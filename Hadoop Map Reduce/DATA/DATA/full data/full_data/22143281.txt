of chestnut ridge  dick boyles business card      trents trust  i  randolph trent stepped from the stockton boat on the san francisco wharf penniless friendless and unknown hunger might have been added to his trials for having paid his last coin in passage money he had been a day and a half without food yet he knew it only by an occasional lapse into weakness as much mental as physical nevertheless he was first on the gangplank to land and hurried feverishly ashore in that vague desire for action and change of scene common to such irritation yet after mixing for a few moments with the departing passengers each selfishly hurrying to some rendezvous of rest or business he insensibly drew apart from them with the instinct of a vagabond and outcast although he was conscious that he was neither but merely an unsuccessful miner suddenly reduced to the point of soliciting work or alms of any kind he took advantage of the first crossing to plunge into a side street with a vague sense of hiding his shame  a rising wind which had rocked the boat for the last few hours had now developed into a strong souwester with torrents of rain which swept the roadway his wellworn working clothes fitted to the warmer southern mines gave him more concern from their visible absurd contrast to the climate than from any actual sense of discomfort and his feverishness defied the chill of his soaking garments as he hurriedly faced the blast through the dimly lighted street at the next corner he paused he had reached another and from its dilapidated appearance apparently an older wharf than that where he had landed but like the first it was still a straggling avenue leading toward the higher and more animated part of the city he again mechanicallyfor a part of his trouble was a vague undefined purposeturned toward it  in his feverish exaltation his powers of perception seemed to be quickened he was vividly alive to the incongruous halfmarine halfbackwoods character of the warehouses and commercial buildings to the hull of a stranded ship already built into a block of rude tenements to the dark stockaded wall of a house framed of corrugated iron and its weird contiguity to a swiss chalet whose galleries were used only to bear the signs of the shops and whose frame had been carried across seas in sections to be set up at random here  moving past these as in a nightmare dream of which even the turbulency of the weather seemed to be a part he stumbled blinded panting and unexpectedly with no consciousness of his rapid pace beyond his breathlessness upon the dazzling main thoroughfare of the city in spite of the weather the slippery pavements were thronged by hurrying crowds of welldressed people again all intent on their own purposespurposes that seemed so trifling and unimportant beside his own the shops were brilliantly lighted exposing their brightest wares through plateglass windows a jewelers glittered with precious stones a fashionable apothecarys next to it almost outrivaled it with its gorgeous globes the gold and green precision of its shelves and the marble and silver soda fountain like a shrine before it all this specious show of opulence came upon him with the shock of contrast and with it a bitter revulsion of feeling more hopeless than his feverish anxietythe bitterness of disappointment  for during his journey he had been buoyed up with the prospect of finding work and sympathy in this youthful citya prospect founded solely on his inexperienced hopes for this he had exchanged the poverty of the mining districta poverty that had nothing ignoble about it that was a part of the economy of nature and shared with his fellow men and the birds and beasts in their rude encampments he had given up the brotherhood of the miner and that practical help and sympathy which brought no degradation with it for this rude shock of selfinterested selfsatisfied civilization he who would not have shrunk from asking rest food or a nights lodging at the cabin of a brother miner or woodsman now recoiled suddenly from these welldressed citizens what madness had sent him here an intruder or even as it seemed to him in his dripping clothes an impostor and yet these were the people to whom he had confidently expected to tell his story and who would cheerfully assist him with work he could almost anticipate the hard laugh or brutal hurried negative in their faces in his foolish heart he thanked god he had not tried it then the apathetic recoil which is apt to follow any keen emotion overtook him he was dazedly conscious of being rudely shoved once or twice and even heard the epithet drunken lout from one who had run against him  he found himself presently staring vacantly in the apothecarys window how long he stood there he could not tell for he was aroused only by the door opening in front of him and a young girl emerging with some purchase in her hand he could see that she was handsomely dressed and quite pretty and as she passed out she lifted to his withdrawing figure a pair of calm inquiring eyes which however changed to a look of halfwondering halfamused pity as she gazed yet that look of pity stung his pride more deeply than all with a deliberate effort he recovered his energy no he would not beg he would not ask assistance from these people he would go backanywhere to the steamboat first they might let him sleep there give him a meal and allow him to work his passage back to stockton he might be refused well what then well beyond there was the bay he laughed bitterlyhis mind was sane enough for thatbut he kept on repeating it vaguely to himself as he crossed the street again and once more made his way to the wharf  the wind and rain had increased but he no longer heeded them in his feverish haste and his consciousness that motion could alone keep away that dreadful apathy which threatened to overcloud his judgment and he wished while he was able to reason logically to make up his mind to end this unsupportable situation that night he was scarcely twenty yet it seemed to him that it had already been demonstrated that his life was a failure he was an orphan and when he left college to seek his own fortune in california he believed he had staked his all upon that ventureand lost  that bitterness which is the sudden recoil of boyish enthusiasm and is none the less terrible for being without experience to justify itthat melancholy we are too apt to look back upon with cynical jeers and laughter in middle ageis more potent than we dare to think and it was in no mere pose of youthful pessimism that randolph trent now contemplated suicide such scraps of philosophy as his education had given him pointed to that one conclusion and it was the only refuge that pridereal or falseoffered him from the one supreme terror of youthshame  the street was deserted and the few lights he had previously noted in warehouses and shops were extinguished it had grown darker with the storm the incongruous buildings on either side had become misshapen shadows the long perspective of the wharf was a strange gloom from which the spars of a ship stood out like the cross he remembered as a boy to have once seen in a picture of the tempestsmitten calvary it was his only fancy connected with the futureit might have been his last for suddenly one of the planks of the rotten wharf gave way beneath his feet and he felt himself violently precipitated toward the gurgling and oozing tide below he threw out his arms desperately caught at a strong girder drew himself up with the energy of desperation and staggered to his feet again safeand sane for with this terrible automatic struggle to avoid that death he was courting came a flash of reason if he had resolutely thrown himself from the pier head as he intended would he have undergone a hopeless revulsion like this was he sure that this might not be after all the terrible penalty of selfdestructionthis inevitable fierce protest of mind and body when too late he was momentarily touched with a sense of gratitude at his escape but his reason told him it was not from his accident but from his intention  he was trying carefully to retrace his steps but as he did so he saw the figure of a man dimly lurching toward him out of the darkness of the wharf and the crossed yards of the ship a gleam of hope came over him for the emotion of the last few minutes had rudely displaced his pride and selflove he would appeal to this stranger whoever he was there was more chance that in this rude locality he would be a belated sailor or some humbler wayfarer and the darkness and solitude made him feel less ashamed by the last flickering street lamp he could see that he was a man about his own size with something of the rolling gait of a sailor which was increased by the weight of a traveling portmanteau he was swinging in his hand as he approached he evidently detected randolphs waiting figure slackened his speed slightly and changed his portmanteau from his right hand to his left as a precaution for defense  randolph felt the blood flush his cheek at this significant proof of his disreputable appearance but determined to accost him he scarcely recognized the sound of his own voice now first breaking the silence for hours but he made his appeal the man listened made a slight gesture forward with his disengaged hand and impelled randolph slowly up to the street lamp until it shone on both their faces randolph saw a man a few years his senior with a slightly trimmed beard on his dark weatherbeaten cheeks wellcut features a quick observant eye and a sailors upward glance and bearing the stranger saw a thin youthful anxious yet refined and handsome face beneath straggling damp curls and dark eyes preternaturally bright with suffering perhaps his experienced ear too detected some harmony with all this in randolphs voice  and you want something to eat a nights lodging and a chance of work afterward the stranger repeated with goodhumored deliberation  yes said randolph  you look it  randolph colored faintly  do you ever drink  yes said randolph wonderingly  i thought id ask said the stranger as it might play hell with you just now if you were not accustomed to it take that just a swallow you knowthats as good as a jugful  he handed him a heavy flask randolph felt the burning liquor scald his throat and fire his empty stomach the stranger turned and looked down the vacant wharf to the darkness from which he came then he turned to randolph again and said abruptly  strong enough to carry this bag  yes said randolph the whiskeypossibly the reliefhad given him new strength besides he might earn his alms  take it up to room 74 niantic hoteltop of next street to this one block that wayand wait till i come  what name shall i say asked randolph  neednt say any i ordered the room a week ago stop theres the key go in change your togs youll find something in that bag thatll fit you wait for me stopno youd better get some grub there first he fumbled in his pockets but fruitlessly no matter youll find a buckskin purse with some scads in it in the bag so long and before randolph could thank him he lurched away again into the semidarkness of the wharf  overflowing with gratitude at a hospitality so like that of his reckless brethren of the mines randolph picked up the portmanteau and started for the hotel he walked warily now with a new interest in life and then suddenly thinking of his own miraculous escape he paused wondering if he ought not to warn his benefactor of the perils of the rotten wharf but he had already disappeared the bag was not heavy but he found that in his exhausted state this new exertion was telling and he was glad when he reached the hotel equally glad was he in his dripping clothes to slip by the porter and with the key in his pocket ascend unnoticed to 74  yet had his experience been larger he might have spared himself that sensitiveness for the hotel was one of those great caravansaries popular with the returning miner it received him and his gold dust in his wornout and bedraggled working clothes and returned him the next day as a welldressed citizen on montgomery street it was hard indeed to recognize the unshaven unwashed and unkempt arrival one met on the principal staircase at night in the scrupulously neat stranger one sat opposite to at breakfast the next morning in this daily whirl of mutation all identity was swamped as randolph learned to know  at present finding himself in a comfortable bedroom his first act was to change his wet clothes which in the warmer temperature and the decline of his feverishness now began to chill him he opened the portmanteau and found a complete suit of clothing evidently a foreign make well preserved as if for shoregoing his pride would have preferred a humbler suit as lessening his obligation but there was no other he discovered the purse a chamois leather bag such as miners and travelers carried which contained a dozen gold pieces and some paper notes taking from it a single coin to defray the expenses of a meal he restrapped the bag and leaving the key in the door lock for the benefit of his returning host made his way to the dining room  for a moment he was embarrassed when the waiter approached him inquisitively but it was only to learn the number of his room to charge the meal he ate it quickly but not voraciously for his appetite had not yet returned and he was eager to get back to the room and see the stranger again and return to him the coin which was no longer necessary  but the stranger had not yet arrived when he reached the room over an hour had elapsed since their strange meeting a new fear came upon him was it possible he had mistaken the hotel and his benefactor was awaiting him elsewhere perhaps even beginning to suspect not only his gratitude but his honesty the thought made him hot again but he was helpless not knowing the strangers name he could not inquire without exposing his situation to the landlord but again there was the key and it was scarcely possible that it fitted another 74 in another hotel he did not dare to leave the room but sat by the window peering through the streaming panes into the stormswept street below gradually the fatigue his excitement had hitherto kept away began to overcome him his eyes once or twice closed during his vigil his head nodded against the pane he rose and walked up and down the room to shake off his drowsiness another hour passednine oclock blown in fitful faroff strokes from some windrocked steeple still no stranger how inviting the bed looked to his weary eyes the man had told him he wanted rest he could lie down on the bed in his clothes until he came he would waken quickly and be ready for his benefactors directions it was a great temptation he yielded to it his head had scarcely sunk upon the pillow before he slipped into a profound and dreamless sleep  he awoke with a start and for a few moments lay vaguely staring at the sunbeams that stretched across his bed before he could recall himself the room was exactly as before the portmanteau strapped and pushed under the table as he had left it there came a tap at the doorthe chambermaid to do up the room she had been there once already but seeing him asleep she had forborne to wake him apparently the spectacle of a gentleman lying on the bed fully dressed even to his boots was not an unusual one at that hotel for she made no comment it was twelve oclock but she would come again later  he was bewildered he had slept the round of the clockthat was natural after his fatiguebut where was his benefactor the lateness of the time forbade the conclusion that he had merely slept elsewhere he would assuredly have returned by this time to claim his portmanteau the portmanteau he unstrapped it and examined the contents again they were undisturbed as he had left them the night before there was a further change of linen the buckskin bag which he could see now contained a couple of bank of england notes with some foreign gold mixed with american halfeagles and a cheap rough memorandum book clasped with elastic containing a letter in a boyish hand addressed dear daddy and signed bobby and a photograph of a boy taken by a foreign photographer at callao as the printed back denoted but nothing giving any clue whatever to the name of the owner  a strange idea seized him did the portmanteau really belong to the man who had given it to him had he been the innocent receiver of stolen goods from some one who wished to escape detection he recalled now that he had heard stories of robbery of luggage by thieves sydney duckson the deserted wharves and remembered toohe could not tell why the thought had escaped him beforethat the man had spoken with an english accent but the next moment he recalled his frank and open manner and his mind cleared of all unworthy suspicion it was more than likely that his benefactor had taken this delicate way of making a free permanent gift for that temporary service yet he smiled faintly at the return of that youthful optimism which had caused him so much suffering  nevertheless something must be done he must try to find the man still more important he must seek work before this dubious loan was further encroached upon he restrapped the portmanteau and replaced it under the table locked the door gave the key to the office clerk saying that any one who called upon him was to await his return and sallied forth a fresh wind and a blue sky of scudding clouds were all that remained of last nights storm as he made his way to the fateful wharf still deserted except by an occasional wharfratas the longshore vagrant or petty thief was calledhe wondered at his own temerity of last night and the trustfulness of his friend in yielding up his portmanteau to a stranger in such a place a low drinking saloon feebly disguised as a junk shop stood at the corner with slimy green steps leading to the water  the wharf was slowly decaying and here and there were occasional gaps in the planking as dangerous as the one from which he had escaped the night before he thought again of the warning he might have given to the stranger but he reflected that as a seafaring man he must have been familiar with the locality where he had landed but had he landed there to randolphs astonishment there was no sign or trace of any late occupation of the wharf and the ship whose crossyards he had seen dimly through the darkness the night before was no longer there she might have warped out in the early morning but there was no trace of her in the stream or offing beyond a bark and brig quite dismantled at an adjacent wharf seemed to accent the loneliness beyond the open channel between him and verba buena island was racing with whitemaned seas and sparkling in the shifting sunbeams the scudding clouds above him drove down the steelblue sky the lateen sails of the italian fishing boats were like shreds of cloud too blown over the blue and distant bay his ears sang his eyes blinked his pulses throbbed with the untiring fierce activity of a san francisco day  with something of its restlessness he hurried back to the hotel still the stranger was not there and no one had called for him the room had been put in order the portmanteau that sole connecting link with his last nights experience was under the table he drew it out again and again subjected it to a minute examination a few toilet articles not of the best quality which he had overlooked at first the linen the buckskin purse the memorandum book and the suit of clothes he stood in still comprised all he knew of his benefactor he counted the money in the purse it amounted with the bank of england notes to about seventy dollars as he could roughly guess there was a scrap of paper the tornoff margin of a newspaper lying in the purse with an address hastily scribbled in pencil it gave however no name only a number 85 california street it might be a clue he put it with the purse carefully in his pocket and after hurriedly partaking of his forgotten breakfast again started out  he presently found himself in the main thoroughfare of last night which he now knew to be montgomery street it was more thronged than then but he failed to be impressed as then with the selfish activity of the crowd yet he was half conscious that his own brighter fortune more decent attire and satisfied hunger had something to do with this change and he glanced hurriedly at the druggists broad plateglass windows with a faint hope that the young girl whose amused pity he had awakened might be there again he found california street quickly and in a few moments he stood before no 85 he was a little disturbed to find it a rather large building and that it bore the inscription bank then came the usual shock to his mercurial temperament and for the first time he began to consider the absurd hopelessness of his clue  he however entered desperately and approaching the window of the receiving teller put the question he had formulated in his mind could they give him any information concerning a customer or correspondent who had just arrived in san francisco and was putting up at the niantic hotel room 74 he felt his face flushing but to his astonishment the clerk manifested no surprise and you dont know his name said the clerk quietly wait a moment he moved away and randolph saw him speaking to one of the other clerks who consulted a large register in a few minutes he returned we dont have many customers he began politely who leave only their hotelroom addresses when he was interrupted by a mumbling protest from one of the other clerks thats very different he replied to his fellow clerk and then turned to randolph im afraid we cannot help you but ill make other inquiries if youll come back in ten minutes satisfied to be relieved from the present perils of his questioning and doubtful of returning randolph turned away but as he left the building he saw a written notice on the swinging door wanted a night porter and this one chance of employment determined his return  when he again presented himself at the window the clerk motioned him to step inside through a lifted rail here he found himself confronted by the clerk and another man distinguished by a certain air of authority a keen gray eye and singularly compressed lips set in a closely clipped beard the clerk indicated him deferentially but brieflyeverybody was astonishingly brief and businesslike thereas the president the president absorbed and possessed randolph with eyes that never seemed to leave him then leaning back against the counter which he lightly grasped with both hands he said weve sent to the niantic hotel to inquire about your man he ordered his room by letter giving no name he arrived there on time last night slept there and has occupied the room no 74 ever since we dont know him from adam buthis eyes never left randolphsfrom the description the landlord gave our clerk youre the man himself  for an instant randolph flushed crimson the natural mistake of the landlord flashed upon him his own stupidity in seeking this information the suspicious predicament in which he was now placed and the necessity of telling the whole truth but the presidents eye was at once a threat and an invitation he felt himself becoming suddenly cool and with a business brevity equal to their own said  i was looking for work last night on the wharf he employed me to carry his bag to the hotel saying i was to wait for him i have waited since nine oclock last night in his room and he has not come  what are you in such a dd hurry for hes trusted you cant you trust him youve got his bag returned the president  randolph was silent for a moment i want to know what to do with it he said  hang on to it whats in it  some clothes and a purse containing about seventy dollars  that ought to pay you for carrying it and storage afterward said the president decisively what made you come here  i found this address in the purse said randolph producing it  is that all  yes  and thats the only reason you came here to find an owner for that bag  yes  the president disengaged himself from the counter  im sorry to have given you so much trouble said randolph concludingly thank you and goodmorning  goodmorning  as randolph turned away he remembered the advertisement for the night watchman he hesitated and turned back he was a little surprised to find that the president had not gone away but was looking after him  i beg your pardon but i see you want a night watchman could i do said randolph resolutely  no youre a stranger here and we want some one who knows the citydewslake he returned to the receiving teller whos taken larkins place  no one yet returned the teller but he added parenthetically judge boompointer you know was speaking to you about his son  yes i know that to randolph go round to my private room and wait for me i wont be as long as your friend last night then he added to a negro porter show him round there  he moved away stopping at one or two desks to give an order to the clerks and once before the railing to speak to a depositor randolph followed the negro into the hall through a board room and into a handsomely furnished office he had not to wait long in a few moments the president appeared with an older man whose gray side whiskers cut with a certain precision and whose black and white checked neckerchief tied in a formal bow proclaimed the english respectability of the period at the presidents dictation he took down randolphs name nativity length of residence and occupation in california this concluded the president glancing at his companion said briefly  well  he had better come tomorrow morning at nine was the answer  and ask for mr dingwall the deputy manager added the president with a gesture that was at once an introduction and a dismissal to both  randolph had heard before of this startling brevity of san francisco business detail yet he lingered until the door closed on mr dingwall his heart was honestly full  you have been very kind sir he stammered  i havent run half the risks of that chap last night said the president grimly the least tremor of a smile on his set mouth  if you would only let me know what i can do to thank you persisted randolph  trust the man that trusts you and hang on to your trust returned the president curtly with a parting nod  elated and filled with high hopes as randolph was he felt some trepidation in returning to his hotel he had to face his landlord with some explanation of the banks inquiry the landlord might consider him an impostor and request him to leave or more dreadful still insist upon keeping the bag he thought of the parting words of the president and resolved upon hanging on to his trust whatever happened but he was agreeably surprised to find that he was received at the office with a certain respect not usually shown to the casual visitor your caller turned up todayrandolph startedfrom the eureka bank continued the clerk sorry we could not give your name but you know you only left a deposit in your letter and sent a messenger for your key yesterday afternoon when you came you went straight to your room perhaps you would like to register now randolph no longer hesitated reflecting that he could explain it all later to his unknown benefactor and wrote his name boldly but he was still more astonished when the clerk continued i reckon it was a case of identifying you for a draftit often happens hereand wed have been glad to do it for you but the bank clerk seemed satisfied with out description of youyoure easily described you know this in a parenthesis complimentarily intendedso its all right we can give you a better room lower down if youre going to stay longer not knowing whether to laugh or to be embarrassed at this extraordinary conclusion of the blunder randolph answered that he had just come from the bank adding with a pardonable touch of youthful pride that he was entering the banks employment the next day  another equally agreeable surprise met him on his arrival there the next morning without any previous examination or trial he was installed at once as a corresponding clerk in the place of one just promoted to a subagency in the interior his handwriting his facility of composition had all been taken for granted or perhaps predicated upon something the president had discerned in that one quick absorbing glance he ventured to express the thought to his neighbor  the boss said that gentleman can size a man in and out and all through in about the time it would take you and me to tell the color of his hair he dont make mistakes you bet but old dingythe depyou settled with your clothes  my clothes echoed randolph with a faint flush  yes english cutthat fetched him  and so his work began his liberal salary which seemed to him munificent in comparison with his previous earnings in the mines enabled him to keep the contents of the buckskin purse intact and presently to return the borrowed suit of clothes to the portmanteau the mysterious owner should find everything as when he first placed it in his hands with the quick mobility of youth and his own rather mercurial nature he had begun to forget or perhaps to be a little ashamed of his keen emotions and sufferings the night of his arrival until that night was recalled to him in a singular way  one sunday a vague sense of duty to his still missing benefactor impelled him to spend part of his holiday upon the wharves he had rambled away among the shipping at the newer pier slips and had gazed curiously upon decks where a few seamen or officers in their sunday apparel smoked paced or idled trying vainly to recognize the face and figure which had once briefly flashed out under the flickering wharf lamp was the stranger a shipmaster who had suddenly transferred himself to another vessel on another voyage a crowd which had gathered around some landing steps nearer shore presently attracted his attention he lounged toward it and looked over the shoulders of the bystanders down upon the steps a boat was lying there which had just towed in the body of a man found floating on the water its features were already swollen and defaced like a hideous mask its body distended beyond all proportion even to the bursting of its sodden clothing a tremulous fascination came over randolph as he gazed the bystanders made their brief comments a few authoritatively and with the air of nautical experts  been in the water about a week i reckon  bout that time just rucked up and floated with the tide  not much chance o spottin him by his looks eh  nor anything else you bet reglarly cleaned out look at his pockets  wharfrats or shanghai men  betwixt and between i reckon man who found him says hes got an ugly cut just back of his head ye cant see it for his floating hair  wonder if he got it before or after he got in the water  thats for the coroner to say  much he knows or cares said another cynically itll just be a case of found drowned and the regular twentyfive dollars to him and five to the man who found the body thats enough for him to know  thrilled with a vague anxiety randolph edged forward for a nearer view of the wretched derelict still gently undulating on the towline the closer he looked the more he was impressed by the idea of some frightful mask that hid a face that refused to be recognized but his attention became fixed on a man who was giving some advice or orders and examining the body scrutinizingly without knowing why randolph felt a sudden aversion to him which was deepened when the man lifting his head met randolphs eyes with a pair of shifting yet aggressive ones he bore nevertheless an odd weird likeness to the missing man randolph was seeking which strangely troubled him as the strangers eyes followed him and lingered with a singular curiosity on randolphs dress he remembered with a sudden alarm that he was wearing the suit of the missing man a quick impulse to conceal himself came upon him but he as quickly conquered it and returned the mans cold stare with an anger he could not account for but which made the stranger avert his eyes then the man got into the boat beside the boatman and the two again towed away the corpse the head rose and fell with the swell as if nodding a farewell but it was still defiant under its shapeless mask that even wore a smile as if triumphant in its hideous secret   ii   the opinion of the cynical bystander on the wharf proved to be a correct one the coroners jury brought in the usual verdict of found drowned which was followed by the usual newspaper comment upon the insecurity of the wharves and the inadequate protection of the police  randolph trent read it with conflicting emotions the possibility he had conceived of the corpse being that of his benefactor was dismissed when he had seen its face although he was sometimes tortured with doubt and a wonder if he might not have learned more by attending the inquest and there was still the suggestion that the mysterious disappearance might have been accomplished by violence like this he was satisfied that if he had attempted publicly to identify the corpse as his missing friend he would have laid himself open to suspicion with a story he could hardly corroborate  he had once thought of confiding his doubts to mr revelstoke the bank president but he had a dread of that gentlemans curt conclusions and remembered his injunction to hang on to his trust since his installation mr revelstoke had merely acknowledged his presence by a goodhumored nod now and then although randolph had an instinctive feeling that he was perfectly informed as to his progress it was wiser for randolph to confine himself strictly to his duty and keep his own counsel  yet he was young and it was not strange that in his idle moments his thoughts sometimes reverted to the pretty girl he had seen on the night of his arrival nor that he should wish to parade his better fortune before her curious eyes neither was it strange that in this city whose daylong sunshine brought every one into the public streets he should presently have that opportunity it chanced that one afternoon being in the residential quarter he noticed a welldressed young girl walking before him in company with a delicate looking boy of seven or eight years something in the carriage of her graceful figure something in a certain consciousness and ostentation of coquetry toward her youthful escort attracted his attention yet it struck him that she was neither related to the child nor accustomed to childrens ways and that she somewhat unduly emphasized this to the passersby particularly those of his own sex who seemed to be greatly attracted by her evident beauty presently she ascended the steps of a handsome dwelling evidently their home and as she turned he saw her face it was the girl he remembered as her eye caught his he blushed with the consciousness of their former meeting yet in the very embarrassment of the moment he lifted his hat in recognition but the salutation was met only by a cold critical stare randolph bit his lip and passed on his reason told him she was right his instinct told him she was unfair the contradiction fascinated him  yet he was destined to see her again a month later while seated at his desk which overlooked the tellers counter he was startled to see her enter the bank and approach the counter she was already withdrawing a glove from her little hand ready to affix her signature to the receipted form to be proffered by the teller as she received the gold in exchange he could see by the increased politeness of that official his evident desire to prolong the transaction and the sidelong glances of his fellow clerks that she was apparently no stranger but a recognized object of admiration although her face was slightly flushed at the moment randolph observed that she wore a certain proud reserve which he half hoped was intended as a check to these attentions her eyes were fixed upon the counter and this gave him a brief opportunity to study her delicate beauty for in a few moments she was gone whether she had in her turn observed him he could not say presently he rose and sauntered with what he believed was a careless air toward the paying tellers counter and the receipt which being the last was plainly exposed on the file of that days taking he was startled by a titter of laughter from the clerks and by the teller ironically lifting the file and placing it before him  thats her name sonny but i didnt think that youd tumble to it quite as quick as the others every new man manages to saunter round here to get a sight of that receipt and ive seen hoary old depositors outside edge around inside pretendin they wanted to see the dep jest to feast their eyes on that girls name take a good look at it and paste a copy in your hat for thats all youll know of her you bet perhaps you think shes put her address and her at home days on the receipt look hard and maybe youll see em  the instinct of youthful retaliation to say he knew her address already stirred randolph but he shut his lips in time and moved away his desk neighbor informed him that the young lady came there once a month and drew a hundred dollars from some deposit to her credit but that was all they knew her name was caroline avondale yet there was no one of that name in the san francisco directory  but randolphs romantic curiosity would not allow the incident to rest there a favorable impression he had produced on mr dingwall enabled him to learn more and precipitated what seemed to him a singular discovery you will find said the deputy manager the statement of the first deposit to miss avondales credit in letters in your own department the account was opened two years ago through a south american banker but i am afraid it will not satisfy your curiosity nevertheless randolph remained after office hours and spent some time in examining the correspondence of two years ago he was rewarded at last by a bankers letter from callao advising the remittance of one thousand dollars to the credit of miss avondale of san francisco the letter was written in spanish of which randolph had a fair knowledge but it was made plainer by a space having been left in the formal letter for the english name which was written in another hand together with a copy of miss avondales signature for identificationthe usual proceeding in those early days when personal identification was difficult to travelers emigrants and visitors in a land of strangers  but here he was struck by a singular resemblance which he at first put down to mere coincidence of names the childs photograph which he had found in the portmanteau was taken at callao that was a mere coincidence but it suggested to his mind a more singular onethat the handwriting of the address was in some odd fashion familiar to him that night when he went home he opened the portmanteau and took from the purse the scrap of paper with the written address of the bank and on comparing it with the bankers letter the next day he was startled to find that the handwriting of the banks address and that in which the girls name was introduced in the bankers letter were apparently the same the letters in the words caroline and california appeared as if formed by the same hand how this might have struck a chirographical expert he did not know he could not consult the paying teller who was supposed to be familiar with signatures without exposing his secret and himself to ridicule and after all what did it prove nothing even if this girl were cognizant of the man who supplied her address to the callao banker two years ago and he was really the missing owner of the portmanteau would she know where he was now it might make an opening for conversation if he ever met her familiarly but nothing more yet i am afraid another idea occasionally took possession of randolphs romantic fancy it was pleasant to think that the patron of his own fortunes might be in some mysterious way the custodian of hers the money was placed to her credita liberal sum for a girl so young the large house in which she lived was sufficient to prove to the optimistic randolph that this income was something personal and distinct from her family that his unknown benefactor was in the habit of mysteriously rewarding deserving merit after the fashion of a marine fairy godmother i fear did not strike him as being ridiculous  but an unfortunate query in that direction addressed to a cynical fellow clerk who had the exhaustive experience with the immature mustaches of twentythree elicited a reply which shocked him to his indignant protest the young man continued  look here a girl like that who draws money regularly from some man who doesnt show up by name who comes for it herself and hasnt any address and calls herself avondaleonly an innocent from dutch flat like you would swallow  impossible said randolph indignantly anybody could see shes a lady by her dress and bearing  dress and bearing echoed the clerk with the derision of blase youth if thats your test you ought to see florry   but here one may safely leave the young gentleman as abruptly as randolph did yet a drop of this corrosive criticism irritated his sensitiveness and it was not until he recalled his last meeting with her and her innocent escort that he was himself again fortunately he did not relate it to the critic who would in all probability have added a precocious motherhood to the young ladys possible qualities  he could now only look forward to her reappearance at the bank and here he was destined to a more serious disappointment for when she made her customary appearance at the counter he noticed a certain businesslike gravity in the paying tellers reception of her and that he was consulting a small register before him instead of handing her the usual receipt form perhaps you are unaware miss avondale that your account is overdrawn randolph distinctly heard him say although in a politely lowered voice  the young girl stopped in taking off her glove her delicate face expressed her wonder and paled slightly she cast a quick and apparently involuntary glance in the direction of randolph but said quietly  i dont think i understand  i thought you did notladies so seldom do continued the paying teller suavely but there are no funds to your credit has not your banker or correspondent advised you  the girl evidently did not comprehend i have no correspondent or banker she said i meani have heard nothing  the original credit was opened from callao continued the official but since then it has been added to by drafts from melbourne there may be one nearly due now  the young girl seemed scarcely to comprehend yet her face remained pale and thoughtful it was not until the paying teller resumed with suggestive politeness that she roused herself if you would like to see the president he might oblige you until you hear from your friends of course my duty is simply to  i dont think i require you to exceed it returned the young girl quietly or that i wish to see the president her delicate little face was quite set with resolution and a mature dignity albeit it was still pale as she drew away from the counter  if you would leave your address continued the official with persistent politeness we could advise you of any later deposit to your credit  it is hardly necessary returned the young lady i should learn it myself and call again thank you goodmorning and settling her veil over her face she quietly passed out  the pain and indignation with which randolph overheard this colloquy he could with the greatest difficulty conceal for one wild moment he had thought of calling her back while he made a personal appeal to revelstoke but the conviction borne in upon him by her resolute bearing that she would refuse it and he would only lay himself open to another rebuff held him to his seat yet he could not entirely repress his youthful indignation  where i come from he said in an audible voice to his neighbor a young lady like that would have been spared this public disappointment a dozen men would have made up that sum and let her go without knowing anything about her account being overdrawn and he really believed it  nice comfable way of doing banking business in dutch flat returned the cynic and i suppose youd have kept it up every month rather a tall price to pay for looking at a pretty girl once a month but i suppose theyre scarcer up there than here all the same it aint too late now start up your subscription right here sonny and well all ante up  but randolph who seldom followed his heroics to their ultimate prosaic conclusions regretted he had spoken although still unconvinced happily for his temper he did not hear the comment of the two tellers  wont see her again old boy said one  i reckon not returned the other now that shes been chucked by her fancy manuntil she gets another but cheer up a girl like that wont want friends long  it is not probable that either of these young gentlemen believed what they said or would have been personally disrespectful or uncivil to any woman they were fairly decent young fellows but the rigors of business demanded this appearance of worldly wisdom between themselves meantime for a week after randolph indulged in wild fancies of taking his benefactors capital of seventy dollars adding thirty to it from his own hardearned savings buying a draft with it from the bank for one hundred dollars and in some mysterious way getting it to miss avondale as the delayed remittance  the brief wet winter was nearly spent the long dry season was due although there was still the rare beauty of cloud scenery in the steelblue sky and the sudden return of quick but transient showers it was on a sunday of weather like this that the natureloving randolph extended his usual holiday excursion as far as contra costa by the steamer after his dutiful round of the wharves and shipping it was with a gayety born equally of his youth and the weather that he overcame his constitutional shyness and not only mingled without restraint among the pleasureseekers that thronged the crowded boat but in the consciousness of his good looks and a new suit of clothes even penetrated into the aristocratic seclusion of the ladies cabinsacred to the fair sex and their attendant swains or chaperones  but he found every seat occupied and was turning away when he suddenly recognized miss avondale sitting beside her little escort she appeared however in a somewhat constrained attitude sustaining with one hand the boy who had clambered on the seat he was looking out of the cabin window which she was also trying to do with greater difficulty on account of her position he could see her profile presented with such marked persistency that he was satisfied she had seen him and was avoiding him he turned and left the cabin  yet once on the deck again he repented his haste perhaps she had not actually recognized him perhaps she wished to avoid him only because she was in plainer clothesa circumstance that with his knowledge of her changed fortunes struck him to the heart it seemed to him that even as a humble employee of the bank he was in some way responsible for it and wondered if she associated him with her humiliation he longed to speak with her and assure her of his sympathy and yet he was equally conscious that she would reject it  when the boat reached the alameda wharf she slipped away with the other passengers he wandered about the hotel garden and the main street in the hope of meeting her again although he was instinctively conscious that she would not follow the lines of the usual sunday sightseers but had her own destination he penetrated the depths of the alameda and lost himself among its low trailing oaks to no purpose the hope of the morning had died within him the fire of adventure was quenched and when the clouds gathered with a rising wind he felt that the promise of that day was gone he turned to go back to the ferry but on consulting his watch he found that he had already lost so much time in his devious wanderings that he must run to catch the last boat the few drops that spattered through the trees presently increased to a shower he put up his umbrella without lessening his speed and finally dashed into the main street as the last bell was ringing but at the same moment a slight graceful figure slipped out of the woods just ahead of him with no other protection from the pelting storm than a handkerchief tied over her hat and ran as swiftly toward the wharf it needed only one glance for randolph to recognize miss avondale the moment had come the opportunity was here and the next instant he was panting at her side with the umbrella over her head  the girl lifted her head quickly gave a swift look of recognition a brief smile of gratitude and continued her pace she had not taken his arm but had grasped the handle of the umbrella which linked them together not a word was spoken two people cannot be conversational or sentimental flying at the top of their speed beneath a single umbrella with a crowd of impatient passengers watching and waiting for them and i grieve to say that being a happy american crowd there was some irreverent humor go it sis hes gainin on you keep it up steady sonny dont prance no fancy licks you were nearly over the traces that time keep up to the pole i e the umbrella dont crowd her off the track just swing on together youll do it  randolph had glanced quickly at his companion she was laughing yet looking at him shyly as if wondering how he was taking it the paddle wheels were beginning to revolve another rush and they were on board as the plank was drawn in  but they were only on the edge of a packed and seething crowd randolph managed however to force a way for her to an angle of the paddle box where they were comparatively alone although still exposed to the rain she recognized their enforced companionship by dropping her grasp of the umbrella which she had hitherto been holding over him with a singular kind of mature superiority very likeas randolph felther manner to the boy  you have left your little friend he said grasping at the idea for a conversational opening  my little cousin yes she said i left him with friends i could not bear to make him run any risk in this weather but she hesitated half apologetically half mischievously perhaps i hurried you  oh no said randolph quickly this is the last boat and i must be at the bank tomorrow morning at nine  and i must be at the shop at eight she said she did not speak bitterly or pointedly nor yet with the entire familiarity of custom he noticed that her dress was indeed plainer and yet she seemed quite concerned over the watersoaked state of that cheap thin silk pelerine and merino skirt a big lump was in his throat  do you know he said desperately yet trying to laugh that this is not the first time you have seen me dripping  yes she returned looking at him interestedly it was outside of the druggists in montgomery street about four months ago you were wetter then even than you are now  i was hungry friendless and penniless miss avondale he had spoken thus abruptly in the faint hope that the revelation might equalize their present condition but somehow his confession now that it was uttered seemed exceedingly weak and impotent then he blundered in a different direction your eyes were the only kind ones i had seen since i landed he flushed a little feeling himself on insecure ground and ended desperately why when i left you i thought of committing suicide  oh dear not so bad as that i hope she said quickly smiling kindly yet with a certain air of mature toleration as if she were addressing her little cousin you only fancied it and it isnt very complimentary to my eyes if their kindness drove you to such horrid thoughts and then what happened she pursued smilingly  i had a job to carry a mans bag and it got me a nights lodging and a meal said randolph almost brusquely feeling the utter collapse of his story  and then she said encouragingly  i got a situation at the bank  when  the next day faltered randolph expecting to hear her laugh but miss avondale heaved the faintest sigh  you are very lucky she said  not so very returned randolph quickly for the next time you saw me you cut me dead  i believe i did she said smilingly  would you mind telling me why  are you sure you wont be angry  i may be pained said randolph prudently  i apologize for that beforehand well that first night i saw a young man looking very anxious very uncomfortable and very weak the second timeand not very long afteri saw him well dressed lounging like any other young man on a sunday afternoon and i believed that he took the liberty of bowing to me then because i had once looked at him under a misapprehension  oh miss avondale  then i took a more charitable view and came to the conclusion that the first night he had been drinking but she added with a faint smile at randolphs lugubrious face i apologize and you have had your revenge for if i cut you on account of your smart clothes you have tried to do me a kindness on account of my plain ones  oh miss avondale burst out randolph if you only knew how sorry and indignant i was at the bankwhenyou knowthe other dayhe stammered i wanted to go with you to mr revelstoke you know who had been so generous to me and i know he would have been proud to befriend you until you heard from your friends  and i am very glad you did nothing so foolish said the young lady seriously orwith a smilei should have been still more aggravating to you when we met the bank was quite right nor have i any pathetic story like yours some years ago my little halfcousin whom you saw lost his mother and was put in my charge by his father with a certain sum to my credit to be expended for myself and the child i lived with an uncle with whom for some family reasons the childs father was not on good terms and this money and the charge of the child were therefore intrusted entirely to me perhaps also because bobby and i were fond of each other and i was a friend of his mother the father was a shipmaster always away on long voyages and has been home but once in the three years i have had charge of his son i have not heard from him since he is a goodhearted man but of a restless roving disposition with no domestic tastes why he should suddenly cease to provide for my little cousinif he has done soor if his omission means only some temporary disaster to himself or his fortunes i do not know my anxiety was more for the poor boys sake than for myself for as long as i live i can provide for him she said this without the least display of emotion and with the same mature air of also repressing any emotion on the part of randolph but for her size and girlish figure but for the dripping tangles of her hair and her soft eyes he would have believed he was talking to a hard middleaged matron  then youhehas no friends here asked randolph  no we are all from callao where bobby was born my uncle was a merchant there who came here lately to establish an agency we lived with him in sutter streetwhere you remember i was so hateful to you she interpolated with a mischievous smileuntil his enterprise failed and he was obliged to return but i stayed here with bobby that he might be educated in his fathers own tongue it was unfortunate perhaps she said with a little knitting of her pretty brows that the remittances ceased and uncle left about the same time but like you i was lucky and i managed to get a place in the emporium  the emporium repeated randolph in surprise it was a popular magasin of fashion in montgomery street to connect this refined girl with its garish display and vulgar attendants seemed impossible  the emporium reiterated miss avondale simply you see we used to dress a good deal in callao and had the paris fashions and that experience was of great service to me i am now at the head of what they call the mantle department if you please and am looked up to as an authority she made him a mischievous bow which had the effect of causing a trickle from the umbrella to fall across his budding mustache and another down her own straight little nosea diversion that made them laugh together although randolph secretly felt that the young girls quiet heroism was making his own trials appear ridiculous but her allusion to callao and the boys name had again excited his fancy and revived his romantic dream of their common benefactor as soon as they could get a more perfect shelter and furl the umbrella he plunged into the full story of the mysterious portmanteau and its missing owner with the strange discovery that he had made of the similarity of the two handwritings the young lady listened intently eagerly checking herself with what might have been a half smile at his enthusiasm  i remember the bankers letter certainly she said and captain dorntonthat was the name of bobbys fatherasked me to sign my name in the body of it where he had also written it with my address but the likeness of the handwriting to your slip of paper may be only a fancied one have you shown it to any one she said quicklyi mean she corrected herself as quickly any one who is an expert  not the two together said randolph explaining how he had shown the paper to mr revelstoke  but miss avondale had recovered herself and laughed that that bit of paper should have been the means of getting you a situation seems to me the more wonderful occurrence of course it is quite a coincidence that there should be a childs photograph and a letter signed bobby in the portmanteau butshe stopped suddenly and fixed her dark eyes on hisyou have seen bobby surely you can say if it was his likeness  randolph was embarrassed the fact was he had always been so absorbed in her that he had hardly glanced at the child he ventured to say this and added a little awkwardly and coloring that he had seen bobby only twice  and you still have this remarkable photograph and letter she said perhaps a little too carelessly  yes would you like to see them  very much she returned quickly and then added with a laugh you are making me quite curious  if you would allow me to see you home said randolph we have to pass the street where my room is and he added timidly i could show them to you  certainly she replied with sublime unconsciousness of the cause of his hesitation that will be very nice  randolph was happy albeit he could not help thinking that she was treating him like the absent bobby  its only on commercial street just above montgomery he went on we go straight up from the wharfhe stopped short here for the bulk of a bystander a roughly clad miner was pressing him so closely that he was obliged to resist indignantlypartly from discomfort and partly from a sense that the man was overhearing him the stranger muttered a kind of apology and moved away  he seems to be perpetually in your way said miss avondale smiling he was right behind you and you nearly trod on his toes when you bolted out of the cabin this morning  ah then you did see me said randolph forgetting all else in his delight at the admission  but miss avondale was not disconcerted thanks to your collision i saw you both  it was still raining when they disembarked at the wharf a little behind the other passengers who had crowded on the bow of the steamboat it was only a block or two beyond the place where randolph had landed that eventful night he had to pass it now but with miss avondale clinging to his arm with what different feelings the rain still fell the day was fading but he walked in an enchanted dream of which the prosaic umbrella was the mystic tent and magic pavilion he must needs even stop at the corner of the wharf and show her the exact spot where his unknown benefactor appeared  coming out of the shadow like that man there she added brightly pointing to a figure just emerging from the obscurity of an overhanging warehouse why its your friend the miner  randolph looked it was indeed the same man who had probably reached the wharf by a cross street  let us go on do said miss avondale suddenly tightening her hold of randolphs arm in some instinctive feminine alarm i dont like this place  but randolph with the young girls arm clinging to his felt supremely daring indeed i fear he was somewhat disappointed when the stranger peacefully turned into the junk shop at the corner and left them to pursue their way  they at last stopped before some business offices on a central thoroughfare where randolph had a room on the third story when they had climbed the flight of stairs he unlocked a door and disclosed a goodsized apartment which had been intended for an office but which was now neatly furnished as a study and bedroom miss avondale smiled at the singular combination  i should fancy she said you would never feel as if you had quite left the bank behind you yet with her air of protection and mature experience she at once began to move one or two articles of furniture into a more tasteful position while randolph nevertheless a little embarrassed at his audacity in asking this goddess into his humble abode hurriedly unlocked a closet brought out the portmanteau and handed her the letter and photograph  womanlike miss avondale looked at the picture first if she experienced any surprise she repressed it it is like bobby she said meditatively but he was stouter then and hes changed sadly since he has been in this climate i dont wonder you didnt recognize him his father may have had it taken some day when they were alone together i didnt know of it though i know the photographer she then looked at the letter knit her pretty brows and with an abstracted air sat down on the edge of randolphs bed crossed her little feet and looked puzzled but he was unable to detect the least emotion  you see she said the handwriting of most children who are learning to write is very much alike for this is the stage of development when they print and their composition is the same they talk only of things that interest all childrenpets toys and their games this is only any childs letter to any father i couldnt really say it was bobbys as to the photograph they have an odd way in south america of selling photographs of anybody principally of pretty women by the packet to any one who wants them so that it does not follow that the owner of this photograph had any personal interest in it now as to your mysterious patron himself can you describe him she looked at randolph with a certain feline intensity  he became embarrassed you know i only saw him once under a street lamphe began  and i have only seen captain dorntonif it were hetwice in three years she said but go on  again randolph was unpleasantly impressed with her cold dryly practical manner he had never seen his benefactor but once but he could not speak of him in that way  i think he went on hesitatingly that he had dark pleasant eyes a thick beard and the look of a sailor  and there were no other papers in the portmanteau she said with the same intense look  none  these are mere coincidences said miss avondale after a pause and after all they are not as strange as the alternative for we would have to believe that captain dornton arrived herewhere he knew his son and i were livingwithout a word of warning came ashore for the purpose of going to a hotel and the bank also and then unaccountably changed his mind and disappeared  the thought of the rotten wharf his own escape and the dead body were all in randolphs mind but his reasoning was already staggered by the girls conclusions and he felt that it might only pain without convincing her and was he convinced himself she smiled at his blank face and rose thank you all the same and now i must go  randolph rose also would you like to take the photograph and letter to show your cousin  yes but i should not place much reliance on his memory nevertheless she took up the photograph and letter and randolph putting the portmanteau back in the closet locked it and stood ready to accompany her  on their way to her house they talked of other things randolph learned something of her life in callao that she was an orphan like himself and had been brought from the eastern states when a child to live with a rich uncle in callao who was childless that her aunt had died and her uncle had married again that the second wife had been at variance with his family and that it was consequently some relief to miss avondale to be independent as the guardian of bobby whose mother was a sister of the first wife that her uncle had objected as strongly as a brotherinlaw could to his wifes sisters marriage with captain dornton on account of his roving life and unsettled habits and that consequently there would be little sympathy for her or for bobby in his mysterious disappearance the wind blew and the rain fell upon these confidences yet randolph walking again under that umbrella of felicity parted with her at her own doorstep all too soon although consoled with the permission to come and see her when the child returned  he went back to his room a very hopeful foolish but happy youth as he entered he seemed to feel the charm of her presence again in the humble apartment she had sanctified the furniture she had moved with her own little hands the bed on which she had sat for a half moment was glorified to his youthful fancy and even that magic portmanteau which had brought him all this happiness that toobut he gave a sudden start the closet door which he had shut as he went out was unlocked and open the portmanteauhis trustgone   iii   randolph trents consternation at the loss of the portmanteau was partly superstitious for although it was easy to make up the small sum taken and the papers were safe in miss avondales possession yet this displacement of the only link between him and his missing benefactor and the mystery of its disappearance raised all his old doubts and suspicions a vague uneasiness a still more vague sense of some remissness on his own part possessed him  that the portmanteau was taken from his room during his absence with miss avondale that afternoon was evident the door had been opened by a skeleton key and as the building was deserted on sunday there had been no chance of interference with the thief if mere booty had been his object the purse would have satisfied him without his burdening himself with a portmanteau which might be identified nothing else in the room had been disturbed the thief must have had some cognizance of its location and have kept some espionage over randolphs movementsa circumstance which added to the mystery and his disquiet he placed a description of his loss with the police authorities but their only idea of recovering it was by leaving that description with pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers a proceeding that randolph instinctively felt was in vain  a singular but instinctive reluctance to inform miss avondale of his loss kept him from calling upon her for the first few days when he did she seemed concerned at the news although far from participating in his superstition or his suspicions  you still have the letter and photographwhatever they may be worthfor identification she said dryly although bobby cannot remember about the letter he thinks he went once with his father to a photographer and had a picture taken but he cannot remember seeing it afterward she was holding them in her hand and randolph almost mechanically took them from her and put them in his pocket he would not perhaps have noticed his own brusqueness had she not looked a little surprised and he thought annoyed are you quite sure you wont lose them she said gently perhaps i had better keep them for you  i shall seal them up and put them in the bank safe he said quickly he could not tell whether his sudden resolution was an instinct or the obstinacy that often comes to an awkward man but he added coloring i shall always regret the loss of the portmanteau for it was the means of bringing us together  i thought it was the umbrella said miss avondale dryly  she had once before halted him on the perilous edge of sentiment by a similar cynicism but this time it cut him deeply for he could not be blind to the fact that she treated him like a mere boy and in dispelling the illusions of his instincts and beliefs seemed as if intent upon dispelling his illusions of her and in her halfsmiling abstraction he read only the wellbred toleration of one who is beginning to be bored he made his excuses early and went home nevertheless although regretting he had not left her the letter and photograph he deposited them in the bank safe the next day and tried to feel that he had vindicated his character for grownup wisdom  then in his conflicting emotions he punished himself after the fashion of youth by avoiding the beloved ones presence for several days he did this in the belief that it would enable him to make up his mind whether to reveal his real feelings to her and perhaps there was the more alluring hope that his absence might provoke some manifestations of sentiment on her part but she made no sign and then came a reaction in his feelings with a heightened sense of loyalty to his benefactor for freed of any illusion or youthful fancy now a purely unselfish gratitude to the unknown man filled his heart in the lapse of his sentiment he clung the more closely to this one honest romance of his life  one afternoon at the close of business he was a little astonished to receive a message from mr dingwall the deputy manager that he wished to see him in his private office he was still more astonished when mr dingwall after offering him a chair stood up with his hands under his coat tails before the fireplace and with a hesitancy half reserved half courteous but wholly english said  ierwould be glad mr trent if you wouldergive me the pleasure of your company at dinner tomorrow  randolph still amazed stammered his acceptance  there will beera young lady in whom you wereerinterested some time ago ermiss avondale  randolph feeling he was coloring and uncertain whether he should speak of having met her since contented himself with expressing his delight  in fact continued mr dingwall clearing his throat as if he were also clearing his conscience of a tremendous secret sheermentioned your name there is sir william dornton coming also sir william has recently succeeded his elder brother whoerit seems was the gentleman you were inquiring about when you first came here and who it is now ascertained was drowned in the bay a few months ago in facterit is probable that you were the last one who saw him alive i thought i would tell you continued mr dingwall settling his chin more comfortably in his checked cravat in case sir william should speak of him to you  randolph was staggered the abrupt revelation of his benefactors name and fate casually coupled with an invitation to dinner shocked and confounded him perhaps mr dingwall noticed it and misunderstood the cause for he added in parenthetical explanation yes the man whose portmanteau you took charge of is dead but you did your duty mr trent in the matter although the recovery of the portmanteau was unessential to the case  dead repeated randolph scarcely heeding him but is it true are they sure  mr dingwall elevated his eyebrows the large property at stake of course rendered the most satisfactory proofs of it necessary his father had died only a month previous and of course they were seeking the presumptive heir the socalled captain john dorntonyour manwhen they made the discovery of his death  randolph thought of the strange body at the wharf of the coroners vague verdict and was unconvinced but he said impulsively there was a child he checked himself as he remembered this was one of miss avondales confidences to him  ahmiss avondale has spoken of a child said mr dingwall dryly  i saw her with one which she said was captain dorntons which had been left in her care after the death of his wife said randolph in hurried explanation  john dornton had no wife said mr dingwall severely the boy is a natural son captain john lived a wild rough anderan eccentric life  i thoughti understood from miss avondale that he was married stammered the young man  in your rather slight acquaintance with that young lady i should imagine she would have had some delicacy in telling you otherwise returned mr dingwall primly  randolph felt the truth of this and was momentarily embarrassed yet he lingered  has miss avondale known of this discovery long he asked  about two weeks i should say returned mr dingwall she was of some service to sir william in getting up certain proofs he required  it was three weeks since she had seen randolph yet it would have been easy for her to communicate the news to him in these three weeks his romance of their common interest in his benefactoreven his own dream of ever seeing him againhad been utterly dispelled  it was in no social humor that he reached dingwalls house the next evening yet he knew the difficulty of taking an aggressive attitude toward his previous idol or of inviting a full explanation from her then  the guests with the exception of himself and miss avondale were all english she selfpossessed and charming in evening dress nodded to him with her usual mature patronage but did not evince the least desire to seek him for any confidential aside he noticed the undoubted resemblance of sir william dornton to his missing benefactor and yet it produced a singular repulsion in him rather than any sympathetic predilection at table he found that miss avondale was separated from him being seated beside the distinguished guest while he was placed next to the young lady he had taken downa miss eversleigh the cousin of sir william she was tall and randolphs first impression of her was that she was stiff and constrainedan impression he quickly corrected at the sound of her voice her frank ingenuousness and her unmistakable youth in the habit of being crushed by miss avondales unrelenting superiority he found himself apparently growing up beside this tall english girl who had the naivete of a child after a few commonplaces she suddenly turned her gray eyes on his and said  didnt you like jack i hope you did oh say you diddo  you mean captain john dornton said randolph a little confused  yes of course his brotherglancing toward sir william we always called him jack though i was ever so little when he went away no one thought of calling him anything else but jack say you liked him  i certainly did returned randolph impulsively then checking himself he added i only saw him once but i liked his face and mannerandhe was very kind to me  of course he was said the young girl quickly that was only like him and yetlowering her voice slightlywould you believe that they all say he was wild and wicked and dissipated and why fancy just because he didnt care to stay at home and shoot and hunt and race and make debts as heirs usually do no he wanted to see the world and do something for himself why when he was quite young he could manage a boat like any sailor dornton hall their place is on the coast you know and they say that just for adventures sake after he went away he shipped as first mate somewhere over here on the pacific and made two or three voyages you knowdont youand how every one was shocked at such conduct in the heir  her face was so girlishly animated with such sparkle of eye and responsive color that he could hardly reconcile it with her first restraint or with his accepted traditions of her unemotional race or indeed with her relationship to the principal guest his latent feeling of gratitude to the dead man warmed under the young girls voice  its so dreadful to think of him as drowned you know though even that they put against him she went on hurriedly for they say he was probably drowned in some drunken fitfell through the wharf or something shocking and awfulworse than suicide butshe turned her frank young eyes upon him againyou saw him on the wharf that night and you could tell how he looked  he was as sober as i was returned randolph indignantly as he recalled the incident of the flask and the dead mans caution from recalling it to repeating it followed naturally and he presently related the whole story of his meeting with captain dornton to the brightly interested eyes beside him when he had finished she leaned toward him in girlish confidence and said  yes but even that they tell to show how intoxicated be must have been to have given up his portmanteau to an utter stranger like you she stopped colored and yet reflecting his own half smile she added you know what i mean for they all agree how nice it was of you not to take any advantage of his condition and dingwall said your honesty and faithfulness struck revelstoke so much that he made a place for you at the bank now i think she continued with delightful naivete it was a proof of poor jacks being perfectly sober that he knew whom he was trusting and saw just what you were at once there but i suppose you must not talk to me any longer but must make yourself agreeable to some one else but it was very nice of you to tell me all this i wish you knew my guardian youd like him do you ever go to england do come and see us  these confidences had not been observed by the others and miss avondale appeared to confine her attentions to sir william who seemed to be equally absorbed except that once he lifted his eyes toward randolph as if in answer to some remark from her it struck randolph that he was the subject of their conversation and this did not tend to allay the irritation of a mind already wounded by the contrast of her lack of sympathy for the dead man who had befriended and trusted her to the simple faith of the girl beside him who was still loyal to a mere childish recollection  after the ladies had rustled away sir william moved his seat beside randolph his manner seemed to combine mr dingwalls restraint with a certain assumption of the man of the world more notable for its frankness than its tactfulness  sad business this of my brothers eh he said lighting a cigar any way you take it eh you saw him last eh the interrogating word however seemed to be only an exclamation of habit for he seldom waited for an answer  i really dont know said randolph as i saw him only once and he left me on the wharf i know no more where he went to then than where he came from before of course you must know all the rest and how he came to be drowned  yes it really did not matter much the whole question was identification and proof of death you know beastly job eh  was that his body you were helping to get ashore at the wharf one sunday asked randolph bluntly now fully recognizing the likeness that had puzzled him in sir william i didnt see any resemblance  precious few would i didntthough its true i hadnt seen him for eight years poor old chap been knocked about so he hadnt a feature left eh but his shipmate knew him and there were his traps on the ship  then for the first time randolph heard the grim and sordid details of john dorntons mysterious disappearance he had arrived the morning before that eventful day on an australian bark as the principal passenger the vessel itself had an evil repute and was believed to have slipped from the hands of the police at melbourne john dornton had evidently amassed a considerable fortune in australia although an examination of his papers and effects showed it to be in drafts and letters of credit and shares and that he had no ready moneya fact borne out by the testimony of his shipmates the night he arrived was spent in an orgy on board ship which he did not leave until the early evening of the next day although after his erratic fashion he had ordered a room at a hotel that evening he took ashore a portmanteau evidently intending to pass the night at his hotel he was never seen again although some of the sailors declared that they had seen him on the wharf without the portmanteau and they had drunk together at a low grog shop on the street corner he had evidently fallen through some hole in the wharf as he was seen only with the sailors who also knew he had no ready money on his person there was no suspicion of foul play  for all that dont you know continued sir william with a forced laugh which struck randolph as not only discordant but as having an insolent significance it might have been a deuced bad business for you eh last man who was with him eh in possession of his portmanteau eh wearing his clothes eh awfully clever of you to go straight to the bank with it pon my word my legal man wanted to pounce down on you as accessory until i and dingwall called him off but its all right now  randolphs antagonism to the man increased the investigation seems to have been peculiar he said dryly for if i remember rightly at the coroners inquest on the body i saw you with the verdict returned was of the death of an unknown man  yes we hadnt clear proof of identity then he returned coolly but we had a reexamination of the body before witnesses afterward and a verdict according to the facts that was kept out of the papers in deference to the feelings of the family and friends i fancy you wouldnt have liked to be crossexamined before a stupid jury about what you were doing with jacks portmanteau even if we were satisfied with it  i should have been glad to testify to the kindness of your brother at any risk returned randolph stoutly you have heard that the portmanteau was stolen from me but the amount of money it contained has been placed in mr dingwalls hands for disposal  its contents were known and all thats been settled returned sir william rising but he continued with his forced laugh which to randolphs fancy masked a certain threatening significance i say it would have been a beastly business dont you know if you had been called upon to produce it againha haeh  returning to the dining room randolph found miss avondale alone on a corner of the sofa she swept her skirts aside as he approached as an invitation for him to sit beside her still sore from his experience he accepted only in the hope that she was about to confide to him her opinion of this strange story but to his chagrin she looked at him over her fan with a mischievous tolerance you seemed more interested in the cousin than the brother of your patron  once randolph might have been flattered at this but her speech seemed to him only an echo of the general heartlessness i found miss eversleigh very sympathetic over the fate of the unfortunate man whom nobody else here seems to care for said randolph coldly  yes returned miss avondale composedly i believe she was a great friend of captain dornton when she was quite a child and i dont think she can expect much from sir william who is very different from his brother in fact she was one of the relatives who came over here in quest of the captain when it was believed he was living and the heir he was quite a patron of hers  but was he not also one of yours said randolph bluntly  i think i told you i was the friend of the boy and of poor paquita the boys mother said miss avondale quietly i never saw captain dornton but twice  randolph noticed that she had not said wife although in her previous confidences she had so described the mother but as dingwall had said why should she have exposed the boys illegitimacy to a comparative stranger and if she herself had been deceived about it why should he expect her to tell him and yethe was not satisfied  he was startled by a little laugh well i declare you look as if you resented the fact that your benefactor had turned out to be a baronetjust as in some noveland that you have rendered a service to the english aristocracy if you are thinking of poor bobby she continued without the slightest show of selfconsciousness sir william will provide for him and thinks of taking him to england to restore his health nowwith her smiling tolerant superiorityyou must go and talk to miss eversleigh i see her looking this way and i dont think she half likes me as it is  randolph who however also saw that sir william was lounging toward them here rose formally as if permitting the latter to take the vacated seat this partly imposed on him the necessity of seeking miss eversleigh who having withdrawn to the other end of the room was turning over the leaves of an album as randolph joined her she said without looking up is miss avondale a friend of yours  the question was so pertinent to his reflections at the moment that he answered impulsively i really dont know  yes thats the answer i think most of her acquaintances would give if they were asked the same question and replied honestly said the young girl as if musing  even sir william suggested randolph half smiling yet wondering at her unlookedfor serious shrewdness as he glanced toward the sofa  yes but he wouldnt care you see there would be a pair of them she stopped with a slight blush as if she had gone too far but corrected herself in her former youthful frankness you dont mind my saying what i did of her youre not such a particular friend  we both owe a debt of gratitude to your cousin jack said randolph in some embarrassment  yes but you feel it and she doesnt so that doesnt make you friends  but she has taken good care of captain dorntons child suggested randolph loyally  he stopped however feeling that he was on dangerous ground but miss eversleigh put her own construction on his reticence and said  i dont think she cares for it muchor for any children  randolph remembered his own impression the only time he had ever seen her with the child and was struck with the young girls instinct again coinciding with his own but possibly because he knew he could never again feel toward miss avondale as he had he was the more anxious to be just and he was about to utter a protest against this general assumption when the voice of sir william broke in upon them he was taking his leaveand the opportunity of accompanying miss avondale to her lodgings on the way to his hotel he lingered a moment over his handshaking with randolph  awfully glad to have met you and i fancy youre awfully glad to get rid of what they call your trust must have given you a beastly lot of bother ehmight have given you more  he nodded familiarly to miss eversleigh and turned away with miss avondale who waved her usual smiling patronage to randolph even including his companion in that halfamused halfsuperior salutation perhaps it was this that put a sudden hauteur into the young girls expression as she stared at miss avondales departing figure  if you ever come to england mr trent she said with a pretty dignity in her youthful face i hope you will find some people not quite so rude as my cousin and  miss avondale you would say returned randolph quietly as to her i am quite accustomed to her maturer superiority which i am afraid is the effect of my own youth and inexperience and i believe that in course of time your cousins brusqueness might be as easily understood by me i dare say he added with a laugh that i must seem to them a very romantic visionary with my trust and the foolish importance i have put upon a very trivial occurrence  i dont think so said the girl quickly and i consider bill very rude and she added with a return of her boyish frankness i shall tell him so as for miss avondale shes at least thirty i understand perhaps she cant help showing it in that way too  but here randolph to evade further personal allusions continued laughingly and as ive lost my trust i havent even that to show in defense indeed when you all are gone i shall have nothing to remind me of my kind benefactor it will seem like a dream  miss eversleigh was silent for a moment and then glanced quickly around her the rest of the company were their elders and engaged in conversation at the other end of the apartment had evidently left the young people to themselves  wait a moment she said with a youthful air of mystery and earnestness randolph saw that she had slipped an indian bracelet profusely hung with small trinkets from her arm to her wrist and was evidently selecting one it proved to be a childs tiny ring with a small pearl setting this was given to me by cousin jack said miss eversleigh in a low voice when i was a child at some frolic or festival and i have kept it ever since i brought it with me when we came here as a kind of memento to show him you know that is impossible now you say you have nothing of his to keep will you accept this i know he would be glad to know you had it you could wear it on your watch chain dont say no but take it  protesting yet filled with a strange joy and pride randolph took it from the young girls hand the little color which had deepened on her cheek cleared away as he thanked her gratefully and with a quiet dignity she arose and moved toward the others randolph did not linger long after this and presently took his leave of his host and hostess  it seemed to him that he walked home that night in the whirling clouds of his dispelled dream the airy structure he had built up for the last three months had collapsed the enchanted canopy under which he had stood with miss avondale was folded forever the romance he had evolved from his strange fortune had come to an end not prosaically as such romances are apt to do but with a dramatic termination which however was equally fatal to his hopes at any other time he might have projected the wildest hopes from the fancy that he and miss avondale were orphaned of a common benefactor but it was plain that her interests were apart from his and there was an indefinable something he did not understand and did not want to understand in the story she had told him how much of it she had withheld not so much from delicacy or contempt for his understanding as a desire to mislead him he did not know his faith in her had gone with his romance it was not strange that the young english girls unsophisticated frankness and simple confidences lingered longest in his memory and that when a few days later mr dingwall informed him that miss avondale had sailed for england with the dornton family he was more conscious of a loss in the stranger girls departure  i suppose miss avondale takes charge ofof the boy sir he said quietly  mr dingwall gave him a quick glance possibly sir william has behaved with greaterconsideration he replied briefly   iv   randolphs nature was too hopeful and recuperative to allow him to linger idly in the past he threw himself into his work at the bank with his old earnestness and a certain simple conscientiousness which while it often provoked the raillery of his fellow clerks did not escape the eyes of his employers he was advanced step by step and by the end of the year was put in charge of the correspondence with banks and agencies he had saved some money and had made one or two profitable investments he was enabled to take better apartments in the same building he had occupied he had few of the temptations of youth his fear of poverty and his natural taste kept him from the speculative and material excesses of the period a distrust of his romantic weakness kept him from society and meaner entanglements which might have beset his good looks and good nature he worked in his rooms at night and forbore his old evening rambles  as the year wore on to the anniversary of his arrival he thought much of the dead man who had inspired his fortunes and with it a sense of his old doubts and suspicions revived his reason had obliged him to accept the loss of the fateful portmanteau as an ordinary theft his instinct remained unconvinced there was no superstition connected with his loss his own prosperity had not been impaired by it on the contrary he reflected bitterly that the dead man had apparently died only to benefit others at such times he recalled with a pleasure that he knew might become perilous the tall english girl who had defended dorntons memory and echoed his own sympathy but that was all over now  one stormy night not unlike that eventful one of his past experience randolph sought his rooms in the teeth of a southwest gale as he buffeted his way along the rainwashed pavement of montgomery street it was not strange that his thoughts reverted to that night and the memory of his dead protector but reaching his apartment he sternly banished them with the vanished romance they revived and lighting his lamp laid out his papers in the prospect of an evening of uninterrupted work he was surprised however after a little interval by the sound of uncertain and shuffling steps on the halflighted passage outside the noise of some heavy article set down on the floor and then a tentative knock at his door a little impatiently he called come in  the door opened slowly and out of the half obscurity of the passage a thickset figure lurched toward him into the full light of the room randolph half rose and then sank back into his chair awed spellbound and motionless he saw the figure standing plainly before him he saw distinctly the familiar furniture of his room the stormtwinkling lights in the windows opposite the flash of passing carriage lamps in the street below but the figure before him was none other than the dead man of whom he had just been thinking  the figure looked at him intently and then burst into a fit of unmistakable laughter it was neither loud nor unpleasant and yet it provoked a disagreeable recollection nevertheless it dissipated randolphs superstitious tremor for he had never before heard of a ghost who laughed heartily  you dont remember me said the man belay there and ill freshen your memory he stepped back to the door opened it put his arm out into the hall and brought in a portmanteau closed the door and appeared before randolph again with the portmanteau in his hand it was the one that had been stolen there he said  captain dornton murmured randolph  the man laughed again and flung down the portmanteau youve got my name pat enough lad i see but i reckoned youd have spotted me without that portmanteau  i see youve got it back stammered randolph in his embarrassment it wasstolen from me  captain dornton laughed again dropped into a chair rubbed his hands on his knees and turned his face toward randolph yes i stole itor had it stolenthe same thing for im responsible  but i would have given it up to you at once said randolph reproachfully clinging to the only idea he could understand in his utter bewilderment i have religiously and faithfully kept it for you with all its contents ever sinceyou disappeared  i know it lad said captain dornton rising and extending a brown weatherbeaten hand which closed heartily on the young mans no need to say that and youve kept it even better than you know look here  he lifted the portmanteau to his lap and disclosed behind the usual small pouch or pocket in the lid a slit in the lining between the lining and the outer leather he went on grimly i had two or three bank notes that came to about a thousand dollars and some papers lad that reckoning by and large might be worth to me a million when i got that portmanteau back they were all there gummed in just as i had left them i didnt show up and come for them myself for i was lying low at the time andno offense ladi didnt know how you stood with a party who was no particular friend of mine an old shipmate whom i set to watch that party quite accidentally run across your bows in the ferry boat and heard enough to make him follow in your wake here where he got the portmanteau its all right he said with a laugh waving aside with his brown hand randolphs protesting gesture the old bags only got back to its rightful owner it maynt have been got in shipshape frisco style but when a mans life is at stake at least when its a question of his being considered dead or alive hes got to take things as he finds em and i found em d bad  in a flash of recollection randolph remembered the obtruding miner on the ferry boat the same figure on the wharf corner and the advantage taken of his absence with miss avondale and miss avondale was the party this mans shipmate was watching he felt his face crimsoning yet he dared not question him further nor yet defend her captain dornton noticed it and with a friendly tact which randolph had not expected of him rising again laid his hand gently on the young mans shoulder  look here lad he said with his pleasant smile dont you worry your head about the ways or doings of the dornton family or any of their friends theyre a queer lotincluding your humble servant youve done the square thing accordin to your lights youve ridden straight from start to finish with no jockeying and i shant forget it there are only two men who havent failed me when i trusted them one was you when i gave you my portmanteau the other was jack redhill when he stole it from you  he dropped back in his chair again and laughed silently  then you did not fall overboard as they supposed stammered randolph at last  not much but the next thing to it it wasnt the water that i took in that knocked me out my lad but something stronger i was shanghaied  shanghaied repeated randolph vacantly  yes shanghaied hocused drugged at that gin mill on the wharf by a lot of crimps who mistaking me for a better man shoved me blind drunk and helpless down the steps into a boat and out to a shorthanded brig in the stream when i came to i was outside the heads pointed for guayaquil when they found theyd captured not a poor jack but a man whod trod a quarterdeck who knew and was known at every port on the trading line and who could make it hot for them they were glad to compromise and set me ashore at acapulco and six weeks later i landed in frisco  safe and sound thank heaven said randolph joyously  not exactly lad said captain dornton grimly but dead and sat upon by the coroner and my body comfortably boxed up and on its way to england  but that was nine months ago what have you been doing since why didnt you declare yourself then said randolph impatiently a little irritated by the mans extreme indifference he really talked like an amused spectator of his own misfortunes  steady lad i know what youre going to say i know all that happened but the first thing i found when i got back was that the shanghai business had saved my life that but for that i would have really been occupying that box on its way to england instead of the poor devil who was taken for me  a cold tremor passed over randolph captain dornton however was tolerantly smiling  i dont understand said randolph breathlessly  captain dornton rose and walking to the door looked out into the passage then he shut the door carefully and returned glancing about the room and at the stormwashed windows i thought i heard some one outside im lying low just now and only go out at night for i dont want this thing blown before im ready got anything to drink here  randolph replied by taking a decanter of whiskey and glasses from a cupboard the captain filled his glass and continued with the same gentle but exasperating nonchalance mind my smoking  not at all said randolph pushing a cigar toward him but the captain put it aside drew from his pocket a short black clay pipe stuffed it with black cavendish plug which he had first chipped off in the palm of his hand with a large clasp knife lighted it and took a few meditative whiffs then glancing at randolphs papers he said im not keeping you from your work lad and receiving a reply in the negative puffed at his pipe and once more settled himself comfortably in his chair with his dark bearded profile toward randolph  you were saying just now you didnt understand he went on slowly without looking up so you must take your own bearings from what im telling you when i met you that night i had just arrived from melbourne i had been lucky in some trading speculations i had out there and i had some bills with me but no money except what i had tucked in the skin of that portmanteau and a few papers connected with my family at home when a man lives the roving kind of life i have he learns to keep all that he cares for under his own hat and isnt apt to blab to friends but it got out in some way on the voyage that i had money and as there was a mixed lot of sydney ducks and ticket of leave men on board it seems they hatched a nice little plot to waylay me on the wharf on landing rob me and drop me into deep water to make it seem less suspicious they associated themselves with a lot of crimps who were on the lookout for our sailors who were going ashore that night too id my suspicions that a couple of those men might be waiting for me at the end of the wharf i left the ship just a minute or two before the sailors did then i met you that meeting my lad was my first step toward salvation for the two men let you pass with my portmanteau which they didnt recognize as i knew they would me and supposed you were a stranger and lay low waiting for me i who went into the ginmill with the other sailors was foolish enough to drink and was drugged and crimped as they were i hadnt thought of that a poor devil of a ticket of leave man about my size was knocked down for me and he added suppressing a laugh will be buried deeply lamented in the chancel of dornton church while the row was going on the skipper fearing to lose other men warped out into the stream and so knew nothing of what happened to me when they found what they thought was my body he was willing to identify it in the hope that the crime might be charged to the crimps and so did the other sailor witnesses but my brother bill who had just arrived here from callao where he had been hunting for me hushed it up to prevent a scandal all the same bill might have known the body wasnt mine even though he hadnt seen me for years  but it was frightfully disfigured so that even i who saw you only once could not have sworn it was not you said randolph quickly  humph said captain dornton musingly bill may have acted on the squarethough he was in a dd hurry  but said randolph eagerly you will put an end to all this now you will assert yourself you have witnesses to prove your identity  steady lad said the captain waving his pipe gently of course i have buthe stopped laid down his pipe and put his hands doggedly in his pocketsis it worth it seeing the look of amazement in randolphs face he laughed his low laugh and settled himself back in his chair again no he said quietly if it wasnt for my son and whats due him as my heir i supposei reckon id just chuck the whole dd thing  what said randolph give up the property the title the family honor the wrong done to your reputation the punishmenthe hesitated fearing he had gone too far  captain dornton withdrew his pipe from his mouth with a gesture of caution and holding it up said steady lad well come to that by and by as to the property and title i cut and run from them ten years ago to me they meant only the old thingthe life of a country gentleman the hunting the shooting the whole beastly business that the land over there hangs like a millstone round your neck they meant all this to me who loved adventure and the sea from my cradle i cut the property for i hated it and i hate it still if i went back i should hear the sea calling me day and night i should feel the breath of the southwest trades in every wind that blew over that tight little island yonder i should be always scenting the old trail lad the trail that leads straight out of the gate to swoop down to the south seas do you think a man who has felt his ships bows heave and plunge under him in the long pacific swelljust ahead of him a reef breaking white into the lagoon and beyond a fence of feathery palmscares to follow hounds over gray hedges under a gray november sky and the society a man whos got a speaking acquaintance in every port from acapulco to melbourne who knows every den and every longshoreman in it from a south american tienda to a samoan beachcombers hutwhat does he want with society he paused as randolphs eyes were fixed wonderingly on the first sign of emotion on his weatherbeaten face which seemed for a moment to glow with the strength and freshness of the sea and then said with a laugh you stare lad well for all the dorntons are rather proud of their family like as not there was some beastly old danish pirate among them long ago and ive got a taste of his blood in me but im not quite as bad as that yet  he laughed and carelessly went on as to the family honor i dont see that it will be helped by my ripping up the whole thing and perhaps showing that bill was a little too previous in identifying me as to my reputation that was gone after i left home and if i hadnt been the legal heir they wouldnt have bothered their heads about me my father had given me up long ago and there isnt a man woman or child that wouldnt now welcome bill in my place  there is one who wouldnt said randolph impulsively  you mean caroline avondale said captain dornton dryly  randolph colored no i mean miss eversleigh who was with your brother  captain dornton reflected to be sure sibyl eversleigh i havent seen her since she was so high i used to call her my little sweetheart so sybby remembered cousin jack and came to find him but when did you meet her he asked suddenly as if this was the only detail of the past which had escaped him fixing his frank eyes upon randolph  the young man recounted at some length the dinner party at dingwalls his conversation with miss eversleigh and his interview with sir william but spoke little of miss avondale to his surprise the captain listened smilingly and only said that was like billy to take a rise out of you by pretending you were suspected thats his waya little rough when you dont know him and hes got a little grog amidships all the same id have given something to have heard him running you when all the while you had the biggest bulge on him only neither of you knew it he laughed again until randolph amazed at his levity and indifference lost his patience  do you know he said bluntly that they dont believe you were legally married  but captain dornton only continued to laugh until seeing his companions horrified face he became demure i suppose bill didnt for bill had sense enough to know that otherwise he would have to take a back seat to bobby  but did miss avondale know you were legally married and that your son was the heir asked randolph bluntly  she had no reason to suspect otherwise although we were married secretly she was an old friend of my wife not particularly of mine  randolph sat back amazed and horrified those were her own words or was this man deceiving him as the others had  but the captain eying him curiously but still amusedly added i even thought of bringing her as one of my witnesses until  until what asked randolph quickly as he saw the captain had hesitated  until i found she wasnt to be trusted until i found she was too thick with bill said the captain bluntly and now shes gone to england with him and the boy i suppose shell make him come to terms  come to terms echoed randolph i dont understand yet he had an instinctive fear that he did  well said the captain slowly suppose she might prefer the chance of being the wife of a grownup baronet to being the governess of one who was only a minor shes a cute girl he added dryly  but said randolph indignantly you have other witnesses i hope  of course i have ive got the spanish records now from the callao priest and theyre put in a safe place should anything happen to meif anything could happen to a dead man he added grimly these proofs were all i was waiting for before i made up my mind whether i should blow the whole thing or let it slide  randolph looked again with amazement at this strange man who seemed so indifferent to the claims of wealth position and even to revenge it seemed inconceivable and yet he could not help being impressed with his perfect sincerity he was relieved however when captain dornton rose with apparent reluctance and put away his pipe  now look here my lad im right glad to have overhauled you again whatever happened or is going to happen and theres my hand upon it now to come to business im going over to england on this job and i want you to come and help me  randolphs heart leaped the appeal revived all his old boyish enthusiasm with his secret loyalty to the man before him but he suddenly remembered his past illusions and for an instant he hesitated  but the bank he stammered scarce knowing what to say  the captain smiled i will pay you better than the bank and at the end of four months in whatever way this job turns out if you still wish to return here i will see that you are secured from any loss perhaps you may be able to get a leave of absence but your real object must be kept a secret from every one not a word of my existence or my purpose must be blown before i am ready you and jack redhill are all that know it now  but you have a lawyer said the surprised randolph  not yet im my own lawyer in this matter until i get fairly under way ive studied the law enough to know that as soon as i prove that im alive the case must go on on account of my heir whether i choose to cry quits or not and its just that that holds my hand  randolph stared at the extraordinary man before him for a moment as the strange story of his miraculous escape and his still more wonderful indifference to it all recurred to his mind he felt a doubt of the narrators truthfulness or his sanity but another glance at the sailors frank eyes dispelled that momentary suspicion he held out his hand as frankly and grasping captain dorntons said i will go   v   randolphs request for a four months leave of absence was granted with little objection and no curiosity he had acquired the confidence of his employers and beyond mr revelstokes curt surprise that a young fellow on the road to fortune should sacrifice so much time to irrelevant travel and the remark but you know your own business best there was no comment it struck the young man however that mr dingwalls slight coolness on receiving the news might be attributed to a suspicion that he was following miss avondale whom he had fancied dingwall disliked and he quickly made certain inquiries in regard to miss eversleigh and the possibility of his meeting her as without intending it and to his own surprise he achieved a blush in so doing which dingwall noted he received a gracious reply and the suggestion that it was quite proper for him on arriving to send the young lady his card  captain dornton under the alias of captain johns was ready to catch the next steamer to the isthmus and in two days they sailed the voyage was uneventful and if randolph had expected any enthusiasm on the part of the captain in the mission on which he was now fairly launched he would have been disappointed although his frankness was unchanged he volunteered no confidences it was evident he was fully acquainted with the legal strength of his claim yet he as evidently deferred making any plan of redress until he reached england of miss eversleigh he was more communicative you would have liked her better my lad it you hadnt been bewitched by the avondale woman for she is the whitest of the dorntons in vain randolph protested truthfully yet with an even more convincing color that it had made no difference and he had liked her the captain laughed ay lad but shes a poor orphan with scarcely a hundred pounds a year who lives with her guardian an old clergyman and yet he added grimly there are only three lives between her and the propertymine bobbys and billsunless he should marry and have an heir  the more reason why you should assert yourself and do what you can for her now said randolph eagerly  ay returned the captain with his usual laugh when she was a child i used to call her my little sweetheart and gave her a ring and i reckon i promised to marry her too when she grew up  the truthful randolph would have told him of miss evereleighs gift but unfortunately he felt himself again blushing and fearful lest the captain would misconstrue his confusion he said nothing  except on this occasion the captain talked with randolph chiefly of his later pastof voyages he had made of places they were passing and ports they visited he spent much of the time with the officers and even the crew over whom he seemed to exercise a singular power and with whom he exhibited an odd freemasonry to randolphs eyes he appeared to grow in strength and stature in the salt breath of the sea and although he was uniformly kind even affectionate to him he was brusque to the other passengers and at times even with his friends the sailors randolph sometimes wondered how he would treat a crew of his own he found some answer to that question in the captains manner to jack redhill the abstractor of the portmanteau and his old shipmate who was accompanying the captain in some dependent capacity but who received his masters confidences and orders with respectful devotion  it was a cold foggy morning nearly two months later that they landed at plymouth the english coast had been a vague blank all night only pierced long hours apart by dim starpoints or weird yellow beacon flashes against the horizon and this vagueness and unreality increased on landing until it seemed to randolph that they had slipped into a land of dreams the illusion was kept up as they walked in the weird shadows through halflit streets into a murky railway station throbbing with steam and sudden angry flashes in the darkness and then drew away into what ought to have been the open country but was only gray plains of mist against a lost horizon sometimes even the vague outlook was obliterated by passing trains coming from nowhere and slipping into nothingness as they crept along with the day without however any lightening of the opaque vault overhead to mark its meridian there came at times a thinning of the gray wall on either side of the track showing the vague bulk of a distant hill the battlemented sky line of an oldtime hall or the spires of a cathedral but always melting back into the mist again as in a dream then vague stretches of gloom again foggy stations obscured by nebulous light and blurred and moving figures and the black relief of a tunnel only once the captain catching sight of randolphs awed face under the lamp of the smoking carriage gave way to his long low laugh jolly place englandso very merrie and then they came to a comparatively lighter broader and more brilliantly signaled tunnel filled with people and as they remained in it randolph was told it was london with the sensation of being only half awake he was guided and put into a cab by his companion and seemed to be completely roused only at the hotel   it had been arranged that randolph should first go down to chillingworth rectory and call on miss eversleigh and without disclosing his secret gather the latest news from dornton hall only a few miles from chillingworth for this purpose he had telegraphed to her that evening and had received a cordial response the next morning he arose early and in spite of the gloom in the glow of his youthful optimism entered the bedroom of the sleeping captain dornton and shook him by the shoulder in lieu of the accolade saying rise sir john dornton  the captain a light sleeper awoke quickly thank you my lad all the same though i dont know that im quite ready yet to tumble up to that kind of piping theres a rotten old saying in the family that only once in a hundred years the eldest son succeeds thats why bill was so cocksure i reckon well  in an hour im off to chillingworth to begin the campaign said randolph cheerily  luck to you my boy whatever happens clap a stopper on your jaws though now and then im glad you like sybby but i dont want you to like her so much as to forget yourself and give me away  half an hour out of london the fog grew thinner breaking into lacelike shreds in the woods as the train sped by or expanding into lustrous tenuity above him although the trees were leafless there was some recompense in the glimpses their bare boughs afforded of clustering chimneys and gables nestling in ivy an infinite repose had been laid upon the landscape with the withdrawal of the fog as of a veil lifted from the face of a sleeper all his boyish dreams of the mother country came back to him in the books he had read and repeopled the vast silence even the rotting leaves that lay thick in the cryptlike woods seemed to him the dead laurels of its past heroes and sages quaint oldtime villages thatched roofs the everrecurring square towers of church or hall the trim ordered parks tiny streams crossed by heavy stone bridges much too large for themall these were only pages of those books whose leaves he seemed to be turning over two hours of this fancy and then the train stopped at a station within a mile or two of a bleak headland a beacon and the gray wash of a pewtercolored sea where a hilly village street climbed to a norman church tower and the ivied gables of a rectory  miss eversleigh dignifiedly tall but youthfully frank as he remembered her was waiting to drive him in a pony trap to the rectory a little pink with suppressed consciousness and the responsibilities of presenting a stranger guest to her guardian she seemed to randolph more charming than ever  but her first word of news shocked and held him breathless bobby the little orphan a frail exotic had succumbed to the northern winter a cold caught in new york had developed into pneumonia and he died on the passage miss avondale although she had received marked attention from sir william returned to america in the same ship  i really dont think she was quite as devoted to the poor child as all that you know she continued with innocent frankness and cousin bill was certainly most kind to them both yet there really seemed to be some coolness between them after the childs death but she added suddenly for the first time observing her companions evident distress and coloring in confusion i beg your pardonive been horribly rude and heartless i dare say the poor boy was very dear to you and of course miss avondale was your friend please forgive me  randolph intent only on that catastrophe which seemed to wreck all captain dorntons hopes and blunt his only purpose for declaring himself hurriedly reassured her yet was not sorry his agitation had been misunderstood and what was to be done there was no train back to london for four hours he dare not telegraph and if he did could he trust to his strange patrons wise conduct under the first shock of this news to his present vacillating purpose he could only wait  luckily for his ungallant abstraction they were speedily at the rectory where a warm welcome from mr brunton sibyls guardian and his family forced him to recover himself and showed him that the story of his devotion to john dornton had suffered nothing from miss eversleighs recital distraught and anxious as he was he could not resist the young girls offer after luncheon to show him the church with the vault of the dorntons and the tablet erected to john dornton and later the hall only two miles distant but here randolph hesitated  i would rather not call on sir william today he said  you need not he is over at the horse show at fern dyke and wont be back till late and if he has been forgathering with his boon companions he wont be very pleasant company  sibyl said the rector in goodhumored protest  oh mr trent has had a little of cousin bills convivial manners before now said the young girl vivaciously and isnt shocked but we can see the hall from the park on our way to the station  even in his anxious preoccupation he could see that the church itself was a quaint and wonderful preservation of the past for four centuries it had been sacred to the tombs of the dorntons and their effigies in brass and marble yet as randolph glanced at the stately sarcophagus of the unknown ticket of leave man its complacent absurdity combined with his nervousness made him almost hysterical yet again it seemed to him that something of the mystery and inviolability of the past now invested that degraded dust and it would be an equal impiety to disturb it miss eversleigh again believing his agitation caused by the memory of his old patron tactfully hurried him away yet it was a more bitter thought i fear that not only were his lips sealed to his charming companion on the subject in which they could sympathize but his anxiety prevented him from availing himself of that interview to exchange the lighter confidences he had eagerly looked forward to it seemed cruel that he was debarred this chance of knitting their friendship closer by another of those accidents that had brought them together and he was aware that his gloomy abstraction was noticed by her at first she drew herself up in a certain proud reserve and then perhaps his own nervousness infecting her in turn he was at last terrified to observe that as she stood before the tomb her clear gray eyes filled with tears  oh please dont do thatthere miss eversleigh he burst out impulsively  i was thinking of cousin jack she said a little startled at his abruptness sometimes it seems so strange that he is deadi scarcely can believe it  i meant stammered randolph that he is much happieryou knowhe grew almost hysterical again as he thought of the captain lying cheerfully in his bed at the hotelmuch happier than you or i he added bitterly that isi mean it grieves me so to see you grieve you know  miss eversleigh did not know but there was enough sincerity and real feeling in the young fellows voice and eyes to make her color slightly and hurry him away to a locality less fraught with emotions in a few moments they entered the park and the old hall rose before them it was a great tudor house of mullioned windows traceries and battlements of stately towers mossgrown balustrades and statues darkening with the fog that was already hiding the angles and wings of its huge bulk a peacock spread its ostentatious tail on the broad stone steps before the portal a flight of rooks from the leafless elms rose above its stacked and twisted chimneys after all how little had this stately incarnation of the vested rights and sacred tenures of the past in common with the laughing rover he had left in london that morning and thinking of the destinies that the captain held so lightly in his hand and perhaps not a little of the absurdity of his own position to the confiding young girl beside him for a moment he half hated him  the fog deepened as they reached the station and as it seemed to randolph made their parting still more vague and indefinite and it was with difficulty that he could respond to the young girls frank hope that he would soon return to them yet he half resolved that he would not until he could tell her all  nevertheless as the train crept more and more slowly with halting signals toward london he buoyed himself up with the hope that captain dornton would still try conclusions for his patrimony or at least come to some compromise by which he might be restored to his rank and name but upon these hopes the vision of that great house settled firmly upon its lands held there in perpetuity by the dead and stretchedout hands of those that lay beneath its soil always obtruded itself then the fog deepened and the crawling train came to a dead stop at the next station the whole line was blocked four precious hours were hopelessly lost  yet despite his impatience he reentered london with the same dazed semiconsciousness of feeling as on the night he had first arrived there seemed to have been no interim his visit to the rectory and hall and even his fateful news were only a dream he drove through the same shadow to the hotel was received by the same haloencircled lights that had never been put out after glancing through the halls and reading room he hurriedly made his way to his companions room the captain was not there he quickly summoned the waiter the gentleman yes captain dornton had left with his servant redhill a few hours after mr trent went away he had left no message  again condemned to wait in inactivity randolph tried to resist a certain uneasiness that was creeping over him by attributing the captains absence to some unexpected legal consultation or the gathering of evidence his prolonged detention being due to the same fog that had delayed his own train but he was somewhat surprised to find that the captain had ordered his luggage into the porters care in the hall below before leaving and that nothing remained in his room but a few toilet articles and the fateful portmanteau the hours passed slowly owing to that perpetual twilight in which he had passed the day there seemed no perceptible flight of time and at eleven oclock the captain not arriving he determined to wait in the latters room so as to be sure not to miss him twelve oclock boomed from an adjacent invisible steeple but still he came not overcome by the fatigue and excitement of the day randolph concluded to lie down in his clothes on the captains bed not without a superstitious and uncomfortable recollection of that night about a year before when he had awaited him vainly at the san francisco hotel even the fateful portmanteau was there to assist his gloomy fancy nevertheless with the boom of one oclock in his drowsy ears as his last coherent recollection he sank into a dreamless sleep  he was awakened by a tapping at his door and jumped up to realize by his watch and the still burning gaslight that it was nine oclock but the intruder was only a waiter with a letter which he had brought to randolphs room in obedience to the instructions the latter had given overnight not doubting it was from the captain although the handwriting of the address was unfamiliar he eagerly broke the seal but he was surprised to read as follows   dear mr trentwe had such sad news from the hall after you left sir william was seized with a kind of fit it appears that he had just returned from the horse show and had given his mare to the groom while he walked to the garden entrance the groom saw him turn at the yew hedge and was driving to the stables when he heard a queer kind of cry and turning back to the garden front found poor sir william lying on the ground in convulsions the doctor was sent for and mr brunton and i went over to the hall the doctor thinks it was something like a stroke but he is not certain and sir william is quite delirious and doesnt recognize anybody i gathered from the groom that he had been drinking heavily perhaps it was well that you did not see him but i thought you ought to know what had happened in case you came down again its all very dreadful and i wonder if that is why i was so nervous all the afternoon it may have been a kind of presentiment dont you think so  yours faithfully  sibyl eversleigh   i am afraid randolph thought more of the simpleminded girl who in the midst of her excitement turned to him half unconsciously than he did of sir william had it not been for the necessity of seeing the captain he would probably have taken the next train to the rectory perhaps he might later he thought little of sir williams illness and was inclined to accept the young girls naive suggestion of its cause he read and reread the letter staring at the large grave childlike handwritingso like herselfand obeying a sudden impulse raised the signature as gravely as if it had been her hand to his lips  still the day advanced and the captain came not randolph found the inactivity insupportable he knew not where to seek him he had no more clue to his resorts or his friendsif indeed he had any in londonthan he had after their memorable first meeting in san francisco he might indeed be the dupe of an impostor who at the eleventh hour had turned craven and fled he might be in the captains indifference a mere instrument set aside at his pleasure yet he could take advantage of miss eversleighs letter and seek her and confess everything and ask her advice it was a great and at the moment it seemed to him an overwhelming temptation but only for the moment he had given his word to the captainmore he had given his youthful faith and to his credit he never swerved again it seemed to him too in his youthful superstition as he looked at the abandoned portmanteau that he had again to take up his burdenhis trust  it was nearly four oclock when the spell was broken a large packet bearing the printed address of a london and american bank was brought to him by a special messenger but the written direction was in the captains hand randolph tore it open it contained one or two inclosures which he hastily put aside for the letter two pages of foolscap which he read breathlessly   dear trentdont worry your head if i have slipped my cable without telling you im all right only i got the news you are bringing me just after you left by jack redhill whom i had sent to dornton hall to see how the land lay the night before it was not that i didnt trust you but he had ways of getting news that you wouldnt stoop to you can guess from what i have told you already that now bobby is gone theres nothing to keep me here and im following my own idea of letting the whole blasted thing slide i only worked this racket for the sake of him im sorry for him but i suppose the poor little beggar couldnt stand these sunless godforsaken longitudes any more than i could besides that as i didnt want to trust any lawyer with my secret i myself had hunted up some books on the matter and found that by the law of entail id have to rip up the whole blessed thing and bill would have had to pay back every blessed cent of what rents he had collected since he took holdnot to me but the estatewith interest and that no arrangement i could make with him would be legal on account of the boy at least thats the way the thing seemed to pan out to me so that when i heard of bobbys death i was glad to jump the rest and thats what i made up my mind to do  but like a blasted lubber now that i could do it and cut right away i must needs think that id like first to see bill on the sly without letting on to any one else and tell him what i was going to do id no fear that hed object or that hed hesitate a minute to fall in with my plan of dropping my name and my game and giving him full swing while i stood out to sea and the south pacific and dropped out of his mess for the rest of my life perhaps i wanted to set his mind at rest if hed ever had any doubts perhaps i wanted to have a little fun out of him for his dd previousness perhaps lad i had a hankering to see the old place for the last time at any rate i allowed to go to dornton hall i timed myself to get there about the hour you left to keep out of sight until i knew he was returning from the horse show and to waylay him alone and have our little talk without witnesses i darent go to the hall for some of the old servants might recognize me  i went down there with jack redhill and we separated at the station i hung around in the fog i even saw you pass with sibyl in the dogcart but you didnt see me i knew the place and just where to hide where i could have the chance of seeing him alone but it was a beastly job waiting there i felt like a dd thief instead of a man who was simply visiting his own yet you maynt believe me lad but i hated the place and all it meant more than ever then by and by i heard him coming i had arranged it all with myself to get into the yew hedge and step out as he came to the garden entrance and as soon as he recognized me to get him round the terrace into the summer house where we could speak without danger  i heard the groom drive away to the stable with the cart and sure enough in a minute he came lurching along toward the garden door he was mighty unsteady on his pins and i reckon he was more than half full which was a bad lookout for our confab but i calculated that the sight of me when i slipped out would sober him and by  it did for his eyes bulged out of his head and got fixed there his jaw dropped he tried to strike at me with a hunting crop he was carrying and then he uttered an ungodly yell you might have heard at the station and dropped down in his tracks i had just time to slip back into the hedge again before the groom came driving back and then all hands were piped and they took him into the house  and of course the game was up and i lost my only chance i was thankful enough to get clean away without discovering myself and i have to trust now to the fact of bills being drunk and thinking it was my ghost that he saw in a touch of the jimjams and im not sorry to have given him that start for there was that in his eye and that in the stroke he made my lad that showed a guilty conscience i hadnt reckoned on and it cured me of my wish to set his mind at ease hes welcome to all the rest  and thats why im going awaynever to return im sorry i couldnt take you with me but its better that i shouldnt see you again and that you didnt even know where i was gone when you get this i shall be on blue water and heading for the sunshine youll find two letters inclosed one you need not open unless you hear that my secret was blown and you are ever called upon to explain your relations with me the other is my thanks my lad in a letter of credit on the bank for the way you have kept your trust and i believe will continue to keep it to  john dornton  ps i hope you dropped a tear over my swell tomb at dornton church all the same i dont begrudge it to the poor devil who lost his life instead of me  j d   as randolph read he seemed to hear the captains voice throughout the letter and even his low characteristic laugh in the postscript then he suddenly remembered the luggage which the porter had said the captain had ordered to be taken below but on asking that functionary he was told a conveyance for the victoria docks had called with an order and taken it away at daybreak it was evident that the captain had intended the letter should be his only farewell depressed and a little hurt at his patrons abruptness randolph returned to his room opening the letter of credit he found it was for a thousand poundsa munificent beneficence as it seemed to randolph for his dubious services and a proof of his patrons frequent declarations that he had money enough without touching the dornton estates  for a long time he sat with these sole evidences of the reality of his experience in his hands a prey to a thousand surmises and conflicting thoughts was he the selfdeceived disciple of a visionary a generous unselfish but weak man whose eccentricity passed even the bounds of reason who would believe the captains story or the captains motives who comprehend his strange quest and its stranger and almost ridiculous termination even if the seal of secrecy were removed in after years what had he randolph to show in corroboration of his patrons claim  then it occurred to him that there was no reason why he should not go down to the rectory and see miss eversleigh again under pretense of inquiring after the luckless baronet whose title and fortune had nevertheless been so strangely preserved he began at once his preparations for the journey and was nearly ready when a servant entered with a telegram randolphs heart leaped the captain had sent him newsperhaps had changed his mind he tore off the yellow cover and read   sir william died at twelve oclock without recovering consciousness  s eversleigh   vi   for a moment randolph gazed at the dispatch with a halfhysterical laugh and then became as suddenly sane and cool one thought alone was uppermost in his mind the captain could not have heard this news yet and if he was still within reach or accessible by any means whatever however determined his purpose he must know it at once the only clue to his whereabouts was the victoria docks but that was something in another moment randolph was in the lower hall had learned the quickest way of reaching the docks and plunged into the street  the fog here swooped down and to the embarrassment of his mind was added the obscurity of light and distance which halted him after a few hurried steps in utter perplexity indistinct figures were here and there approaching him out of nothingness and melting away again into the greenish gray chaos he was in a busy thoroughfare he could hear the slow trample of hoofs the dull crawling of vehicles and the warning outcries of a traffic he could not see trusting rather to his own speed than that of a halting conveyance he blundered on until he reached the railway station a short but exasperating journey of impulses and hesitations of detonating signals and warning whistles and he at last stood on the docks beyond him a vague bulk or two and a soft opaque flowing wallthe river  but one steamer had left that daythe dom pedro for the river platetwo hours before but until the fog thickened a quarter of an hour ago she could be seen so his informant said still lying with steam up in midstream yes it was still possible to board her but even as the boatman spoke and was leading the way toward the landing steps the fog suddenly lightened a soft salt breath stole in from the distant sea and a veil seemed to be lifted from the face of the gray waters the outlines of the two shores came back the spars of nearer vessels showed distinctly but the space where the huge hulk had rested was empty and void there was a trail of something darker and more opaque than fog itself lying near the surface of the water but the dom pedro was a mere speck in the broadening distance   a bright sun and a keen easterly wind were revealing the curling ridges of the sea beyond the headland when randolph again passed the gates of dornton hall on his way to the rectory now for the first time he was able to see clearly the outlines of that spot which had seemed to him only a misty dream and even in his preoccupation he was struck by its grave beauty the leafless limes and elms in the park grouped themselves as part of the picturesque details of the hall they encompassed and the evergreen slope of firs and larches rose as a background to the gray battlements covered with dark green ivy whose rich shadows were brought out by the unwonted sunshine with a halfrepugnant curiosity he had tried to identify the garden entrance and the fateful yew hedge the captain had spoken of as he passed but as quickly he fell back upon the resolution he had taken in coming thereto dissociate his secret his experience and his responsibility to his patron from his relations to sibyl eversleigh to enjoy her companionship without an obtruding thought of the strange circumstances that had brought them together at first or the stranger fortune that had later renewed their acquaintance he had resolved to think of her as if she had merely passed into his life in the casual ways of society with only her personal charms to set her apart from others why should his exclusive possession of a secretwhich even if confided to her would only give her needless and hopeless anxietydebar them from an exchange of those other confidences of youth and sympathy why could he not love her and yet withhold from her the knowledge of her cousins existence so he had determined to make the most of his opportunity during his brief holiday to avail himself of her naive invitation and even of what he dared sometimes to think was her predilection for his companionship and if before he left he had acquired a right to look forward to a time when her future and his should be onebut here his glowing fancy was abruptly checked by his arrival at the rectory door  mr brunton received him cordially yet with a slight business preoccupation and a certain air of importance that struck him as peculiar sibyl he informed him was engaged at that moment with some friends who had come over from the hall mr trent would understand that there was a great deal for her to doin her present position wondering why she should be selected to do it instead of older and more experienced persons randolph however contented himself with inquiries regarding the details of sir williams seizure and death he learned as he expected that nothing whatever was known of the captains visit nor was there the least suspicion that the baronets attack was the result of any predisposing emotion indeed it seemed more possible that his medical attendants knowing something of his late excesses and their effect upon his constitution preferred for the sake of avoiding scandal to attribute the attack to longstanding organic disease  randolph who had already determined as a forlorn hope to write a cautious letter to the captain informing him briefly of the news without betraying his secret and directed to the care of the consignees of the dom pedro in brazil by the next post was glad to be able to add this medical opinion to relieve his patrons mind of any fear of having hastened his brothers death by his innocent appearance but here the entrance of sibyl eversleigh with her friends drove all else from his mind  she looked so tall and graceful in her black dress which set off her dazzling skin and with her youthful gravity gave to her figure the charming maturity of a young widow that he was for a moment awed and embarrassed but he experienced a relief when she came eagerly toward him in all her old girlish frankness and with even something of yearning expectation in her gray eyes  it was so good of you to come she said i thought you would imagine how i was feelingshe stopped as if she were conscious as randolph was of a certain chill of unresponsiveness in the company and said in an undertone wait until we are alone then turning with a slight color and a pretty dignity toward her friends she continued lady ashbrook this is mr trent an old friend of both my cousins when they were in america  in spite of the gracious response of the ladies randolph was aware of their critical scrutiny of both himself and miss eversleigh of the exchange of significant glances and a certain stiffness in her guardians manner it was quite enough to affect randolphs sensitiveness and bring out his own reserve  fancying however that his reticence disturbed miss eversleigh he forced himself to converse with lady ashbrookavoiding many of her pointed queries as to himself his acquaintance with sibyl and the length of time he expected to stay in englandand even accompanied her to her carriage and here he was rewarded by sibyl running out with a crape veil twisted round her throat and head and the usual femininely forgotten final message to her visitor as the carriage drove away she turned to randolph and said quickly  let us go in by way of the garden  it was a slight detour but it gave them a few moments alone  it was so awful and sudden she said looking gravely at randolph and to think that only an hour before i had been saying unkind things of him of course she added naively they were true and the groom admitted to me that the mare was overdriven and sir william could hardly stand and only to think of it he never recovered complete consciousness but muttered incoherently all the time i was with him to the last and he never said a word i could understandonly once  what did he say asked randolph uneasily  i dont like to sayit was too dreadful  randolph did not press her yet after a pause she said in a low voice with a naivete impossible to describe it was jack damn you  he did not dare to look at her even with this grim mingling of farce and tragedy which seemed to invest every scene of that sordid drama miss eversleigh continued gravely the grooms name was robert but jack might have been the name of one of his boon companions  convinced that she suspected nothing yet in the hope of changing the subject randolph said quietly i thought your guardian perhaps a little less frank and communicative today  yes said the young girl suddenly with a certain impatience and yet in half apology to her companion of course hetheyall and everybodyare much more concerned and anxious about my new position than i am its perfectly dreadfulthis thinking of it all the time arranging everything criticising everything in reference to it and the poor man who is the cause of it all not yet at rest in his grave the whole thing is inhuman and unchristian  i dont understand stammered randolph vaguely what is your new position what do you mean  the girl looked up in his face with surprise why didnt you know im the next of kinim the heiressand will succeed to the property in six months when i am of age  in a flash of recollection randolph suddenly recalled the captains words there are only three lives between her and the property their meaning had barely touched his comprehension before she was the heiress yes save for the captain  she saw the change the wonder even the dismay in his face and her own brightened frankly its so good to find one who never thought of it who hadnt it before him as the chief end for which i was born yes i was the next of kin after dear jack died and bill succeeded but there was every chance that he would marry and have an heir and yet the moment he was taken ill that idea was uppermost in my guardians mind good man as he is and even forced upon me if thisthis property had come from poor cousin jack whom i loved there would have been something dear in it as a memory or a gift but from him whom i couldnt beari know its wicked to talk that way but its simply dreadful  and yet said randolph with a sudden seriousness he could not control i honestly believe that captain dornton would be perfectly happyyes rejoicedif he knew the property had come to you  there was such an air of conviction and it seemed to the simple girl even of spiritual insight in his manner that her clear handsome eyes rested wonderingly on his  do you really think so she said thoughtfully and yet he knows that i am like him yes she continued answering randolphs look of surprise i am just like him in that i loathe and despise the life that this thing would condemn me to i hate all that it means and all that it binds me to as he used to and if i could i would cut and run from it as he did  she spoke with a determined earnestness and warmth so unlike her usual grave naivete that he was astonished there was a flush on her cheek and a frank fire in her eye that reminded him strangely of the captain and yet she had emphasized her words with a little stamp of her narrow foot and a gesture of her hand that was so untrained and girlish that he smiled and said with perhaps the least touch of bitterness in his tone but you will get over that when you come into the property  i suppose i shall she returned with an odd lapse to her former gravity and submissiveness thats what they all tell me  you will be independent and your own mistress he added  independent she repeated impatiently with dornton hall and twenty thousand a year independent with every duty marked out for me independent with every one to criticise my smallest actionsevery one who would never have given a thought to the orphan who was contented and made her own friends on a hundred a year of course you who are a stranger dont understand yet i thought that youshe hesitatedwould have thought differently  why  why with your belief that one should make ones own fortune she said  that would do for a man and in that i respected captain dorntons convictions as you told them to me but for a girl how could she be independent except with money  she shook her head as if unconvinced but did not reply they were nearing the garden porch when she looked up and said and as youre a man you will be making your way in the world mr dingwall said you would  there was something so childishly trustful and confident in her assurance that he smiled mr dingwall is too sanguine but it gives me hope to hear you say so  she colored slightly and said gravely we must go in now yet she lingered for a moment before the door for a long time afterward he had a very vivid recollection of her charming face in its childlike gravity and its quaint frame of black crape standing out against the sunsetwarmed wall of the rectory promise me you will not mind what these people say or do she said suddenly  i promise he returned with a smile to mind only what you say or do  but i might not be always quite right you know she said naively  ill risk that  then when we go in now dont talk much to me but make yourself agreeable to all the others and then go straight home to the inn and dont come here until after the funeral  the faintest evasive glint of mischievousness in her withdrawn eyes at this moment mitigated the austerity of her command as they both passed in  randolph had intended not to return to london until after the funeral two days later and spent the interesting day at the neighboring town whence he dispatched his exploring and perhaps hopeless letter to the captain the funeral was a large and imposing one and impressed randolph for the first time with the local importance and solid standing of the dorntons all the magnates and old county families were represented the inn yard and the streets of the little village were filled with their quaint liveries crested paneled carriages and silvercipher caparisoned horses with a sprinkling of fashion from london he could not close his ears to the gossip of the villagers regarding the suddenness of the late baronets death the extinction of the title the accession of the orphaned girl to the property and even to his greater exasperation speculations upon her future and probable marriage some o they gay chaps from lunnon will be lordin it over the hall afore long was the comment of the hostler  it was with some little bitterness that randolph took his seat in the crowded church but this feeling and even his attempts to discover miss eversleighs face in the stately family pew fenced off from the chancel presently passed away and then his mind began to be filled with strange and weird fancies what grim and ghostly revelations might pass between this dead scion of the dorntons lying on the trestles before them and the obscure nameless ticket of leave man awaiting his entrance in the vault below the incongruity of this thought with the smug complacency of the worldly minded congregation sitting around him and the probable smiling carelessness of the reckless roverthe cause of alleven now idly pacing the deck on the distant sea touched him with horror and when added to this was the consciousness that sibyl eversleigh was forced to become an innocent actor in this hideous comedy it seemed as much as he could bear again he questioned himself was he right to withhold his secret from her in vain he tried to satisfy his conscience that she was happier in her ignorance the resolve he had made to keep his relations with her apart from his secret he knew now was impossible but one thing was left to him until he could disclose his whole storyuntil his lips were unsealed by captain dorntonhe must never see her again and the grim sanctity of the edifice seemed to make that resolution a vow  he did not dare to raise his eyes again toward her pew lest a sight of her sweet grave face might shake his resolution and he slipped away first among the departing congregation he sent her a brief note from the inn saying that he was recalled to london by an earlier train and that he would be obliged to return to california at once but hoping that if he could be of any further assistance to her she would write to him to the care of the bank it was a formal letter and yet he had never written otherwise than formally to her that night he reached london on the following night he sailed from liverpool for america   six months had passed it was difficult at first for randolph to pick up his old life again but his habitual earnestness and singleness of purpose stood him in good stead and a vague rumor that he had made some powerful friends abroad with the nearer fact that he had a letter of credit for a thousand pounds did not lessen his reputation he was reinstalled and advanced at the bank mr dingwall was exceptionally gracious and minute in his inquiries regarding miss eversleighs succession to the dornton property with an occasional shrewdness of eye in his interrogations which recalled to randolph the questioning of miss eversleighs friends and which he responded to as cautiously for the young fellow remained faithful to his vow even in thinking of her and seemed to be absorbed entirely in his business yet there was a vague ambition of purpose in this absorption that would probably have startled the more conservative englishman had he known it  he had not heard from miss eversleigh since he left nor had he received any response from the captain indeed he had indulged in little hopes of either but he kept stolidly at work perhaps with a larger trust than he knew and then one day he received a letter addressed in a handwriting that made his heart leap though he had seen it but once when it conveyed the news of sir william dorntons sudden illness it was from miss eversleigh but the postmark was callao he tore open the envelope and for the next few moments forgot everythinghis business devotion his lofty purpose even his solemn vow  it read as follows   dear mr trenti should not be writing to you now if i did not believe that i now understand why you left us so abruptly on the day of the funeral and why you were at times so strange you might have been a little less hard and cold even if you knew all that you did know but i must write now for i shall be in san francisco a few days after this reaches you and i must see you and have your help for i can have no other as you know you are wondering what this means and why i am here i know all and everything i know he is alive and never was dead i know i have no right to what i have and never had and i have come here to seek him and make him take it back i could do no other i could not live and do anything but that and you might have known it but i have not found him here as i hoped i should though perhaps it was a foolish hope of mine and i am coming to you to help me seek him for he must be found you know i want to keep his and your secret and therefore the only one i can turn to for assistance and counsel is you  you are wondering how i know what i do two months ago i got a letter from himthe strangest quaintest and yet the kindest letterexactly like himself and the way he used to talk he had just heard of his brothers death and congratulated me on coming into the property and said he was now perfectly happy and should keep dead and never never come to life again that he never thought things would turn out as splendidly as they hadfor sir william might have had an heirand that now he should really die happy he said something about everything being legally right and that i could do what i liked with the property as if that would satisfy me yet it was all so sweet and kind and so like dear old jack that i cried all night and then i resolved to come here where his letter was dated from luckily i was of age now and could do as i liked and i said i wanted to travel in south america and california and i suppose they didnt think it very strange that i should use my liberty in that way some said it was quite like a dornton i knew something of callao from your friend miss avondale and could talk about it which impressed them so i started off with only a maidmy old nurse i was a little frightened at first when i came to think what i was doing but everybody was very kind and i really feel quite independent now so you see a girl may be independent after all of course i shall see mr dingwall in san francisco but he need not know anything more than that i am traveling for pleasure and i may go to the sandwich islands or sydney if i think he is there of course i have had to use some moneysome of his rentsbut it shall be paid back i will tell you everything about my plans when i see you  yours faithfully  sibyl eversleigh  p s why did you let me cry over that mans tomb in the church   randolph looked again at the date and then hurriedly consulted the shipping list she was due in ten days yet delighted as he was with that prospect and touched as he had been with her courage and naive determination after his first joy he laid the letter down with a sigh for whatever was his ultimate ambition he was still a mere salaried clerk whatever was her selfsacrificing purpose she was still the rich heiress the seal of secrecy had been broken yet the situation remained unchanged their association must still be dominated by it and he shrank from the thought of making her girlish appeal to him for help an opportunity for revealing his real feelings  this instinct was strengthened by the somewhat formal manner in which mr dingwall announced her approaching visit miss eversleigh will stay with mrs dingwall while she is here on account of hererposition and the fact that she is without a chaperon mrs dingwall will of course be glad to receive any friends miss eversleigh would like to see  randolph frankly returned that miss eversleigh had written to him and that he would be glad to present himself nothing more was said but as the days passed he could not help noticing that in proportion as mr dingwalls manner became more stiff and ceremonious mr revelstokes usually crisp goodhumored suggestions grew more deliberate and randolph found himself once or twice the subject of the presidents penetrating but smiling scrutiny and the day before miss eversleighs arrival his natural excitement was a little heightened by a summons to mr revelstokes private office  as he entered the president laid aside his pen and closed the door  i have never made it my business trent he said with goodhumored brusqueness to interfere in my employees private affairs unless they affect their relations to the bank and i havent had the least occasion to do so with you neither has mr dingwall although it is on his behalf that i am now speaking as randolph listened with a contracted brow he went on with a grim smile but he is an englishman you know and has certain ideas of the importance of position particularly among his own people he wishes me therefore to warn you of what he calls the disparity of your position and that of a young english ladymiss eversleighwith whom you have some acquaintance and in whom he added with a still grimmer satisfaction he fears you are too deeply interested  randolph blazed if mr dingwall had asked me sir he said hotly i would have told him that i have never yet had to be reminded that miss eversleigh is a rich heiress and i only a poor clerk but as to his using her name in such a connection or dictating to me the manner of  hold hard said revelstoke lifting his hand deprecatingly yet with his unchanged smile i dont agree with mr dingwall and i have every reason to know the value of your services yet i admit something is due to his prejudices and in this matter trent the bank of eureka while i am its president doesnt take a back seat i have concluded to make you manager of the branch bank at marysville an independent position with its salary and commissions and if that doesnt suit dingwall why he added rising from his desk with a short laugh he has a bigger idea of the value of property than the bank has  one moment sir i implore you burst out randolph breathlessly if your kind offer is based upon the mistaken belief that i have the least claim upon miss eversleighs consideration more than that of simple friendshipif anybody has dared to give you the idea that i have aspired by word or deed to more or that the young lady has ever countenanced or even suspected such aspirations it is utterly false and grateful as i am for your kindness i could not accept it  look here trent returned revelstoke curtly yet laying his hand on the young mans shoulder not unkindly all that is your private affair which as i told you i dont interfere with the other is a question between mr dingwall and myself of your comparative value it wont hurt you with anybody to know how high weve assessed it dont spoil a good thing  grateful even in his uncertainty randolph could only thank him and withdraw yet this fateful forcing of his hand in a delicate question gave him a new courage it was with a certain confidence now in his capacity as her friend and qualified to advise her that he called at mr dingwalls the evening she arrived it struck him that in the dingwalls reception of him there was mingled with their formality a certain respect  thanks to this perhaps he found her alone she seemed to him more beautiful than his recollection had painted her in the development that maturity freedom from restraint and time had given her for a moment his new fresh courage was staggered but she had retained her youthful simplicity and came toward him with the same naive and innocent yearning in her clear eyes that he remembered at their last meeting their first words were naturally of their great secret and randolph told her the whole story of his unexpected and startling meeting with the captain and the captains strange narrative of his undertaking the journey with him to recover his claim establish his identity and as randolph had hoped restore to her that member of the family whom she had most cared for he recounted the captains hesitation on arriving his own journey to the rectory the news she had given him the reason of his singular behavior his return to london and the second disappearance of the captain he read to her the letter he had received from him and told her of his hopeless chase to the docks only to find him gone she listened to him breathlessly with varying color with an occasional outburst of pity or a strange shining of the eyes that sometimes became clouded and misty and at the conclusion with a calm and grave paleness  but she said you should have told me all  it was not my secret he pleaded  you should have trusted me  but the captain had trusted me  she looked at him with grave wonder and then said with her old directness but if i had been told such a secret affecting you i should have told you she stopped suddenly seeing his eyes fixed on her and dropped her own lids with a slight color i mean she said hesitatingly of course you have acted nobly generously kindly wiselybut i hate secrets oh why cannot one be always frank  a wild idea seized randolph but i have another secretyou have not guessedand i have not dared to tell you do you wish me to be frank now  why not she said simply but she did not look up  then he told her but strangest of all in spite of his fears and convictions it flowed easily and naturally as a part of his other secret with an eloquence he had not dreamed of before but when he told her of his late position and his prospects she raised her eyes to his for the first time yet without withdrawing her hand from his and said reproachfully  yet but for that you would never have told me  how could i he returned eagerly for but for that how could i help you to carry out your trust how could i devote myself to your plans and enable you to carry them out without touching a dollar of that inheritance which you believe to be wrongfully yours  then with his old boyish enthusiasm he sketched a glowing picture of their future how they would keep the dornton property intact until the captain was found and communicated with and how they would cautiously collect all the information accessible to find him until such time as randolphs fortunes would enable them both to go on a voyage of discovery after him and in the midst of this prophetic forecast which brought them so closely together that she was enabled to examine his watch chain she said  i see you have kept cousin jacks ring did he ever see it  he told me he had given it to you as his little sweetheart and that he  there was a singular pause here  he never did thatat least not in that way said sybil eversleigh   and strangely enough the optimistic randolphs prophecies came true he was married a month later to sibyl eversleigh mr dingwall giving away the bride he and his wife were able to keep their trust in regard to the property for without investing a dollar of it in the bank the mere reputation of his wifes wealth brought him a flood of other investors and a confidence which at once secured his success in two years he was able to take his wife on a six months holiday to europe via australia but of the details of that holiday no one knew it is however on record that ten or twelve years ago dornton hall which had been leased or unoccupied for a long time was refitted for the heiress her husband and their children during a brief occupancy and that in that period extensive repairs were made to the interior of the old norman church and much attention given to the redecoration and restoration of its ancient tombs      mr macglowries widow   very little was known of her late husband yet that little was of a sufficiently aweinspiring character to satisfy the curiosity of laurel spring a man of unswerving animosity and candid belligerency untempered by any human weakness he had been actively engaged as survivor in two or three blood feuds in kentucky and some desultory dueling only to succumb through the irony of fate to an attack of fever and ague in san francisco gifted with a fine sense of humor he is said in his last moments to have called the simpleminded clergyman to his bedside to assist him in putting on his boots the kindly divine although pointing out to him that he was too weak to rise much less walk could not resist the request of a dying man when it was fulfilled mr macglowrie crawled back into bed with the remark that his race had always died with their boots on and so passed smilingly and tranquilly away  it is probable that this story was invented to soften the ignominy of macglowries peaceful end the widow herself was also reported to be endowed with relations of equally homicidal eccentricities her two brothers stephen and hector boompointer had western reputations that were quite as lurid and remote her own experiences of a frontier life had been rude and startling and her scalpa singularly beautiful one of blond hairhad been in peril from indians on several occasions a pair of scissors with which she had once pinned the intruding hand of a marauder to her cabin doorpost was to be seen in her sitting room at laurel spring a fairfaced woman with eyes the color of pale sherry a complexion sallowed by innutritious food slight and tall figure she gave little suggestion of this amazonian feat but that it exercised a wholesome restraint over the many who would like to have induced her to reenter the married state there is little reason to doubt laurel spring was a peaceful agricultural settlement few of its citizens dared to aspire to the dangerous eminence of succeeding the defunct macglowrie few could hope that the sister of living boompointers would accept an obvious mesalliance with them however sincere their affection life was still sweet to the rude inhabitants of laurel spring and the preservation of the usual quantity of limbs necessary to them in their avocations with their devotion thus chastened by caution it would seem as if the charming mistress of laurel spring house was secure from disturbing attentions  it was a pleasant summer afternoon and the sun was beginning to strike under the laurels around the hotel into the little office where the widow sat with the housekeepera stout spinster of a coarser western type mrs macglowrie was looking wearily over some accounts on the desk before her and absently putting back some tumbled sheaves from the stack of her heavy hair for the widow had a certain indolent southern negligence which in a less pretty woman would have been untidiness and a characteristic hook and eyeless freedom of attire which on less graceful limbs would have been slovenly one sleeve cuff was unbuttoned but it showed the blue veins of her delicate wrist the neck of her dress had lost a hook but the glimpse of a bit of edging round the white throat made amends of all which however it should be said that the widow in her limp abstraction was really unconscious  i reckon we kin put the new preacher in kernel starbottles room said miss morvin the housekeeper the kernels going tonight  oh said the widow in a tone of relief but whether at the early departure of the gallant colonel or at the successful solution of the problem of lodging the preacher miss morvin could not determine but she went on tentatively  the kernel was talkin in the bar room and kind o wonderin why you hadnt got married agin said youd make a stir in sacramentobut you was jest berried here  i suppose hes heard of my husband said the widow indifferently  yesbut he said he couldnt place you returned miss morvin  the widow looked up couldnt place me she repeated  yeshadnt heard o macglowries wife and disremembered your brothers  the colonel doesnt know everybody even if he is a fighting man said mrs macglowrie with languid scorn  thats just what dick blair said returned miss morvin and though hes only a doctor he jest stuck up agin the kernel and told that story about your jabbin that man with your scissorsbeautiful and how you once fought off a bear with a redhot iron so that youd have admired to hear him hes awfully gone on you  the widow took that opportunity to button her cuff  and how long does the preacher calculate to stay she added returning to business details  only a day theyll have his house fixed up and ready for him tomorrow theyre spendin a heap o money on it he ought to be the powful preacher they say he isto be worth it  but here mrs macglowries interest in the conversation ceased and it dropped  in her anxiety to further the suit of dick blair miss morvin had scarcely reported the colonel with fairness  that gentleman leaning against the bar in the hotel saloon with a cocktail in his hand had expatiated with his usual gallantry upon mrs macglowries charms and on his own personal responsibility had expressed the opinion that they were thrown away on laurel spring thatblank it allshe reminded him of the blankest beautiful woman he had seen even in washingtonold major beveridges daughter from kentucky were they sure she wasnt from kentucky wasnt her name beveridgeand not boompointer becoming more reminiscent over his second drink the colonel could vaguely recall only one boompointera blank skulking hound sira mean white shysterbut of course he couldnt have been of the same breed as such a blank fine woman as the widow it was here that dick blair interrupted with a heightened color and a glowing eulogy of the widows relations and herself which however only increased the chivalry of the colonelwho would be the last man sir to detract fromor suffer any detraction ofa ladys reputation it was needless to say that all this was intensely diverting to the bystanders and proportionally discomposing to blair who already experienced some slight jealousy of the colonel as a man whose fighting reputation might possibly attract the affections of the widow of the belligerent macglowrie he had cursed his folly and relapsed into gloomy silence until the colonel left  for dick blair loved the widow with the unselfishness of a generous nature and a first passion he had admired her from the first day his lot was cast in laurel spring where coming from a rude frontier practice he had succeeded the district doctor in a more peaceful and domestic ministration a skillful and gentle surgeon rather than a general household practitioner he was at first coldly welcomed by the gloomy dyspeptics and aguehaunted settlers from riparian lowlands the few bucolic idlers who had relieved the monotony of their lives by the stimulus of patent medicines and the exaltation of stomach bitters also looked askance at him a commonsense way of dealing with their ailments did not naturally commend itself to the shopkeepers who vended these nostrums and he was made to feel the opposition of trade but he was gentle to women and children and animals and oddly enough it was to this latter dilection that he owed the widows interest in himan interest that eventually made him popular elsewhere  the widow had a pet doga beautiful spaniel who however had assimilated her graceful languor to his own native love of ease to such an extent that he failed in a short leap between a balcony and a window and fell to the ground with a fractured thigh the dog was supposed to be crippled for life even if that life were worth preservingwhen dr blair came to the rescue set the fractured limb put it in splints and plaster after an ingenious design of his own visited him daily and eventually restored him to his mistresss lap sound in wind and limb how far this daily ministration and the necessary exchange of sympathy between the widow and himself heightened his zeal was not known there were those who believed that the whole thing was an unmanly trick to get the better of his rivals in the widows good graces there were others who averred that his treatment of a brute beast like a human being was sinful and unchristian he couldnt have done more for a regularly baptized child said the postmistress and what mo would a regularly baptized child have wanted returned mrs macglowrie with the drawling southern intonation she fell back upon when most contemptuous  but dr blairs increasing practice and the widows preoccupation presently ended their brief intimacy it was well known that she encouraged no suitors at the hotel and his shyness and sensitiveness shrank from ostentatious advances there seemed to be no chance of her becoming herself his patient her sane mind indolent nerves and calm circulation kept her from feminine vapors of feminine excesses she retained the teeth and digestion of a child in her thirty odd years and abused neither riding and the cultivation of her little garden gave her sufficient exercise and yet the unexpected occurred the day after starbottle left dr blair was summoned hastily to the hotel mrs macglowrie had been found lying senseless in a dead faint in the passage outside the dining room in his hurried flight thither with the messenger he could learn only that she had seemed to be in her usual health that morning and that no one could assign any cause for her fainting  he could find out little more when he arrived and examined her as she lay pale and unconscious on the sofa of her sitting room it had not been thought necessary to loosen her already loose dress and indeed he could find no organic disturbance the case was one of sudden nervous shockbut this with his knowledge of her indolent temperament seemed almost absurd they could tell him nothing but that she was evidently on the point of entering the dining room when she fell unconscious had she been frightened by anything a snake or a rat miss morvin was indignant the widow of macglowriethe repeller of grizzliesfrightened at sich had she been upset by any previous excitement passion or the receipt of bad news noshe wasnt that kind as the doctor knew and even as they were speaking he felt the widows healthy life returning to the pulse he was holding and giving a faint tinge to her lips her blueveined eyelids quivered slightly and then opened with languid wonder on the doctor and her surroundings suddenly a quick startled look contracted the yellow brown pupils of her eyes she lifted herself to a sitting posture with a hurried glance around the room and at the door beyond catching the quick observant eyes of dr blair she collected herself with an effort which dr blair felt in her pulse and drew away her wrist  what is it what happened she said weakly  you had a slight attack of faintness said the doctor cheerily and they called me in as i was passing but youre all right now  how powful foolish she said with returning color but her eyes still glancing at the door slumping off like a green gyrl at nothin  perhaps you were startled said the doctor  mrs macglowrie glanced up quickly and looked away nolet me see i was just passing through the hall going into the dining room wheneverything seemed to waltz round meand i was off where did they find me she said turning to miss morvin  i picked you up just outside the door replied the housekeeper  then they did not see me said mrs macglowrie  whos they responded the housekeeper with more directness than grammatical accuracy  the people in the dining room i was just opening the doorand i felt this coming onandi reckon i had just sense enough to shut the door again before i went off  then that accounts for what jim slocum said uttered miss morvin triumphantly he was in the dining room talkin with the new preacher when he allowed he heard the door open and shut behind him then he heard a kind of slump outside and opened the door again just to find you lyin there and to rush off and get me and thats why he was so mad at the preacherfor he says he just skurried away without offerin to help he allows the preacher may be a powful exhorterbut he aint worth much at works  some men cant bear to be around when a womans up to that sort of foolishness said the widow with a faint attempt at a smile but a return of her paleness  hadnt you better lie down again said the doctor solicitously  im all right now returned mrs macglowrie struggling to her feet morvin will look after me till the shakiness goes but it was mighty touching and neighborly to come in doctor she continued succeeding at last in bringing up a faint but adorable smile which stirred blairs pulses if i were my own dogyou couldnt have treated me better  with no further excuse for staying longer blair was obliged to departyet reluctantly both as lover and physician he was by no means satisfied with her condition he called to inquire the next daybut she was engaged and sent word to say she was better  in the excitement attending the advent of the new preacher the slight illness of the charming widow was forgotten he had taken the settlement by storm his first sermon at laurel spring exceeded even the extravagant reputation that had preceded him known as the inspired cowboy a common unlettered frontiersman he was said to have developed wonderful powers of exhortatory eloquence among the indians and scarcely less savage border communities where he had lived half outcast half missionary he had just come up from the southern agricultural districts where he had been despite his rude antecedents singularly effective with women and young people the moody dyspeptics and lazy rustics of laurel spring were stirred as with a new patent medicine dr blair went to the first revival meeting without undervaluing the mans influence he was instinctively repelled by his appearance and methods the young physicians trained powers of observation not only saw an overwrought emotionalism in the speakers eloquence but detected the ring of insincerity in his more lucid speech and acts nevertheless the hysteria of the preacher was communicated to the congregation who wept and shouted with him tired and discontented housewives found their vague sorrows and vaguer longings were only the result of their unregenerate state the lazy country youths felt that the frustration of their small ambitions lay in their not being convicted of sin the mourners bench was crowded with wildly emulating sinners dr blair turned away with mingled feelings of amusement and contempt at the door jim slocum tapped him on the shoulder fetches the wimmin folk every time dont he doctor said jim  so it seems said blair dryly  youre one o them scientific fellers that look inter thingswhat do you allow it is  the young doctor restrained the crushing answer that rose to his lips he had learned caution in that neighborhood i couldnt say he said indifferently  taint no religion said slocum emphatically its jest pure fasnation did ye look at his eye its like a rattlesnakes and them wimmin are like birds theyre frightened of himbut they hev to do jest what he wills em thats how he skeert the widder the other day  the doctor was alert and on fire at once scared the widow he repeated indignantly  yes you know how she swooned away well sir me and that preacher brown was the only one in that dinin room at the time the widder opened the door behind me and sorter peeked in and that thar preacher give a start and looked up and then that sort of queer light come in his eyes and she shut the door and kinder fluttered and flopped down in the passage outside like a bird and he crawled away like a snake and never said a word my belief is that either he hadnt time to turn on the hull influence or else she bein smart got the door shut betwixt her and it in time otherwise sure as youre born shed hev been floppin and crawlin and sobbin arter himjist like them critters weve left  better not let the brethren hear you talk like that or theyll lynch you said the doctor with a laugh mrs macglowrie simply had an attack of faintness from some overexertion thats all  nevertheless he was uneasy as he walked away mrs macglowrie had evidently received a shock which was still unexplained and in spite of slocums exaggerated fancy there might be some foundation in his story he did not share the mans superstition although he was not a skeptic regarding magnetism yet even then the widows action was one of repulsion and as long as she was strong enough not to come to these meetings she was not in danger a day or two later as he was passing the garden of the hotel on horseback he saw her lithe graceful languid figure bending over one of her favorite flower beds the high fence partially concealed him from view and she evidently believed herself alone perhaps that was why she suddenly raised herself from her task put back her straying hair with a weary abstracted look remained for a moment quite still staring at the vacant sky and then with a little catching of her breath resumed her occupation in a dull mechanical way in that brief glimpse of her charming face blair was shocked at the change she was pale the corners of her pretty mouth were drawn there were deeper shades in the orbits of her eyes and in spite of her broad garden hat with its blue ribbon her light flowered frock and frilled apron she looked as he fancied she might have looked in the first crushing grief of her widowhood yet he would have passed on respecting her privacy of sorrow had not her little spaniel detected him with her keener senses and fluffy being truthfulas dogs areand recognizing a dear friend in the intruder barked joyously  the widow looked up her eyes met blairs and she reddened but he was too acute a lover to misinterpret what he knew alas was only confusion at her abstraction being discovered nevertheless there was something else in her brown eyes he had never seen before a momentary lighting up of reliefof even hopefulnessin his presence it was enough for blair he shook off his old shyness like the dust of his ride and galloped around to the front door  but she met him in the hall with only her usual languid good humor nevertheless blair was not abashed  i cant put you in splints and plaster like fluffy mrs macglowrie he said but i can forbid you to go into the garden unless youre looking better its a positive reflection on my professional skill and laurel spring will be shocked and hold me responsible  mrs macglowrie had recovered enough of her old spirit to reply that she thought laurel spring could be in better business than looking at her over her garden fence  but your dog who knows youre not well and doesnt think me quite a fool had the good sense to call me you heard him  but the widow protested that she was as strong as a horse and that fluffy was like all puppies conceited to the last degree  well said blair cheerfully suppose i admit you are all right physically youll confess you have some trouble on your mind wont you if i cant make you show me your tongue youll let me hear you use it to tell me what worries you if he added more earnestly you wont confide in your physicianyou will perhapstotoafriend  but mrs macglowrie evading his earnest eyes as well as his appeal was wondering what good it would do either a doctor oraashe herself seemed to hesitate over the worda friend to hear the worriments of a silly nervous old thingwho had only stuck a little too closely to her business  you are neither nervous nor old mrs macglowrie said the doctor promptly though i begin to think you have been too closely confined here you want more diversion orexcitement you might even go to hear this preacherhe stopped for the word had slipped from his mouth unawares  but a swift look of scorn swept her pale face and youd like me to follow those skinny old frumps and leggy limp chits that slobber and cry over that man she said contemptuously no i reckon i only want a changeand ill go away or get out of this for a while  the poor doctor had not thought of this possible alternative his heart sank but he was brave yes perhaps you are right he said sadly though it would be a dreadful lossto laurel springto us allif you went  do i look so very bad doctor she said with a halfmischievous halfpathetic smile  the doctor thought her upturned face very adorable but restrained his feelings heroically and contented himself with replying to the pathetic half of her smile you look as if you had been suffering he said gravely and i never saw you look so before you seem as if you had experienced some great shock do you know he went on in a lower tone and with a halfembarrassed smile that when i saw you just now in the garden you looked as i imagined you might have looked in the first days of your widowhoodwhen your husbands death was fresh in your heart  a strange expression crossed her face her eyelids dropped instantly and with both hands she caught up her frilled apron as if to meet them and covered her face a little shudder seemed to pass over her shoulders and then a cry that ended in an uncontrollable and halfhysterical laugh followed from the depths of that apron until shaking her sides and with her head still enveloped in its covering she fairly ran into the inner room and closed the door behind her  amazed shocked and at first indignant dr blair remained fixed to the spot then his indignation gave way to a burning mortification as he recalled his speech he had made a frightful faux pas he had been fool enough to try to recall the most sacred memories of that dead husband he was trying to succeedand her quick womans wit had detected his ridiculous stupidity her laugh was hystericalbut that was only natural in her mixed emotions he mounted his horse in confusion and rode away  for a few days he avoided the house but when he next saw her she had a charming smile of greeting and an air of entire obliviousness of his past blunder she said she was better she had taken his advice and was giving herself some relaxation from business she had been riding againoh so far aloneof course she was always aloneelse what would laurel spring say  true said blair smilingly besides i forgot that you are quite able to take care of yourself in an emergency and yet he added admiringly looking at her lithe figure and indolent grace do you know i never can associate you with the dreadful scenes they say you have gone through  then please dont she said quickly really id rather you wouldnt im sick and tired of hearing of it she was half laughing and yet half in earnest with a slight color on her cheek  blair was a little embarrassed of course i dont mean your heroismlike that story of the intruder and the scissors he stammered  oh thats the worst of all its too foolishits sickening she went on almost angrily i dont know who started that stuff she paused and then added shyly i really am an awful coward and horribly nervousas you know  he would have combated thisbut she looked really disturbed and he had no desire to commit another imprudence and he thought too that he again had seen in her eyes the same hopeful wistful light he had once seen before and was happy  this led him i fear to indulge in wilder dreams his practice although increasing barely supported him and the widow was rich her business had been profitable and she had repaid the advances made her when she first took the hotel but this disparity in their fortunes which had frightened him before now had no fears for him he felt that if he succeeded in winning her affections she could afford to wait for him despite other suitors until his talents had won an equal position his rivals had always felt as secure in his poverty as they had in his peaceful profession how could a poor simple doctor aspire to the hand of the rich widow of the redoubtable macglowrie  it was late one afternoon and the low sun was beginning to strike athwart the stark columns and down the long aisles of the redwoods on the high ridge the doctor returning from a patient at the loggers camp in its depths had just sighted the smaller groves of laurel springs two miles away he was riding fast with his thoughts filled with the widow when he heard a joyous bark in the underbrush and fluffy came bounding towards him blair dismounted to caress him as was his wont and then wisely conceiving that his mistress was not far away sauntered forward exploringly leading his horse the dog hounding before him and barking as if bent upon both leading and announcing him but the latter he effected first for as blair turned from the trail into the deeper woods he saw the figures of a man and woman walking together suddenly separate at the dogs warning the woman was mrs macglowriethe man was the revival preacher  amazed mystified and indignant blair nevertheless obeyed his first instinct which was that of a gentleman he turned leisurely aside as if not recognizing them led his horse a few paces further mounted him and galloped away without turning his head but his heart was filled with bitterness and disgust this womanwho but a few days before had voluntarily declared her scorn and contempt for that man and his admirershad just been giving him a clandestine meeting like one of the most infatuated of his devotees the story of the widows fainting the coarse surmises and comments of slocum came back to him with overwhelming significance but even then his reason forbade him to believe that she had fallen under the preachers influenceshe with her sane mind and indolent temperament yet whatever her excuse or purpose was she had deceived him wantonly and cruelly his abrupt avoidance of her had prevented him from knowing if she on her part had recognized him as he rode away if she had she would understand why he had avoided her and any explanation must come from her  then followed a few days of uncertainty when his thoughts again reverted to the preacher with returning jealousy was she after all like other women and had her gratuitous outburst of scorn of their infatuation been prompted by unsuccessful rivalry he was too proud to question slocum again or breathe a word of his fears yet he was not strong enough to keep from again seeking the high ridge to discover any repetition of that rendezvous but he saw her neither there nor elsewhere during his daily rounds and one night his feverish anxiety getting the better of him he entered the great gospel tent of the revival preacher  it chanced to be an extraordinary meeting and the usual enthusiastic audience was reinforced by some sightseers from the neighboring county townthe district judge and officials from the court in session among them colonel starbottle the impassioned revivalisthis eyes ablaze with fever his lank hair wet with perspiration hanging beside his heavy but weak jawswas concluding a fervent exhortation to his auditors to confess their sins accept conviction and regenerate then and there without delay they must put off the old adam and put on the flesh of righteousness at once they were to let no false shame or worldly pride keep them from avowing their guilty past before their brethren sobs and groans followed the preachers appeals his own agitation and convulsive efforts seemed to spread in surging waves through the congregation until a dozen men and women arose staggering like drunkards blindly or led or dragged forward by sobbing sympathizers towards the mourners bench and prominent among them but stepping jauntily and airily forward was the redoubtable and worldly colonel starbottle  at this proof of the orators power the crowd shoutedbut stopped suddenly as the colonel halted before the preacher and ascended the rostrum beside him then taking a slight pose with his goldheaded cane in one hand and the other thrust in the breast of his buttoned coat he said in his blandest forensic voice  if i mistake not sir you are advising these ladies and gentlemen to a free and public confession of their sins and aerdenunciation of their past lifeprevious to their conversion if i am mistaken ierask your pardon and theirs anderhold myself responsibleerpersonally responsible  the preacher glanced uneasily at the colonel but replied still in the hysterical intonation of his exordium  yes a complete searching of heartsa casting out of the seven devils of pride vain glory  thank youthat is sufficient said the colonel blandly but might ierbe permitted to suggest that youererset them the example the statement of the circumstances attending your own past life and conversion would be singularly interesting and exemplary  the preacher turned suddenly and glanced at the colonel with furious eyes set in an ashy face  if this is the flouting and jeering of the ungodly and dissolute he screamed woe to you i saywoe to you what have such as you to do with my previous state of unregeneracy  nothing said the colonel blandly unless that state were also the state of arkansas then sir as a former member of the arkansas bari might be able to assist your memoryandereven corroborate your confession  but here the enthusiastic adherents of the preacher vaguely conscious of some danger to their idol gathered threateningly round the platform from which he had promptly leaped into their midst leaving the colonel alone to face the sea of angry upturned faces but that gallant warrior never altered his characteristic pose behind him loomed the reputation of the dozen duels he had fought the goldheaded stick on which he leaned was believed to contain eighteen inches of shining steeland the people of laurel spring had discretion  he smiled suavely stepped jauntily down and made his way to the entrance without molestation  but here he was met by blair and slocum and a dozen eager questions  what was it what had he done who was he  a blank shyster who had swindled the widows and orphans in arkansas and escaped from jail  and his name isnt brown  no said the colonel curtly  what is it  that is a matter which concerns only myself and him sir said the colonel loftily but for which i amerpersonally responsible  a wild idea took possession of blair  and you say he was a noted desperado he said with nervous hesitation  the colonel glared  desperado sir never blank it alla mean psalmsinging crawling sneak thief  and blair felt relieved without knowing exactly why  the next day it was known that the preacher gabriel brown had left laurel spring on an urgent gospel call elsewhere  colonel starbottle returned that night with his friends to the county town strange to say a majority of the audience had not grasped the full significance of the colonels unseemly interruption and those who had as partisans kept it quiet blair tortured by doubt had a new delicacy added to his hesitation which left him helpless until the widow should take the initiative in explanation  a sudden summons from his patient at the loggers camp the next day brought him again to the fateful redwoods but he was vexed and mystified to find on arriving at the camp that he had been made the victim of some stupid blunder and that no message had been sent from there he was returning abstractedly through the woods when he was amazed at seeing at a little distance before him the flutter of mrs macglowries wellknown dark green riding habit and the figure of the lady herself her dog was not with her neither was the revival preacheror he might have thought the whole vision a trick of his memory but she slackened her pace and he was obliged to rein up abreast of her in some confusion  i hope i wont shock you again by riding alone through the woods with a man she said with a light laugh  nevertheless she was quite pale as he answered somewhat coldly that he had no right to be shocked at anything she might choose to do  but you were shocked for you rode away the last time without speaking she said and yetshe looked up suddenly into his eyes with a smileless facethat man you saw me with once had a better right to ride alone with me than any other man he was  your lover said blair with brutal brevity  my husband returned mrs macglowrie slowly  then you are not a widow gasped blair  no i am only a divorced woman that is why i have had to live a lie here that manthat hypocritewhose secret was only half exposed the other night was my husbanddivorced from me by the law when an escaped convict he fled with another woman from the state three years ago her face flushed and whitened again she put up her hand blindly to her straying hair and for an instant seemed to sway in the saddle  but blair as quickly leaped from his horse and was beside her let me help you down he said quickly and rest yourself until you are better before she could reply he lifted her tenderly to the ground and placed her on a mossy stump a little distance from the trail her color and a faint smile returned to her troubled face  had we not better go on she said looking around i never went so far as to sit down in the woods with him that day  forgive me he said pleadingly but of course i knew nothing i disliked the man from instincti thought he had some power over you  he has noneexcept the secret that would also have exposed himself  but others knew it colonel starbottle must have known his name and yetas he remembered he stammeredhe refused to tell me  yes but not because he knew he was my husband but because he knew he bore the same name he thinks as every one does that my husband died in san francisco the man who died there was my husbands cousina desperate man and a noted duelist  and you assumed to be his widow said the astounded blair  yes but dont blame me too much she said pathetically it was a wild a silly deceit but it was partly forced upon me for when i first arrived across the plains at the frontier i was still bearing my husbands name and although i was alone and helpless i found myself strangely welcomed and respected by those rude frontiersmen it was not long before i saw it was because i was presumed to be the widow of allen macglowriewho had just died in san francisco i let them think so for i knewwhat they did notthat allens wife had separated from him and married again and that my taking his name could do no harm i accepted their kindness they gave me my first start in business which brought me here it was not much of a deceit she continued with a slight tremble of her pretty lip to prefer to pass as the widow of a dead desperado than to be known as the divorced wife of a living convict it has hurt no one and it has saved me just now  you were right no one could blame you said blair eagerly seizing her hand  but she disengaged it gently and went on  and now you wonder why i gave him a meeting here  i wonder at nothing but your courage and patience in all this suffering said blair fervently and at your forgiving me for so cruelly misunderstanding you  but you must learn all when i first saw macglowrie under his assumed name i fainted for i was terrified and believed he knew i was here and had come to expose me even at his own risk that was why i hesitated between going away or openly defying him but it appears he was more frightened than i at finding me herehe had supposed i had changed my name after the divorce and that mrs macglowrie laurel spring was his cousins widow when he found out who i was he was eager to see me and agree upon a mutual silence while he was here he thought only of himself she added scornfully and colonel starbottles recognition of him that night as the convicted swindler was enough to put him to flight  and the colonel never suspected that you were his wife said blair  never he supposed from the name that he was some relation of my husband and that was why he refused to tell itfor my sake the colonel is an old fogyand pompousbut a gentlemanas good as they make them  a slightly jealous uneasiness and a greater sense of shame came over blair  i seem to have been the only one who suspected and did not aid you he said sadly and yet god knows  the widow had put up her slim hand in halfsmiling halfpathetic interruption  wait i have not told you everything when i took over the responsibility of being allen macglowries widow i had to take over her relations and her history as i gathered it from the frontiersmen i never frightened any grizzlyi never jabbed anybody with the scissors it was she who did it i never was among the injinsi never had any fighting relations my paw was a plain farmer i was only a peaceful blue grass girlthere i never thought there was any harm in it it seemed to keep the men off and leave me freeuntil i knew you and you know i didnt want you to believe itdont you  she hid her flushed face and dimples in her handkerchief  but did you never think there might be another way to keep the men off and sink the name of macglowrie forever said blair in a lower voice  i think we must be going back now said the widow timidly withdrawing her hand which blair had again mysteriously got possession of in her confusion  but wait just a few minutes longer to keep me company said blair pleadingly i came here to see a patient and as there must have been some mistake in the messagei must try to discover it  oh is that all said the widow quickly whyshe flushed again and laughed faintlywell i am that patient i wanted to see you alone to explain everything and i could think of no other way im afraid ive got into the habit of thinking nothing of being somebody else  i wish you would let me select who you should be said the doctor boldly  we really must go backto the horses said the widow  agreedif we will ride home together  they did and before the year was over although they both remained the name of macglowrie had passed out of laurel spring      a ward of colonel starbottles   the kernel seems a little off color today said the barkeeper as he replaced the whiskey decanter and gazed reflectively after the departing figure of colonel starbottle  i didnt notice anything said a bystander he passed the time o day civil enough to me  oh hes allus polite enough to strangers and wimmin folk even when he is that way its only his old chums or them ez like to be thought so that hes peppery with why ez to that after hed had that quoll with his old partner judge pratt in one o them spells i saw him the next minit go half a block out of his way to direct an entire stranger and ez for wimminwell i reckon if hed just got a head drawn on a man and a woman spoke to him hed drop his battery and take off his hat to her noye cant judge by that  and perhaps in his larger experience the barkeeper was right he might have added too that the colonel in his general outward bearing and jauntiness gave no indication of his internal irritation yet he was undoubtedly in one of his spells suffering from a moody cynicism which made him as susceptible of affront as he was dangerous in resentment  luckily on this particular morning he reached his office and entered his private room without any serious rencontre here he opened his desk and arranging his papers he at once set to work with grim persistency he had not been occupied for many minutes before the door opened to mr pyecroftone of a firm of attorneys who undertook the colonels office work  i see you are early to work colonel said mr pyecroft cheerfully  you see sir said the colonel correcting him with a slow deliberation that boded no goodyou see a southern gentlemanblank itwho has stood at the head of his profession for thirtyfive years obliged to work like a blank nigger sir in the dirty squabbles of psalmsinging yankee traders instead oferattending to the affairs oferlegislation  but you manage to get pretty good fees out of itcolonel continued pyecroft with a laugh  fees sir filthy shekels and barely enough to satisfy a debt of honor with one hand and wipe out a tavern score for the entertainment ofera few lady friends with the other  this allusion to his losses at poker as well as an oyster supper given to the two principal actresses of the north star troupe then performing in the town convinced mr pyecroft that the colonel was in one of his moods and he changed the subject  that reminds me of a little joke that happened in sacramento last week you remember dick stannard who died a year agoone of your friends  i have yet to learn interrupted the colonel with the same deadly deliberation what right heor anybodyhad to intimate that he held such a relationship with me am i to understand sir that heerpublicly boasted of it  dont know resumed pyecroft hastily but it dont matter for if he wasnt a friend it only makes the joke bigger well his widow didnt survive him long but died in the states tother day leavin the property in sacramentoworth about three thousand dollarsto her little girl who is at school at santa clara the question of guardianship came up and it appears that the widowwho only knew you through her husbandhad some time before her death mentioned your name in that connection he he  what said colonel starbottle starting up  hold on said pyecroft hilariously that isnt all neither the executors nor the probate judge knew you from adam and the sacramento bar scenting a good joke lay low and said nothing then the old fool judge said that as you appeared to be a lawyer a man of mature years and a friend of the family you were an eminently fit person and ought to be communicated withyou know his hifalutin style nobody says anything so that the next thing youll know youll get a letter from that executor asking you to look after that kid ha ha the boys said they could fancy they saw you trotting around with a ten year old girl holding on to your hand and the senorita dolores or miss bellamont looking on or your being called away from a poker deal some night by the infant singing gardy dear gardy come home with me now the clock in the steeple strikes one and think of that old fool judge not knowing you ha ha  a study of colonel starbottles face during this speech would have puzzled a better physiognomist than mr pyecroft his first look of astonishment gave way to an empurpled confusion from which a single short silenuslike chuckle escaped but this quickly changed again into a dull coppery indignation and as pyecrofts laugh continued faded out into a sallow rigidity in which his murky eyes alone seemed to keep what was left of his previous high color but what was more singular in spite of his enforced calm something of his habitual oldfashioned loftiness and oratorical exaltation appeared to be returning to him as he placed his hand on his inflated breast and faced pyceroft  the ignorance of the executor of mrs stannard and theerprobate judge he began slowly may be pardonable mr pyecroft since his honor would imply that although unknown to him personally i am at least amicus curiae in this question oferguardianship but i am grievedindeed i may say shockedmr pyecroft that theerlast sacred trust of a dying widowperhaps the holiest trust that can be conceived by manthe care and welfare of her helpless orphaned girlshould be made the subject of mirth sir by yourself and the members of the sacramento bar i shall not allude sir to my own feelings in regard to dick stannard one of my most cherished friends continued the colonel in a voice charged with emotion but i can conceive of no nobler trust laid upon the altar of friendship than the care and guidance of his orphaned girl and if as you tell me the utterly inadequate sum of three thousand dollars is all that is left for her maintenance through life the selection of a guardian sufficiently devoted to the family to be willing to augment that pittance out of his own means from time to time would seem to be most important  before the astounded pyecroft could recover himself colonel starbottle leaned back in his chair half closing his eyes and abandoned himself quite after his old manner to one of his dreamy reminiscences  poor dick stannard i have a vivid recollection sir of driving out with him on the shell road at new orleans in 54 and of his saying starthe only man sir who ever abbreviated my namestar if anything happens to me or her look after our child it was during that very drive sir that through his incautious neglect to fortify himself against the swampy malaria by a glass of straight bourbon with a pinch of bark in it he caught that fever which undermined his constitution thank you mr pyecroft forerrecalling the circumstance i shall continued the colonel suddenly abandoning reminiscence sitting up and arranging his papers look forward with great interest toerletter from the executor  the next day it was universally understood that colonel starbottle had been appointed guardian of pansy stannard by the probate judge of sacramento   there are of record two distinct accounts of colonel starbottles first meeting with his ward after his appointment as her guardian one given by himself varying slightly at times but always bearing unvarying compliment to the grace beauty and singular accomplishments of this apparently gifted child was nevertheless characterized more by vague dreamy reminiscences of the departed parents than by any personal experience of the daughter  i found the young lady sir he remarked to mr pyecroft recalling my cherished friend stannard inerform and features andalthougherpersonally unacquainted with her deceased motherwho belonged sir to one of the first families of virginiai am told that she iserremarkably like her miss stannard is at present a

present at one of the school exercises i had the opportunity of testifying to her excellence inershort address i made to the young ladies from such glittering but unsatisfying generalities as these i prefer to turn to the real interview gathered from contemporary witnesses  it was the usual cloudless dazzling californian summer day tempered with the asperity of the northwest trades that miss tish looking through her window towards the roseembowered gateway of the seminary saw an extraordinary figure advancing up the avenue it was that of a man slightly past middle age yet erect and jaunty whose costume recalled the early watercolor portraits of her own youthful days his tightly buttoned blue frock coat with gilt buttons was opened far enough across the chest to allow the expanding of a frilled shirt black stock and nankeen waistcoat and his immaculate white trousers were smartly strapped over his smart varnished boots a white bellcrowned hat carried in his hand to permit the wiping of his forehead with a silk handkerchief and a goldheaded walking stick hooked over his arm completed this singular equipment he was followed a few paces in the rear by a negro carrying an enormous bouquet and a number of small boxes and parcels tied up with ribbons as the figure paused before the door miss tish gasped and cast a quick restraining glance around the classroom but it was too late a dozen pairs of blue black round inquiring or mischievous eyes were already dancing and gloating over the bizarre stranger through the window  a cirkissor nigger minstrelssure as youre born said mary frost aged nine in a fierce whisper  noa agent from the emporium with samples returned miss briggs aged fourteen  young ladies attend to your studies said miss tish as the servant brought in a card miss tish glanced at it with some nervousness and read to herself colonel culpeper starbottle engraved in script and below it in pencil to see miss pansy stannard under favor of miss tish rising with some perturbation miss tish hurriedly intrusted the class to an assistant and descended to the reception room she had never seen pansys guardian before the executor had brought the child and this extraordinary creature whose visit she could not deny might be ruinous to school discipline it was therefore with an extra degree of frigidity of demeanor that she threw open the door of the reception room and entered majestically but to her utter astonishment the colonel met her with a bow so stately so ceremonious and so commanding that she stopped disarmed and speechless  i need not ask if i am addressing miss tish said the colonel loftily for without having the pleasure oferprevious acquaintance i can at once recognize theerlady superior anderchatelaine of thiserestablishment miss tish here gave way to a slight cough and an embarrassed curtsy as the colonel with a wave of his white hand towards the burden carried by his follower resumed more lightly i have broughterfew trifles and gewgaws for my wardsubject of course to your rules and discretion they include someerdainties free from any deleterious substance as i am informeda sasha ribbon or two for the hair gloves mittens and a nosegayfrom which i trust it will be her pleasure as it is my own to invite you to cull such blossoms as may suit your taste boy you may set them down and retire  at the present moment stammered miss tish miss stannard is engaged on her lessons butshe stopped again hopelessly  i see said the colonel with an air of playful poetical reminiscenceher lessons certainly       we willergo to our places      with smiles on our faces      and say all our lessons distinctly and slow  certainly not for worlds would i interrupt them until they are done we willerwalk through the classrooms and inspect  no no interrupted the horrified principal with a dreadful presentiment of the appalling effect of the colonels entry upon the class nothat isi meanour rules excludeexcept on days of public examination  say no more my dear madam said the colonel politely until she is free i will stroll outside througherthe groves of the academus  but miss tish equally alarmed at the diversion this would create at the classroom windows recalled herself with an effort please wait here a moment she said hurriedly i will bring her down and before the colonel could politely open the door for her she had fled  happily unconscious of the sensation he had caused colonel starbottle seated himself on the sofa his white hands resting easily on the goldheaded cane once or twice the door behind him opened and closed quietly scarcely disturbing him or again opened more ostentatiously to the words oh excuse please and the brief glimpse of a flaxen braid or a black curly headto all of which the colonel nodded politelyeven rising later to the apparition of a taller demure young ladyand her more affected really i beg your pardon the only result of this evident curiosity was slightly to change the colonels attitude so as to enable him to put his other hand in his breast in his favorite pose but presently he was conscious of a more active movement in the hall of the sounds of scuffling of a high youthful voice saying i wont and i shant of the door opening to a momentary apparition of miss tish dragging a small hand and half of a small blackribboned arm into the room and her rapid disappearance again apparently pulled back by the little hand and arm of another and longer pause of a whispered conference outside and then the reappearance of miss tish majestically reinforced and supported by the grim presence of her partner miss prinkwell  thiserunexpected visit began miss tishnot previously arranged by letter  which is an invariable rule of our establishment supplemented miss prinkwell  and the fact that you are personally unknown to us continued miss tish  an ignorance shared by the child who exhibits a distaste for an interview interpolated miss prinkwell in a kind of antiphonal response  for which we have had no time to prepare her continued miss tish  compels us most reluctantlybut here she stopped short colonel starbottle who had risen with a deep bow at their entrance and remained standing here walked quietly towards them his usually high color had faded except from his eyes but his exalted manner was still more pronounced with a dreadful deliberation superadded  i believeeri hadthe honahto send up my kyard in his supreme moments the colonels southern accent was always in evidence i mayerbe mistakenbuterthat is my impression the colonel paused and placed his right hand statuesquely on his heart  the two women trembledmiss tish fancied the very shirt frill of the colonel was majestically erecting itselfas they stammered in one voice  yeees  that kyard contained my full namewith a request to see my wardmiss stannard continued the colonel slowly i believe that is the fact  certainly certainly gasped the women feebly  then may ierpoint out to you that i amerwaiting  although nothing could exceed the laborious simplicity and husky sweetness of the colonels utterance it appeared to demoralize utterly his two hearersmiss prinkwell seemed to fade into the pattern of the wall paper miss tish to droop submissively forward like a pink wax candle in the rays of the burning sun  we will bring her instantly a thousand pardons sir they uttered in the same breath backing towards the door  but here the unexpected intervened unnoticed by the three during the colloquy a little figure in a black dress had peeped through the door and then glided into the room it was a girl of about ten who in all candor could scarcely be called pretty although the awkward change of adolescence had not destroyed the delicate proportions of her hands and feet nor the beauty of her brown eyes these were just then round and wondering and fixed alternately on the colonel and the two women but like many other round and wondering eyes they had taken in the full meaning of the situation with a quickness the adult mind is not apt to give them credit for they saw the complete and utter subjugation of the two supreme autocrats of the school and i grieve to say they were filled with a secret and fearful joy but the casual spectator saw none of this the round and wondering eyes still rimmed with recent and recalcitrant tears only looked big and innocently shining  the relief of the two women was sudden and unaffected  oh here you are dearest at last said miss tish eagerly this is your guardian colonel starbottle come to him dear  she took the hand of the child who hung back with an odd mingling of shamefacedness and resentment of the interference when the voice of colonel starbottle in the same deadly calm deliberation said  ierwill speak with heralone  the round eyes again saw the complete collapse of authority as the two women shrank back from the voice and said hurriedly  certainly colonel starbottle perhaps it would be better and ingloriously quitted the room  but the colonels triumph left him helpless he was alone with a simple child an unprecedented unheardof situation which left him embarrassed andspeechless even his vanity was conscious that his oratorical periods his methods his very attitude were powerless here the perspiration stood out on his forehead he looked at her vaguely and essayed a feeble smile the child saw his embarrassment even as she had seen and understood his triumph and the small woman within her exulted she put her little hands on her waist and with the fingers turned downwards and outwards pressed them down her hips to her bended knees until they had forced her skirts into an egregious fullness before and behind as if she were making a curtsy and then jumped up and laughed  you did it hooray  did what said the colonel pleased yet mystified  frightened emthe two old cats frightened em outen their slippers oh jiminy never never never before was they so skeert never since school kept did they have to crawl like that they was skeert enough first when you come but just nowlordy they wasnt agoin to let you see mebut they had to had to had to and she emphasized each repetition with a skip  i believeer said the colonel blandly that ierintimated with some firmness  thats itjust it interrupted the child delightedly youyouoverdid em  what  overdid em dont you know theyre always so high and mighty kinder dont tech me my mothers an angel my fathers a kingall that sort of thing they did thisshe drew herself up in a presumable imitation of the two womens majestic entranceand then she continued youyou jest did thishere she lifted her chin and puffing out her small chest strode towards the colonel in evident simulation of his grandest manner  a short deep chuckle escaped himalthough the next moment his face became serious again but pansy in the mean time had taken possession of his coat sleeve and was rubbing her cheek against it like a young colt at which the colonel succumbed feebly and sat down on the sofa the child standing beside him leaning over and transferring her little hands to the lapels of his frock coat which she essayed to button over his chest as she looked into his murky eyes  the other girls said she began tugging at the button that you was a cirkissanother tuga nigger minstreland a third tuga agent with samplesbut that showed all they knew  ah said the colonel with exaggerated blandness anderwhat did youersay  the child smiled i said you was a stuffed donkeybut that was before i knew you i was a little skeert too but nowshe succeeded in buttoning the coat and making the colonel quite apoplecticnow i aint frightened one bitno not one tiny bit but she added after a pause unbuttoning the coat again and smoothing down the lapels between her fingers youre to keep on frightening the old catsmind never mind about the girls ill tell them  the colonel would have given worlds to be able to struggle up into an upright position with suitable oral expression not that his vanity was at all wounded by these irresponsible epithets which only excited an amused wonder but he was conscious of an embarrassed pleasure in the childs caressing familiarity and her perfect trustfulness in him touched his extravagant chivalry he ought to protect her and yet correct her in the consciousness of these duties he laid his white hand upon her head alas she lifted her arm and instantly transferred his hand and part of his arm around her neck and shoulders and comfortably snuggled against him the colonel gasped nevertheless something must be said and he began albeit somewhat crippled in delivery  theeruse of elegant and precise language byeryoung ladies cannot be too sedulously cultivated  but here the child laughed and snuggling still closer gurgled thats right give it to her when she comes down thats the style and the colonel stopped discomfited nevertheless there was a certain wholesome glow in the contact of this nestling little figure  presently he resumed tentativery i haveerbrought you a few dainties  yes said pansy i see but theyre from the wrong shop you dear old silly theyre from tomkinss and we girls just abominate his things you oughter have gone to emmonss never mind ill show you when we go out were going out arent we she said suddenly lifting her head anxiously you know its allowed and its rights to parents and guardians  certainly certainly said the colonel he knew he would feel a little less constrained in the open air  then well go now said pansy jumping up ill just run upstairs and put on my things ill say its orders from you and ill wear my new frockits longer the colonel was slightly relieved at this it had seemed to him as a guardian that there was perhaps an abnormal display of pansys black stockings you wait i wont be long  she darted to the door but reaching it suddenly stopped returned to the sofa where the colonel still sat imprinted a swift kiss on his mottled cheek and fled leaving him invested with a mingled flavor of freshly ironed muslin wintergreen lozenges and recent bread and butter he sat still for some time staring out of the window it was very quiet in the room a bumblebee blundered from the jasmine outside into the open window and snored loudly at the panes but the colonel heeded it not and remained abstracted and silent until the door opened to miss tish and pansyin her best frock and sash at which the colonel started and became erect again and courtly  i am about to take my ward out he said deliberately toertaste the air in the alameda anderview the shops we mayeralsoindulge inerslight suitable refreshmenterseed cakeorbread and butteranda dish of tea  miss tish now thoroughly subdued was delighted to grant miss stannard the half holiday permitted on such occasions she begged the colonel to suit his own pleasure and intrusted the dear child to her guardian with the greatest confidence  the colonel made a low bow and pansy demurely slipping her hand into his passed with him into the hall there was a slight rustle of vanishing skirts and pansy pressed his hand significantly when they were well outside she said in a lower voice  dont look up until were under the gymnasium windows the colonel mystified but obedient strutted on now said pansy he looked up beheld the windows aglow with bright young faces and bewildering with many handkerchiefs and clapping hands stopped and then taking off his hat acknowledged the salute with a sweeping bow pansy was delighted i knew theyd be there id already fixed em theyre just dyin to know you  the colonel felt a certain glow of pleasure ierhad already intimated aerwillingness toerinspect the classes butierunderstood that the rules  theyre sick old rules interrupted the child tish and prinkwell are the rules you say just right out that you will just overdo her  the colonel had a vague sense that he ought to correct both the spirit and language of this insurrectionary speech but pansy pulled him along and then swept him quite away with a torrent of prattle of the school of her friends of the teachers of her life and its infinitely small miseries and pleasures pansy was voluble never before had the colonel found himself relegated to the place of a passive listener nevertheless he liked it and as they passed on under the shade of the alameda with pansy alternately swinging from his hand and skipping beside him there was a vague smile of satisfaction on his face passersby turned to look after the strangely assorted pair or smiled accepting them as the colonel fancied as father and daughter an odd feeling half of pain and half of pleasure gripped at the heart of the empty and childless man  and now as they approached the more crowded thoroughfares the instinct of chivalrous protection was keen in his breast he piloted her skillfully he jauntily suited his own to her skipping step he lifted her with scrupulous politeness over obstacles strutting beside her on crowded pavements he made way for her with his swinging stick all the while too he had taken note of the easy carriage of her head and shoulders and most of all of her small slim feet and hands that to his fastidious taste betokened her race ged sir he muttered to himself shes blue grass stock all through to admiration succeeded pride with a slight touch of ownership when they went into a shop which thanks to the ingenuous pansy they did pretty often he would introduce her with a wave of the hand and the remark i amerseeking nothing today but if you will kindlyerserve my wardmiss stannard later when they went into the confectioners for refreshment and pansy frankly declared for ice cream and cream cakes instead of the dish of tea and bread and butter he had ordered in pursuance of his promise he heroically took it himselfto satisfy his honor indeed i know of no more sublime figure than colonel starbottlerising superior to a longwithstood craving for a cocktail morbidly conscious also of the ridiculousness of his appearance to any of his old associates who might see himdrinking lukewarm tea and pecking feebly at his bread and butter at a small table beside his little tyrant  and this domination of the helpless continued on their way home although miss pansy no longer talked of herself she was equally voluble in inquiry as to the colonels habits ways of life friends and acquaintances happily restricting her interrogations in regard to those of her own sex to any little girls that he knew saved by this exonerating adjective the colonel saw here a chance to indulge his postponed monitorial duty as well as his vivid imagination he accordingly drew elaborate pictures of impossible children he had knowncreatures precise in language and dress abstinent of play and confectionery devoted to lessons and duties and otherwise in pansys own words loathsome to the last degree as daughters of oldest and most cherished friends they might perhaps have excited pansys childish jealousy but for the singular fact that they had all long ago been rewarded by marriage with senators judges and generalsalso associates of the colonel this remoteness of presence somewhat marred their effect as an example and the colonel was mortified though not entirely displeased to observe that their surprising virtues did not destroy pansys voracity for sweets the recklessness of her skipping nor the freedom of her language the colonel was remorsefulbut happy  when they reached the seminary again pansy retired with her various purchases but reappeared after an interval with miss tish  i remember hesitated that lady trembling under the fascination of the colonels profound bow that you were anxious to look over the school and although it was not possible then i shall be glad to show you now through one of the classrooms  the colonel glancing at pansy was momentarily shocked by a distortion of one side of her face which seemed however to end in a wink of her innocent brown eyes but recovering himself gallantly expressed his gratitude the next moment he was ascending the stairs side by side with miss tish and had a distinct impression that he had been pinched in the calf by pansy who was following close behind  it was recess but the large classroom was quite filled with pupils many of them older and prettier girls inveigled there as it afterwards appeared by pansy in some precocious presentiment of her guardians taste the colonels apologetic yet gallant bow on entering and his erect oldfashioned elegance instantly took their delighted attention indeed all would have gone well had not miss prinkwell with the view of impressing the colonel as well as her pupils majestically introduced him as a distinguished jurist deeply interested in the cause of education as well as guardian of their fellow pupil that opportunity was not thrown away on colonel starbottle  stepping up to the desk of the astounded principal he laid the points of his fingers delicately upon it and with a preparatory inclination of his head towards her placed his other hand in his breast and with an invocatory glance at the ceiling began  it was the colonels habit at such moments to state at first with great care and precision the things that he would not say that he need not say and apparently that it was absolutely unnecessary even to allude to it was therefore not strange that the colonel informed them that he need not say that he counted his present privilege among the highest that had been granted him for besides the privilege of beholding the galaxy of youthful talent and excellence before him besides the privilege of being surrounded by a garland of the blossoms of the school in all their freshness and beauty it was well understood that he had the greater privilege oferstanding in loco parentis to one of these blossoms it was not for him to allude to the high trust imposed upon him byerdeceased and cherished friend and daughter of one of the first families of virginia by the side of one who must feel that she was the recipient of trusts equally supreme here the colonel paused and statuesquely regarded the alarmed miss prinkwell as if he were in doubt of it but he would say that it should be his devoted mission to champion the rights of the orphaned and innocent whenever and wherever the occasion arose against all odds and even in the face of misguided authority having left the impression that miss prinkwell contemplated an invasion of those rights the colonel became more lenient and genial he fully recognized her high and noble office he saw in her the worthy successor of those two famous instructresses of athensthose greek ladieserwhose names had escaped his memory but whicherno doubt miss prinkwell would be glad to recall to her pupils with some account of their lives miss prinkwell colored she had never heard of them before and even the delight of the class in the colonels triumph was a little dampened by this prospect of hearing more about them but the colonel was only too content with seeing before him these bright and beautiful faces destined as he firmly believed in after years to lend their charm and effulgence to the highest places as the happy helpmeets of the greatest in the land he waserleaving aerslight testimonial of his regard in the form of someerinnocent refreshments in the hands of his ward who woulderact aserhis proxy in their distribution and the colonel sat down to the flutter of handkerchiefs an applause only half restrained and the utter demoralization of miss prinkwell  but the time of his departure had come by this time and he was too experienced a public man to risk the possibility of an anticlimax by protracting his leavetaking and in an ominous shining of pansys big eyes as the time approached he felt an embarrassment as perplexing as the odd presentiment of loneliness that was creeping over him but with an elaborate caution as to the dangers of selfindulgence and the private bestowal of a large gold piece slipped into her hand a promise to come again soon and an exaction that she would write to him often the colonel received in return a wet kiss a great deal of wet cheek pressed against his own and a momentary tender clinging like that which attends the pulling up of some small flower as he passed out into the porch in the hall on the landing above him there was a close packing of brief skirts against the railing and a voice apparently proceeding from a pair of very small mottled legs protruding through the balusters said distinctly free cheers for ternel tarbottle and to this benediction the colonel hat in hand passed out of this eden into the world again   the colonels next visit to the seminary did not produce the same sensation as the first although it was accompanied with equal disturbance to the fair principals had he been a less conceited man he might have noticed that their antagonism although held in restraint by their wholesome fear of him was in danger of becoming more a conviction than a mere suspicion he was made aware of it through pansys resentment towards them and her revelation of a certain inquisition that she had been subjected to in regard to his occupation habits and acquaintances naturally of these things pansy knew very little but this had not prevented her from saying a great deal there had been enough in her questioners manner to make her suspect that her guardian was being attacked and to his defense she brought the mendacity and imagination of a clever child what she had really said did not transpire except through her own comments to the colonel and of course youve killed peoplefor youre a kernel you know here the colonel admitted as a point of fact that he had served in the mexican war and you kin preach for they heard you do it when you was here before she added confidently and of course you own niggersfor theres jim the colonel here attempted to explain that jim being in a free state was now a free man but pansy swept away such fine distinctions and youre rich you know for you gave me that tendollar gold piece all for myself so i jest gave em as good as they sentthe old spies and curiosity shops the colonel more pleased at pansys devotion than concerned over the incident itself accepted this interpretation of his character as a munificent militant priest with a smiling protest but a later incident caused him to remember it more seriously  they had taken their usual stroll through the alameda and had made the round of the shops where the colonel had exhibited his usual liberality of purchase and his exalted parental protection and so had passed on to their usual refreshment at the confectioners the usual ices and cakes for pansy but this timea concession also to the tyrant pansya glass of lemon soda and a biscuit for the colonel he was coughing over his unaccustomed beverage and pansy her equanimity and volubility restored by sweets was chirruping at his side the large saloon was filling up with customersmainly ladies and children embarrassing to him as the only man present when suddenly pansys attention was diverted by another arrival it was a goodlooking young woman overdressed striking and selfconscious who with an air of one who was in the habit of challenging attention affectedly seated herself with a male companion at an empty table and began to pull off an overtight glove  my said pansy in admiring wonder aint she fine  colonel starbottle looked up abstractedly but at the first glance his face flushed redly deepened to a purple and then became gray and stern he had recognized in the garish fair one miss flora montague the western star of terpsichore and song with whom he had supped a few days before at sacramento the lady was on tour with her combination troupe  the colonel leaned over and fixed his murky eyes on pansy the room is filling up the place is stifling i musterrequest you toerhurry  there was a change in the colonels manner which the quickwitted child heeded but she had not associated it with the entrance of the strangers and as she obediently gulped down her ice she went on innocently  that fine ladys smilin and lookin over here seems to know you so does the man with her  iermust request you said the colonel with husky precision not to look that way but finish yourerrepast  his tone was so decided that the childs lips pouted but before she could speak a shadow leaned over their table it was the companion of the fine lady  dont seem to see us colonel he said with coarse familiarity laying his hand on the colonels shoulder florry wants to know whats up  the colonel rose at the touch tell her sir he said huskily but with slow deliberation that i am up and leaving this place with my ward miss stannard goodmorning he lifted pansy with infinite courtesy from her chair took her hand strolled to the counter threw down a gold piece and passing the table of the astonished fair one with an inflated breast swept with pansy out of the shop in the street he paused bidding the child go on and then finding he was not followed by the womans escort rejoined his little companion  for a few moments they walked silently side by side then pansys curiosity getting the better of her pout demanded information she had applied a childs swift logic to the scene the colonel was angry and had punished the woman for something she drew closer to his side and looking up with her big eyes said confidentially  what had she been adoing  the colonel was amazed embarrassed and speechless he was totally unprepared for the question and as unable to answer it his abrupt departure from the shop had been to evade the very truth now demanded of him only a supreme effort of mendacity was left him he wiped his brow with his handkerchief coughed and began deliberately  theerlady in question is in the habit of using a scent callederpatchouli aerperfume exceedingly distressing to me i detected it instantly on her entrance i wished to avoid itwithout further contact it isersingular but accepted fact that some people areerpeculiarly affected by odors i haderold cherished friend who alwayserfainted at the odor of jasmine and i was intimately acquainted with general bludyer whoerdropped like a shot on the presentation of a simple violet theerhabit of using such perfumes excessively in public continued the colonel looking down upon the innocent pansy and speaking in tones of deadly deliberation cannot be too greatly condemned as well as the habit oferfrequenting places of public resort in extravagant costumes witherindividuals whoerintrude upon domestic privacy i trust you will eschew such perfumes places costumes andercompanions forever andon all occasions the colonel had raised his voice to his forensic emphasis and pansy somewhat alarmed assented whether she entirely accepted the colonels explanation was another matter  the incident although not again alluded to seemed to shadow the rest of their brief afternoon holiday and the colonels manner was unmistakably graver but it seemed to the child more affectionate and thoughtful he had previously at parting submitted to be kissed by pansy with stately tolerance and an immediate resumption of his loftiest manner on this present leavetaking he laid his straight closely shaven lips on the crown of her dark head and as her small arms clipped his neck drew her closely to his side the child uttered a slight cry the colonel hurriedly put his hand to his breast her round cheek had come in contact with his derringera small weapon of beauty and precisionwhich invariably nestled also at his side in his waistcoat pocket the child laughed so did the colonel but his cheek flushed mightily   it was four months later and a turbulent night the early rains driven by a strong southwester against the upper windows of the magnolia restaurant sometimes blurred the radiance of the bright lights within and the roar of the encompassing pines at times drowned the sounds of song and laughter that rose from a private supper room even the clattering arrival and departure of the sacramento stage coach which disturbed the depths below did not affect these upper revelers for colonel starbottle jack hamlin judge beeswinger and jo wynyard assisted by mesdames montague montmorency bellefield and tinky clifford of the western star combination troupe then performing on tour were holding high jinks in the supper room the colonel had been of late moody irritable and easily upset in the words of a friend and admirer he was kam only at twelve paces  in a lull in the general tumult a chinese waiter was seen at the door vainly endeavoring to attract the attention of the colonel by signs and interjections mr hamlins quick eye first caught sight of the intruder come in confucius said jack pleasantly youre a trifle late for a regular turn but any little thing in the way of knife swallowing  lill missee to see connle waitee waitee bottom side housee interrupted the chinaman dividing his speech between jack and the colonel  what another lady this is no place for me said jack rising with finely simulated decorum  ask her up chirped tinky clifford  but at this moment the door opened against the chinaman and a small figure in a cloak and hat dripping with raindrops glided swiftly in after a moments halffrightened halfadmiring glance at the party she darted forward with a little cry and threw her wet arms round the colonel the rest of the company arrested in their festivity gasped with vague and smiling wonder the colonel became purple and gasped but only for a moment the next instant he was on his legs holding the child with one hand while with the other he described a stately sweep of the table  my wardmiss pansy stannard he said with husky brevity but drawing the child aside he whispered quickly what has happened why are you here  but pansy childlike already diverted by the lights the table piled with delicacies the gayly dressed women and the air of festivity answered half abstractedly and as much perhaps to the curious eyes about her as to the colonels voice  i runned away  hush whispered the colonel aghast  but pansy responding again to the company rather than her guardians counsel and as if appealing to them went on half poutingly yes i runned away because they teased me because they didnt like you and said horrid things because they told awful dreadful lies because they said i wasnt no orphanthat my name wasnt stannard and that youd made it all up because they said i was a liarand you was my father  a sudden outbreak of laughter here shook the room and even drowned the storm outside again and again it rose as the colonel staggered gaspingly to his feet for an instant it seemed as if his struggles to restrain himself would end in an apoplectic fit perhaps it was for this reason that jack hamlin checked his own light laugh and became alert and grave yet the next moment colonel starbottle went as suddenly dead white as leaning over the table he said huskily but deliberately i must request the ladies present to withdraw  dont mind us colonel said judge beeswinger its all in the family here you know and now i look at the girlhang it all she does favor you old man ha ha  and as for the ladies said wynyard with a weak vinous laugh unless any of em is inclined to take the matter as personaleh  stop roared the colonel  there was no mistaking his voice nor his intent now the two men insulted and instantly sobered were silent mr hamlin rose playfully but determinedly tapped his fair companions on the shoulders saying run away and play girls actually bundled them giggling and protesting from the room closed the door and stood with his back against it then it was seen that the colonel still very white was holding the child by the hand as she shrank back wonderingly and a little frightened against him  i thank you mr hamlin said the colonel in a lower voiceyet with a slight touch of his habitual stateliness in it for being here to bear witness in the presence of this child to my unqualified statement that a more foul vile and iniquitous falsehood never was uttered than that which has been poured into her innocent ears he paused walked to the door still holding her hand and as mr hamlin stepped aside opened it told her to await him in the public parlor closed the door again and once more faced the two men and he continued more deliberately for the infamous jests that you judge beeswinger and you mr wynyard have dared to pass in her presence and mine i shall expect from each of you the fullest satisfactionpersonal satisfaction my seconds will wait on you in the morning  the two men stood up soberedyet belligerent  as you like sir said beeswinger flashing  the sooner the better for me added wynyard curtly  they passed the unruffled jack hamlin with a smile and a vaguely significant air as if calling him as a witness to the colonels madness and strode out of the room  as the door closed behind them mr hamlin lightly settled his white waistcoat and with his hands on his hips lounged towards the colonel and then he said quietly  eh said the colonel  after youve shot one or both of these men or one of em has knocked you out whats to become of that child  ifi amerspared sir said the colonel huskily i shall continue to defend heragainst calumny and sneers  in this style eh after her life has been made a hell by her association with a man of your reputation you propose to whitewash it by a quarrel with a couple of drunken scallawags like beeswinger and wynyard in the presence of three painted trollops and a dd scamp like myself do you suppose this wont be blown all over california before she can be sent back to school do you suppose those cackling hussies in the next room wont give the whole story away to the next man who stands treat a fine contempt for the sex in general was one of mr hamlins most subtle attractions for them  nevertheless sir stammered the colonel the prompt punishment of the man who has dared  punishment interrupted hamlin whos to punish the man who has dared most the one man who is responsible for the whole thing whos to punish you  mr hamlinsir gasped the colonel falling back as his hand involuntarily rose to the level of his waistcoat pocket and his derringer  but mr hamlin only put down the wine glass he had lifted from the table and was delicately twirling between his fingers and looked fixedly at the colonel  look here he said slowly when the boys said that you accepted the guardianship of that child not on account of dick stannard but only as a bluff against the joke theyd set up at you i didnt believe them when these men and women tonight tumbled to that story of the child being yours i didnt believe that when it was said by others that you were serious about making her your ward and giving her your property because you doted on her like a father i didnt believe that  andwhy not that said the colonel quickly yet with an odd tremor in his voice  because said hamlin becoming suddenly as grave as the colonel i could not believe that any one who cared a picayune for the child could undertake a trust that might bring her into contact with a life and company as rotten as ours i could not believe that even the most godforsaken conceited fool would for the sake of a little sentimental parade and splurge among people outside his regular walk allow the prospects of that child to be blasted i couldnt believe it even if he thought he was acting like a father i didnt believe itbut im beginning to believe it now  there was little to choose between the attitudes and expressions of the two set stern faces now regarding each other silently a foot apart but the colonel was the first to speak  mr hamlinsir you said a moment ago that i waserahemresponsible for this evenings affairbut you expressed a doubt as to who coulderpunish me for it i accept the responsibility you have indicated sir and offer you that chance but as this matter between us must have precedence overmy engagements with that canaille i shall expect you with your seconds at sunrise on burnt ridge goodevening sir  with head erect the colonel left the room mr hamlin slightly shrugged his shoulders turned to the door of the room whither he had just banished the ladies and in a few minutes his voice was heard melodiously among the gayest  for all that he managed to get them away early when he had bundled them into a large carryall and watched them drive away through the storm he returned for a minute to the waiting room for his overcoat he was surprised to hear the sound of the childs voice in the supper room and the door being ajar he could see quite distinctly that she was seated at the table with a plate full of sweets before her while colonel starbottle with his back to the door was sitting opposite to her his shoulders slightly bowed as he eagerly watched her it seemed to mr hamlin that it was the close of an emotional interview for pansys voice was broken partly by sobs and partly i grieve to say by the hurried swallowing of the delicacies before her yet above the beating of the storm outside he could hear her saying  yes i promise to be goodsoband to go with mrs pyecroftsoband to try to like another guardiansoband not to cry any moresobandoh please dont you do it either  but here mr hamlin slipped out of the room and out of the house with a rather grave face an hour later when the colonel drove up to the pyecrofts door with pansy he found that mr pyecroft was slightly embarrassed and a figure which in the darkness seemed to resemble mr hamlins had just emerged from the door as he entered  yet the sun was not up on burnt ridge earlier than mr hamlin the storm of the night before had blown itself out a few shreds of mist hung in the valleys from the ridge that lay above coldly reddening then a breeze swept over it and out of the dissipating mist fringe mr hamlin saw two black figures closely buttoned up like himself emerge which he recognized as beeswinger and wynyard followed by their seconds but the colonel came not hamlin joined the others in an animated confidential conversation attended by a watchful outlook for the missing adversary five ten minutes elapsed and yet the usually prompt colonel was not there mr hamlin looked grave wynyard and beeswinger exchanged interrogatory glances then a buggy was seen driving furiously up the grade and from it leaped colonel starbottle accompanied by dick mackinstry his second carrying his pistol case and thenstrangely enough for men who were waiting the coming of an antagonist who was a dead shotthey drew a breath of relief  mackinstry slightly preceded his principal and the others could see that starbottle though erect was walking slowly they were surprised also to observe that he was haggard and hollow eyed and seemed in the few hours that had elapsed since they last saw him to have aged ten years mackinstry a tall kentuckian saluted and was the first one to speak  colonel starbottle he said formally desires to express his regrets at this delay which was unavoidable as he was obliged to attend his ward who was leaving by the down coach for sacramento with mrs pyecroft this morning hamlin wynyard and beeswinger exchanged glances colonel starbottle continued mackinstry turning to his principal desires to say a word to mr hamlin  as mr hamlin would have advanced from the group colonel starbottle lifted his hand deprecatingly what i have to say must be said before these gentlemen he began slowly mr hamlinsir when i solicited the honor of this meeting i was under a grievous misapprehension of the intent and purpose of your comments on my action last evening i think he added slightly inflating his buttonedup figure that the reputation i have always borne inermeetings of this kind will prevent anyermisunderstanding of my present actionwhich is toerask permission to withdraw my challengeand to humbly beg your pardon  the astonishment produced by this unexpected apology and mr hamlins prompt grasp of the colonels hand had scarcely passed before the colonel drew himself up again and turning to his second said and now i am at the service of judge beeswinger and mr wynyardwhichever may elect to honor me first  but the two men thus addressed looked for a moment strangely foolish and embarrassed yet the awkwardness was at last broken by judge beeswinger frankly advancing towards the colonel with an outstretched hand we came here only to apologize colonel starbottle without possessing your reputation and experience in these matters we still think we can claim as you have an equal exemption from any misunderstanding when we say that we deeply regret our foolish and discourteous conduct last evening  a quick flush mounted to the colonels haggard cheek as he drew back with a suspicious glance at hamlin  mr hamlingentlemenif this iser  but before he could finish his sentence hamlin had clapped his hand on the colonels shoulder youll take my word colonel that these gentlemen honestly intended to apologize and came here for that purposeandso did ionly you anticipated me  in the laughter that followed mr hamlins frankness the colonels features relaxed grimly and he shook the hands of his late possible antagonists  and now said mr hamlin gayly youll all adjourn to breakfast with meand try to make up for the supper we left unfinished last night  it was the only allusion to that interruption and its consequences for during the breakfast the colonel said nothing in regard to his ward and the other guests were discreetly reticent but mr hamlin was not satisfied he managed to get the colonels servant jim aside and extracted from the negro that colonel starbottle had taken the child that night to pyecrofts that he had had a long interview with pyecroft had written letters and walked de flo all night that he jim was glad the child was gone  why asked hamlin with affected carelessness  she was just makin de kernel like any o de lowdown nothn folkskeerful and stingy and mighty fraid o de opinions o de biggety people and fo what jess to strut round wid dat child like he was her spectable go to meeting fader  and was the child sorry to leave him asked hamlin  wullno sah de mighty curos thing marse jack about the galsbig and littleis dey just use de kerneldats all dey just use de ole man like a pole to bring down deir persimmonssee  but mr hamlin did not smile  later it was known that colonel starbottle had resigned his guardianship with the consent of the court whether he ever again saw his late ward was not known nor if he remained loyal to his memories of her  readers of these chronicles may however remember that years after when the colonel married the widow of a certain mr tretherick both in his courtship and his short married life he was singularly indifferent to the childish graces of carrie tretherick her beloved little daughter and that his obtuseness in that respect provoked the widows ire      prospers old mother   its all very well said joe wynbrook for us to be sittin here slingin lies easy and comfortable with the wind whistlin in the pines outside and the rain just liftin the ditches to fill our sluice boxes with gold ez were smokin and waitin but i tell you what boysit aint home no sir it aint home  the speaker paused glanced around the bright comfortable barroom the shining array of glasses beyond and the circle of complacent faces fronting the stove on which his own boots were cheerfully steaming lifted a glass of whiskey from the floor under his chair and in spite of his deprecating remark took a long draught of the spirits with every symptom of satisfaction  if ye mean returned cyrus brewster that it aint the old farmhouse of our boyhood way back in the woods ill agree with you but yell just remember that there wasnt any gold placers lying round on the medder on that farm not much ef thar had been we wouldnt have left it  i dont mean that said joe wynbrook settling himself comfortably back in his chair its the family hearth im talkin of the soothin influence ye knowthe tidiness of the women folks  ez to the soothin influence remarked the barkeeper leaning his elbows meditatively on his counter afore i struck these diggins i had a grocery and bar way back in mizzoori where there was five oldfashioned farms jined blame my skin ef the men folks werent a darned sight oftener over in my grocery sittin on barrils and histin in their reglar cornjuice than ever any of you be herewith all these modern improvements  ye dont catch on any of you returned wynbrook impatiently ef it was a mere matter o buildin houses and becomin family men i reckon that this yer camp is about prosperous enough to do it and able to get gals enough to marry us but that would be only borryin trouble and lettin loose a lot of jabberin women to gossip agin each other and spile all our friendships no gentlemen what we want hereeach of usis a good old mother nothin newfangled or fancy but the reglar oldfashioned mother we was used to when we was boys  the speaker struck a wellworn chordrather the worse for wear and one that had jangled falsely ere now but which still produced its effect the men were silent thus encouraged wynbrook proceeded  think o comin home from the gulch a night like this and findin yer old mother awaitin ye no fumblin around for the matches yed left in the gulch no high old cussin because the wood was wet or you forgot to bring it in no bustlin around for your dry things and findin you forgot to dry em that morninbut everything waitin for ye and ready and then mebbe she brings ye in some doughnuts shes just cooked for yecooked ez only she kin cook em take prossy riggsalongside of me herefor instance hes made the biggest strike yet and is puttin up a hightoned house on the hill well hell hev it finished off and furnished slapup style you bet with a chinese cook and a biddy and a mexican vaquero to look after his horsebut he wont have no mother to housekeep that is he corrected himself perfunctorily turning to his companion youve never spoke o your mother so i reckon youre about fixed up like us  the young man thus addressed flushed slightly and then nodded his head with a sheepish smile he had however listened to the conversation with an interest almost childish and a reverent admiration of his comradesqualities which combined with an intellect not particularly brilliant made him alternately the butt and the favorite of the camp indeed he was supposed to possess that proportion of stupidity and inexperience which in mining superstition gives luck to its possessor and this had been singularly proven in the fact that he had made the biggest strike of the season  joe wynbrooks sentimentalism albeit only argumentative and half serious had unwittingly touched a chord of simple history and the flush which had risen to his cheek was not entirely bashfulness the home and relationship of which they spoke so glibly he had never known he was a foundling as he lay awake that night he remembered the charitable institution which had protected his infancy the master to whom he had later been apprenticed that was all he knew of his childhood in his simple way he had been greatly impressed by the strange value placed by his companions upon the family influence and he had received their extravagance with perfect credulity in his absolute ignorance and his lack of humor he had detected no false quality in their sentiment and a vague sense of his responsibility as one who had been the luckiest and who was building the first house in the camp troubled him he lay staringly wide awake hearing the mountain wind and feeling warm puffs of it on his face through the crevices of the log cabin as he thought of the new house on the hill that was to be lathed and plastered and clapboarded and yet void and vacant of that mysterious mother and then out of the solitude and darkness a tremendous idea struck him that made him sit up in his bunk  a day or two later prossy riggs stood on a sandblown windswept suburb of san francisco before a large building whom forbidding exterior proclaimed that it was an institution of formal charity it was in fact a refuge for the various waifs and strays of illadvised or hopeless immigration as prosper paused before the door certain told recollections of a similar refuge were creeping over him and oddly enough he felt as embarrassed as if he had been seeking relief for himself the perspiration stood out on his forehead as he entered the room of the manager  it chanced however that this official besides being a man of shrewd experience of human weakness was also kindly hearted and having after his first official scrutiny of his visitor and his resplendent watch chain assured himself that he was not seeking personal relief courteously assisted him in his stammering request  if i understand you you want some one to act as your housekeeper  thats it somebody to kinder look arter thingsand meginrally returned prosper greatly relieved  of what age continued the manager with a cautious glance at the robust youth and goodlooking simple face of prosper  i aint nowise particklerez long ez shes oldye know ye follow me oldez ofbetwixt you an me she might be my own mother  the manager smiled inwardly a certain degree of discretion was noticeable in this rustic youth you are quite right he answered gravely as yours is a mining camp where there are no other women still you dont want any one too old or decrepit there is an elderly maiden ladybut a change was transparently visible on prospers simple face and the manager paused  she oughter be kinder married you knowter be like a mother stammered prosper  oh ay i see returned the manager again illuminated by prospers unexpected wisdom  he mused for a moment there is he began tentatively a lady in reduced circumstancesnot an inmate of this house but who has received some relief from us she was the wife of a whaling captain who died some years ago and broke up her home she was not brought up to work and this with her delicate health has prevented her from seeking active employment as you dont seem to require that of her but rather want an overseer and as your purpose i gather is somewhat philanthropical you might induce her to accept a home with you having seen better days she is rather particular he added with a shrewd smile  simple prospers face was radiant shell have a chinaman and a biddy to help her he said quickly then recollecting the tastes of his comrades he added half apologetically half cautiously ef she could now and then throw herself into a lemming pie or a pot of doughnuts jest in a motherly kind o way it would please the boys  perhaps you can arrange that too returned the manager but i shall have to broach the whole subject to her and you had better call again tomorrow when i will give you her answer  ye kin say said prosper lightly fingering his massive gold chain and somewhat vaguely recalling the language of advertisement that she kin have the comforts of a home and no questions asked and fifty dollars a month  rejoiced at the easy progress of his plan and half inclined to believe himself a miracle of cautious diplomacy prosper two days later accompanied the manager to the cottage on telegraph hill where the relict of the late captain pottinger lamented the loss of her spouse in full view of the sea he had so often tempted on their way thither the manager imparted to prosper how according to hearsay that lamented seaman had carried into the domestic circle those severe habits of discipline which had earned for him the prefix of bully and belayingpin pottinger during his strenuous life they say that though she is very quiet and resigned she once or twice stood up to the captain but thats not a bad quality to have in a rough community as i presume yours is and would insure her respect  ushered at last into a small tanklike sitting room whose chief decorations consisted of large abelone shells dried marine algae coral and a swordfishs broken weapon prospers disturbed fancy discovered the widow sitting apparently as if among her husbands remains at the bottom of the sea she had a dejected yet somewhat ruddy face her hair was streaked with white but primly disposed over her ears like lappets and her garb was cleanly but sombre there was no doubt but that she was a lugubrious figure even to prospers optimistic and inexperienced mind he could not imagine her as beaming on his hearth it was with some alarm that after the introduction had been completed he beheld the manager take his leave as the door closed the bashful prosper felt the murky eyes of the widow fixed upon him a gentle cough accompanied with the resigned laying of a black mittened hand upon her chest suggested a genteel prelude to conversation with possible pulmonary complications  i am induced to accept your proposal temporarily she said in a voice of querulous precision on account of pressing pecuniary circumstances which would not have happened had my claim against the shipowners for my dear husbands loss been properly raised i hope you fully understand that i am unfitted both by ill health and early education from doing any menial or manual work in your household i shall simply oversee and direct i shall expect that the stipend you offer shall be paid monthly in advance and as my medical man prescribes a certain amount of stimulation for my system i shall expect to be furnished with such viandsor evenshe coughed slightlysuch beverages as may be necessary i am far from strongyet my wants are few  ez far ez i am ketchin on and followin ye maam returned prosper timidly yell hev everything ye wantjest like it was yer own home in fact he went on suddenly growing desperate as the difficulties of adjusting this unexpectedly fastidious and superior woman to his plan seemed to increase yell jest consider me ez yerbut here her murky eyes were fixed on his and he faltered yet he had gone too far to retreat ye see he stammered with a hysterical grimness that was intended to be playfulye see this is jest a little secret betwixt and between you and me therell be only you and me in the house and it would kinder seem to the boys more homelikeefefyou and me hadyou bein a widder you knowa kind ofofhere his smile became ghastlyclose relationship  the widow of captain pottinger here sat up so suddenly that she seemed to slip through her sombre and precise enwrappings with an exposure of the real mrs pottinger that was almost improper her high color deepened the pupils of her black eyes contracted in the light the innocent prosper had poured into them leaning forward with her fingers clasped on her bosom she said did you tell this to the manager  of course not said prosper ye see its only a matter twixt you and me  mrs pottinger looked at prosper drew a deep breath and then gazed at the abelone shells for moral support a smile half querulous half superior crossed her face as she said this is very abrupt and unusual there is of course a disparity in our ages you have never seen me beforeat least to my knowledgealthough you may have heard of me the spraggs of marblehead are well knownperhaps better than the pottingers and yet mr griggs  riggs suggested prosper hurriedly  riggs excuse me i was thinking of young lieutenant griggs of the navy whom i knew in the days now past mr riggs i should say then you want me to  to be my old mother maam said prosper tremblingly that is to pretend and look ez ef you was you see i havent any but i thought it would be nice for the boys and make it more like home in my new house ef i allowed that my old mother would be comin to live with me they dont know i never had a mother to speak of theyll never find it out say ye will mrs pottinger do  and here the unexpected occurred against all conventional rules and all accepted traditions of fiction i am obliged to state that mrs pottinger did not rise up and order the trembling prosper to leave the house she only gripped the arm of her chair a little tighter leaned forward and disdaining her usual precision and refinement of speech said quietly its a bargain if thats what youre wanting my son you can count upon me as becoming your old mother cecilia jane pottinger riggs every time  a few days later the sentimentalist joe wynbrook walked into the wild cat saloon where his comrades were drinking and laid a letter down on the bar with every expression of astonishment and disgust look he said if that dont beat all ye wouldnt believe it but heres prossy riggs writin that he came across his motherhis mother gentlemenin frisco she hevin unbeknownst to him joined a party visiting the coast and what does this blamed fool do why hes goin to bring herthat old womanhere heregentlemento take charge of that new houseand spoil our fun and the godforsaken idiot thinks that well like it  it was one of those rare mornings in the rainy season when there was a suspicion of spring in the air and after a night of rainfall the sun broke through fleecy clouds with little islets of blue skywhen prosper riggs and his mother drove into wild cat camp an expression of cheerfulness was on the faces of his old comrades for it had been recognized that after all prossy had a perfect right to bring his old mother therehis wellknown youth and inexperience preventing this baleful performance from being established as a precedent for these reasons hats were cheerfully doffed and some jackets put on as the buggy swept up the hill to the pretty new cottage with its green blinds and white veranda on the crest  yet i am afraid that prosper was not perfectly happy even in the triumphant consummation of his plans mrs pottingers sudden and businesslike acquiescence in it and her singular lapse from her genteel precision were gratifying but startling to his ingenuousness and although from the moment she accepted the situation she was fertile in resources and full of precaution against any possibility of detection he saw with some uneasiness that its control had passed out of his hands  you say your comrades know nothing of your family history she had said to him on the journey thither what are you going to tell them  nothin cept your bein my old mother said prosper hopelessly  thats not enough my son another embarrassment to prosper was her easy grasp of the maternal epithets now listen you were born just six months after your father captain riggs formerly pottinger sailed on his first voyage you remember very little of him of course as he was away so much  hadnt i better know suthin about his looks said prosper submissively  a tall dark man thats enough responded mrs pottinger sharply  hadnt he better favor me said prosper with his small cunning recognizing the fact that he himself was a decided blond  aint at all necessary said the widow firmly you were always wild and ungovernable she continued and ran away from school to join some western emigration that accounts for the difference of our styles  but continued prosper i oughter remember suthin about our old timesrunnin arrants for you and bringin in the wood o frosty mornins and you givin me hot doughnuts suggested prosper dubiously  nothing of the sort said mrs pottinger promptly we lived in the city with plenty of servants just remember prosper dear your mother wasnt that lowdown country style  glad to be relieved from further invention prosper was nevertheless somewhat concerned at this shattering of the ideal mother in the very camp that had sung her praises but he could only trust to her recognizing the situation with her usual sagacity of which he stood in respectful awe  joe wynbrook and cyrus brewster had as older members of the camp purposely lingered near the new house to offer any assistance to prossy and his mother and had received a brief and passing introduction to the latter so deep and unexpected was the impression she made upon them that these two oracles of the camp retired down the hill in awkward silence for some time neither daring to risk his reputation by comment or oversurprise  but when they approached the curious crowd below awaiting them cyrus brewster ventured to say struck me ez ef that old gal was rather hightoned for prossys mother  joe wynbrook instantly seized the fatal admission to show the advantage of superior insight  struck you why it was no more than i expected all along what did we know of prossy nothin what did he ever tell us nothin and why cos it was his secret lord a blind mule could see that all this foolishness and simplicity o his come o his bein cuddled and pampered as a baby then like ez not he was either kidnapped or led away by some fellerand nearly broke his mothers heart ill bet my bottom dollar he has been advertised for afore thisonly we didnt see the paper like as not they had agents out seekin him and he jest ran into their hands in frisco i had a kind o presentiment o this when he left though i never let on anything  i reckon too that shes kinder afraid hell bolt agin did ye notice how she kept watchin him all the time and how she did the bossin o everything and theres one thing sure hes changedyes he dont look as keerless and free and foolish ez he uster  here there was an unmistakable chorus of assent from the crowd that had joined them every oneeven those who had not been introduced to the motherhad noticed his strange restraint and reticence in the impulsive logic of the camp conduct such as this in the face of that superior womanhis mothercould only imply that her presence was distasteful to him that he was either ashamed of their noticing his inferiority to her or ashamed of them wild and hasty as was their deduction it was nevertheless voiced by joe wynbrook in a tone of impartial and even reluctant conviction well gentlemen some of ye may remember that when i heard that prossy was bringin his mother here i kickedkicked because it only stood to reason that being his mother shed be that foolish shed upset the camp there wasnt room enough for two such chuckleheadsand one of em being a woman she couldnt be shut up or sat upon ez we did to him but now gentlemen ez we see she aint that kind but hightoned and levelheaded and that shes got the grip on prossywhether he likes it or notwe aint goin to let him go back on her no sir we aint goin to let him break her heart the second time he may think we aint good enough for her but ez long ez shes civil to us well stand by her  in this conscientious way were the shackles of that unhallowed relationship slowly riveted on the unfortunate prossy in his intercourse with his comrades during the next two or three days their attitude was shown in frequent and ostentatious praise of his mother and suggestive advice such as i wouldnt stop at the saloon prossy your old mother is wantin ye or chuck that ere tarpolin over your shoulders pross and dont take your wet duds into the house that yer old mothers bin makin tidy oddly enough much of this advice was quite sincere and representedfor at least twenty minutesthe honest sentiments of the speaker prosper was touched at what seemed a revival of the sentiment under which he had acted forgot his uneasiness and became quite himself againa fact also noticed by his critics yeve only to keep him up to his work and hell be the widders joy agin said cyrus brewster certainly he was so far encouraged that he had a long conversation with mrs pottinger that night with the result that the next morning joe wynbrook cyrus brewster hank mann and kentucky ike were invited to spend the evening at the new house as the men clean shirted and decently jacketed filed into the neat sitting room with its bright carpet its cheerful fire its side table with a snowy cloth on which shining tea and coffee pots were standing their hearts thrilled with satisfaction in a large stuffed rocking chair prossys old mother wrapped up in a shawl and some mysterious ill health which seemed to forbid any exertion received them with genteel languor and an extended black mitten  i cannot said mrs pottinger with sad pensiveness offer you the hospitality of my own home gentlemenyou remember prosper dear the large salon and our staff of servants at lexington avenuebut since my son has persuaded me to take charge of his humble cot i hope you will make all allowances for its deficiencieseven she added casting a look of mild reproach on the astonished prospereven if he cannot  im sure he oughter to be thankful to ye maam said joe wynbrook quickly for makin a break to come here to live jest ez were thankfulspeakin for the rest of this campfor yer lightin us up ez youre doin i reckon im speakin for the crowd he added looking round him  murmurs of thats so and you bet passed through the company and one or two cast a halfindignant glance at prosper  its only natural continued mrs pottinger resignedly that having lived so long alone my dear prosper may at first be a little impatient of his old mothers control and perhaps regret his invitation  oh no maam said the embarrassed prosper  but here the mercurial wynbrook interposed on behalf of amity and the camps esprit de corps why lord maam hes jest bin longin for ye times and times agin hes talked about ye sayin how ef he could only get ye out of yer fifth avenue saloon to share his humble lot with him here hed die happy youve heard him talk brewster  frequent replied the accommodating brewster  part of the simple refreshment i have to offer you continued mrs pottinger ignoring further comment is a viand the exact quality of which i am not familiar with but which my son informs me is a great favorite with you it has been prepared by li sing under my direction prosper dear see that theerdoughnutsare brought in with the coffee  satisfaction beamed on the faces of the company with perhaps the sole exception of prosper as a dish containing a number of brown glistening spheres of baked dough was brought in the mens eyes shone in sympathetic appreciation yet that epicurean light was for a moment dulled as each man grasped a sphere and then sat motionless with it in his hand as if it was a ball and they were waiting the signal for playing  i am told said mrs pottinger with a glance of christian tolerance at prosper that lightness is considered desirable by someperhaps you gentlemen may find them heavy  thar is two kinds said the diplomatic joe cheerfully as he began to nibble his sideways like a squirrel light and heavy some likes em one way and some another  they were hard and heavy but the men assisted by the steaming coffee finished them with heroic politeness and now gentlemen said mrs pottinger leaning back in her chair and calmly surveying the party you have my permission to light your pipes while you partake of some whiskey and water  the guests looked upgratified but astonished are ye sure maam you dont mind it said joe politely  not at all responded mrs pottinger briefly in fact as my physician advises the inhalation of tobacco smoke for my asthmatic difficulties i will join you after a moments fumbling in a beaded bag that hung from her waist she produced a small black clay pipe filled it from the same receptacle and lit it  a thrill of surprise went round the company and it was noticed that prosper seemed equally confounded nevertheless this awkwardness was quickly overcome by the privilege and example given them and with a glass of whiskey and water before them the men were speedily at their ease nor did mrs pottinger disdain to mingle in their desultory talk sitting there with her black pipe in her mouth but still precise and superior she told a thrilling whaling adventure of prospers father drawn evidently from the experience of the lamented pottinger which not only deeply interested her hearers but momentarily exalted prosper in their minds as the son of that hero now you speak o that maam said the ingenuous wynbrook theres a good deal o prossy in that yarn o his fathers same kind o keerless grit you remember boys that day the dam broke and he stood thar the water up to his neck heavin logs in the break till he stopped it briefly the evening in spite of its initial culinary failure and its surprises was a decided social success and even the bewildered and doubting prosper went to bed relieved it was followed by many and more informal gatherings at the house and mrs pottinger so far unbentif that term could be used of one who never altered her primness of manneras to join in a game of pokerand even permitted herself to win  but by the end of six weeks another change in their feelings towards prosper seemed to creep insidiously over the camp he had been received into his former fellowship and even the presence of his mother had become familiar but he began to be an object of secret commiseration they still frequented the house but among themselves afterwards they talked in whispers there was no doubt to them that prospers old mother drank not only what her son had provided but what she surreptitiously obtained from the saloon there was the testimony of the barkeeper himself concerned equally with the camp in the integrity of the riggs household and there was an even darker suspicion but this must be given in joe wynbrooks own words  i didnt mind the old woman winnin and winnin reglarfor pokers an unsartin gameit aint the money that were losinfor its all in the camp but when shes developing a habit o holdin four aces when somebody else hez two who dont like to let on because its prospers old motherits gettin rough and dangerous too gentlemen if there happened to be an outsider in or one of the boys should kick why i saw bilson grind his teethhe holdin a sequence flushace highwhen the dear old critter laid down her reglar four aces and raked in the pile we had to nearly kick his legs off under the table afore hed understandnot havin an old mother himself  some un will hev to tackle her without prossy knowin it for it would jest break his heart arter all hes gone through to get her here said brewster significantly  onless he did know it and it was that what made him so sorrowful when they first came bgosh i never thought o that said wynbrook with one of his characteristic sudden illuminations  well gentlemen whether he did or not said the barkeeper stoutly he must never know that we know it no not if the old gal cleans out my bar and takes the last scad in the camp  and to this noble sentiment they responded as one man  how far they would have been able to carry out that heroic resolve was never known for an event occurred which eclipsed its importance one morning at breakfast mrs pottinger fixed a clouded eye upon prosper  prosper she said with fell deliberation you ought to know you have a sister  yes maam returned prosper with that meekness with which he usually received these family disclosures  a sister continued the lady whom you havent seen since you were a child a sister who for family reasons has been living with other relatives a girl of nineteen  yea maam said prosper humbly but ef you wouldnt mind writin all that down on a bit o paperye know my short memory i would get it by heart today in the gulch id have it all pat enough by night ef he added with a short sigh ye was kalkilatin to make any illusions to it when the boys are here  your sister augusta continued mrs pottinger calmly ignoring these details will be here tomorrow to make me a visit  but here the worm prosper not only turned but stood up nearly upsetting the table it cant be did maam it mustnt be did he said wildly its enough for me to have played this camp with youbut now to run in  cant be did repeated mrs pottinger rising in her turn and fixing upon the unfortunate prosper a pair of murky piratical eyes that had once quelled the searoving pottinger do you my adopted son dare to tell me that i cant have my own flesh and blood beneath my roof  yes id rather tell the whole storyid rather tell the boys i fooled themthan go on again burst out the excited prosper  but mrs pottinger only set her lips implacably together very well tell them then she said rigidly tell them how you lured me from my humble dependence in san francisco with the prospect of a home with you tell them how you compelled me to deceive their trusting hearts with your wicked falsehoods tell them how youa foundlingborrowed me for your mother my poor dead husband for your father and made me invent falsehood upon falsehood to tell them while you sat still and listened  prosper gasped  tell them she went on deliberately that when i wanted to bring my helpless child to her only homethen only thenyou determined to break your word to me either because you meanly begrudged her that share of your house or to keep your misdeeds from her knowledge tell them that prossy dear and see what theyll say  prosper sank back in his chair aghast in his sudden instinct of revolt he had forgotten the camp he knew alas too well what they would say he knew that added to their indignation at having been duped their chivalry and absurd sentiment would rise in arms against the abandonment of two helpless women  praps yere right maam he stammered i was only thinkin he added feebly how shed take it  shell take it as i wish her to take it said mrs pottinger firmly  supposin ez the camp dont know her and i aint bin talkin o havin any sister you ran her in here as my cousin see you bein her aunt  mrs pottinger regarded him with compressed lips for some time then she said slowly and half meditatively yes it might be done she will probably be willing to sacrifice her nearer relationship to save herself from passing as your sister it would be less galling to her pride and she wouldnt have to treat you so familiarly  yes maam said prosper too relieved to notice the uncomplimentary nature of the suggestion and ye see i could call her miss pottinger which would come easier to me  in its high resolve to bear with the weaknesses of prospers mother the camp received the news of the advent of prospers cousin solely with reference to its possible effect upon the aunts habits and very little other curiosity prospers own reticence they felt was probably due to the tender age at which he had separated from his relations but when it was known that prospers mother had driven to the house with a very pretty girl of eighteen there was a flutter of excitement in that impressionable community prosper with his usual shyness had evaded an early meeting with her and was even loitering irresolutely on his way home from work when as he approached the house to his discomfiture the door suddenly opened the young lady appeared and advanced directly towards him  she was slim graceful and prettily dressed and at any other moment prosper might have been impressed by her good looks but her brows were knit her dark eyesin which there was an unmistakable reminiscence of mrs pottingerwere glittering and although she was apparently anticipating their meeting it was evidently with no cousinly interest when within a few feet of him she stopped prosper with a feeble smile offered his hand she sprang back  dont touch me dont come a step nearer or ill scream  prosper still with smiling inanity stammered that he was only goin to shake hands and moved sideways towards the house  stop she said with a stamp of her slim foot stay where you are we must have our talk out here im not going to waste words with you in there before her  prosper stopped  what did you do this for she said angrily how dared you how could you are you a man or the fool she takes you for  wot did i do wot for said prosper sullenly  this making my mother pretend you were her son bringing her here among these men to live a lie  she was willin said prosper gloomily i told her what she had to do and she seemed to like it  but couldnt you see she was old and weak and wasnt responsible for her actions or were you only thinking of yourself  this last taunt stung him he looked up he was not facing a helpless dependent old woman as he had been the day before but a handsome clever girl in every way his superiorand in the right in his vague sense of honor it seemed more creditable for him to fight it out with her he burst out i never thought of myself i never had an old mother i never knew what it was to want onebut the men did and as i couldnt get one for them i got one for myselfto share and share alikei thought theyd be happier ef there was one in the camp  there was the unmistakable accent of truth in his voice there came a faint twitching of the young girls lips and the dawning of a smile but it only acted as a goad to the unfortunate prosper ye kin laugh miss pottinger but its gods truth but one thing i didnt do no when your mother wanted to bring you in here as my sister i kicked i did and you kin thank me for all your laughin that youre standing in this camp in your own nameand aint nothin but my cousin  i suppose you thought your precious friends didnt want a sister too said the girl ironically  it dont make no matter wot they want now he said gloomily for he added with sudden desperation its come to an end yes you and your mother will stay here a spell so that the boys dont suspicion nothin of either of ye then ill give it out that youre takin your aunt away on a visit then ill make over to her a thousand dollars for all the trouble ive given her and youll take her away ive bin a fool miss pottinger mebbe i am one now but what im doin is on the square and its got to be done  he looked so simple and so goodso like an honest schoolboy confessing a fault and abiding by his punishment for all his six feet of altitude and silky mustachethat miss pottinger lowered her eyes but she recovered herself and said sharply  its all very well to talk of her going away but she wont you have made her like youyes like you better than methan any of us she says youre the only one who ever treated her like a motheras a mother should be treated she says she never knew what peace and comfort were until she came to you there dont stare like that dont you understand dont you see must i tell you again that she is strangethatthat she was always queer and strangeand queerer on account of her unfortunate habitssurely you knew them mr riggs she quarreled with us all i went to live with my aunt and she took herself off to san francisco with a silly claim against my fathers shipowners heaven only knows how she managed to live there but she always impressed people with her manners and some one always helped her at last i begged my aunt to let me seek her and i tracked her here there if youve confessed everything to me you have made me confess everything to you and about my own mother too now what is to be done  whatever is agreeable to you is the same to me miss pottinger he said formally  but you mustnt call me miss pottinger so loud somebody might hear you she returned mischievously  all rightcousin then he said with a prodigious blush supposin we go in  in spite of the camps curiosity for the next few days they delicately withheld their usual evening visits to prossys mother theyll be wantin to talk o old times and we dont wanter be too previous suggested wynbrook but their verdict when they at last met the new cousin was unanimous and their praises extravagant to their inexperienced eyes she seemed to possess all her aunts gentility and precision of language with a vivacity and playfulness all her own in a few days the whole camp was in love with her yet she dispensed her favors with such tactful impartiality and with such innocent enjoymentfree from any suspicion of coquetrythat there were no heartburnings and the unlucky man who nourished a fancied slight would have been laughed at by his fellows she had a townbred girls curiosity and interest in camp life which she declared was like a perpetual picnic and her slim graceful figure halting beside a ditch where the men were working seemed to them as grateful as the new spring sunshine the whole camp became tidier a coat was considered de rigueur at prossys mother evenings there was less horseplay in the trails and less shouting its all very well to talk about old mothers said the cynical barkeeper but that gal single handed has done more in a week to make the camp decent than old maam riggs has in a month o sundays  since prospers brief conversation with miss pottinger before the house the question what is to be done had singularly lapsed nor had it been referred to again by either the young lady had apparently thrown herself into the diversions of the camp with the thoughtless gayety of a brief holiday maker and it was not for him to remind hereven had he wished tothat her important question had never been answered he had enjoyed her happiness with the relief of a secret shared by her three weeks had passed the last of the winters rains had gone spring was stirring in underbrush and wildwood in the pulse of the waters in the sap of the great pines in the uplifting of flowers small wonder if prospers boyish heart had stirred a little too  in fact he had been possessed by another luminous ideaa wild idea that to him seemed almost as absurd as the one which had brought him all this trouble it had come to him like that oneout of a starlit nightand he had risen one morning with a feverish intent to put it into action it brought him later to take an unprecedented walk alone with miss pottinger to linger under green leaves in unfrequented woods and at last seemed about to desert him as he stood in a little hollow with her hand in histheir only listener an inquisitive squirrel yet this was all the disappointed animal heard him stammer  so you see dear it would then be no liefordont you seeshed be really my mother as well as yours   the marriage of prosper riggs and miss pottinger was quietly celebrated at sacramento but prossys old mother did not return with the happy pair  of mrs pottingers later career some idea may be gathered from a letter which prosper received a year after his marriage circumstances wrote mrs pottinger which had induced me to accept the offer of a widower to take care of his motherless household have since developed into a more enduring matrimonial position so that i can always offer my dear prosper a home with his mother should he choose to visit this locality and a second father in hiram w watergates esq her husband      the convalescence of jack hamlin   the habitually quiet ascetic face of seth rivers was somewhat disturbed and his brows were knitted as he climbed the long ascent of windy hill to its summit and his own rancho perhaps it was the effect of the characteristic wind which that afternoon seemed to assault him from all points at once and did not cease its battery even at his front door but hustled him into the passage blew him into the sitting room and then celebrated its own exit from the long rambling house by the banging of doors throughout the halls and the slamming of windows in the remote distance  mrs rivers looked up from her work at this abrupt onset of her husband but without changing her own expression of slightly fatigued selfrighteousness accustomed to these elemental eruptions she laid her hands from force of habit upon the lifting tablecloth and then rose submissively to brush together the scattered embers and ashes from the large hearthstone as she had often done before  youre in early seth she said  yes i stopped at the cross roads post office lucky i did or youd hev had kempany on your hands afore you knowed itthis very night i found this letter from dr duchesne and he produced a letter from his pocket  mrs rivers looked up with an expression of worldly interest dr duchesne had brought her two children into the world with some difficulty and had skillfully attended her through a long illness consequent upon the inefficient maternity of soulful but fragile american women of her type the doctor had more than a mere local reputation as a surgeon and mrs rivers looked up to him as her sole connecting link with a world of thought beyond windy hill  hes comin up yer tonight bringin a friend of hisa patient that he wants us to board and keep for three weeks until hes well agin continued mr rivers ye know how the doctor used to rave about the pure air on our hill  mrs rivers shivered slightly and drew her shawl over her shoulders but nodded a patient assent  well he says its just what that patient oughter have to cure him hes had lung fever and other things and this yer air and ginral quiet is bound to set him up were to board and keep him without any fuss or feathers and the doctor sez hell pay liberal for it this yers what he sez concluded mr rivers reading from the letter he is now fully convalescent though weak and really requires no other medicine than theozoneyes thats what the doctor calls itof windy hill and in fact as little attendance as possible i will not let him keep even his negro servant with him hell give you no trouble if he can be prevailed upon to stay the whole time of his cure  theres our spare roomit hasnt been used since parson greenwood was here said mrs rivers reflectively melinda could put it to rights in an hour at what time will he come  hed come about nine they drive over from hightown depot but he added grimly here ye are orderin rooms to be done up and ye dont know who for  you said a friend of dr duchesne returned mrs rivers simply  dr duchesne has many friends that you and me mightnt cotton to said her husband this man is jack hamlin as his wifes remote and introspective black eyes returned only vacancy he added quickly the noted gambler  gambler echoed his wife still vaguely  yesreglar its his business  goodness seth he cant expect to do it here  no said seth quickly with that sense of fairness to his fellow man which most women find it so difficult to understand noand he probably wont mention the word card while hes here  well said mrs rivers interrogatively  and continued seth seeing that the objection was not pressed hes one of them desprit men a reglar fighter killed two or three men in dools  mrs rivers stared what could dr duchesne have been thinking of why we wouldnt be safe in the house with him  again seths sense of equity triumphed i never heard of his fightin anybody but his own kind and when he was bullyragged and ez to women hes quite tother way in fact and thats why i think ye oughter know it afore you let him come he dont go round with decent women in factbut here mr rivers in the sanctity of conjugal confidences and the fullness of bible reading used a few strong scriptural substantives happily unnecessary to repeat here  seth said mrs rivers suddenly you seem to know this man  the unexpectedness and irrelevancy of this for a moment startled seth but that chaste and godfearing man had no secrets only by hearsay jane he returned quietly but if ye say the word ill stop his comin now  its too late said mrs rivers decidedly  i reckon not returned her husband and thats why i came straight here ive only got to meet them at the depot and say this thing cant be doneand thats the end of it theyll go off quiet to the hotel  i dont like to disappoint the doctor seth said mrs rivers we might she added with a troubled look of inquiry at her husband we might take that mr hamlin on trial like as not he wont stay anyway when he sees what were like seth what do you think it would be only our christian duty too  i was thinkin o that as a professin christian jane said her husband but supposin that other christians dont look at it in that light thars deacon stubbs and his wife and the parson ye remember what he said about no covenant with sin  the stubbses have no right to dictate who ill have in my house said mrs rivers quickly with a faint flush in her rather sallow cheeks  its your say and nobody elses assented her husband with grim submissiveness you do what you like  mrs rivers mused theres only myself and melinda here she said with sublime naivete and the children aint old enough to be corrupted i am satisfied if you are seth and she again looked at him inquiringly  go ahead then and get ready for em said seth hurrying away with unaffected relief if you have everything fixed by nine oclock thatll do  mrs rivers had everything fixed by that hour including herself presumably for she had put on a gray dress which she usually wore when shopping in the county town adding a prim collar and cuffs a pearlencircled brooch the wedding gift of seth and a solitaire ring next to her wedding ring with a locket containing her childrens hair accented her position as a proper wife and mother at a quarter to nine she had finished tidying the parlor opening the harmonium so that the light might play upon its polished keyboard and bringing from the forgotten seclusion of her closet two beautifully bound volumes of tuppers poems and polloks course of time to impart a literary grace to the centre table she then drew a chair to the table and sat down before it with a religious magazine in her lap the wind roared over the deepthroated chimney the clock ticked monotonously and then there came the sound of wheels and voices  but mrs rivers was not destined to see her guest that night dr duchesne under the safe lee of the door explained that mr hamlin had been exhausted by the journey and assisted by a mild opiate was asleep in the carriage that if mrs rivers did not object they would carry him at once to his room in the flaring and guttering of candles the flashing of lanterns the flapping of coats and shawls and the bewildering rush of wind mrs rivers was only vaguely conscious of a slight figure muffled tightly in a cloak carried past her in the arms of a grizzled negro up the staircase followed by dr duchesne with the closing of the front door on the tumultuous world without a silence fell again on the little parlor  when the doctor made his reappearance it was to say that his patient was being undressed and put to bed by his negro servant who however would return with the doctor tonight but that the patient would be left with everything that was necessary and that he would require no attention from the family until the next day indeed it was better that he should remain undisturbed as the doctor confined his confidences and instructions entirely to the physical condition of their guest mrs rivers found it awkward to press other inquiries  of course she said at last hesitatingly but with a certain primness of expression mr hamlin must expect to find everything here very different from what he is accustomed toat least from what my husband says are his habits  nobody knows that better than he mrs rivers returned the doctor with an equally marked precision of manner and you could not have a guest who would be less likely to make you remind him of it  a little annoyed yet not exactly knowing why mrs rivers abandoned the subject and as the doctor shortly afterwards busied himself in the care of his patient with whom he remained until the hour of his departure she had no chance of renewing it but as he finally shook hands with his host and hostess it seemed to her that he slightly recurred to it i have the greatest hope of the curative effect of this wonderful locality on my patient but even still more of the beneficial effect of the complete change of his habits his surroundings and their influences then the door closed on the man of science and the grizzled negro servant the noise of the carriage wheels was shut out with the song of the wind in the pine tops and the rancho of windy hill possessed mr jack hamlin in peace indeed the wind was now falling as was its custom at that hour and the moon presently arose over a hushed and sleeping landscape  for the rest of the evening the silent presence in the room above affected the household the halfcurious servants and ranch hands spoke in whispers in the passages and at evening prayers in the dining room seth rivers kneeling before and bowed over a rushbottomed chair whose legs were clutched by his strong hands included the stranger within our gates in his regular supplications when the hour for retiring came seth with a candle in his hand preceded his wife up the staircase but stopped before the door of their guests room i reckon he said interrogatively to mrs rivers i oughter see ef hes wantin anythin  you heard what the doctor said returned mrs rivers cautiously at the same time she did not speak decidedly and the frontiersmans instinct of hospitality prevailed he knocked lightly there was no response he turned the door handle softly the door opened a faint clean perfumean odor of some general personality rather than any particular thingstole out upon them the light of seths candle struck a few glints from some cutglass and silver the contents of the guests dressing case which had been carefully laid out upon a small table by his negro servant there was also a refined neatness in the disposition of his clothes and effects which struck the feminine eye of even the tidy mrs rivers as something new to her experience seth drew nearer the bed with his shaded candle and then turning beckoned his wife to approach mrs rivers hesitatedbut for the necessity of silence she would have openly protestedbut that protest was shut up in her compressed lips as she came forward  for an instant that awe with which absolute helplessness invests the sleeping and dead was felt by both husband and wife only the upper part of the sleepers face was visible above the bedclothes held in position by a thin white nervous hand that was encircled at the wrist by a ruffle seth stared short brown curls were tumbled over a forehead damp with the dews of sleep and exhaustion but what appeared more singular the closed eyes of this vessel of wrath and recklessness were fringed with lashes as long and silky as a womans then mrs rivers gently pulled her husbands sleeve and they both crept back with a greater sense of intrusion and even more cautiously than they had entered nor did they speak until the door was closed softly and they were alone on the landing seth looked grimly at his wife  dont look much ez ef he could hurt anybody  he looks like a sick man returned mrs rivers calmly   the unconscious object of this criticism and attention slept until late slept through the stir of awakened life within and without through the challenge of early cocks in the leanto shed through the creaking of departing ox teams and the lazy longdrawn commands of teamsters through the regular strokes of the morning pump and the splash of water on stones through the faroff barking of dogs and the halfintelligible shouts of ranchmen slept through the sunlight on his ceiling through its slow descent of his wall and awoke with it in his eyes he woke too with a delicious sense of freedom from pain and of even drawing a long breath without difficultytwo facts so marvelous and dreamlike that he naturally closed his eyes again lest he should waken to a world of suffering and dyspnoea satisfied at last that this relief was real he again opened his eyes but upon surroundings so strange so wildly absurd and improbable that he again doubted their reality he was lying in a moderately large room primly and severely furnished but his attention was for the moment riveted to a gilt frame upon the wall beside him bearing the text god bless our home and then on another frame on the opposite wall which admonished him to watch and pray beside them hung an engraving of the raising of lazarus and a hogarthian lithograph of the drunkards progress mr hamlin closed his eyes he was dreaming certainlynot one of those wild fantastic visions that had so miserably filled the past long nights of pain and suffering but still a dream at last opening one eye stealthily he caught the flash of the sunlight upon the crystal and silver articles of his dressing case and that flash at once illuminated his memory he remembered his long weeks of illness and the devotion of dr duchesne he remembered how when the crisis was past the doctor had urged a complete change and absolute rest and had told him of a secluded rancho in some remote locality kept by an honest western pioneer whose family he had attended he remembered his own reluctant assent impelled by gratitude to the doctor and the helplessness of a sick man he now recalled the weary journey thither his exhaustion and the semiconsciousness of his arrival in a bewildering wind on a shadowy hilltop and this was the place  he shivered slightly and ducked his head under the cover again but the brightness of the sun and some exhilarating quality in the air tempted him to have another outlook avoiding as far as possible the grimly decorated walls if they had only left him his faithful servant he could have relieved himself of that mischievous badinage which always alternately horrified and delighted that devoted negro but he was aloneabsolutely alonein this conventicle  presently he saw the door open slowly it gave admission to the small round face and yellow ringlets of a little girl and finally to her whole figure clasping a doll nearly as large as herself for a moment she stood there arrested by the display of mr hamlins dressing case on the table then her glances moved around the room and rested upon the bed her blue eyes and mr hamlins brown ones met and mingled without a moments hesitation she moved to the bedside taking her dolls hands in her own she displayed it before him  isnt it pitty  mr hamlin was instantly his old self again thrusting his hand comfortably under the pillow he lay on his side and gazed at it long and affectionately i never he said in a faint voice but with immovable features saw anything so perfectly beautiful is it alive  its a dolly she returned gravely smoothing down its frock and straightening its helpless feet then seized with a spontaneous idea like a young animal she suddenly presented it to him with both hands and said  kiss it  mr hamlin implanted a chaste salute on its vermilion cheek would you mind letting me hold it for a little he said with extreme diffidence  the child was delighted as he expected mr hamlin placed it in a sitting posture on the edge of his bed and put an ostentatious paternal arm around it  but youre alive aint you he said to the child  this subtle witticism convulsed her im a little girl she gurgled  i see her mother  ess  and whos your mother  mammy  mrs rivers  the child nodded until her ringlets were shaken on her cheek after a moment she began to laugh bashfully and with repression yet as mr hamlin thought a little mischievously then as he looked at her interrogatively she suddenly caught hold of the ruffle of his sleeve  oos got on mammys nighty  mr hamlin started he saw the childs obvious mistake and actually felt himself blushing it was unprecedentedit was the sheerest weaknessit must have something to do with the confounded air  i grieve to say you are deeply mistakenit is my very own he returned with great gravity nevertheless he drew the coverlet close over his shoulder but here he was again attracted by another face at the halfopened doora freckled one belonging to a boy apparently a year or two older than the girl he was violently telegraphing to her to come away although it was evident that he was at the same time deeply interested in the guests toilet articles yet as his bright gray eyes and mr hamlins brown ones met he succumbed as the girl had and walked directly to the bedside but he did it bashfullyas the girl had not he even attempted a defensive explanation  she hadnt oughter come in here and mar wouldnt let her and she knows it he said with superior virtue  but i asked her to come as im asking you said mr hamlin promptly and dont you go back on your sister or youll never be president of the united states with this he laid his hand on the boys tow head and then lifting himself on his pillow to a halfsitting posture put an arm around each of the children drawing them together with the doll occupying the central post of honor now continued mr hamlin albeit in a voice a little faint from the exertion now that were comfortable together ill tell you the story of the good little boy who became a pirate in order to save his grandmother and little sister from being eaten by a wolf at the door  but alas that interesting record of selfsacrifice never was told for it chanced that melinda bird mrs riverss help following the trail of the missing children came upon the open door and glanced in there to her astonishment she saw the domestic group already described and to her eyes dominated by the most beautiful and perfectly elegant young man she had ever seen but let not the incautious reader suppose that she succumbed as weakly as her artless charges to these fascinations the character and antecedents of that young man had been already delivered to her in the kitchen by the other help with that single glance she halted her eyes sought the ceiling in chaste exaltation falling back a step she called in ladylike hauteur and precision mary emmeline and john wesley  mr hamlin glanced at the children its melindy looking for us said john wesley but they did not move at which mr hamlin called out faintly but cheerfully theyre here all right  again the voice arose with still more marked and lofty distinctness john wesley and mary emmeline it seemed to mr hamlin that human accents could not convey a more significant and elevated ignoring of some implied impropriety in his invitation he was for a moment crushed  but he only said to his little friends with a smile youd better go now and well have that story later  affer beckus suggested mary emmeline  in the woods added john wesley  mr hamlin nodded blandly the children trotted to the door it closed upon them and miss birds parting admonition loud enough for mr hamlin to hear no more freedoms no more intrudings you hear  the older culprit hamlin retreated luxuriously under his blankets but presently another new sensation came over himabsolutely hunger perhaps it was the childs allusion to beckus but he found himself wondering when it would be ready this anxiety was soon relieved by the appearance of his host himself bearing a tray possibly in deference to miss birds sense of propriety it appeared also that dr duchesne had previously given suitable directions for his diet and mr hamlin found his repast simple but enjoyable always playfully or ironically polite to strangers he thanked his host and said he had slept splendidly  its this yer ozone in the air that dr duchesne talks about said seth complacently  i am inclined to think it is also those texts said mr hamlin gravely as he indicated them on the wall you see they reminded me of church and my boyhoods slumbers there i have never slept so peacefully since seths face brightened so interestedly at what he believed to be a suggestion of his guests conversion that mr hamlin was fain to change the subject when his host had withdrawn he proceeded to dress himself but here became conscious of his weakness and was obliged to sit down in one of those enforced rests he chanced to be near the window and for the first time looked on the environs of his place of exile for a moment he was staggered everything seemed to pitch downward from the rocky outcrop on which the rambling house and farm sheds stood even the great pines around it swept downward like a green wave to rise again in enormous billows as far as the eye could reach he could count a dozen of their tumbled crests following each other on their way to the distant plain in some vague point of that shimmering horizon of heat and dust was the spot he came from the preceding night yet the recollection of it and his feverish past seemed to confuse him and he turned his eyes gladly away  pale a little tremulous but immaculate and jaunty in his white flannels and straw hat he at last made his way downstairs to his great relief he found the sitting room empty as he would have willingly deferred his formal acknowledgments to his hostess later a single glance at the interior determined him not to linger and he slipped quietly into the open air and sunshine the day was warm and still as the wind only came up with the going down of the sun and the atmosphere was still redolent with the morning spicing of pine and hay and a stronger balm that seemed to fill his breast with sunshine he walked toward the nearest shadea cluster of young buckeyesand having with a certain civic fastidiousness flicked the dust from a stump with his handkerchief he sat down it was very quiet and calm the life and animation of early morning had already vanished from the hill or seemed to be suspended with the sun in the sky he could see the ranchmen and oxen toiling on the green terraced slopes below but no sound reached his ears even the house he had just quitted seemed empty of life throughout its rambling length his seclusion was complete could he stand it for three weeks perhaps it need not be for so long he was already stronger he foresaw that the ascetic seth might become wearisome he had an intuition that mrs rivers would be equally so he should certainly quarrel with melinda and this would probably debar him from the company of the childrenhis only hope  but his seclusion was by no means so complete as he expected he presently was aware of a campmeeting hymn hummed somewhat ostentatiously by a deep contralto voice which he at once recognized as melindas and saw that severe virgin proceeding from the kitchen along the ridge until within a few paces of the buckeyes when she stopped and with her hand shading her eyes apparently began to examine the distant fields she was a tall robust girl not without certain rustic attractions of which she seemed fully conscious this latter weakness gave mr hamlin a new idea he put up the penknife with which he had been paring his nails while wondering why his hands had become so thin and awaited events she presently turned approached the buckeyes plucked a spike of the blossoms with great girlish lightness and then apparently discovering mr hamlin started in deep concern and said with somewhat stentorian politeness i beg your pardondidnt know i was intruding  dont mention it returned jack promptly but without moving i saw you coming and was prepared but generallyas i have something the matter with my hearta sudden joy like this is dangerous  somewhat mystified but struggling between an expression of rigorous decorum and gratified vanity miss melinda stammered i was only  i knew iti saw what you were doing interrupted jack gravely only i wouldnt do it if i were you you were looking at one of those young men down the hill you forgot that if you could see him he could see you looking too and that would only make him conceited and a girl with your attractions dont require that  ez if said melinda with lofty but somewhat reddening scorn there was a man on this hull rancho that id take a second look at  its the first look that does the business returned jack simply but maybe i was wrong would you mindas youre going straight back to the house miss melinda had certainly expressed no such intentionturning those two little kids loose out here ive a sort of engagement with them  i will speak to their mar said melinda primly yet with a certain sign of relenting as she turned away  you can say to her that i regretted not finding her in the sitting room when i came down continued jack tactfully  apparently the tact was successful for he was delighted a few moments later by the joyous onset of john wesley and mary emmeline upon the buckeyes which he at once converted into a game of hide and seek permitting himself at last to be shamelessly caught in the open but here he wisely resolved upon guarding against further grownup interruption and consulting with his companions found that on one of the lower terraces there was a large reservoir fed by a mountain rivulet but they were not allowed to play there thither however the reckless jack hied with his playmates and was presently ensconced under a willow tree where he dexterously fashioned tiny willow canoes with his penknife and sent them sailing over a submerged expanse of nearly an acre but half an hour of this ingenious amusement was brought to an abrupt termination while cutting bark with his back momentarily turned on his companions he heard a scream and turned quickly to see john wesley struggling in the water grasping a tree root and mary emmelinenowhere in another minute he saw the strings of her pinafore appear on the surface a few yards beyond and in yet another minute with a swift rueful glance at his white flannels he had plunged after her a disagreeable shock of finding himself out of his depths was however followed by contact with the childs clothing and clutching her firmly a stroke or two brought him panting to the bank here a gasp a gurgle and then a roar from mary emmeline followed by a sympathetic howl from john wesley satisfied him that the danger was over rescuing the boy from the tree root he laid them both on the grass and contemplated them exercising their lungs with miserable satisfaction but here he found his own breathing impeded in addition to a slight faintness and was suddenly obliged to sit down beside them at which by some sympathetic intuition they both stopped crying  encouraged by this mr hamlin got them to laughing again and then proposed a race home in their wet clothes which they accepted mr hamlin for respiratory reasons lagging in their rear until he had the satisfaction of seeing them captured by the horrified melinda in front of the kitchen while he slipped past her and regained his own room here he changed his saturated clothes tried to rub away a certain chilliness that was creeping over him and lay down in his dressing gown to miserable reflections he had nearly drowned the children and overexcited himself in spite of his promise to the doctor he would never again be intrusted with the care of the former nor be believed by the latter  but events are not always logical in sequence mr hamlin went comfortably to sleep and into a profuse perspiration he was awakened by a rapping at his door and opening it was surprised to find mrs rivers with anxious inquiries as to his condition indeed she said with an emotion which even her prim reserve could not conceal i did not know until now how serious the accident was and how but for you and divine providence my little girl might have been drowned it seems melinda saw it all  inwardly objurgating the spying melinda but relieved that his playmates hadnt broken their promise of secrecy mr hamlin laughed  im afraid that your little girl wouldnt have got into the water at all but for meand you must give all the credit of getting her out to the other fellow he stopped at the severe change in mrs riverss expression and added quite boyishly and with a sudden drop from his usual levity but please dont keep the children away from me for all that mrs rivers  mrs rivers did not and the next day jack and his companions sought fresh playing fields and some new storytelling pastures indeed it was a fine sight to see this pale handsome elegantly dressed young fellow lounging along between a bluecheckered pinafored girl on one side and a barefooted boy on the other the ranchmen turned and looked after him curiously one a rustic prodigal reduced by dissipation to the swinehusks of ranching saw fit to accost him familiarly  the last time i saw you dealing poker in sacramento mr hamlin i did not reckon to find you up here playing with a couple of kids  no responded mr hamlin suavely and yet i remember i was playing with some country idiots down there and you were one of them well understand that up here i prefer the kids dont let me have to remind you of it  nevertheless mr hamlin could not help noticing that for the next two or three days there were many callers at the ranch and that he was obliged in his walks to avoid the highroad on account of the impertinent curiosity of wayfarers some of them were of that sex which he would not have contented himself with simply calling curious  to think said melinda confidently to her mistress that that thar mrs stubbs who wouldnt go to the hightown hotel because there was a play actress thar has been snoopin round here twice since that young feller came  of this fact however mr hamlin was blissfully unconscious  nevertheless his temper was growing uncertain the angle of his smart straw hat was becoming aggressive to strangers his politeness sardonic and now sunday morning had come with an atmosphere of starched piety and wellsoaped respectability at the rancho and the children were to be taken with the rest of the family to the daylong service at hightown as these sabbath pilgrimages filled the main road he was fain to take himself and his loneliness to the trails and byways and even to invade the haunts of some other elegant outcasts like himselfto wit a crested hawk a graceful wild cat beautifully marked and an eloquently reticent rattlesnake mr hamlin eyed them without fear and certainly without reproach they were not out of their element  suddenly he heard his name called in a stentorian contralto an impatient ejaculation rose to his lips but died upon them as he turned it was certainly melinda but in his present sensitive loneliness it struck him for the first time that he had never actually seen her before as she really was like most men in his profession he was a quick reader of thoughts and faces when he was interested and although this was the same robust longlimbed sunburnt girl he had met he now seemed to see through her triple incrustation of human vanity conventional piety and outrageous sabbath finery an honest sympathetic simplicity that commanded his respect  you are back early from church he said  yes one service is good enough for me when thar aint no special preacher she returned so i jest sez to silas as i aint here to listen to the sisters cackle ye kin put to the buckboard and drive me home ez soon ez you please  and so his name is silas suggested mr hamlin cheerfully  go long with you mr hamlin and dont pester she returned with heiferlike playfulness well silas put to and when we rose the hill here i saw your straw hat passin in the gulch and sez to silas sez i ye kin pull up here for over yar is our new boarder jack hamlin and im goin to talk with him all right sez he id sooner trust ye with that gay young gambolier every day of the week than with them saints down thar on sunday he deals ez straight ez he shoots and is about as nigh onto a gentleman as they make em  for one moment or two miss bird only saw jacks long lashes when his eyes once more lifted they were shining and what did you say he said with a short laugh  i told him he neednt be christopher columbus to have discovered that she turned with a laugh toward jack to be met by the word shake and an outstretched thin white hand which grasped her large red one with a frank fraternal pressure  i didnt come to tell ye that remarked miss bird as she sat down on a boulder took off her yellow hat and restacked her tawny mane under it but this i reckoned i went to sunday meetin as i ought ter i kalkilated to hear considerable about faith and works and sich but i didnt reckon to hear all about you from the lords prayer to the doxology you were in the special prayers ez a warnin in the sermon ez a text they picked out hymns to fit ye and always a drefful example and a visitation and the rest o the tune it was all gabble gabble by the brothers and sisters about you i reckon mr hamlin that they know everything you ever did since you were kneehigh to a grasshopper and a good deal more than you ever thought of doin the women is all dead set on convertin ye and savin ye by their own precious selves and the men is ekally dead set on gettin rid o ye on that account  and what did seth and mrs rivers say asked hamlin composedly but with kindling eyes  they stuck up for ye ez far ez they could but ye see the parson hez got a holt upon seth havin caught him kissin a convert at camp meeting and deacon turner knows suthin about mrs riverss sister who kicked over the pail and jumped the fence years ago and shes afeard a him but what i wanted to tell ye was that theyre all comin up here to take a look at yesome on em tonight you aint afeard are ye she added with a loud laugh  well it looks rather desperate doesnt it returned jack with dancing eyes  ill trust ye for all that said melinda and now i reckon ill trot along to the rancho ye neednt offer ter see me home she added as jack made a movement to accompany her everybody up here aint as fairminded ez silas and you and melinda bird hez a character to lose so long with this she cantered away a little heavily perhaps adjusting her yellow hat with both hands as she clattered down the steep hill  that afternoon mr hamlin drew largely on his convalescence to mount a halfbroken mustang and in spite of the rising afternoon wind to gallop along the highroad in quite as mischievous and breezy a fashion he was wont to allow his mustangs nose to hang over the hind rails of wagons and buggies containing young couples and to dash ahead of sober carryalls that held elderly members in good standing  an accomplished rider he picked up and brought back the flying parasol of mrs deacon stubbs without dismounting he finally came home a little blown but dangerously composed  there was the usual sunday evening gathering at windy hill ranchoneighbors and their wives deacons and the pastorbut their curiosity was not satisfied by the sight of mr hamlin who kept his own room and his own counsel there was some desultory conversation chiefly on church topics for it was vaguely felt that a discussion of the advisability or getting rid of the guest of their host was somewhat difficult under this hosts roof with the guest impending at any moment then a diversion was created by some of the church choir practicing the harmonium with the singing of certain more or less lugubrious anthems mrs rivers presently joined in and in a somewhat faded soprano which however still retained considerable musical taste and expression sang come ye disconsolate the wind moaned over the deepthroated chimney in a weird harmony with the melancholy of that human appeal as mrs rivers sang the first verse       come ye disconsolate whereer ye languish        come to the mercy seat fervently kneel      here bring your wounded heartshere tell your anguish        earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal  a pause followed and the longdrawn halfhuman sigh of the mountain wind over the chimney seemed to mingle with the wail of the harmonium and then to their thrilled astonishment a tenor voice high clear but tenderly passionate broke like a skylark over their heads in the lines of the second verse       joy of the desolate light of the straying        hope of the penitentfadeless and pure      here speaks the comforter tenderly saying        earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure  the hymn was old and familiar enough heaven knows it had been quite popular at funerals and some who sat there had had its strange melancholy borne upon them in time of loss and tribulations but never had they felt its full power before accustomed as they were to emotional appeal and to respond to it as the singers voice died away above them their very tears flowed and fell with that voice a few sobbed aloud and then a voice asked tremulously  who is it  its mr hamlin said seth quietly ive heard him often hummin things before  there was another silence and the voice of deacon stubbs broke in harshly  its rank blasphemy  if its rank blasphemy to sing the praise o god not only better than some folks in the choir but like an angel o light i wish youd do a little o that blaspheming on sundays mr stubbs  the speaker was mrs stubbs and as deacon stubbs was a notoriously bad singer the shot told  if hes sincere why does he stand aloof why does he not join us asked the parson  he hasnt been asked said seth quietly if i aint mistaken this yer gathering this evening was specially to see how to get rid of him  there was a quick murmur of protest at this the parson exchanged glances with the deacon and saw that they were hopelessly in the minority  i will ask him myself said mrs rivers suddenly  so do sister rivers so do was the unmistakable response  mrs rivers left the room and returned in a few moments with a handsome young man pale elegant composed even to a grave indifference what his eyes might have said was another thing the long lashes were scarcely raised  i dont mind playing a little he said quietly to mrs rivers as if continuing a conversation but youll have to let me trust my memory  then youerplay the harmonium said the parson with an attempt at formal courtesy  i was for a year or two the organist in the choir of dr todds church at sacramento returned mr hamlin quietly  the blank amazement on the faces of deacons stubbs and turner and the parson was followed by wreathed smiles from the other auditors and especially from the ladies mr hamlin sat down to the instrument and in another moment took possession of it as it had never been held before he played from memory as he had implied but it was the memory of a musician he began with one or two familiar anthems in which they all joined a fragment of a mass and a latin chant followed an ave maria from an opera was his first secular departure but his delighted audience did not detect it then he hurried them along in unfamiliar language to o mio fernando and spiritu gentil which they fondly imagined were hymns until with crowning audacity after a few preliminary chords of the miserere he landed them brokenhearted in the trovatores donjon tower with non te scordar de mi  amidst the applause he heard the preacher suavely explain that those popish masses were always in the latin language and rose from the instrument satisfied with his experiment excusing himself as an invalid from joining them in a light collation in the dining room and begging his hostesss permission to retire he nevertheless lingered a few moments by the door as the ladies filed out of the room followed by the gentlemen until deacon turner who was bringing up the rear was abreast of him here mr hamlin became suddenly deeply interested in a framed pencil drawing which hung on the wall it was evidently a schoolgirls amateur portrait done by mrs rivers deacon turner halted quickly by his side as the others passed outwhich was exactly what mr hamlin expected  do you know the face said the deacon eagerly  thanks to the faithful melinda mr hamlin did know it perfectly it was a pencil sketch of mrs riverss youthfully erring sister but he only said he thought he recognized a likeness to some one he had seen in sacramento  the deacons eye brightened perhaps the same oneperhaps he added in a submissive and significant tone aerpainful story  ratherto him observed hamlin quietly  howierdont understand said deacon turner  well the portrait looks like a lady i knew in sacramento who had been in some trouble when she was a silly girl but had got over it quietly she was however troubled a good deal by some mean hound who was every now and then raking up the story wherever she went well one of her friendsi might have been among them i dont exactly remember just nowchallenged him but although he had no conscientious convictions about slandering a woman he had some about being shot for it and declined the consequence was he was cowhided once in the street and the second time tarred and feathered and ridden on a rail out of town that i suppose was what you meant by your painful story but is this the woman  no no said the deacon hurriedly with a white face you have quite misunderstood  but whose is this portrait persisted jack  i believe thati dont know exactlybut i think it is a sister of mrs riverss stammered the deacon  then of course it isnt the same woman said jack in simulated indignation  certainlyof course not returned the deacon  phew said jack that was a mighty close call lucky we were alone wasnt it  yes said the deacon with a feeble smile  seth continued jack with a thoughtful air looks like a quiet man but i shouldnt like to have made that mistake about his sisterinlaw before him these quiet men are apt to shoot straight better keep this to ourselves  deacon turner not only kept the revelation to himself but apparently his own sacred person also as he did not call again at windy hill rancho during mr hamlins stay but he was exceedingly polite in his references to jack and alluded patronizingly to a little chat they had had together and when the usual reaction took place in mr hamlins favor and jack was actually induced to perform on the organ at hightown church next sunday the deacons voice was loudest in his praise even parson greenwood allowed himself to be noncommittal as to the truth of the rumor largely circulated that one of the most desperate gamblers in the state had been converted through his exhortations  so with breezy walks and games with the children occasional confidences with melinda and silas and the sabbath singing of anthems mr hamlins three weeks of convalescence drew to a close he had lately relaxed his habit of seclusion so far as to mingle with the company gathered for more social purposes at the rancho and once or twice unbent so far as to satisfy their curiosity in regard to certain details of his profession  i have no personal knowledge of games of cards said parson greenwood patronizingly and think i am right in saying that our brothers and sisters are equally inexperienced i amahemfar from believing however that entire ignorance of evil is the best preparation for combating it and i should be glad if youd explain to the company the intricacies of various games there is one that you mentioned with aerscriptural name  faro said hamlin with an unmoved face  pharaoh repeated the parson gravely and one which you call poker which seems to require great selfcontrol  i couldnt make you understand poker without your playing it said jack decidedly  as long as we dont gamblethat is play for moneyi see no objection returned the parson  and said jack musingly you could use beans  it was agreed finally that there would be no falling from grace in their playing among themselves in an inquiring christian spirit under jacks guidance he having decided to abstain from card playing during his convalescence and jack permitted himself to be persuaded to show them the following evening  it so chanced however that dr duchesne finding the end of jacks cure approaching and not hearing from that interesting invalid resolved to visit him at about this time having no chance to apprise jack of his intention on coming to hightown at night he procured a conveyance at the depot to carry him to windy hill rancho the wind blew with its usual nocturnal rollicking persistency and at the end of his turbulent drive it seemed almost impossible to make himself heard amongst the roaring of the pines and some astounding preoccupation of the inmates after vainly knocking the doctor pushed open the front door and entered he rapped at the closed sitting room door but receiving no reply pushed it open upon the most unexpected and astounding scene he had ever witnessed around the centre table several respectable members of the hightown church including the parson were gathered with intense and eager faces playing poker and behind the parson with his hands in his pockets carelessly lounged the doctors patient the picture of health and vigor a disused pack of cards was scattered on the floor and before the gentle and precise mrs rivers was heaped a pile of beans that would have filled a quart measure  when dr duchesne had tactfully retreated before the hurried and stammering apologies of his host and hostess and was alone with jack in his rooms he turned to him with a gravity that was more than half affected and said how long sir did it take you to effect this corruption  upon my honor said jack simply they played last night for the first time and they forced me to show them but added jack after a significant pause i thought it would make the game livelier and be more of a moral lesson if i gave them nearly all good pat hands so i ran in a cold deck on themthe first time i ever did such a thing in my life i fixed up a pack of cards so that one had three tens another three jacks and another three queens and so on up to three aces in a minute they had all tumbled to the game and you never saw such betting every man and woman there believed he or she had struck a sure thing and staked accordingly a new panful of beans was brought on and seth your friend banked for them and at last the parson raked in the whole pile  i suppose you gave him the three aces said dr duchesne gloomily  the parson said jack slowly hadnt a single pair in his hand it was the stoniest deadest neatest bluff i ever saw and when hed frightened off the last man who held out and laid that measly hand of his face down on that pile of kings queens and aces and looked around the table as he raked in the pile there was a smile of humble selfrighteousness on his face that was worth double the money      a pupil of chestnut ridge   the schoolmaster of chestnut ridge was interrupted in his afterschool solitude by the click of hoof and sound of voices on the little bridle path that led to the scant clearing in which his schoolhouse stood he laid down his pen as the figures of a man and woman on horseback passed the windows and dismounted before the porch he recognized the complacent goodhumored faces of mr and mrs hoover who owned a neighboring ranch of some importance and who were accounted well to do people by the community being a childless couple however while they generously contributed to the support of the little school they had not added to its flock and it was with some curiosity that the young schoolmaster greeted them and awaited the purport of their visit this was protracted in delivery through a certain polite dalliance with the real subject characteristic of the southwestern pioneer  well almiry said mr hoover turning to his wife after the first greeting with the schoolmaster was over this makes me feel like old times you bet why i aint bin inside a schoolhouse since i was kneehigh to a grasshopper thars the benches and the desks and the books and all them a b abs jest like the old days dear dear but the teacher in those days was ez old and grizzled ez i beand some o the scholarsno offense to you mr brookswas older and bigger nor you but times is changed yet look almiry if thar aint a hunk o stale gingerbread in that desk jest as it uster be lord how it all comes back ez i was sayin only tother day we cant be too grateful to our parents for givin us an eddication in our youth and mr hoover with the air of recalling an alma mater of sequestered gloom and cloistered erudition gazed reverently around the new pine walls  but mrs hoover here intervened with a gracious appreciation of the schoolmasters youth after her usual kindly fashion and dont you forget it hiram hoover that these young folks of today kin teach the old schoolmasters of way back moren you and i dream of weve heard of your book larnin mr brooks afore this and were proud to hev you here even if the lord has not pleased to give us the children to send to ye but weve always paid our share in keeping up the school for others that was more favored and now it looks as if he had not forgotten us and ez ifwith a significant halfshy glance at her husband and a corroborating nod from that gentlemanez if reelly we might be reckonin to send you a scholar ourselves  the young schoolmaster sympathetic and sensitive felt somewhat embarrassed the allusion to his extreme youth mollified though it was by the salve of praise from the tactful mrs hoover had annoyed him and perhaps added to his slight confusion over the information she vouchsafed he had not heard of any late addition to the hoover family he would not have been likely to in his secluded habits and although he was accustomed to the naive and direct simplicity of the pioneer he could scarcely believe that this good lady was announcing a maternal expectation he smiled vaguely and begged them to be seated  ye see said mr hoover dropping upon a low bench the way the thing pans out is this almirys brother is a powful preacher down the coast at san antonio and hez settled down thar with a big free will baptist church congregation and a heap o land got from them mexicans thars a lot o poor spanish and injin trash that belong to the land and almirys brother hez set about convertin em givin em convickshion and religion though the most of em is papists and followers of the scarlet woman thar was an orphan a little girl that he got outer the hands o them priests kinder snatched as a brand from the burnin and he sent her to us to be brought up in the ways o the lord knowin that we had no children of our own but we thought she oughter get the benefit o schoolin too besides our own care and we reckoned to bring her here reglar to school  relieved and pleased to help the goodnatured couple in the care of the homeless waif albeit somewhat doubtful of their religious methods the schoolmaster said he would be delighted to number her among his little flock had she already received any tuition  only from them padres ye know things about saints virgin marys visions and miracles put in mrs hoover and we kinder thought ez you know spanish you might be able to get rid o them in exchange for conviction o sins and justification by faith ye know  im afraid said mr brooks smiling at the thought of displacing the churchs mysteries for certain corybantic displays and thaumaturgical exhibitions he had witnessed at the dissenters camp meeting that i must leave all that to you and i must caution you to be careful what you do lest you also shake her faith in the alphabet and the multiplication table  mebbee youre right said mrs hoover mystified but goodnatured but thars one thing more we oughter tell ye shesshes a trifle dark complected  the schoolmaster smiled well he said patiently  she isnt a nigger nor an injin ye know but shes kinder a halfspanish halfmexican injin what they call mesmes  mestiza suggested mr brooks a halfbreed or mongrel  i reckon now thar wouldnt be any objection to that eh said mr hoover a little uneasily  not by me returned the schoolmaster cheerfully and although this school is stateaided its not a public school in the eye of the law so you have only the foolish prejudices of your neighbors to deal with he had recognized the reason of their hesitation and knew the strong racial antagonism held towards the negro and indian by mr hoovers southwestern compatriots and he could not refrain from rubbing it in  they kin see interposed mrs hoover that shes not a nigger for her hair dont kink and a furrin injin of course is different from one o our own  if they hear her speak spanish and you simply say she is a foreigner as she is it will be all right said the schoolmaster smilingly let her come ill look after her  much relieved after a few more words the couple took their departure the schoolmaster promising to call the next afternoon at the hoovers ranch and meet his new scholar ye might give us a hint or two how she oughter be fixed up afore she joins the school  the ranch was about four miles from the schoolhouse and as mr brooks drew rein before the hoovers gate he appreciated the devotion of the couple who were willing to send the child that distance twice a day the house with its outbuildings was on a more liberal scale than its neighbors and showed few of the makeshifts and halfhearted advances towards permanent occupation common to the southwestern pioneers who were more or less nomads in instinct and circumstance he was ushered into a wellfurnished sitting room whose glaring freshness was subdued and repressed by blackframed engravings of scriptural subjects as mr brooks glanced at them and recalled the schoolrooms of the old missions with their monastic shadows which half hid the gaudy tinseled saints and flaming or ensanguined hearts upon the walls he feared that the little waif of mother church had not gained any cheerfulness in the exchange  as she entered the room with mrs hoover her large dark eyesthe most notable feature in her small faceseemed to sustain the schoolmasters fanciful fear in their halffrightened wonder she was clinging closely to mrs hoovers side as if recognizing the good womans maternal kindness even while doubtful of her purpose but on the schoolmaster addressing her in spanish a singular change took place in their relative positions a quick look of intelligence came into her melancholy eyes and with it a slight consciousness of superiority to her protectors that was embarrassing to him for the rest he observed merely that she was small and slightly built although her figure was hidden in a long check apron or calico pinafore with sleevesa local garmentwhich was utterly incongruous with her originality her skin was olive inclining to yellow or rather to that exquisite shade of buff to be seen in the new bark of the madrono her face was oval and her mouth small and childlike with little to suggest the aboriginal type in her other features  the masters questions elicited from the child the fact that she could read and write that she knew her hail mary and creed happily the protestant mrs hoover was unable to follow this questioning but he also elicited the more disturbing fact that her replies and confidences suggested a certain familiarity and equality of condition which he could only set down to his own youthfulness of appearance he was apprehensive that she might even make some remark regarding mrs hoover and was not sorry that the latter did not understand spanish but before he left he managed to speak with mrs hoover alone and suggested a change in the costume of the pupil when she came to school the better she is dressed suggested the wily young diplomat the less likely is she to awaken any suspicion of her race  now thats jest whats botherin me mr brooks returned mrs hoover with a troubled face for you see she is a growin girl and she concluded with some embarrassment i cant quite make up my mind how to dress her  how old is she asked the master abruptly  goin on twelve butand mrs hoover again hesitated  why two of my scholars the bromly girls are over fourteen said the master and you know how they are dressed but here he hesitated in his turn it had just occurred to him that the little waif was from the extreme south and the precocious maturity of the mixed races there was well known he even remembered to his alarm to have seen brides of twelve and mothers of fourteen among the native villagers this might also account for the suggestion of equality in her manner and even for a slight coquettishness which he thought he had noticed in her when he had addressed her playfully as a muchacha i should dress her in something spanish he said hurriedly something white you know with plenty of flounces and a little black lace or a black silk skirt and a lace scarf you know shell be all right if you dont make her look like a servant or a dependent he added with a show of confidence he was far from feeling but you havent told me her name he concluded  as were reckonin to adopt her said mrs hoover gravely youll give her ours  but i cant call her miss hoover suggested the master whats her first name  we was thinkin o serafina ann said mrs hoover with more gravity  but what is her name persisted the master  well returned mrs hoover with a troubled look me and hiram consider its a heathenish sort of name for a young gal but youll find it in my brothers letter she took a letter from under the lid of a large bible on the table and pointed to a passage in it  the child was christened concepcion read the master why thats one of the marys  the which asked mrs hoover severely  one of the titles of the virgin mary maria de la concepcion said mr brooks glibly  it dont sound much like anythin so christian and decent as maria or mary returned mrs hoover suspiciously  but the abbreviation concha is very pretty in fact its just the thing its so very spanish returned the master decisively and you know that the squaw who hangs about the mining camp is called reservation ann and old mrs parkinss negro cook is called aunt serafina so serafina ann is too suggestive concha hoover s the name  praps youre right said mrs hoover meditatively  and dress her so shell look like her name and youll be all right said the master gayly as he took his departure  nevertheless it was with some anxiety the next morning he heard the sound of hoofs on the rocky bridle path leading to the schoolhouse he had already informed his little flock of the probable addition to their numbers and their breathless curiosity now accented the appearance of mr hoover riding past the window followed by a little figure on horseback half hidden in the graceful folds of a serape the next moment they dismounted at the porch the serape was cast aside and the new scholar entered  a little alarmed even in his admiration the master nevertheless thought he had never seen a more dainty figure her heavily flounced white skirt stopped short just above her whitestockinged ankles and little feet hidden in white satin lowquartered slippers her black silk shelllike jacket half clasped her stayless bust clad in an underbodice of soft muslin that faintly outlined a contour which struck him as already womanly a black lace veil which had protected her head she had on entering slipped down to her shoulders with a graceful gesture leaving one end of it pinned to her hair by a rose above her little yellow ear the whole figure was so inconsistent with its present setting that the master inwardly resolved to suggest a modification of it to mrs hoover as he with great gravity however led the girl to the seat he had prepared for her mr hoover who had been assisting discipline as he conscientiously believed by gazing with hushed reverent reminiscence on the walls here whispered behind his large hand that he would call for her at four oclock and tiptoed out of the schoolroom the master who felt that everything would depend upon his repressing the childrens exuberant curiosity and maintaining the discipline of the school for the next few minutes with supernatural gravity addressed the young girl in spanish and placed before her a few slight elementary tasks perhaps the strangeness of the language perhaps the unwonted seriousness of the master perhaps also the impassibility of the young stranger herself all contributed to arrest the expanding smiles on little faces to check their wandering eyes and hush their eager whispers by degrees heads were again lowered over their tasks the scratching of pencils on slates and the faroff rapping of woodpeckers again indicated the normal quiet of the schoolroom and the master knew he had triumphed and the ordeal was past  but not as regarded himself for although the new pupil had accepted his instructions with childlike submissiveness and even as it seemed to him with childlike comprehension he could not help noticing that she occasionally glanced at him with a demure suggestion of some understanding between them or as if they were playing at master and pupil this naturally annoyed him and perhaps added a severer dignity to his manner which did not appear to be effective however and which he fancied secretly amused her was she covertly laughing at him yet against this once or twice as her big eyes wandered from her task over the room they encountered the curious gaze of the other children and he fancied he saw an exchange of that freemasonry of intelligence common to children in the presence of their elders even when strangers to each other he looked forward to recess to see how she would get on with her companions he knew that this would settle her status in the school and perhaps elsewhere even her limited english vocabulary would not in any way affect that instinctive childlike test of superiority but he was surprised when the hour of recess came and he had explained to her in spanish and english its purpose to see her quietly put her arm around the waist of matilda bromly the tallest girl in the school as the two whisked themselves off to the playground she was a mere child after all  other things seemed to confirm this opinion later when the children returned from recess the young stranger had instantly become a popular idol and had evidently dispensed her favors and patronage generously the elder bromly girl was wearing her lace veil another had possession of her handkerchief and a third displayed the rose which had adorned her left ear things of which the master was obliged to take note with a view of returning them to the prodigal little barbarian at the close of school later he was however much perplexed by the mysterious passage under the desks of some unknown object which apparently was making the circuit of the school with the annoyed consciousness that he was perhaps unwittingly participating in some game he finally nailed it in the possession of demosthenes walker aged six to the spontaneous outcry of cotched from the whole school when produced from master walkers desk in company with a horned toad and a piece of gingerbread it was found to be conchas white satin slipper the young girl herself meanwhile bending demurely over her task with the bereft foot tucked up like a birds under her skirt the master reserving reproof of this and other enormities until later contented himself with commanding the slipper to be brought to him when he took it to her with the satirical remark in spanish that the schoolroom was not a dressing roomcamara para vestirse to his surprise however she smilingly held out the tiny stockinged foot with a singular combination of the spoiled child and the coquettish senorita and remained with it extended as if waiting for him to kneel and replace the slipper but he laid it carefully on her desk  put it on at once he said in english  there was no mistaking the tone of his voice whatever his language concha darted a quick look at him like the momentary resentment of an animal but almost as quickly her eyes became suffused and with a hurried movement she put on the slipper  please sir it dropped off and jimmy snyder passed it on said a small explanatory voice among the benches  silence said the master  nevertheless he was glad to see that the school had not noticed the girls familiarity even though they thought him hard he was not sure upon reflection but that he had magnified her offense and had been unnecessarily severe and this feeling was augmented by his occasionally finding her looking at him with the melancholy wondering eyes of a chidden animal later as he was moving among the desks overlooking the tasks of the individual pupils he observed from a distance that her head was bent over her desk while her lips were moving as if repeating to herself her lesson and that afterwards with a swift look around the room to assure herself that she was unobserved she made a hurried sign of the cross it occurred to him that this might have followed some penitential prayer of the child and remembering her tuition by the padres it gave him an idea he dismissed school a few moments earlier in order that he might speak to her alone before mr hoover arrived  referring to the slipper incident and receiving her assurances that she the slipper was much too large and fell often so a fact really established by demonstration he seized his opportunity but tell me when you were with the padre and your slipper fell off you did not expect him to put it on for you  concha looked at him coyly and then said triumphantly ah no but he was a priest and you are a young caballero  yet even after this audacity mr brooks found he could only recommend to mr hoover a change in the young girls slippers the absence of the rosepinned veil and the substitution of a sunbonnet for the rest he must trust to circumstances as mr hooverwho with large paternal optimism had professed to see already an improvement in herhelped her into the saddle the schoolmaster could not help noticing that she had evidently expected him to perform that act of courtesy and that she looked correspondingly reproachful  the holy fathers used sometimes to let me ride with them on their mules said concha leaning over her saddle towards the schoolmaster  eh what missy said the protestant mr hoover pricking up his ears now you just listen to mr brookss doctrines and never mind them papists he added as he rode away with the firm conviction that the master had already commenced the task of her spiritual conversion  the next day the master awoke to find his little school famous whatever were the exaggerations or whatever the fancies carried home to their parents by the children the result was an overwhelming interest in the proceedings and personnel of the school by the whole district people had already called at the hoover ranch to see mrs hoovers pretty adopted daughter the master on his way to the schoolroom that morning had found a few woodmen and charcoal burners lounging on the bridle path that led from the main road two or three parents accompanied their children to school asserting they had just dropped in to see how aramanta or tommy were gettin on as the school began to assemble several unfamiliar faces passed the windows or were boldly flattened against the glass the little schoolhouse had not seen such a gathering since it had been borrowed for a political meeting in the previous autumn and the master noticed with some concern that many of the faces were the same which he had seen uplifted to the glittering periods of colonel starbottle the war horse of the democracy  for he could not shut his eyes to the fact that they came from no mere curiosity to see the novel and bizarre no appreciation of mere picturesqueness or beauty and alas from no enthusiasm for the progression of education he knew the people among whom he had lived and he realized the fatal question of color had been raised in some mysterious way by those southwestern emigrants who had carried into this free state their inherited prejudices a few words convinced him that the unhappy children had variously described the complexion of their new fellow pupil and it was believed that the nothn schoolmaster aided and abetted by capital in the person of hiram hoover had introduced either a nigger wench a chinese girl or an injin baby to the same educational privileges as the pure whites and so contaminated the sons of freemen in their very nests he was able to reassure many that the child was of spanish origin but a majority preferred the evidence of their own senses and lingered for that purpose as the hour for her appearance drew near and passed he was seized with a sudden fear that she might not come that mr hoover had been prevailed upon by his compatriots in view of the excitement to withdraw her from the school but a faint cheer from the bridle path satisfied him and the next moment a little retinue swept by the window and he understood the hoovers had evidently determined to accent the spanish character of their little charge concha with a black riding skirt over her flounces was now mounted on a handsome pinto mustang glittering with silver trappings accompanied by a vaquero in a velvet jacket mr hoover bringing up the rear he as he informed the master had merely come to show the way to the vaquero who hereafter would always accompany the child to and from school whether or not he had been induced to this display by the excitement did not transpire enough that the effect was a success the riding skirt and her mustangs fripperies had added to conchas piquancy and if her origin was still doubted by some the child herself was accepted with enthusiasm the parents who were spectators were proud of this distinguished accession to their childrens playmates and when she dismounted amid the acclaim of her little companions it was with the aplomb of a queen  the master alone foresaw trouble in this encouragement of her precocious manner he received her quietly and when she had removed her riding skirt glancing at her feet said approvingly i am glad to see you have changed your slippers i hope they fit you more firmly than the others  the child shrugged her shoulders quien sabe but pedro the vaquero will help me now on my horse when he comes for me  the master understood the characteristic non sequitur as an allusion to his want of gallantry on the previous day but took no notice of it nevertheless he was pleased to see during the day that she was paying more attention to her studies although they were generally rehearsed with the languid indifference to all mental accomplishment which belonged to her race once he thought to stimulate her activity through her personal vanity  why can you not learn as quickly as matilda bromly she is only two years older than you he suggested  ah mother of godwhy does she then try to wear roses like me and with that hair it becomes her not  the master became thus aware for the first time that the elder bromly girl in the sincerest form of flattery to her idol was wearing a yellow rose in her tawny locks and further that master bromly with exquisite humor had burlesqued his sisters imitation with a very small carrot stuck above his left ear this the master promptly removed adding an additional sum to the humorists already overflowing slate by way of penance and returned to concha but wouldnt you like to be as clever as sheyou can if you will only learn  what for should i look you she has a devotion for the tall onethe boy brown ah i want him not  yet notwithstanding this lack of noble ambition concha seemed to have absorbed the devotion of the boys big and little and as the master presently discovered even that of many of the adult population there were always loungers on the bridle path at the opening and closing of school and the vaquero who now always accompanied her became an object of envy possibly this caused the master to observe him closely he was tall and thin with a smooth complexionless face but to the masters astonishment he had the blue gray eye of the higher or castilian type of native californian further inquiry proved that he was a son of one of the old impoverished spanish grant holders whose leagues and cattle had been mortgaged to the hoovers who now retained the son to control the live stock on shares it looks kinder ez ef he might hev an eye on that poorty little gal when shes an age to marry suggested a jealous swain for several days the girl submitted to her school tasks with her usual languid indifference and did not again transgress the ordinary rules nor did mr brooks again refer to their hopeless conversation but one afternoon he noticed that in the silence and preoccupation of the class she had substituted another volume for her textbook and was perusing it with the articulating lips of the unpracticed reader he demanded it from her with blazing eyes and both hands thrust into her desk she refused and defied him mr brooks slipped his arms around her waist quietly lifted her from the benchfeeling her little teeth pierce the back of his hand as he did so but secured the book two of the elder boys and girls had risen with excited faces  sit down said the master sternly  they resumed their places with awed looks the master examined the book it was a little spanish prayer book you were reading this he said in her own tongue  yes you shall not prevent me she burst out mother of god they will not let me read it at the ranch they would take it from me and now you  you may read it when and where you like except when you should be studying your lessons returned the master quietly you may keep it here in your desk and peruse it at recess come to me for it then you are not fit to read it now  the girl looked up with astounded eyes which in the capriciousness of her passionate nature the next moment filled with tears then dropping on her knees she caught the masters bitten hand and covered it with tears and kisses but he quietly disengaged it and lifted her to her seat there was a sniffling sound among the benches which however quickly subsided as he glanced around the room and the incident ended  regularly thereafter she took her prayer book back at recess and disappeared with the children finding as he afterwards learned a seat under a secluded buckeye tree where she was not disturbed by them until her orisons were concluded the children must have remained loyal to some command of hers for the incident and this custom were never told out of school and the master did not consider it his duty to inform mr or mrs hoover if the child could recognize some checkeven if it were deemed by some a superstitious oneover her capricious and precocious nature why should he interfere  one day at recess he presently became conscious of the ceasing of those small voices in the woods around the schoolhouse which were always as familiar and pleasant to him in his seclusion as the song of their playfellowsthe birds themselves the continued silence at last awakened his concern and curiosity he had seldom intruded upon or participated in their games or amusements remembering when a boy himself the heavy incompatibility of the best intentioned adult intruder to even the most hypocritically polite child at such a moment a sense of duty however impelled him to step beyond the schoolhouse where to his astonishment he found the adjacent woods empty and soundless he was relieved however after penetrating its recesses to hear the distant sound of small applause and the unmistakable choking gasps of johnny stidgers pocket accordion following the sound he came at last upon a little hollow among the sycamores where the children were disposed in a ring in the centre of which with a handkerchief in each hand concha the melancholyconcha the devoutwas dancing that most extravagant feat of the fandangothe audacious sembicuaca  yet in spite of her rude and uncertain accompaniment she was dancing it with a grace precision and lightness that was wonderful in spite of its doubtful poses and seductive languors she was dancing it with the artless gayety and innocenceperhaps from the suggestion of her tiny figureof a mere child among an audience of children dancing it alone she assumed the parts of the man and woman advancing retreating coquetting rejecting coyly bewitching and at last yielding as lightly and as immaterially as the flickering shadows that fell upon them from the waving trees overhead the master was fascinated yet troubled what if there had been older spectators would the parents take the performance as innocently as the performer and her little audience he thought it necessary later to suggest this delicately to the child her temper rose her eyes flashed  ah the slipper she is forbidden the prayer bookshe must not the dance it is not good truly there is nothing  for several days she sulked one morning she did not come to school nor the next at the close of the third day the master called at the hoovers ranch  mrs hoover met him embarrassedly in the hall i was sayin to hiram he ought to tell ye but he didnt like to till it was certain conchas gone  gone echoed the master  yes run off with pedro married to him yesterday by the popish priest at the mission  married that child  she wasnt no child mr brooks we were deceived my brother was a fool and men dont understand these things she was a grown womanaccordin to these folks ways and ageswhen she kem here and thats what bothered me  there was a weeks excitement at chestnut ridge but it pleased the master to know that while the children grieved for the loss of concha they never seemed to understand why she had gone      dick boyles business card   the sage wood and dead flat stage coach was waiting before the station the pine barrens mail wagon that connected with it was long overdue with its transfer passengers and the station had relapsed into listless expectation even the humors of dick boyle the chicago drummerand so far the solitary passengerwhich had diverted the waiting loungers began to fail in effect though the cheerfulness of the humorist was unabated the ostlers had slunk back into the stables the station keeper and stage driver had reduced their conversation to impatient monosyllables as if each thought the other responsible for the delay a solitary indian wrapped in a commissary blanket and covered by a castoff tall hat crouched against the wall of the station looking stolidly at nothing the station itself a long rambling building containing its entire accommodation for man and beast under one monotonous shedlike roof offered nothing to attract the eye still less the prospect on the one side two miles of arid waste to the stunted farspaced pines in the distance known as the barrens on the other an apparently limitless level with darker patches of sage brush like the scars of burntout fires  dick boyle approached the motionless indian as a possible relief you dont seem to care much if school keeps or not do you lo  the indian who had been half crouching on his upturned soles here straightened himself with a lithe animallike movement and stood up boyle took hold of a corner of his blanket and examined it critically  govment aint pampering you with a1 goods lo i reckon the agent charged em four dollars for that our firm could have delivered them to you for 2 dols 37 cents and thrown in a box of beads in the bargain suthin like this he took from his pocket a small box containing a gaudy bead necklace and held it up before the indian  the savage who had regarded himor rather looked beyond himwith the tolerating indifference of one interrupted by a frisking inferior animal here suddenly changed his expression a look of childish eagerness came into his gloomy face he reached out his hand for the trinket  hol on said boyle hesitating for a moment then he suddenly ejaculated well take it and one o these and drew a business card from his pocket which he stuck in the band of the battered tall hat of the aborigine there show that to your friends and when youre wantin anything in our line  the interrupting roar of laughter coming from the box seat of the coach was probably what boyle was expecting for he turned away demurely and walked towards the coach all right boys ive squared the noble red man and the star of empire is taking its westward way and i reckon our firm will do the great father business for him at about half the price that it is done in washington  but at this point the ostlers came hurrying out of the stables shes comin said one thats her dust just behind the lone pineand by the way shes racin i reckon shes comin in mighty light  thats so said the mail agent standing up on the box seat for a better view but darned ef i kin see any outside passengers i reckon we havent waited for much  indeed as the galloping horses of the incoming vehicle pulled out of the hanging dust in the distance the solitary driver could be seen urging on his team in a few moments more they had halted at the lower end of the station  wonder whats up said the mail agent  nothin only a big injin scare at pine barrens said one of the ostlers injins doin ghost dancinor suthin like thatand the passengers just skunked out and went on by the other line thars only one ez dar comeand shes a lady  a lady echoed boyle  yes answered the driver taking a deliberate survey of a tall graceful girl who waiving the gallant assistance of the station keeper had leaped unaided from the vehicle a ladyand the fort commandants darter at that shes clar grit you beta chip o the old block and all this means sonny that youre to give up that box seat to her miss julia cantire dont take anythin less when im around  the young lady was already walking directly and composedly towards the waiting coacherect selfcontained well gloved and booted and clothed even in her dust cloak and cape of plain ashen merino with the unmistakable panoply of taste and superiority a goodsized aquiline nose which made her handsome mouth look smaller gray eyes with an occasional humid yellow sparkle in their depths brown penciled eyebrows and brown tendrils of hair all seemed to boyle to be charmingly framed in by the silver gray veil twisted around her neck and under her oval chin in her sober tints she appeared to him to have evoked a harmony even out of the dreadful dust around them what he appeared to her was not so plain she looked him overhe was rather short through himhe was easily penetrable and then her eyes rested with a frank recognition on the driver  goodmorning mr foster she said with a smile  mornin miss i hear theyre havin an injin scare over at the barrens i reckon them men must feel mighty mean at bein stumped by a lady  i dont think they believed i would go and some of them had their wives with them returned the young lady indifferently besides they are eastern people who dont know indians as well as we do mr foster  the driver blushed with pleasure at the association yes maam he laughed i reckon the sight of even old fleas in the blanket over there pointing to the indian who was walking stolidly away from the station would frighten em out o their boots and yet hes got inside his hat the business card o this gentlemanmr dick boyle traveling for the big firm o fletcher  co of chicagohe interpolated rising suddenly to the formal heights of polite introduction so it sorter looks ez ef any skelpin was to be done it might be the other way round ha ha  miss cantire accepted the introduction and the joke with polite but cool abstraction and climbed lightly into the box seat as the mail bags and a quantity of luggageevidently belonging to the evading passengerswere quickly transferred to the coach but for his fair companion the driver would probably have given profane voice to his conviction that his vehicle was used as a dd baggage truck but he only smiled grimly gathered up his reins and flicked his whip the coach plunged forward into the dust which instantly rose around it and made it thereafter a mere cloud in the distance some of that dust for a moment overtook and hid the indian walking stolidly in its track but he emerged from it at an angle with a quickened pace and a peculiar halting trot yet that trot was so well sustained that in an hour he had reached a fringe of rocks and low bushes hitherto invisible through the irregularities of the apparently level plain into which he plunged and disappeared the dust cloud which indicated the coachprobably owing to these same irregularitieshad long since been lost on the visible horizon  the fringe which received him was really the rim of a depression quite concealed from the surface of the plainwhich it followed for some miles through a tangled troughlike bottom of low trees and underbrushand was a natural cover for wolves coyotes and occasionally bears whose halfhuman footprint might have deceived a stranger this did not however divert the indian who trotting still doggedly on paused only to examine another footprintmuch more frequentthe smooth inwardtoed track of moccasins the thicket grew more dense and difficult as he went on yet he seemed to glide through its density and darknessan obscurity that now seemed to be stirred by other moving objects dimly seen and as uncertain and intangible as sunlit leaves thrilled by the wind yet bearing a strange resemblance to human figures pressing a few yards further he himself presently became a part of this shadowy procession which on closer scrutiny revealed itself as a single file of indians following each other in the same tireless trot the woods and underbrush were full of them all moving on as he had moved in a line parallel with the vanishing coach sometimes through the openings a bared painted limb a crest of feathers or a strip of gaudy blanket was visible but nothing more and yet only a few hundred yards away stretched the dusky silent plainvacant of sound or motion   meanwhile the sage wood and pine barren stage coach profoundly obliviousafter the manner of all human inventionof everything but its regular function toiled dustily out of the higher plain and began the grateful descent of a wooded canyon which was in fact the culminating point of the depression just described along which the shadowy procession was slowly advancing hardly a mile in the rear and flank of the vehicle miss julia cantire who had faced the dust volleys of the plain unflinchingly as became a soldiers daughter here stood upright and shook herselfher pretty head and figure emerging like a goddess from the enveloping silver cloud at least mr boyle relegated to the back seat thought soalthough her conversation and attentions had been chiefly directed to the driver and mail agent once when he had lightheartedly addressed a remark to her it had been received with a distinct but unpromising politeness that had made him desist from further attempts yet without abatement of his cheerfulness or resentment of the evident amusement his two male companions got out of his snub indeed it is to be feared that miss julia had certain prejudices of position and may have thought that a drummeror commercial travelerwas no more fitting company for the daughter of a major than an ordinary peddler but it was more probable that mr boyles reputation as a humorista teller of funny stories and a boon companion of menwas inconsistent with the feminine ideal of high and exalted manhood the man who sets the table in a roar is apt to be secretly detested by the sex to say nothing of the other obvious reasons why juliets do not like mercutios  for some such cause as this dick boyle was obliged to amuse himself silently alone on the back seat with those liberal powers of observation which nature had given him on entering the canyon he had noticed the devious route the coach had taken to reach it and had already invented an improved route which should enter the depression at the point where the indians had already unknown to him plunged into it and had conceived a road through the tangled brush that would shorten the distance by some miles he had figured it out and believed that it would pay but by this time they were beginning the somewhat steep and difficult ascent of the canyon on the other side the vehicle had not crawled many yards before it stopped dick boyle glanced around miss cantire was getting down she had expressed a wish to walk the rest of the ascent and the coach was to wait for her at the top foster had effusively begged her to take her own timethere was no hurry boyle glanced a little longingly after her graceful figure released from her cramped position on the box as it flitted youthfully in and out of the wayside trees he would like to have joined her in the woodland ramble but even his good nature was not proof against her indifference at a turn in the road they lost sight of her and as the driver and mail agent were deep in a discussion about the indistinct track boyle lapsed into his silent study of the country suddenly he uttered a slight exclamation and quietly slipped from the back of the toiling coach to the ground the action was however quickly noted by the driver who promptly put his foot on the brake and pulled up wots up now he growled  boyle did not reply but ran back a few steps and began searching eagerly on the ground  lost suthin asked foster  found something said boyle picking up a small object look at that dd if it isnt the card i gave that indian four hours ago at the station he held up the card  look yer sonny retorted foster gravely ef yer wantin to get out and hang round miss cantire why dont yer say so at oncet that story wont wash  fact continued boyle eagerly its the same card i stuck in his hattheres the greasy mark in the corner how the devil did ithow did he get here  better ax him said foster grimly ef hes anywhere round  but i say foster i dont like the look of this at all miss cantire is alone and  but a burst of laughter from foster and the mail agent interrupted him thats so said foster thats your best holt keep it up you jest tell her that say thars another injin skeer on that that thar bloodthirsty ole fleas in his blanket is on the warpath and youre goin to shed the last drop o your blood defendin her thatll fetch her and she aint bin treatin you well glang  the horses started forward under fosters whip leaving boyle standing there half inclined to join in the laugh against himself and yet impelled by some strange instinct to take a more serious view of his discovery there was no doubt it was the same card he had given to the indian true that indian might have given it to anotheryet by what agency had it been brought there faster than the coach traveled on the same road and yet invisibly to them for an instant the humorous idea of literally accepting fosters challenge and communicating his discovery to miss cantire occurred to him he could have made a funny story out of it and could have amused any other girl with it but he would not force himself upon her and again doubted if the discovery were a matter of amusement if it were really serious why should he alarm her he resolved however to remain on the road and within convenient distance of her until she returned to the coach she could not be far away with this purpose he walked slowly on halting occasionally to look behind  meantime the coach continued its difficult ascent a difficulty made greater by the singular nervousness of the horses that only with great trouble and some objurgation from the driver could be prevented from shying from the regular track  now wots gone o them critters said the irate foster straining at the reins until he seemed to lift the leader back into the track again  looks as ef they smelt suthinbar or injin ponies suggested the mail agent  injin ponies repeated foster scornfully  fac injin ponies set a hoss crazyjest as wild hosses would  whars yer injin ponies demanded foster incredulously  dunno said the mail agent simply  but here the horses again swerved so madly from some point of the thicket beside them that the coach completely left the track on the right luckily it was a disused trail and the ground fairly good and foster gave them their heads satisfied of his ability to regain the regular road when necessary it took some moments for him to recover complete control of the frightened animals and then their nervousness having abated with their distance from the thicket and the trail being less steep though more winding than the regular road he concluded to keep it until he got to the summit when he would regain the highway once more and await his passengers having done this the two men stood up on the box and with an anxiety they tried to conceal from each other looked down the canyon for the lagging pedestrians  i hope miss cantire hasnt been stampeded from the track by any skeer like that said the mail agent dubiously  not she shes got too much grit and sabe for that unless that drummer hez caught up with her and unloaded his yarn about that kyard  they were the last words the men spoke for two rifle shots cracked from the thicket beside the road two shots aimed with such deliberateness and precision that the two men mortally stricken collapsed where they stood hanging for a brief moment over the dashboard before they rolled over on the horses backs nor did they remain there long for the next moment they were seized by half a dozen shadowy figures and with the horses and their cut traces dragged into the thicket a half dozen and then a dozen other shadows flitted and swarmed over in and through the coach reinforced by still more until the whole vehicle seemed to be possessed covered and hidden by them swaying and moving with their weight like helpless carrion beneath a pack of ravenous wolves yet even while this seething congregation was at its greatest at some unknown signal it as suddenly dispersed vanished and disappeared leaving the coach emptyvacant and void of all that had given it life weight animation and purposea mere skeleton on the roadside the afternoon wind blew through its open doors and ravaged rack and box as if it had been the wreck of weeks instead of minutes and the level rays of the setting sun flashed and blazed into its windows as though fire had been added to the ruin but even this presently faded leaving the abandoned coach a rigid lifeless spectre on the twilight plain  an hour later there was the sound of hurrying hoofs and jingling accoutrements and out of the plain swept a squad of cavalrymen bearing down upon the deserted vehicle for a few moments they too seemed to surround and possess it even as the other shadows had done penetrating the woods and thicket beside it and then as suddenly at some signal they swept forward furiously in the track of the destroying shadows   miss cantire took full advantage of the suggestion not to hurry in her walk with certain feminine ideas of its latitude she gathered a few wild flowers and some berries in the underwood inspected some birds nests with a healthy youthful curiosity and even took the opportunity of arranging some moist tendrils of her silky hair with something she took from the small reticule that hung coquettishly from her girdle it was indeed some twenty minutes before she emerged into the road again the vehicle had evidently disappeared in a turn of the long winding ascent but just ahead of her was that dreadful man the chicago drummer she was not vain but she made no doubt that he was waiting there for her there was no avoiding him but his companionship could be made a brief one she began to walk with ostentatious swiftness  boyle whose concern for her safety was secretly relieved at this began to walk forward briskly too without looking around miss cantire was not prepared for this it looked so ridiculously as if she were chasing him she hesitated slightly but now as she was nearly abreast of him she was obliged to keep on  i think you do well to hurry miss cantire he said as she passed ive lost sight of the coach for some time and i dare say theyre already waiting for us at the summit  miss cantire did not like this any better to go on beside this dreadful man scrambling breathlessly after the stagefor all the world like an absorbed and sentimentally belated pair of picnickerswas really too much perhaps if you ran on and told them i was coming as fast as i could she suggested tentatively  it would be as much as my life is worth to appear before foster without you he said laughingly youve only got to hurry on a little faster  but the young lady resented this being driven by a drummer she began to lag depressing her pretty brows ominously  let me carry your flowers said boyle he had noticed that she was finding some difficulty in holding up her skirt and the nosegay at the same time  no no she said in hurried horror at this new suggestion of their companionship thank you very muchbut theyre really not worth keepingi am going to throw them away there she added tossing them impatiently in the dust  but she had not reckoned on boyles perfect goodhumor that gentle idiot stooped down actually gathered them up again and was following she hurried on if she could only get to the coach first ignoring him but a vulgar man like that would be sure to hand them to her with some joke then she lagged againshe was getting tired and she could see no sign of the coach the drummer too was also lagging behindat a respectful distance like a groom or one of her fathers troopers nevertheless this did not put her in a much better humor and halting until he came abreast of her she said impatiently i dont see why mr foster should think it necessary to send any one to look after me  he didnt returned boyle simply i got down to pick up something  to pick up something she returned incredulously  yes that he held out the card its the card of our firm  miss cantire smiled ironically you are certainly devoted to your business  well yes returned boyle goodhumoredly you see i reckon it dont pay to do anything halfway and whatever i do i mean to keep my eyes about me in spite of her prejudice miss cantire could see that these necessary organs if rather flippant were honest yes i suppose there isnt much on that i dont take in why now miss cantire theres that fancy dust cloak youre wearingit isnt in our line of goodsnor in anybodys line west of chicago it came from boston or new york and was made for home consumption but your hatand mighty pretty it is too as youve fixed it upis only regular dunstable stock which we could put down at pine barrens for four and a half cents a piece net yet i suppose you paid nearly twentyfive cents for it at the agency  oddly enough this cool appraisement of her costume did not incense the young lady as it ought to have done on the contrary for some occult feminine reason it amused and interested her it would be such a good story to tell her friends of a drummers idea of gallantry and to tease the flirtatious young west pointer who had just joined and the appraisement was truthfulmajor cantire had only his payand miss cantire had been obliged to select that hat from the government stores  are you in the habit of giving this information to ladies you meet in traveling she asked  well no answered boylefor thats just where you have to keep your eyes open most of em wouldnt like it and its no use aggravating a possible customer but you are not that kind  miss cantire was silent she knew she was not of that kind but she did not require his vulgar indorsement she pushed on for some moments alone when suddenly he hailed her she turned impatiently he was carefully examining the road on both sides  we have either lost our way he said rejoining her or the coach has turned off somewhere these tracks are not fresh and as they are all going the same way they were made by the up coach last night theyre not our tracks i thought it strange we hadnt sighted the coach by this time  and thensaid miss cantire impatiently  we must turn back until we find them again  the young lady frowned why not keep on until we get to the top she said pettishly im sure i shall she stopped suddenly as she caught sight of his grave face and keen observant eyes why cant we go on as we are  because we are expected to come back to the coachand not to the summit merely these are the orders and you know you are a soldiers daughter he laughed as he spoke but there was a certain quiet deliberation in his manner that impressed her when he added after a pause we must go back and find where the tracks turned off she obeyed without a word  they walked for some time eagerly searching for signs of the missing vehicle a curious interest and a new reliance in boyles judgment obliterated her previous annoyance and made her more natural she ran ahead of him with youthful eagerness examining the ground following a false clue with great animation and confessing her defeat with a charming laugh and it was she who after retracing their steps for ten minutes found the diverging track with a girlish cry of triumph boyle who had followed her movements quite as interestedly as her discovery looked a little grave as he noticed the deep indentations made by the struggling horses miss cantire detected the change in his face ten minutes before she would never have observed it i suppose we had better follow the new track she said inquiringly as he seemed to hesitate  certainly he said quickly as if coming to a prompt decision that is safest  what do you think has happened the ground looks very much cut up she said in a confidential tone as new to her as her previous observation of him  a horse has probably stumbled and theyve taken the old trail as less difficult said boyle promptly in his heart he did not believe it yet he knew that if anything serious had threatened them the coach would have waited in the road its an easier trail for us though i suppose its a little longer he added presently  you take everything so goodhumoredly mr boyle she said after a pause  its the way to do business miss cantire he said a man in my line has to cultivate it  she wished he hadnt said that but nevertheless she returned a little archly but you havent any business with the stage company nor with me although i admit i intend to get my dunstable hereafter from your firm at the wholesale prices  before he could reply the detonation of two gunshots softened by distance floated down from the ridge above them there said miss cantire eagerly do you hear that  his face was turned towards the distant ridge but really that she might not question his eyes she continued with animation thats from the coachto guide usdont you see  yes he returned with a quick laugh and it says hurry upmighty quickwere tired waitingso wed better push on  why dont you answer back with your revolver she asked  havent got one he said  havent got one she repeated in genuine surprise i thought you gentlemen who are traveling always carried one perhaps its inconsistent with your gospel of goodhumor  thats just it miss cantire he said with a laugh youve hit it  why she said hesitatingly even i have a derringera very little one you know which i carry in my reticule captain richards gave it to me she opened her reticule and showed a pretty ivoryhandled pistol the look of joyful surprise which came into his face changed quickly as she cocked it and lifted it into the air he seized her arm quickly  no please dont you might want iti mean the report wont carry far enough its a very useful little thing for all that but its only effective at close quarters he kept the pistol in his hand as they walked on but miss cantire noticed this also his evident satisfaction when she had at first produced it and his concern when she was about to discharge it uselessly she was a clever girl and a frank one to those she was inclined to trust and she began to trust this stranger a smile stole along her oval cheek  i really believe youre afraid of something mr boyle she said without looking up what is it you havent got that indian scare too  boyle had no false shame i think i have he returned with equal frankness you see i dont understand indians as well as youand foster  well you take my word and fosters that there is not the least danger from them about here they are merely grownup children cruel and destructive as most children are but they know their masters by this time and the old days of promiscuous scalping are over the only other childish propensity they keep is thieving even then they only steal what they actually wanthorses guns and powder a coach can go where an ammunition or an emigrant wagon cant so your trunk of samples is quite safe with foster  boyle did not think it necessary to protest perhaps he was thinking of something else  ive a mind she went on slyly to tell you something more confidence for confidence as youve told me your trade secrets ill tell you one of ours before we left pine barrens my father ordered a small escort of cavalrymen to be in readiness to join that coach if the scouts who were watching thought it necessary so you see im something of a fraud as regards my reputation for courage  that doesnt follow said boyle admiringly for your father must have thought there was some danger or he wouldnt have taken that precaution  oh it wasnt for me said the young girl quickly  not for you repeated boyle  miss cantire stopped short with a pretty flush of color and an adorable laugh there ive done it so i might as well tell the whole story but i can trust you mr boyle she faced him with clear penetrating eyes well she laughed again you might have noticed that we had a quantity of baggage of passengers who didnt go well those passengers never intended to go and hadnt any baggage do you understand those innocentlooking heavy trunks contained carbines and cartridges from our post for fort taylorshe made him a mischievous curtsyunder my charge and she added enjoying his astonishment as you saw i brought them through safe to the station and had them transferred to this coach with less fuss and trouble than a commissary transport and escort would have made  and they were in this coach repeated boyle abstractedly  were they are said miss cantire  then the sooner i get you back to your treasure again the better said boyle with a laugh does foster know it  of course not do you suppose id tell it to anybody but a stranger to the place perhaps like you i know when and to whom to impart information she said mischievously  whatever was in boyles mind he had space for profound and admiring astonishment of the young lady before him the girlish simplicity and trustfulness of her revelation seemed as inconsistent with his previous impression of her reserve and independence as her girlish reasoning and manner was now delightfully at variance with her tallness her aquiline nose and her erect figure mr boyle like most short men was apt to overestimate the qualities of size  they walked on for some moments in silence the ascent was comparatively easy but devious and boyle could see that this new detour would take them still some time to reach the summit miss cantire at last voiced the thought in his own mind i wonder what induced them to turn off here and if you hadnt been so clever as to discover their tracks how could we have found them but she added with feminine logic that of course is why they fired those shots  boyle remembered however that the shots came from another direction but did not correct her conclusion nevertheless he said lightly perhaps even foster might have had an indian scare  he ought to know friendlies or government reservation men better by this time said miss cantire however there is something in that do you know she added with a laugh though i havent your keen eyes im gifted with a keen scent and once or twice ive thought i smelt indiansthat peculiar odor of their camps which is unlike anything else and which one detects even in their ponies i used to notice it when i rode one no amount of grooming could take it away  i dont suppose that the intensity or degree of this odor would give you any idea of the hostile or friendly feelings of the indians towards you asked boyle grimly  although the remark was consistent with boyles objectionable reputation as a humorist miss cantire deigned to receive it with a smile at which boyle who was a little relieved by their security so far and their nearness to their journeys end developed further ingenious trifling until at the end of an hour they stood upon the plain again  there was no sign of the coach but its fresh track was visible leading along the bank of the ravine towards the intersection of the road they should have come by and to which the coach had indubitably returned mr boyle drew a long breath they were comparatively safe from any invisible attack now at the end of ten minutes miss cantire from her superior height detected the top of the missing vehicle appearing above the stunted bushes at the junction of the highway  would you mind throwing those old flowers away now she said glancing at the spoils which boyle still carried  why he asked  oh theyre too ridiculous please do  may i keep one he asked with the first intonation of masculine weakness in his voice  if you like she said a little coldly  boyle selected a small spray of myrtle and cast the other flowers obediently aside  dear me how ridiculous she said  what is ridiculous he asked lifting his eyes to hers with a slight color but he saw that she was straining her eyes in the distance  why there dont seem to be any horses to the coach  he looked through a gap in the furze he could see the vehicle now quite distinctly standing empty horseless and alone he glanced hurriedly around them on the one side a few rocks protected them from the tangled rim of the ridge on the other stretched the plain sit down dont move until i return he said quickly take that he handed back her pistol and ran quickly to the coach it was no illusion there it stood vacant abandoned its dropped pole and cut traces showing too plainly the fearful haste of its desertion a light step behind him made him turn it was miss cantire pink and breathless carrying the cocked derringer in her hand how foolish of youwithout a weapon she gasped in explanation  then they both stared at the coach the empty plain and at each other after their tedious ascent their long detour their protracted expectancy and their eager curiosity there was such a suggestion of hideous mockery in this vacant useless vehicleapparently left to them in what seemed their utter abandonmentthat it instinctively affected them alike and as i am writing of human nature i am compelled to say that they both burst into a fit of laughter that for the moment stopped all other expression  it was so kind of them to leave the coach said miss cantire faintly as she took her handkerchief from her wet and mirthful eyes but what made them run away  boyle did not reply he was eagerly examining the coach in that brief hour and a half the dust of the plain had blown thick upon it and covered any foul stain or blot that might have suggested the awful truth even the soft imprint of the indians moccasined feet had been trampled out by the later horse hoofs of the cavalrymen it was these that first attracted boyles attention but he thought them the marks made by the plunging of the released coach horses  not so his companion she was examining them more closely and suddenly lifted her bright animated face look she said our men have been here and have had a hand in thiswhatever it is  our men repeated boyle blankly  yestroopers from the postthe escort i told you of these are the prints of the regulation cavalry horseshoenot of fosters team nor of indian ponies who never have any dont you see she went on eagerly our men have got wind of something and have galloped down herealong the ridgesee she went on pointing to the hoof prints coming from the plain theyve anticipated some indian attack and secured everything  but if they were the same escort you spoke of they must have known you were here and havehe was about to say abandoned you but checked himself remembering they were her fathers soldiers  they knew i could take care of myself and wouldnt stand in the way of their duty said the young girl anticipating him with quick professional pride that seemed to fit her aquiline nose and tall figure and if they knew that she added softening with a mischievous smile they also knew of course that i was protected by a gallant stranger vouched for by mr foster no she added with a certain blind devoted confidence which boyle noticed with a slight wince that she had never shown before its all right and by orders mr boyle and when theyve done their work theyll be back  but boyles masculine common sense was perhaps safer than miss cantires feminine faith and inherited discipline for in an instant he suddenly comprehended the actual truth the indians had been there first they had despoiled the coach and got off safely with their booty and prisoners on the approach of the escort who were now naturally pursuing them with a fury aroused by the belief that their commanders daughter was one of their prisoners this conviction was a dreadful one yet a relief as far as the young girl was concerned but should he tell her no better that she should keep her calm faith in the triumphant promptness of the soldiersand their speedy return  i dare say you are right he said cheerfully and let us be thankful that in the empty coach youll have at least a halfcivilized shelter until they return meantime ill go and reconnoitre a little  i will go with you she said  but boyle pointed out to her so strongly the necessity of her remaining to wait for the return of the soldiers that being also fagged out by her long climb she obediently consented while he even with his inspiration of the truth did not believe in the return of the despoilers and knew she would be safe  he made his way to the nearest thicket where he rightly believed the ambush had been prepared and to which undoubtedly they first retreated with their booty he expected to find some signs or traces of their spoil which in their haste they had to abandon he was more successful than he anticipated a few steps into the thicket brought him full upon a realization of more than his worst convictionsthe dead body of foster near it lay the body of the mail agent both had been evidently dragged into the thicket from where they fell scalped and half stripped there was no evidence of any later struggle they must have been dead when they were brought there  boyle was neither a hardhearted nor an unduly sensitive man his vocation had brought him peril enough by land and water he had often rendered valuable assistance to others his sympathy never confusing his directness and common sense he was sorry for these two men and would have fought to save them but he had no imaginative ideas of death and his keen perception of the truth was consequently sensitively alive only to that grotesqueness of aspect which too often the hapless victims of violence are apt to assume he saw no agony in the vacant eyes of the two men lying on their backs in apparently the complacent abandonment of drunkenness which was further simulated by their tumbled and disordered hair matted by coagulated blood which however had lost its sanguine color he thought only of the unsuspecting girl sitting in the lonely coach and hurriedly dragged them further into the bushes in doing this he discovered a loaded revolver and a flask of spirits which had been lying under them and promptly secured them a few paces away lay the coveted trunks of arms and ammunition their lids wrenched off and their contents gone he noticed with a grim smile that his own trunks of samples had shared a like fate but was delighted to find that while the brighter trifles had attracted the indians childish cupidity they had overlooked a heavy black merino shawl of a cheap but serviceable quality it would help to protect miss cantire from the evening wind which was already rising over the chill and stark plain it also occurred to him that she would need water after her parched journey and he resolved to look for a spring being rewarded at last by a trickling rill near the ambush camp but he had no utensil except the spirit flask which he finally emptied of its contents and replaced with the pure watera heroic sacrifice to a traveler who knew the comfort of a stimulant he retraced his steps and was just emerging from the thicket when his quick eye caught sight of a moving shadow before him close to the ground which set the hot blood coursing through his veins  it was the figure of an indian crawling on his hands and knees towards the coach scarcely forty yards away for the first time that afternoon boyles calm goodhumor was overswept by a blind and furious rage yet even then he was sane enough to remember that a pistol shot would alarm the girl and to keep that weapon as a last resource for an instant he crept forward as silently and stealthily as the savage and then with a sudden bound leaped upon him driving his head and shoulders down against the rocks before he could utter a cry and sending the scalping knife he was carrying between his teeth flying with the shock from his battered jaw boyle seized ithis knee still in the mans backbut the prostrate body never moved beyond a slight contraction of the lower limbs the shock had broken the indians neck he turned the inert man on his backthe head hung loosely on the side but in that brief instant boyle had recognized the friendly indian of the station to whom he had given the card  he rose dizzily to his feet the whole action had passed in a few seconds of time and had not even been noticed by the sole occupant of the coach he mechanically cocked his revolver but the man beneath him never moved again neither was there any sign of flight or reinforcement from the thicket around him again the whole truth flashed upon him this spy and traitor had been left behind by the marauders to return to the station and avert suspicion he had been lurking around but being without firearms had not dared to attack the pair together  it was a moment or two before boyle regained his usual elastic goodhumor then he coolly returned to the spring washed himself of the indian as he grimly expressed it to himself brushed his clothes picked up the shawl and flask and returned to the coach it was getting dark now but the glow of the western sky shone unimpeded through the windows and the silence gave him a great fear he was relieved however on opening the door to find miss cantire sitting stiffly in a corner i am sorry i was so long he said apologetically to her attitude but  i suppose you took your own time she interrupted in a voice of injured tolerance i dont blame you anythings better than being cooped up in this tiresome stage for goodness knows how long  i was hunting for water he said humbly and have brought you some he handed her the flask  and i see you have had a wash she said a little enviously how spick and span you look but whats the matter with your necktie  he put his hand to his neck hurriedly his necktie was loose and had twisted to one side in the struggle he colored quite as much from the sensitiveness of a studiously neat man as from the fear of discovery and whats that she added pointing to the shawl  one of my samples that i suppose was turned out of the coach and forgotten in the transfer he said glibly i thought it might keep you warm  she looked at it dubiously and laid it gingerly aside you dont mean to say you go about with such things openly she said querulously  yes one mustnt lose a chance of trade you know he resumed with a smile  and you havent found this journey very profitable she said dryly you certainly are devoted to your business after a pause discontentedly its quite night alreadywe cant sit here in the dark  we can take one of the coach lamps inside theyre still there ive been thinking the matter over and i reckon if we leave one lighted outside the coach it may guide your friends back he had considered it and believed that the audacity of the act coupled with the knowledge the indians must have of the presence of the soldiers in the vicinity would deter rather than invite their approach  she brightened considerably with the coach lamp which he lit and brought inside by its light she watched him curiously his face was slightly flushed and his eyes very bright and keen looking man killing except with old professional hands has the disadvantage of affecting the circulation  but miss cantire had noticed that the flask smelt of whiskey the poor man had probably fortified himself from the fatigues of the day  i suppose you are getting bored by this delay she said tentatively  not at all he replied would you like to play cards ive got a pack in my pocket we can use the middle seat as a table and hang the lantern by the window strap  she assented languidly from the back seat he was on the front seat with the middle seat for a table between them first mr boyle showed her some tricks with the cards and kindled her momentary and flashing interest in a mysteriously evoked but evanescent knave then they played euchre at which miss cantire cheated adorably and mr boyle lost game after game shamelessly then once or twice miss cantire was fain to put her cards to her mouth to conceal an apologetic yawn and her blueveined eyelids grew heavy whereupon mr boyle suggested that she should make herself comfortable in the corner of the coach with as many cushions as she liked and the despised shawl while he took the night air in a prowl around the coach and a lookout for the returning party doing so he was delighted after a turn or two to find her asleep and so returned contentedly to his sentry round  he was some distance from the coach when a low moaning sound in the thicket presently increased until it rose and fell in a prolonged howl that was repeated from the darkened plains beyond he recognized the voice of wolves he instinctively felt the sickening cause of it they had scented the dead bodies and he now regretted that he had left his own victim so near the coach he was hastening thither when a cry this time human and more terrifying came from the coach he turned towards it as its door flew open and miss cantire came rushing toward him her face was colorless her eyes wild with fear and her tall slim figure trembled convulsively as she frantically caught at the lapels of his coat as if to hide herself within its folds and gasped breathlessly  what is it oh mr boyle save me  they are wolves he said hurriedly but there is no danger they would never attack you you were safe where you were let me lead you back  but she remained rooted to the spot still clinging desperately to his coat no no she said i dare not i heard that awful cry in my sleep i looked out and saw ita dreadful creature with yellow eyes and tongue and a sickening breath as it passed between the wheels just below me ah whats that and she again lapsed in nervous terror against him  boyle passed his arm around her promptly firmly masterfully she seemed to feel the implied protection and yielded to it gratefully with the further breakdown of a sob there is no danger he repeated cheerfully wolves are not good to look at i know but they wouldnt have attacked you the beast only scents some carrion on the plain and you probably frightened him more than he did you lean on me he continued as her step tottered you will be better in the coach  and you wont leave me alone again she said in hesitating terror  no  he supported her to the coach gravely gentlyher master and still more his own for all that her beautiful loosened hair was against his cheek and shoulder its perfume in his nostrils and the contour of her lithe and perfect figure against his own he helped her back into the coach with the aid of the cushions and shawl arranged a reclining couch for her on the back seat and then resumed his old place patiently by degrees the color came back to her faceas much of it as was not hidden by her handkerchief  then a tremulous voice behind it began a halfsmothered apology i am so ashamed mr boylei really could not help it but it was so suddenand so horriblei shouldnt have been afraid of it had it been really an indian with a scalping knifeinstead of that beast i dont know why i did itbut i was aloneand seemed to be deadand you were dead too and they were coming to eat me they do you knowyou said so just now perhaps i was dreaming i dont know what you must think of mei had no idea i was such a coward  but boyle protested indignantly he was sure if he had been asleep and had not known what wolves were before he would have been equally frightened she must try to go to sleep againhe was sure she couldand he would not stir from the coach until she waked or her friends came  she grew quieter presently and took away the handkerchief from a mouth that smiled though it still quivered then reaction began and her tired nerves brought her languor and finally repose boyle watched the shadows thicken around her long lashes until they lay softly on the faint flush that sleep was bringing to her cheek her delicate lips parted and her quick breath at last came with the regularity of slumber  so she slept and he sitting silently opposite her dreamedthe old dream that comes to most good men and true once in their lives he scarcely moved until the dawn lightened with opal the dreary plain bringing back the horizon and day when he woke from his dream with a sigh and then a laugh then he listened for the sound of distant hoofs and hearing them crept noiselessly from the coach a compact body of horsemen were bearing down upon it he rose quickly to meet them and throwing up his hand brought them to a halt at some distance from the coach they spread out resolving themselves into a dozen troopers and a smart young cadetlike officer  if you are seeking miss cantire he said in a quiet businesslike tone she is quite safe in the coach and asleep she knows nothing yet of what has happened and believes it is you who have taken everything away for security against an indian attack she has had a pretty rough nightwhat with her fatigue and her alarm at the wolvesand i thought it best to keep the truth from her as long as possible and i would advise you to break it to her gently he then briefly told the story of their experiences omitting only his own personal encounter with the indian a new pride which was perhaps the result of his vigil prevented him  the young officer glanced at him with as much courtesy as might be afforded to a civilian intruding upon active military operations i am sure major cantire will be greatly obliged to you when he knows it he said politely and as we intend to harness up and take the coach back to sage wood station immediately you will have an opportunity of telling him  i am not going back by the coach to sage wood said boyle quietly i have already lost twelve hours of my timeas well as my trunkon this picnic and i reckon the least major cantire can do is to let me take one of your horses to the next station in time to catch the down coach i can do it if i set out at once  boyle heard his name with the familiar prefix of dicky given to the officer by a commissary sergeant whom he recognized as having met at the agency and the words chicago drummer added while a perceptible smile went throughout the group very well sir said the officer with a familiarity a shade less respectful than his previous formal manner you can take the horse as i believe the indians have already made free with your samples give him a mount sergeant  the two men walked towards the coach boyle lingered a moment at the window to show him the figure of miss cantire still peacefully slumbering among her pile of cushions and then turned quietly away a moment later he was galloping on one of the troopers horses across the empty plain   miss cantire awoke presently to the sound of a familiar voice and the sight of figures that she knew but the young officers first words of explanationa guarded account of the pursuit of the indians and the recapture of the arms suppressing the killing of foster and the mail agentbrought a change to her brightened face and a wrinkle to her pretty brow  but mr boyle said nothing of this to me she said sitting up where is he  already on his way to the next station on one of our horses wanted to catch the down stage and get a new box of samples i fancy as the braves had rigged themselves out with his laces and ribbons said hed lost time enough on this picnic returned the young officer with a laugh smart business chap but i hope he didnt bore you  miss cantire felt her cheek flush and bit her lip i found him most kind and considerate mr ashford she said coldly he may have thought the escort could have joined the coach a little earlier and saved all this but he was too much of a gentleman to say anything about it to me she added dryly with a slight elevation of her aquiline nose  nevertheless boyles last words stung her deeply to hurry off too without saying goodby or even asking how she slept no doubt he had lost time and was tired of her company and thought more of his precious samples than of her after all it was like him to rush off for an order  she was half inclined to call the young officer back and tell him how boyle had criticised her costume on the road but mr ashford was at that time entirely preoccupied with his men around a ledge of rock and bushes some yards from the coach yet not so far away but that she could hear what they said ill swear there was no dead injin here when we came yesterday we searched the whole placeby daylight toofor any sign the injin was killed in his tracks by some one last night its like dick boyle lieutenant to have done it and like him to have said nothin to frighten the young lady he knows when to keep his mouth shutand when to open it  miss cantire sank back in her corner as the officer turned and approached the coach the incident of the past night flashed back upon hermr boyles long absence his flushed face twisted necktie and enforced cheerfulness she was shocked amazed discomfitedand admiring and this hero had been sitting opposite to her silent all the rest of the night  did mr boyle say anything of an indian attack last night asked ashford did you hear anything  only the wolves howling said miss cantire mr boyle was away twice she was strangely reticentin complimentary imitation of her missing hero  theres a dead indian here who has been killed began ashford  oh please dont say anything more mr ashford interrupted the young lady but let us get away from this horrid place at once do get the horses in i cant stand it  but the horses were already harnessed and mounted postilionwise by the troopers the vehicle was ready to start when miss cantire called stop  when ashford presented himself at the door the young lady was upon her hands and knees searching the bottom of the coach oh dear ive lost something i must have dropped it on the road she said breathlessly with pink cheeks you must positively wait and let me go back and find it i wont be long you know theres no hurry  mr ashford stared as miss cantire skipped like a schoolgirl from the coach and ran down the trail by which she and boyle had approached the coach the night before she had not gone far before she came upon the withered flowers he had thrown away at her command it must be about here she murmured suddenly she uttered a cry of delight and picked up the business card that boyle had shown her then she looked furtively around her and selecting a sprig of myrtle among the castoff flowers concealed it in her mantle and ran back glowing to the coach thank you all right ive found it she called to ashford with a dazzling smile and leaped inside  the coach drove on and miss cantire alone in its recesses drew the myrtle from her mantle and folding it carefully in her handkerchief placed it in her reticule then she drew out the card read its dryly practical information over and over again examined the soiled edges brushed them daintily and held it for a moment with eyes that saw not motionless in her hand then she raised it slowly to her lips rolled it into a spiral and loosening a hook and eye thrust it gently into her bosom  and dick boyle galloping away to the distant station did not know that the first step towards a realization of his foolish dream had been taken
