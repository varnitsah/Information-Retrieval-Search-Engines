97679050	the ambassadors   by  henry james    new york edition 1909     volume i    preface   nothing is more easy than to state the subject of the ambassadors which first appeared in twelve numbers of the north american review 1903 and was published as a whole the same year the situation involved is gathered up betimes that is in the second chapter of book fifth for the readers benefit into as few words as possibleplanted or sunk stiffly and saliently in the centre of the current almost perhaps to the obstruction of traffic  never can a composition of this sort have sprung straighter from a dropped grain of suggestion and never can that grain developed overgrown and smothered have yet lurked more in the mass as an independent particle  the whole case in fine is in lambert strethers irrepressible outbreak to little bilham on the sunday afternoon in glorianis garden the candour with which he yields for his young friends enlightenment to the charming admonition of that crisis  the idea of the tale resides indeed in the very fact that an hour of such unprecedented ease should have been felt by him as a crisis and he is at pains to express it for us as neatly as we could desire  the remarks to which he thus gives utterance contain the essence of the ambassadors his fingers close before he has done round the stem of the fullblown flower which after that fashion he continues officiously to present to us  live all you can its a mistake not to it doesnt so much matter what you do in particular so long as you have your life  if you havent had that what have you had  im too oldtoo old at any rate for what i see  what one loses one loses make no mistake about that  still we have the illusion of freedom therefore dont like me today be without the memory of that illusion i was either at the right time too stupid or too intelligent to have it and now im a case of reaction against the mistake  do what you like so long as you dont make it  for it was a mistake  live live such is the gist of strethers appeal to the impressed youth whom he likes and whom he desires to befriend the word mistake occurs several times it will be seen in the course of his remarkswhich gives the measure of the signal warning he feels attached to his case  he has accordingly missed too much though perhaps after all constitutionally qualified for a better part and he wakes up to it in conditions that press the spring of a terrible question would there yet perhaps be time for reparationreparation that is for the injury done his character for the affront he is quite ready to say so stupidly put upon it and in which he has even himself had so clumsy a hand  the answer to which is that he now at all events sees so that the business of my tale and the march of my action not to say the precious moral of everything is just my demonstration of this process of vision  nothing can exceed the closeness with which the whole fits again into its germ  that had been given me bodily as usual by the spoken word for i was to take the image over exactly as i happened to have met it a friend had repeated to me with great appreciation a thing or two said to him by a man of distinction much his senior and to which a sense akin to that of strethers melancholy eloquence might be imputedsaid as chance would have and so easily might in paris and in a charming old garden attached to a house of art and on a sunday afternoon of summer many persons of great interest being present  the observation there listened to and gathered up had contained part of the note that i was to recognise on the spot as to my purposehad contained in fact the greater part the rest was in the place and the time and the scene they sketched these constituents clustered and combined to give me further support to give me what i may call the note absolute  there it stands accordingly full in the tideway driven in with hard taps like some strong stake for the noose of a cable the swirl of the current roundabout it  what amplified the hint to more than the bulk of hints in general was the gift with it of the old paris garden for in that token were sealed up values infinitely precious  there was of course the seal to break and each item of the packet to count over and handle and estimate but somehow in the light of the hint all the elements of a situation of the sort most to my taste were there  i could even remember no occasion on which so confronted i had found it of a livelier interest to take stock in this fashion of suggested wealth  for i think verily that there are degrees of merit in subjectsin spite of the fact that to treat even one of the most ambiguous with due decency we must for the time for the feverish and prejudiced hour at least figure its merit and its dignity as possibly absolute  what it comes to doubtless is that even among the supremely goodsince with such alone is it ones theory of ones honour to be concernedthere is an ideal beauty of goodness the invoked action of which is to raise the artistic faith to its maximum  then truly i hold ones theme may be said to shine and that of the ambassadors i confess wore this glow for me from beginning to end  fortunately thus i am able to estimate this as frankly quite the best all round of all my productions any failure of that justification would have made such an extreme of complacency publicly fatuous  i recall then in this connexion no moment of subjective intermittence never one of those alarms as for a suspected hollow beneath ones feet a felt ingratitude in the scheme adopted under which confidence fails and opportunity seems but to mock if the motive of the wings of the dove as i have noted was to worry me at moments by a sealingup of its facethough without prejudice to its again of a sudden fairly grimacing with expressionso in this other business i had absolute conviction and constant clearness to deal with it had been a frank proposition the whole bunch of data installed on my premises like a monotony of fine weather  the order of composition in these things i may mention was reversed by the order of publication the earlier written of the two books having appeared as the later even under the weight of my heros years i could feel my postulate firm even under the strain of the difference between those of madame de vionnet and those of chad newsome a difference liable to be denounced as shocking i could still feel it serene  nothing resisted nothing betrayed i seem to make out in this full and sound sense of the matter it shed from any side i could turn it to the same golden glow  i rejoiced in the promise of a hero so mature who would give me thereby the more to bite intosince its only into thickened motive and accumulated character i think that the painter of life bites more than a little my poor friend should have accumulated character certainly or rather would be quite naturally and handsomely possessed of it in the sense that he would have and would always have felt he had imagination galore and that this yet wouldnt have wrecked him  it was immeasurable the opportunity to do a man of imagination for if there mightnt be a chance to bite where in the world might it be this personage of course so enriched wouldnt give me for his type imagination in predominance or as his prime faculty nor should i in view of other matters have found that convenient  so particular a luxurysome occasion that is for study of the high gift in supreme command of a case or of a careerwould still doubtless come on the day i should be ready to pay for it and till then might as from far back remain hung up well in view and just out of reach the comparative case meanwhile would serveit was only on the minor scale that i had treated myself even to comparative cases  i was to hasten to add however that happy stopgaps as the minor scale had thus yielded the instance in hand should enjoy the advantage of the full range of the major since most immediately to the point was the question of that supplement of situation logically involved in our gentlemans impulse to deliver himself in the paris garden on the sunday afternoonor if not involved by strict logic then all ideally and enchantingly implied in it  i say ideally because i need scarce mention that for development for expression of its maximum my glimmering story was at the earliest stage to have nipped the thread of connexion with the possibilities of the actual reported speaker  he remains but the happiest of accidents his actualities all too definite precluded any range of possibilities it had only been his charming office to project upon that wide field of the artists visionwhich hangs there ever in place like the white sheet suspended for the figures of a childs magiclanterna more fantastic and more moveable shadow  no privilege of the teller of tales and the handler of puppets is more delightful or has more of the suspense and the thrill of a game of difficulty breathlessly played than just this business of looking for the unseen and the occult in a scheme halfgrasped by the light or so to speak by the clinging scent of the gage already in hand no dreadful old pursuit of the hidden slave with bloodhounds and the rag of association can ever for excitement i judge have bettered it at its best  for the dramatist always by the very law of his genius believes not only in a possible right issue from the rightlyconceived tight place he does much more than thishe believes irresistibly in the necessary the precious tightness of the place whatever the issue on the strength of any respectable hint it being thus the respectable hint that i had with such avidity picked up what would be the story to which it would most inevitably form the centre  it is part of the charm attendant on such questions that the story with the omens true as i say puts on from this stage the authenticity of concrete existence  it then is essentiallyit begins to be though it may more or less obscurely lurk so that the point is not in the least what to make of it but only very delightfully and very damnably where to put ones hand on it  in which truth resides surely much of the interest of that admirable mixture for salutary application which we know as art art deals with what we see it must first contribute fullhanded that ingredient it plucks its material otherwise expressed in the garden of lifewhich material elsewhere grown is stale and uneatable  but it has no sooner done this than it has to take account of a processfrom which only when its the basest of the servants of man incurring ignominious dismissal with no character does it and whether under some muddled pretext of morality or on any other pusillanimously edge away  the process that of the expression the literal squeezingout of value is another affairwith which the happy luck of mere finding has little to do  the joys of finding at this stage are pretty well over that quest of the subject as a whole by matching as the ladies say at the shops the big piece with the snippet having ended we assume with a capture  the subject is found and if the problem is then transferred to the ground of what to do with it the field opens out for any amount of doing  this is precisely the infusion that as i submit completes the strong mixture  it is on the other hand the part of the business that can least be likened to the chase with horn and hound  its all a sedentary partinvolves as much ciphering of sorts as would merit the highest salary paid to a chief accountant  not however that the chief accountant hasnt his gleams of bliss for the felicity or at least the equilibrium of the artists state dwells less surely in the further delightful complications he can smuggle in than in those he succeeds in keeping out  he sows his seed at the risk of too thick a crop wherefore yet again like the gentlemen who audit ledgers he must keep his head at any price  in consequence of all which for the interest of the matter i might seem here to have my choice of narrating my hunt for lambert strether of describing the capture of the shadow projected by my friends anecdote or of reporting on the occurrences subsequent to that triumph  but i had probably best attempt a little to glance in each direction since it comes to me again and again over this licentious record that ones bag of adventures conceived or conceivable has been only halfemptied by the mere telling of ones story  it depends so on what one means by that equivocal quantity  there is the story of ones hero and then thanks to the intimate connexion of things the story of ones story itself i blush to confess it but if ones a dramatist ones a dramatist and the latter imbroglio is liable on occasion to strike me as really the more objective of the two  the philosophy imputed to him in that beautiful outbreak the hour there amid such happy provision striking for him would have been then on behalf of my man of imagination to be logically and as the artless craft of comedy has it led up to the probable course to such a goal the goal of so conscious a predicament would have in short to be finely calculated  where has he come from and why has he come what is he doing as we anglosaxons and we only say in our foredoomed clutch of exotic aids to expression in that galere  to answer these questions plausibly to answer them as under crossexamination in the witnessbox by counsel for the prosecution in other words satisfactorily to account for strether and for his peculiar tone was to possess myself of the entire fabric  at the same time the clue to its whereabouts would lie in a certain principle of probability he wouldnt have indulged in his peculiar tone without a reason it would take a felt predicament or a false position to give him so ironic an accent  one hadnt been noting tones all ones life without recognising when one heard it the voice of the false position the dear man in the paris garden was then admirably and unmistakeably in onewhich was no small point gained what next accordingly concerned us was the determination of this identity  one could only go by probabilities but there was the advantage that the most general of the probabilities were virtual certainties  possessed of our friends nationality to start with there was a general probability in his narrower localism which for that matter one had really but to keep under the lens for an hour to see it give up its secrets  he would have issued our rueful worthy from the very heart of new englandat the heels of which matter of course a perfect train of secrets tumbled for me into the light  they had to be sifted and sorted and i shall not reproduce the detail of that process but unmistakeably they were all there and it was but a question auspiciously of picking among them  what the position would infallibly be and why on his hands it had turned falsethese inductive steps could only be as rapid as they were distinct  i accounted for everythingand everything had by this time become the most promising quantityby the view that he had come to paris in some state of mind which was literally undergoing as a result of new and unexpected assaults and infusions a change almost from hour to hour  he had come with a view that might have been figured by a clear green liquid say in a neat glass phial and the liquid once poured into the open cup of application once exposed to the action of another air had begun to turn from green to red or whatever and might for all he knew be on its way to purple to black to yellow  at the still wilder extremes represented perhaps for all he could say to the contrary by a variability so violent he would at first naturally but have gazed in surprise and alarm whereby the situation clearly would spring from the play of wildness and the development of extremes  i saw in a moment that should this development proceed both with force and logic my story would leave nothing to be desired  there is always of course for the storyteller the irresistible determinant and the incalculable advantage of his interest in the story as such it is ever obviously overwhelmingly the prime and precious thing as other than this i have never been able to see it as to which what makes for it with whatever headlong energy may be said to pale before the energy with which it simply makes for itself  it rejoices none the less at its best to seem to offer itself in a light to seem to know and with the very last knowledge what its aboutliable as it yet is at moments to be caught by us with its tongue in its cheek and absolutely no warrant but its splendid impudence  let us grant then that the impudence is always therethere so to speak for grace and effect and allure there above all because the story is just the spoiled child of art and because as we are always disappointed when the pampered dont play up we like it to that extent to look all its character  it probably does so in truth even when we most flatter ourselves that we negotiate with it by treaty  all of which again is but to say that the steps for my fable placed themselves with a prompt and as it were functional assurancean air quite as of readiness to have dispensed with logic had i been in fact too stupid for my clue  never positively none the less as the links multiplied had i felt less stupid than for the determination of poor strethers errand and for the apprehension of his issue  these things continued to fall together as by the neat action of their own weight and form even while their commentator scratched his head about them he easily sees now that they were always well in advance of him  as the case completed itself he had in fact from a good way behind to catch up with them breathless and a little flurried as he best could the false position for our belated man of the worldbelated because he had endeavoured so long to escape being one and now at last had really to face his doomthe false position for him i say was obviously to have presented himself at the gate of that boundless menagerie primed with a moral scheme of the most approved pattern which was yet framed to break down on any approach to vivid facts that is to any at all liberal appreciation of them  there would have been of course the case of the strether prepared wherever presenting himself only to judge and to feel meanly but he would have moved for me i confess enveloped in no legend whatever  the actual mans note from the first of our seeing it struck is the note of discrimination just as his drama is to become under stress the drama of discrimination it would have been his blest imagination we have seen that had already helped him to discriminate the element that was for so much of the pleasure of my cutting thick as i have intimated into his intellectual into his moral substance yet here it was at the same time just here that a shade for a moment fell across the scene  there was the dreadful little old tradition one of the platitudes of the human comedy that peoples moral scheme does break down in paris that nothing is more frequently observed that hundreds of thousands of more or less hypocritical or more or less cynical persons annually visit the place for the sake of the probable catastrophe and that i came late in the day to work myself up about it  there was in fine the trivial association one of the vulgarest in the world but which give me pause no longer i think simply because its vulgarity is so advertised  the revolution performed by strether under the influence of the most interesting of great cities was to have nothing to do with any betise of the imputably tempted state he was to be thrown forward rather thrown quite with violence upon his lifelong trick of intense reflexion which friendly test indeed was to bring him out through winding passages through alternations of darkness and light very much in paris but with the surrounding scene itself a minor matter a mere symbol for more things than had been dreamt of in the philosophy of woollett  another surrounding scene would have done as well for our show could it have represented a place in which strethers errand was likely to lie and his crisis to await him  the likely place had the great merit of sparing me preparations there would have been too many involvednot at all impossibilities only rather worrying and delaying difficultiesin positing elsewhere chad newsomes interesting relation his so interesting complexity of relations strethers appointed stage in fine could be but chads most luckily selected one  the young man had gone in as they say for circumjacent charm and where he would have found it by the turn of his mind most authentic was where his earnest friends analysis would most find him as well as where for that matter the formers whole analytic faculty would be led such a wonderful dance  the ambassadors had been all conveniently arranged for its first appearance was from month to month in the north american review during 1903 and i had been open from far back to any pleasant provocation for ingenuity that might reside in ones actively adoptingso as to make it in its way a small compositional lawrecurrent breaks and resumptions  i had made up my mind here regularly to exploit and enjoy these often rather rude joltshaving found as i believed an admirable way to it yet every question of form and pressure i easily remember paled in the light of the major propriety recognised as soon as really weighed that of employing but one centre and keeping it all within my heros compass the thing was to be so much this worthys intimate adventure that even the projection of his consciousness upon it from beginning to end without intermission or deviation would probably still leave a part of its value for him and a fortiori for ourselves unexpressed i might however express every grain of it that there would be room foron condition of contriving a splendid particular economy other persons in no small number were to people the scene and each with his or her axe to grind his or her situation to treat his or her coherency not to fail of his or her relation to my leading motive in a word to establish and carry on  but strethers sense of these things and strethers only should avail me for showing them i should know them but through his more or less groping knowledge of them since his very gropings would figure among his most interesting motions and a full observance of the rich rigour i speak of would give me more of the effect i should be most after than all other possible observances together  it would give me a large unity and that in turn would crown me with the grace to which the enlightened storyteller will at any time for his interest sacrifice if need be all other graces whatever  i refer of course to the grace of intensity which there are ways of signally achieving and ways of signally missingas we see it all round us helplessly and woefully missed  not that it isnt on the other hand a virtue eminently subject to appreciationthere being no strict no absolute measure of it so that one may hear it acclaimed where it has quite escaped ones perception and see it unnoticed where one has gratefully hailed it  after all of which i am not sure either that the immense amusement of the whole cluster of difficulties so arrayed may not operate for the fond fabulist when judicious not less than fond as his best of determinants  that charming principle is always there at all events to keep interest fresh it is a principle we remember essentially ravenous without scruple and without mercy appeased with no cheap nor easy nourishment  it enjoys the costly sacrifice and rejoices thereby in the very odour of difficultyeven as ogres with their feefawfum rejoice in the smell of the blood of englishmen  thus it was at all events that the ultimate though after all so speedy definition of my gentlemans jobhis coming out all solemnly appointed and deputed to save chad and his then finding the young man so disobligingly and at first so bewilderingly not lost that a new issue altogether in the connexion prodigiously faces them which has to be dealt with in a new lightpromised as many calls on ingenuity and on the higher branches of the compositional art as one could possibly desire again and yet again as from book to book i proceed with my survey i find no source of interest equal to this verification after the fact as i may call it and the more in detail the better of the scheme of consistency gone in for  as alwayssince the charm never failsthe retracing of the process from point to point brings back the old illusion  the old intentions bloom again and flowerin spite of all the blossoms they were to have dropped by the way  this is the charm as i say of adventure transposedthe thrilling ups and downs the intricate ins and outs of the compositional problem made after such a fashion admirably objective becoming the question at issue and keeping the authors heart in his mouth  such an element for instance as his intention that mrs newsome away off with her finger on the pulse of massachusetts should yet be no less intensely than circuitously present through the whole thing should be no less felt as to be reckoned with than the most direct exhibition the finest portrayal at first hand could make her such a sign of artistic good faith i say once its unmistakeably there takes on again an actuality not too much impaired by the comparative dimness of the particular success cherished intention too inevitably acts and operates in the book about fifty times as little as i had fondly dreamt it might but that scarce spoils for me the pleasure of recognising the fifty ways in which i had sought to provide for it  the mere charm of seeing such an idea constituent in its degree the fineness of the measures takena real extension if successful of the very terms and possibilities of representation and figurationsuch things alone were after this fashion inspiring such things alone were a gage of the probable success of that dissimulated calculation with which the whole effort was to square  but oh the cares begotten none the less of that same judicious sacrifice to a particular form of interest  ones work should have composition because composition alone is positive beauty but all the whileapart from ones inevitable consciousness too of the dire paucity of readers ever recognising or ever missing positive beautyhow as to the cheap and easy at every turn how as to immediacy and facility and even as to the commoner vivacity positive beauty might have to be sweated for and paid for  once achieved and installed it may always be trusted to make the poor seeker feel he would have blushed to the roots of his hair for failing of it yet how as its virtue can be essentially but the virtue of the whole the wayside traps set in the interest of muddlement and pleading but the cause of the moment of the particular bit in itself have to be kicked out of the path  all the sophistications in life for example might have appeared to muster on behalf of the menacethe menace to a bright varietyinvolved in strethers having all the subjective say as it were to himself  had i meanwhile made him at once hero and historian endowed him with the romantic privilege of the first personthe darkest abyss of romance this inveterately when enjoyed on the grand scalevariety and many other queer matters as well might have been smuggled in by a back door  suffice it to be brief that the first person in the long piece is a form foredoomed to looseness and that looseness never much my affair had never been so little so as on this particular occasion all of which reflexions flocked to the standard from the momenta very early onethe question of how to keep my form amusing while sticking so close to my central figure and constantly taking its pattern from him had to be faced he arrives arrives at chester as for the dreadful purpose of giving his creator no end to tell about himbefore which rigorous mission the serenest of creators might well have quailed i was far from the serenest i was more than agitated enough to reflect that grimly deprived of one alternative or one substitute for telling i must address myself tooth and nail to another  i couldnt save by implication make other persons tell each other about himblest resource blest necessity of the drama which reaches its effects of unity all remarkably by paths absolutely opposite to the paths of the novel with other persons save as they were primarily his persons not he primarily but one of theirs i had simply nothing to do  i had relations for him none the less by the mercy of providence quite as much as if my exhibition was to be a muddle if i could only by implication and a show of consequence make other persons tell each other about him i could at least make him tell them whatever in the world he must and could so by the same tokenwhich was a further luxury thrown insee straight into the deep differences between what that could do for me or at all events for him and the large ease of autobiography  it may be asked why if one so keeps to ones hero one shouldnt make a single mouthful of method shouldnt throw the reins on his neck and letting them flap there as free as in gil blas or in david copperfield equip him with the double privilege of subject and objecta course that has at least the merit of brushing away questions at a sweep  the answer to which is i think that one makes that surrender only if one is prepared not to make certain precious discriminations  the first person then so employed is addressed by the author directly to ourselves his possible readers whom he has to reckon with at the best by our english tradition so loosely and vaguely after all so little respectfully on so scant a presumption of exposure to criticism  strether on the other hand encaged and provided for as the ambassadors encages and provides has to keep in view proprieties much stiffer and more salutary than any our straight and credulous gape are likely to bring home to him has exhibitional conditions to meet in a word that forbid the terrible fluidity of selfrevelation  i may seem not to better the case for my discrimination if i say that for my first care i had thus inevitably to set him up a confidant or two to wave away with energy the custom of the seated mass of explanation after the fact the inserted block of merely referential narrative which flourishes so to the shame of the modern impatience on the serried page of balzac but which seems simply to appal our actual our general weaker digestion harking back to make up took at any rate more doing as the phrase is not only than the reader of today demands but than he will tolerate at any price any call upon him either to understand or remotely to measure and for the beauty of the thing when done the current editorial mind in particular appears wholly without sense  it is not however primarily for either of these reasons whatever their weight that strethers friend waymarsh is so keenly clutched at on the threshold of the book or that no less a pounce is made on maria gostreywithout even the pretext either of her being in essence strethers friend  she is the readers friend much ratherin consequence of dispositions that make him so eminently require one and she acts in that capacity and really in that capacity alone with exemplary devotion from beginning to and of the book  she is an enrolled a direct aid to lucidity she is in fine to tear off her mask the most unmitigated and abandoned of ficelles  half the dramatists art as we well knowsince if we dont its not the fault of the proofs that lie scattered about usis in the use of ficelles by which i mean in a deep dissimulation of his dependence on them waymarsh only to a slighter degree belongs in the whole business less to my subject than to my treatment of it the interesting proof in these connexions being that one has but to take ones subject for the stuff of drama to interweave with enthusiasm as many gostreys as need be  the material of the ambassadors conforming in this respect exactly to that of the wings of the dove published just before it is taken absolutely for the stuff of drama so that availing myself of the opportunity given me by this edition for some prefatory remarks on the latter work i had mainly to make on its behalf the point of its scenic consistency  it disguises that virtue in the oddest way in the world by just looking as we turn its pages as little scenic as possible but it sharply divides itself just as the composition before us does into the parts that prepare that tend in fact to overprepare for scenes and the parts or otherwise into the scenes that justify and crown the preparation  it may definitely be said i think that everything in it that is not scene not i of course mean complete and functional scene treating all the submitted matter as by logical start logical turn and logical finish is discriminated preparation is the fusion and synthesis of picture these alternations propose themselves all recogniseably i think from an early stage as the very form and figure of the ambassadors so that to repeat such an agent as miss gostrey preengaged at a high salary but waits in the draughty wing with her shawl and her smellingsalts  her function speaks at once for itself and by the time she has dined with strether in london and gone to a play with him her intervention as a ficelle is i hold expertly justified  thanks to it we have treated scenically and scenically alone the whole lumpish question of strethers past which has seen us more happily on the way than anything else could have done we have strained to a high lucidity and vivacity or at least we hope we have certain indispensable facts we have seen our two or three immediate friends all conveniently and profitably in action to say nothing of our beginning to descry others of a remoter intensity getting into motion even if a bit vaguely as yet for our further enrichment  let my first point be here that the scene in question that in which the whole situation at woollett and the complex forces that have propelled my hero to where this lively extractor of his value and distiller of his essence awaits him is normal and entire is really an excellent standard scene copious comprehensive and accordingly never short but with its office as definite as that of the hammer on the gong of the clock the office of expressing all that is in the hour  the ficelle character of the subordinate party is as artfully dissimulated throughout as may be and to that extent that with the seams or joints of maria gostreys ostensible connectedness taken particular care of duly smoothed over that is and anxiously kept from showing as pieced on this figure doubtless achieves after a fashion something of the dignity of a prime idea which circumstance but shows us afresh how many quite incalculable but none the less clear sources of enjoyment for the infatuated artist how many copious springs of our nevertobeslighted fun for the reader and critic susceptible of contagion may sound their incidental plash as soon as an artistic process begins to enjoy free development  exquisitein illustration of thisthe mere interest and amusement of such at once creative and critical questions as how and where and why to make miss gostreys false connexion carry itself under a due high polish as a real one nowhere is it more of an artful expedient for mere consistency of form to mention a case than in the last scene of the book where its function is to give or to add nothing whatever but only to express as vividly as possible certain things quite other than itself and that are of the already fixed and appointed measure  since however all art is expression and is thereby vividness one was to find the door open here to any amount of delightful dissimulation these verily are the refinements and ecstasies of methodamid which or certainly under the influence of any exhilarated demonstration of which one must keep ones head and not lose ones way  to cultivate an adequate intelligence for them and to make that sense operative is positively to find a charm in any produced ambiguity of appearance that is not by the same stroke and all helplessly an ambiguity of sense to project imaginatively for my hero a relation that has nothing to do with the matter the matter of my subject but has everything to do with the manner the manner of my presentation of the same and yet to treat it at close quarters and for fully economic expressions possible sake as if it were important and essentialto do that sort of thing and yet muddle nothing may easily become as one goes a signally attaching proposition even though it all remains but part and parcel i hasten to recognise of the merely general and related question of expressional curiosity and expressional decency  i am moved to add after so much insistence on the scenic side of my labour that i have found the steps of reperusal almost as much waylaid here by quite another style of effort in the same signal interestor have in other words not failed to note how even so associated and so discriminated the finest proprieties and charms of the nonscenic may under the right hand for them still keep their intelligibility and assert their office  infinitely suggestive such an observation as this last on the whole delightful head where representation is concerned of possible variety of effective expressional change and contrast one would like at such an hour as this for critical licence to go into the matter of the noted inevitable deviation from too fond an original vision that the exquisite treachery even of the straightest execution may ever be trusted to inflict even on the most mature planthe case being that though ones last reconsidered production always seems to bristle with that particular evidence the ambassadors would place a flood of such light at my service  i must attach to my final remark here a different import noting in the other connexion i just glanced at that such passages as that of my heros first encounter with chad newsome absolute attestations of the nonscenic form though they be yet lay the firmest hand tooso far at least as intention goeson representational effect  to report at all closely and completely of what passes on a given occasion is inevitably to become more or less scenic and yet in the instance i allude to with the conveyance expressional curiosity and expressional decency are sought and arrived at under quite another law  the true inwardness of this may be at bottom but that one of the suffered treacheries has consisted precisely for chads whole figure and presence of a direct presentability diminished and compromiseddespoiled that is of its proportional advantage so that in a word the whole economy of his authors relation to him has at important points to be redetermined the book however critically viewed is touchingly full of these disguised and repaired losses these insidious recoveries these intensely redemptive consistencies the pages in which mamie pocock gives her appointed and i cant but think duly felt lift to the whole action by the so inscrutablyapplied sidestroke or shortcut of our just watching and as quite at an angle of vision as yet untried her single hour of suspense in the hotel salon in our partaking of her concentrated study of the sense of matters bearing on her own case all the bright warm paris afternoon from the balcony that overlooks the tuileries gardenthese are as marked an example of the representational virtue that insists here and there on being for the charm of opposition and renewal other than the scenic  it wouldnt take much to make me further argue that from an equal play of such oppositions the book gathers an intensity that fairly adds to the dramaticthough the latter is supposed to be the sum of all intensities or that has at any rate nothing to fear from juxtaposition with it  i consciously fail to shrink in fact from that extravagancei risk it rather for the sake of the moral involved which is not that the particular production before us exhausts the interesting questions it raises but that the novel remains still under the right persuasion the most independent most elastic most prodigious of literary forms   henry james      book first    i  strethers first question when he reached the hotel was about his friend yet on his learning that waymarsh was apparently not to arrive till evening he was not wholly disconcerted  a telegram from him bespeaking a room only if not noisy reply paid was produced for the enquirer at the office so that the understanding they should meet at chester rather than at liverpool remained to that extent sound  the same secret principle however that had prompted strether not absolutely to desire waymarshs presence at the dock that had led him thus to postpone for a few hours his enjoyment of it now operated to make him feel he could still wait without disappointment  they would dine together at the worst and with all respect to dear old waymarshif not even for that matter to himselfthere was little fear that in the sequel they shouldnt see enough of each other  the principle i have just mentioned as operating had been with the most newly disembarked of the two men wholly instinctivethe fruit of a sharp sense that delightful as it would be to find himself looking after so much separation into his comrades face his business would be a trifle bungled should he simply arrange for this countenance to present itself to the nearing steamer as the first note of europe mixed with everything was the apprehension already on strethers part that it would at best throughout prove the note of europe in quite a sufficient degree  that note had been meanwhilesince the previous afternoon thanks to this happier devicesuch a consciousness of personal freedom as he hadnt known for years such a deep taste of change and of having above all for the moment nobody and nothing to consider as promised already if headlong hope were not too foolish to colour his adventure with cool success  there were people on the ship with whom he had easily consortedso far as ease could up to now be imputed to himand who for the most part plunged straight into the current that set from the landingstage to london there were others who had invited him to a tryst at the inn and had even invoked his aid for a look round at the beauties of liverpool but he had stolen away from every one alike had kept no appointment and renewed no acquaintance had been indifferently aware of the number of persons who esteemed themselves fortunate in being unlike himself met and had even independently unsociably alone without encounter or relapse and by mere quiet evasion given his afternoon and evening to the immediate and the sensible  they formed a qualified draught of europe an afternoon and an evening on the banks of the mersey but such as it was he took his potion at least undiluted  he winced a little truly at the thought that waymarsh might be already at chester he reflected that should he have to describe himself there as having got in so early it would be difficult to make the interval look particularly eager but he was like a man who elatedly finding in his pocket more money than usual handles it a while and idly and pleasantly chinks it before addressing himself to the business of spending  that he was prepared to be vague to waymarsh about the hour of the ships touching and that he both wanted extremely to see him and enjoyed extremely the duration of delaythese things it is to be conceived were early signs in him that his relation to his actual errand might prove none of the simplest  he was burdened poor stretherit had better be confessed at the outsetwith the oddity of a double consciousness  there was detachment in his zeal and curiosity in his indifference  after the young woman in the glass cage had held up to him across her counter the palepink leaflet bearing his friends name which she neatly pronounced he turned away to find himself in the hall facing a lady who met his eyes as with an intention suddenly determined and whose featuresnot freshly young not markedly fine but on happy terms with each othercame back to him as from a recent vision  for a moment they stood confronted then the moment placed her  he had noticed her the day before noticed her at his previous inn whereagain in the hallshe had been briefly engaged with some people of his own ships company  nothing had actually passed between them and he would as little have been able to say what had been the sign of her face for him on the first occasion as to name the ground of his present recognition recognition at any rate appeared to prevail on her own side as wellwhich would only have added to the mystery  all she now began by saying to him nevertheless was that having chanced to catch his enquiry she was moved to ask by his leave if it were possibly a question of mr waymarsh of milrose connecticutmr waymarsh the american lawyer  oh yes he replied my very wellknown friend  hes to meet me here coming up from malvern and i supposed hed already have arrived but he doesnt come till later and im relieved not to have kept him do you know him strether wound up  it wasnt till after he had spoken that he became aware of how much there had been in him of response when the tone of her own rejoinder as well as the play of something more in her facesomething more that is than its apparently usual restless lightseemed to notify him ive met him at milrosewhere i used sometimes a good while ago to stay i had friends there who were friends of his and ive been at his house  i wont answer for it that he would know me strethers new acquaintance pursued but i should be delighted to see him  perhaps she added i shallfor im staying over  she paused while our friend took in these things and it was as if a good deal of talk had already passed they even vaguely smiled at it and strether presently observed that mr waymarsh would no doubt be easily to be seen this however appeared to affect the lady as if she might have advanced too far  she appeared to have no reserves about anything oh she said he wont careand she immediately thereupon remarked that she believed strether knew the munsters the munsters being the people he had seen her with at liverpool  but he didnt it happened know the munsters well enough to give the case much of a lift so that they were left together as if over the mere laid table of conversation  her qualification of the mentioned connexion had rather removed than placed a dish and there seemed nothing else to serve  their attitude remained none the less that of not forsaking the board and the effect of this in turn was to give them the appearance of having accepted each other with an absence of preliminaries practically complete  they moved along the hall together and strethers companion threw off that the hotel had the advantage of a garden  he was aware by this time of his strange inconsequence  he had shirked the intimacies of the steamer and had muffled the shock of waymarsh only to find himself forsaken in this sudden case both of avoidance and of caution  he passed under this unsought protection and before he had so much as gone up to his room into the garden of the hotel and at the end of ten minutes had agreed to meet there again as soon as he should have made himself tidy the dispenser of such good assurances  he wanted to look at the town and they would forthwith look together  it was almost as if she had been in possession and received him as a guest  her acquaintance with the place presented her in a manner as a hostess and strether had a rueful glance for the lady in the glass cage  it was as if this personage had seen herself instantly superseded  when in a quarter of an hour he came down what his hostess saw what she might have taken in with a vision kindly adjusted was the lean the slightly loose figure of a man of the middle height and something more perhaps than the middle agea man of fiveandfifty whose most immediate signs were a marked bloodless brownness of face a thick dark moustache of characteristically american cut growing strong and falling low a head of hair still abundant but irregularly streaked with grey and a nose of bold free prominence the even line the high finish as it might have been called of which had a certain effect of mitigation  a perpetual pair of glasses astride of this fine ridge and a line unusually deep and drawn the prolonged penstroke of time accompanying the curve of the moustache from nostril to chin did something to complete the facial furniture that an attentive observer would have seen catalogued on the spot in the vision of the other party to strethers appointment  she waited for him in the garden the other party drawing on a pair of singularly fresh soft and elastic light gloves and presenting herself with a superficial readiness which as he approached her over the small smooth lawn and in the watery english sunshine he might with his rougher preparation have marked as the model for such an occasion  she had this lady a perfect plain propriety an expensive subdued suitability that her companion was not free to analyse but that struck him so that his consciousness of it was instantly acute as a quality quite new to him  before reaching her he stopped on the grass and went through the form of feeling for something possibly forgotten in the light overcoat he carried on his arm yet the essence of the act was no more than the impulse to gain time  nothing could have been odder than strethers sense of himself as at that moment launched in something of which the sense would be quite disconnected from the sense of his past and which was literally beginning there and then it had begun in fact already upstairs and before the dressing glass that struck him as blocking further so strangely the dimness of the window of his dull bedroom begun with a sharper survey of the elements of appearance than he had for a long time been moved to make  he had during those moments felt these elements to be not so much to his hand as he should have liked and then had fallen back on the thought that they were precisely a matter as to which help was supposed to come from what he was about to do  he was about to go up to london so that hat and necktie might wait  what had come as straight to him as a ball in a wellplayed gameand caught moreover not less neatlywas just the air in the person of his friend of having seen and chosen the air of achieved possession of those vague qualities and quantities that collectively figured to him as the advantage snatched from lucky chances  without pomp or circumstance certainly as her original address to him equally with his own response had been he would have sketched to himself his impression of her as  well shes more thoroughly civilized if more thoroughly than whom would not have been for him a sequel to this remark that was just by reason of his deep consciousness of the bearing of his comparison  the amusement at all events of a civilisation intenser was whatfamiliar compatriot as she was with the full tone of the compatriot and the rattling link not with mystery but only with dear dyspeptic waymarshshe appeared distinctly to promise  his pause while he felt in his overcoat was positively the pause of confidence and it enabled his eyes to make out as much of a case for her in proportion as her own made out for himself  she affected him as almost insolently young but an easily carried fiveandthirty could still do that  she was however like himself marked and wan only it naturally couldnt have been known to him how much a spectator looking from one to the other might have discerned that they had in common  it wouldnt for such a spectator have been altogether insupposable that each so finely brown and so sharply spare each confessing so to dents of surface and aids to sight to a disproportionate nose and a head delicately or grossly grizzled they might have been brother and sister  on this ground indeed there would have been a residuum of difference such a sister having surely known in respect to such a brother the extremity of separation and such a brother now feeling in respect to such a sister the extremity of surprise  surprise it was true was not on the other hand what the eyes of strethers friend most showed him while she gave him stroking her gloves smoother the time he appreciated  they had taken hold of him straightway measuring him up and down as if they knew how as if he were human material they had already in some sort handled  their possessor was in truth it may be communicated the mistress of a hundred cases or categories receptacles of the mind subdivisions for convenience in which from a full experience she pigeonholed her fellow mortals with a hand as free as that of a compositor scattering type  she was as equipped in this particular as strether was the reverse and it made an opposition between them which he might well have shrunk from submitting to if he had fully suspected it  so far as he did suspect it he was on the contrary after a short shake of his consciousness as pleasantly passive as might be  he really had a sort of sense of what she knew he had quite the sense that she knew things he didnt and though this was a concession that in general he found not easy to make to women he made it now as goodhumouredly as if it lifted a burden  his eyes were so quiet behind his eternal nippers that they might almost have been absent without changing his face which took its expression mainly and not least its stamp of sensibility from other sources surface and grain and form  he joined his guide in an instant and then felt she had profited still better than he by his having been for the moments just mentioned so at the disposal of her intelligence  she knew even intimate things about him that he hadnt yet told her and perhaps never would  he wasnt unaware that he had told her rather remarkably many for the time but these were not the real ones  some of the real ones however precisely were what she knew  they were to pass again through the hall of the inn to get into the street and it was here she presently checked him with a question have you looked up my name  he could only stop with a laugh  have you looked up mine  oh dear yesas soon as you left me  i went to the office and asked hadnt you better do the same  he wondered  find out who you areafter the uplifted young woman there has seen us thus scrape acquaintance  she laughed on her side now at the shade of alarm in his amusement isnt it a reason the more  if what youre afraid of is the injury for memy being seen to walk off with a gentleman who has to ask who i ami assure you i dont in the least mind  here however she continued is my card and as i find theres something else again i have to say at the office you can just study it during the moment i leave you  she left him after he had taken from her the small pasteboard she had extracted from her pocketbook and he had extracted another from his own to exchange with it before she came back  he read thus the simple designation maria gostrey to which was attached in a corner of the card with a number the name of a street presumably in paris without other appreciable identity than its foreignness  he put the card into his waistcoat pocket keeping his own meanwhile in evidence and as he leaned against the doorpost he met with the smile of a straying thought what the expanse before the hotel offered to his view it was positively droll to him that he should already have maria gostrey whoever she wasof which he hadnt really the least ideain a place of safe keeping  he had somehow an assurance that he should carefully preserve the little token he had just tucked in  he gazed with unseeing lingering eyes as he followed some of the implications of his act asking himself if he really felt admonished to qualify it as disloyal  it was prompt it was possibly even premature and there was little doubt of the expression of face the sight of it would have produced in a certain person  but if it was wrongwhy then he had better not have come out at all  at this poor man had he alreadyand even before meeting waymarsharrived  he had believed he had a limit but the limit had been transcended within thirtysix hours  by how long a space on the plane of manners or even of morals moreover he felt still more sharply after maria gostrey had come back to him and with a gay decisive so now led him forth into the world this counted it struck him as he walked beside her with his overcoat on an arm his umbrella under another and his personal pasteboard a little stiffly retained between forefinger and thumb this struck him as really in comparison his introduction to things  it hadnt been europe at liverpool nonot even in the dreadful delightful impressive streets the night beforeto the extent his present companion made it so  she hadnt yet done that so much as when after their walk had lasted a few minutes and he had had time to wonder if a couple of sidelong glances from her meant that he had best have put on gloves she almost pulled him up with an amused challenge but whyfondly as its so easy to imagine your clinging to itdont you put it away  or if its an inconvenience to you to carry it ones often glad to have ones card back  the fortune one spends in them  then he saw both that his way of marching with his own prepared tribute had affected her as a deviation in one of those directions he couldnt yet measure and that she supposed this emblem to be still the one he had received from her  he accordingly handed her the card as if in restitution but as soon as she had it she felt the difference and with her eyes on it stopped short for apology i like she observed your name  oh he answered you wont have heard of it yet he had his reasons for not being sure but that she perhaps might  ah it was but too visible  she read it over again as one who had never seen it  mr lewis lambert strethershe sounded it almost as freely as for any stranger  she repeated however that she liked itparticularly the lewis lambert  its the name of a novel of balzacs  oh i know that said strether  but the novels an awfully bad one  i know that too strether smiled  to which he added with an irrelevance that was only superficial  i come from woollett massachusetts  it made her for some reasonthe irrelevance or whateverlaugh  balzac had described many cities but hadnt described woollett massachusetts  you say that she returned as if you wanted one immediately to know the worst  oh i think its a thing he said that you must already have made out  i feel it so that i certainly must look it speak it and as people say there act it  it sticks out of me and you knew surely for yourself as soon as you looked at me  the worst you mean  well the fact of where i come from  there at any rate it is so that you wont be able if anything happens to say ive not been straight with you  i seeand miss gostrey looked really interested in the point he had made  but what do you think of as happening  though he wasnt shywhich was rather anomalousstrether gazed about without meeting her eyes a motion that was frequent with him in talk yet of which his words often seemed not at all the effect why that you should find me too hopeless  with which they walked on again together while she answered as they went that the most hopeless of her countryfolk were in general precisely those she liked best  all sorts of other pleasant small thingssmall things that were yet large for himflowered in the air of the occasion but the bearing of the occasion itself on matters still remote concerns us too closely to permit us to multiply our illustrations two or three however in truth we should perhaps regret to lose the tortuous wallgirdle long since snapped of the little swollen city half held in place by careful civic handswanders in narrow file between parapets smoothed by peaceful generations pausing here and there for a dismantled gate or a bridged gap with rises and drops steps up and steps down queer twists queer contacts peeps into homely streets and under the brows of gables views of cathedral tower and waterside fields of huddled english town and ordered english country  too deep almost for words was the delight of these things to strether yet as deeply mixed with it were certain images of his inward picture  he had trod this walks in the faroff time at twentyfive but that instead of spoiling it only enriched it for present feeling and marked his renewal as a thing substantial enough to share  it was with waymarsh he should have shared it and he was now accordingly taking from him something that was his due  he looked repeatedly at his watch and when he had done so for the fifth time miss gostrey took him up  youre doing something that you think not right  it so touched the place that he quite changed colour and his laugh grew almost awkward  am i enjoying it as much as that  youre not enjoying it i think so much as you ought  i seehe appeared thoughtfully to agree  great is my privilege  oh its not your privilege  it has nothing to do with me  it has to do with yourself  your failures general  ah there you are he laughed  its the failure of woollett thats general  the failure to enjoy miss gostrey explained is what i mean  precisely  woollett isnt sure it ought to enjoy  if it were it would  but it hasnt poor thing strether continued any one to show it how  its not like me  i have somebody  they had stopped in the afternoon sunshineconstantly pausing in their stroll for the sharper sense of what they sawand strether rested on one of the high sides of the old stony groove of the little rampart  he leaned back on this support with his face to the tower of the cathedral now admirably commanded by their station the high redbrown mass square and subordinately spired and crocketed retouched and restored but charming to his longsealed eyes and with the first swallows of the year weaving their flight all round it  miss gostrey lingered near him full of an air to which she more and more justified her right of understanding the effect of things  she quite concurred  youve indeed somebody and she added  i wish you would let me show you how  oh im afraid of you he cheerfully pleaded  she kept on him a moment through her glasses and through his own a certain pleasant pointedness  ah no youre not youre not in the least thank goodness  if you had been we shouldnt so soon have found ourselves here together  i think she comfortably concluded you trust me  i think i dobut thats exactly what im afraid of  i shouldnt mind if i didnt  its falling thus in twenty minutes so utterly into your hands  i dare say strether continued its a sort of thing youre thoroughly familiar with but nothing more extraordinary has ever happened to me  she watched him with all her kindness  that means simply that youve recognised mewhich is rather beautiful and rare  you see what i am as on this however he protested with a goodhumoured headshake a resignation of any such claim she had a moment of explanation  if youll only come on further as you have come youll at any rate make out  my own fate has been too many for me and ive succumbed to it im a general guideto europe dont you know  i wait for peoplei put them through  i pick them upi set them down  im a sort of superior couriermaid im a companion at large  i take people as ive told you about  i never sought itit has come to me  it has been my fate and ones fate one accepts  its a dreadful thing to have to say in so wicked a world but i verily believe that such as you see me theres nothing i dont know  i know all the shops and the pricesbut i know worse things still  i bear on my back the huge load of our national consciousness or in other wordsfor it comes to thatof our nation itself  of what is our nation composed but of the men and women individually on my shoulders  i dont do it you know for any particular advantage  i dont do it for instancesome people do you knowfor money  strether could only listen and wonder and weigh his chance  and yet affected as you are then to so many of your clients you can scarcely be said to do it for love  he waited a moment  how do we reward you  she had her own hesitation but you dont she finally returned setting him again in motion  they went on but in a few minutes though while still thinking over what she had said he once more took out his watch mechanically unconsciously and as if made nervous by the mere exhilaration of what struck him as her strange and cynical wit  he looked at the hour without seeing it and then on something again said by his companion had another pause youre really in terror of him  he smiled a smile that he almost felt to be sickly  now you can see why im afraid of you  because ive such illuminations  why theyre all for your help its what i told you she added just now  you feel as if this were wrong  he fell back once more settling himself against the parapet as if to hear more about it  then get me out  her face fairly brightened for the joy of the appeal but as if it were a question of immediate action she visibly considered  out of waiting for himof seeing him at all  oh nonot that said poor strether looking grave  ive got to wait for himand i want very much to see him  but out of the terror you did put your finger on it a few minutes ago  its general but it avails itself of particular occasions  thats what its doing for me now  im always considering something else something else i mean than the thing of the moment  the obsession of the other thing is the terror  im considering at present for instance something else than you  she listened with charming earnestness  oh you oughtnt to do that  its what i admit  make it then impossible  she continued to think  is it really an order from youthat i shall take the job  will you give yourself up  poor strether heaved his sigh  if i only could but thats the deuce of itthat i never can  noi cant  she wasnt however discouraged  but you want to at least  oh unspeakably  ah then if youll tryand she took over the job as she had called it on the spot  trust me she exclaimed and the action of this as they retraced their steps was presently to make him pass his hand into her arm in the manner of a benign dependent paternal old person who wishes to be nice to a younger one  if he drew it out again indeed as they approached the inn this may have been because after more talk had passed between them the relation of age or at least of experiencewhich for that matter had already played to and fro with some freedomaffected him as incurring a readjustment  it was at all events perhaps lucky that they arrived in sufficiently separate fashion within range of the hoteldoor  the young lady they had left in the glass cage watched as if she had come to await them on the threshold at her side stood a person equally interested by his attitude in their return and the effect of the sight of whom was instantly to determine for strether another of those responsive arrests that we have had so repeatedly to note  he left it to miss gostrey to name with the fine full bravado as it almost struck him of her mr waymarsh what was to have been whathe more than ever felt as his short stare of suspended welcome took things inwould have been but for herself his doom  it was already upon him even at that distancemr waymarsh was for his part joyless    ii  he had none the less to confess to this friend that evening that he knew almost nothing about her and it was a deficiency that waymarsh even with his memory refreshed by contact by her own prompt and lucid allusions and enquiries by their having publicly partaken of dinner in her company and by another stroll to which she was not a stranger out into the town to look at the cathedral by moonlightit was a blank that the resident of milrose though admitting acquaintance with the munsters professed himself unable to fill  he had no recollection of miss gostrey and two or three questions that she put to him about those members of his circle had to strethers observation the same effect he himself had already more directly feltthe effect of appearing to place all knowledge for the time on this original womans side  it interested him indeed to mark the limits of any such relation for her with his friend as there could possibly be a question of and it particularly struck him that they were to be marked altogether in waymarshs quarter  this added to his own sense of having gone far with hergave him an early illustration of a much shorter course  there was a certitude he immediately graspeda conviction that waymarsh would quite fail as it were and on whatever degree of acquaintances to profit by her  there had been after the first interchange among the three a talk of some five minutes in the hall and then the two men had adjourned to the garden miss gostrey for the time disappearing strether in due course accompanied his friend to the room he had bespoken and had before going out scrupulously visited where at the end of another halfhour he had no less discreetly left him on leaving him he repaired straight to his own room but with the prompt effect of feeling the compass of that chamber resented by his condition  there he enjoyed at once the first consequence of their reunion  a place was too small for him after it that had seemed large enough before  he had awaited it with something he would have been sorry have been almost ashamed not to recognise as emotion yet with a tacit assumption at the same time that emotion would in the event find itself relieved  the actual oddity was that he was only more excited and his excitementto which indeed he would have found it difficult instantly to give a namebrought him once more downstairs and caused him for some minutes vaguely to wander  he went once more to the garden he looked into the public room found miss gostrey writing letters and backed out he roamed fidgeted and wasted time but he was to have his more intimate session with his friend before the evening closed  it was latenot till strether had spent an hour upstairs with himthat this subject consented to betake himself to doubtful rest dinner and the subsequent stroll by moonlighta dream on strethers part of romantic effects rather prosaically merged in a mere missing of thicker coatshad measurably intervened and this midnight conference was the result of waymarshs having when they were free as he put it of their fashionable friend found the smokingroom not quite what he wanted and yet bed what he wanted less  his most frequent form of words was that he knew himself and they were applied on this occasion to his certainty of not sleeping  he knew himself well enough to know that he should have a night of prowling unless he should succeed as a preliminary in getting prodigiously tired  if the effort directed to this end involved till a late hour the presence of stretherconsisted that is in the detention of the latter for full discoursethere was yet an impression of minor discipline involved for our friend in the picture waymarsh made as he sat in trousers and shirt on the edge of his couch  with his long legs extended and his large back much bent he nursed alternately for an almost incredible time his elbows and his beard  he struck his visitor as extremely as almost wilfully uncomfortable yet what had this been for strether from that first glimpse of him disconcerted in the porch of the hotel but the predominant notes  the discomfort was in a manner contagious as well as also in a manner inconsequent and unfounded the visitor felt that unless he should get used to itor unless waymarsh himself shouldit would constitute a menace for his own prepared his own already confirmed consciousness of the agreeable  on their first going up together to the room strether had selected for him waymarsh had looked it over in silence and with a sigh that represented for his companion if not the habit of disapprobation at least the despair of felicity and this look had recurred to strether as the key of much he had since observed europe he had begun to gather from these things had up to now rather failed of its message to him he hadnt got into tune with it and had at the end of three months almost renounced any such expectation  he really appeared at present to insist on that by just perching there with the gas in his eyes  this of itself somehow conveyed the futility of single rectifications in a multiform failure  he had a large handsome head and a large sallow seamed facea striking significant physiognomic total the upper range of which the great political brow the thick loose hair the dark fuliginous eyes recalled even to a generation whose standard had dreadfully deviated the impressive image familiar by engravings and busts of some great national worthy of the earlier part of the midcentury he was of the personal typeand it was an element in the power and promise that in their early time strether had found in himof the american statesman the statesman trained in congressional halls of an elder day  the legend had been in later years that as the lower part of his face which was weak and slightly crooked spoiled the likeness this was the real reason for the growth of his beard which might have seemed to spoil it for those not in the secret  he shook his mane he fixed with his admirable eyes his auditor or his observer he wore no glasses and had a way partly formidable yet also partly encouraging as from a representative to a constituent of looking very hard at those who approached him he met you as if you had knocked and he had bidden you enter strether who hadnt seen him for so long an interval apprehended him now with a freshness of taste and had perhaps never done him such ideal justice  the head was bigger the eyes finer than they need have been for the career but that only meant after all that the career was itself expressive  what it expressed at midnight in the gasglaring bedroom at chester was that the subject of it had at the end of years barely escaped by flight in time a general nervous collapse  but this very proof of the full life as the full life was understood at milrose would have made to strethers imagination an element in which waymarsh could have floated easily had he only consented to float  alas nothing so little resembled floating as the rigour with which on the edge of his bed he hugged his posture of prolonged impermanence  it suggested to his comrade something that always when kept up worried hima person established in a railwaycoach with a forward inclination  it represented the angle at which poor waymarsh was to sit through the ordeal of europe  thanks to the stress of occupation the strain of professions the absorption and embarrassment of each they had not at home during years before this sudden brief and almost bewildering reign of comparative ease found so much as a day for a meeting a fact that was in some degree an explanation of the sharpness with which most of his friends features stood out to strether  those he had lost sight of since the early time came back to him others that it was never possible to forget struck him now as sitting clustered and expectant like a somewhat defiant familygroup on the doorstep of their residence  the room was narrow for its length and the occupant of the bed thrust so far a pair of slippered feet that the visitor had almost to step over them in his recurrent rebounds from his chair to fidget back and forth  there were marks the friends made on things to talk about and on things not to and one of the latter in particular fell like the tap of chalk on the blackboard married at thirty waymarsh had not lived with his wife for fifteen years and it came up vividly between them in the glare of the gas that strether wasnt to ask about her  he knew they were still separate and that she lived at hotels travelled in europe painted her face and wrote her husband abusive letters of not one of which to a certainty that sufferer spared himself the perusal but he respected without difficulty the cold twilight that had settled on this side of his companions life  it was a province in which mystery reigned and as to which waymarsh had never spoken the informing word  strether who wanted to do him the highest justice wherever he could do it singularly admired him for the dignity of this reserve and even counted it as one of the groundsgrounds all handled and numberedfor ranking him in the range of their acquaintance as a success  he was a success waymarsh in spite of overwork or prostration of sensible shrinkage of his wifes letters and of his not liking europe  strether would have reckoned his own career less futile had he been able to put into it anything so handsome as so much fine silence  one might ones self easily have left mrs waymarsh and one would assuredly have paid ones tribute to the ideal in covering with that attitude the derision of having been left by her her husband had held his tongue and had made a large income and these were in especial the achievements as to which strether envied him  our friend had had indeed on his side too a subject for silence which he fully appreciated but it was a matter of a different sort and the figure of the income he had arrived at had never been high enough to look any one in the face  i dont know as i quite see what you require it for  you dont appear sick to speak of  it was of europe waymarsh thus finally spoke  well said strether who fell as much as possible into step i guess i dont feel sick now that ive started  but i had pretty well run down before i did start  waymarsh raised his melancholy look  aint you about up to your usual average  it was not quite pointedly sceptical but it seemed somehow a plea for the purest veracity and it thereby affected our friend as the very voice of milrose  he had long since made a mental distinctionthough never in truth daring to betray itbetween the voice of milrose and the voice even of woollett  it was the former he felt that was most in the real tradition  there had been occasions in his past when the sound of it had reduced him to temporary confusion and the present for some reason suddenly became such another  it was nevertheless no light matter that the very effect of his confusion should be to make him again prevaricate  that description hardly does justice to a man to whom it has done such a lot of good to see you  waymarsh fixed on his washingstand the silent detached stare with which milrose in person as it were might have marked the unexpectedness of a compliment from woollett and strether for his part felt once more like woollett in person  i mean his friend presently continued that your appearance isnt as bad as ive seen it  it compares favourably with what it was when i last noticed it on this appearance waymarshs eyes yet failed to rest it was almost as if they obeyed an instinct of propriety and the effect was still stronger when always considering the basin and jug he added  youve filled out some since then  im afraid i have strether laughed  one does fill out some with all one takes in and ive taken in i dare say more than ive natural room for  i was dogtired when i sailed  it had the oddest sound of cheerfulness  i was dogtired his companion returned when i arrived and its this wild hunt for rest that takes all the life out of me  the fact is stretherand its a comfort to have you here at last to say it to though i dont know after all that ive really waited ive told it to people ive met in the carsthe fact is such a country as this aint my kind of country anyway  there aint a country ive seen over here that does seem my kind  oh i dont say but what there are plenty of pretty places and remarkable old things but the trouble is that i dont seem to feel anywhere in tune  thats one of the reasons why i suppose ive gained so little  i havent had the first sign of that lift i was led to expect  with this he broke out more earnestly look herei want to go back  his eyes were all attached to strethers now for he was one of the men who fully face you when they talk of themselves  this enabled his friend to look at him hard and immediately to appear to the highest advantage in his eyes by doing so  thats a genial thing to say to a fellow who has come out on purpose to meet you  nothing could have been finer on this than waymarshs sombre glow have you come out on purpose  wellvery largely  i thought from the way you wrote there was something back of it  strether hesitated  back of my desire to be with you  back of your prostration  strether with a smile made more dim by a certain consciousness shook his head  there are all the causes of it  and no particular cause that seemed most to drive you  our friend could at last conscientiously answer  yes  one  there is a matter that has had much to do with my coming out  waymarsh waited a little  too private to mention  no not too privatefor you  only rather complicated  well said waymarsh who had waited again i may lose my mind over here but i dont know as ive done so yet  oh you shall have the whole thing  but not tonight  waymarsh seemed to sit stiffer and to hold his elbows tighter  why notif i cant sleep  because my dear man i can  then wheres your prostration  just in thatthat i can put in eight hours  and strether brought it out that if waymarsh didnt gain it was because he didnt go to bed the result of which was in its order that to do the latter justice he permitted his friend to insist on his really getting settled strether with a kind coercive hand for it assisted him to this consummation and again found his own part in their relation auspiciously enlarged by the smaller touches of lowering the lamp and seeing to a sufficiency of blanket  it somehow ministered for him to indulgence to feel waymarsh who looked unnaturally big and black in bed as much tucked in as a patient in a hospital and with his covering up to his chin as much simplified by it he hovered in vague pity to be brief while his companion challenged him out of the bedclothes  is she really after you  is that whats behind  strether felt an uneasiness at the direction taken by his companions insight but he played a little at uncertainty  behind my coming out  behind your prostration or whatever  its generally felt you know that she follows you up pretty close  strethers candour was never very far off  oh it has occurred to you that im literally running away from mrs newsome  well i havent known but what you are  youre a very attractive man strether  youve seen for yourself said waymarsh what that lady downstairs makes of it  unless indeed he rambled on with an effect between the ironic and the anxious its you who are after her  is mrs newsome over here  he spoke as with a droll dread of her  it made his friendthough rather dimlysmile  dear no shes safe thank goodnessas i think i more and more feelat home  she thought of coming but she gave it up  ive come in a manner instead of her and come to that extentfor youre right in your inferenceon her business  so you see there is plenty of connexion  waymarsh continued to see at least all there was  involving accordingly the particular one ive referred to  strether took another turn about the room giving a twitch to his companions blanket and finally gaining the door  his feeling was that of a nurse who had earned personal rest by having made everything straight  involving more things than i can think of breaking ground on now  but dont be afraidyou shall have them from me  youll probably find yourself having quite as much of them as you can do with i shallif we keep togethervery much depend on your impression of some of them  waymarshs acknowledgement of this tribute was characteristically indirect  you mean to say you dont believe we will keep together  i only glance at the danger strether paternally said because when i hear you wail to go back i seem to see you open up such possibilities of folly  waymarsh took itsilent a littlelike a large snubbed child what are you going to do with me  it was the very question strether himself had put to miss gostrey and he wondered if he had sounded like that  but he at least could be more definite  im going to take you right down to london  oh ive been down to london waymarsh more softly moaned  ive no use strether for anything down there  well said strether goodhumouredly i guess youve some use for me  so ive got to go  oh youve got to go further yet  well waymarsh sighed do your damnedest only you will tell me before you lead me on all the way  our friend had again so lost himself both for amusement and for contrition in the wonder of whether he had made in his own challenge that afternoon such another figure that he for an instant missed the thread  tell you  why what youve got on hand  strether hesitated  why its such a matter as that even if i positively wanted i shouldnt be able to keep it from you  waymarsh gloomily gazed  what does that mean then but that your trip is just for her  for mrs newsome  oh it certainly is as i say  very much  then why do you also say its for me  strether in impatience violently played with his latch  its simple enough  its for both of you  waymarsh at last turned over with a groan  well i wont marry you  neither when it comes to that but the visitor had already laughed and escaped    iii  he had told miss gostrey he should probably take for departure with waymarsh some afternoon train and it thereupon in the morning appeared that this lady had made her own plan for an earlier one  she had breakfasted when strether came into the coffeeroom but waymarsh not having yet emerged he was in time to recall her to the terms of their understanding and to pronounce her discretion overdone  she was surely not to break away at the very moment she had created a want  he had met her as she rose from her little table in a window where with the morning papers beside her she reminded him as he let her know of major pendennis breakfasting at his cluba compliment of which she professed a deep appreciation and he detained her as pleadingly as if he had alreadyand notably under pressure of the visions of the nightlearned to be unable to do without her  she must teach him at all events before she went to order breakfast as breakfast was ordered in europe and she must especially sustain him in the problem of ordering for waymarsh  the latter had laid upon his friend by desperate sounds through the door of his room dreadful divined responsibilities in respect to beefsteak and orangesresponsibilities which miss gostrey took over with an alertness of action that matched her quick intelligence  she had before this weaned the expatriated from traditions compared with which the matutinal beefsteak was but the creature of an hour and it was not for her with some of her memories to falter in the path though she freely enough declared on reflexion that there was always in such cases a choice of opposed policies there are times when to give them their head you know  they had gone to wait together in the garden for the dressing of the meal and strether found her more suggestive than ever well what  is to bring about for them such a complexity of relationsunless indeed we call it a simplicitythat the situation has to wind itself up  they want to go back  and you want them to go strether gaily concluded  i always want them to go and i send them as fast as i can  oh i knowyou take them to liverpool  any port will serve in a storm  imwith all my other functionsan agent for repatriation  i want to repeople our stricken country what will become of it else  i want to discourage others  the ordered english garden in the freshness of the day  was delightful to strether who liked the sound under his feet of the tight fine gravel packed with the chronic damp and who had the idlest eye for the deep smoothness of turf and the clean curves of paths other people  other countries  other peopleyes  i want to encourage our own  strether wondered  not to come  why then do you meet  themsince it doesnt appear to be to stop them  oh that they shouldnt come is as yet too much to ask  what i attend to is that they come quickly and return still more so  i meet them to help it to be over as soon as possible  and though i dont stop them ive my way of putting them through  thats my little system and if you want to know  said maria gostrey its my real secret my innermost mission and use  i only seem you see to beguile and approve but ive thought it all out and im working all the while underground  i cant perhaps quite give you my formula but i think that practically i succeed  i send you back spent  so you stay back passed through my hands  we dont turn up again  the further she went the further he always saw himself able to follow  i dont want your formulai feel quite enough as i hinted yesterday your abysses  spent he echoed  if thats how youre arranging so subtly to send me i thank you for the warning  for a minute amid the pleasantnesspoetry in tariffed items but all the more for guests already convicted a challenge to consumptionthey smiled at each other in confirmed fellowship  do you call it subtly its a plain poor tale  besides youre a special case  oh special casesthats weak she was weak enough further still to defer her journey and agree to accompany the gentlemen on their own might a separate carriage mark her independence though it was in spite of this to befall after luncheon that she went off alone and that with a tryst taken for a day of her company in london they lingered another night  she had during the morningspent in a way that he was to remember later on as the very climax of his foretaste as warm with presentiments with what he would have called collapseshad all sorts of things out with strether and among them the fact that though there was never a moment of her life when she wasnt due somewhere there was yet scarce a perfidy to others of which she wasnt capable for his sake  she explained moreover that wherever she happened to be she found a dropped thread to pick up a ragged edge to repair some familiar appetite in ambush jumping out as she approached yet appeasable with a temporary biscuit  it became on her taking the risk of the deviation imposed on him by her insidious arrangement of his morning meal a point of honour for her not to fail with waymarsh of the larger success too and her subsequent boast to strether was that she had made their friend fareand quite without his knowing what was the matteras major pendennis would have fared at the megatherium she had made him breakfast like a gentleman and it was nothing she forcibly asserted to what she would yet make him do  she made him participate in the slow reiterated ramble with which for strether the new day amply filled itself and it was by her art that he somehow had the air on the ramparts and in the rows of carrying a point of his own  the three strolled and stared and gossiped or at least the two did the case really yielding for their comrade if analysed but the element of stricken silence  this element indeed affected strether as charged with audible rumblings but he was conscious of the care of taking it explicitly as a sign of pleasant peace  he wouldnt appeal too much for that provoked stiffness yet he wouldnt be too freely tacit for that suggested giving up waymarsh himself adhered to an ambiguous dumbness that might have represented either the growth of a perception or the despair of one and at times and in placeswhere the lowbrowed galleries were darkest the opposite gables queerest the solicitations of every kind densestthe others caught him fixing hard some object of minor interest fixing even at moments nothing discernible as if he were indulging it with a truce  when he met strethers eye on such occasions he looked guilty and furtive fell the next minute into some attitude of retractation  our friend couldnt show him the right things for fear of provoking some total renouncement and was tempted even to show him the wrong in order to make him differ with triumph  there were moments when he himself felt shy of professing the full sweetness of the taste of leisure and there were others when he found himself feeling as if his passages of interchange with the lady at his side might fall upon the third member of their party very much as mr burchell at dr primroses fireside was influenced by the high flights of the visitors from london  the smallest things so arrested and amused him that he repeatedly almost apologisedbrought up afresh in explanation his plea of a previous grind  he was aware at the same time that his grind had been as nothing to waymarshs and he repeatedly confessed that to cover his frivolity he was doing his best for his previous virtue  do what he might in any case his previous virtue was still there and it seemed fairly to stare at him out of the windows of shops that were not as the shops of woollett fairly to make him want things that he shouldnt know what to do with  it was by the oddest the least admissible of laws demoralising him now and the way it boldly took was to make him want more wants these first walks in europe were in fact a kind of finely lurid intimation of what one might find at the end of that process  had he come back after long years in something already so like the evening of life only to be exposed to it  it was at all events over the shopwindows that he made with waymarsh most free though it would have been easier had not the latter most sensibly yielded to the appeal of the merely useful trades  he pierced with his sombre detachment the plateglass of ironmongers and saddlers while strether flaunted an affinity with the dealers in stamped letterpaper and in smart neckties  strether was in fact recurrently shameless in the presence of the tailors though it was just over the heads of the tailors that his countryman most loftily looked  this gave miss gostrey a grasped opportunity to back up waymarsh at his expense  the weary lawyerit was unmistakeablehad a conception of dress but that in view of some of the features of the effect produced was just what made the danger of insistence on it  strether wondered if he by this time thought miss gostrey less fashionable or lambert strether more so and it appeared probable that most of the remarks exchanged between this latter pair about passers figures faces personal types exemplified in their degree the disposition to talk as society talked  was what was happening to himself then was what already had happened really that a woman of fashion was floating him into society and that an old friend deserted on the brink was watching the force of the current  when the woman of fashion permitted stretheras she permitted him at the mostthe purchase of a pair of gloves the terms she made about it the prohibition of neckties and other items till she should be able to guide him through the burlington arcade were such as to fall upon a sensitive ear as a challenge to just imputations  miss gostrey was such a woman of fashion as could make without a symptom of vulgar blinking an appointment for the burlington arcade  mere discriminations about a pair of gloves could thus at any rate representalways for such sensitive ears as were in questionpossibilities of something that strether could make a mark against only as the peril of apparent wantonness  he had quite the consciousness of his new friend for their companion that he might have had of a jesuit in petticoats a representative of the recruiting interests of the catholic church  the catholic church for waymarshthat was to say the enemy the monster of bulging eyes and farreaching quivering groping tentacleswas exactly society exactly the multiplication of shibboleths exactly the discrimination of types and tones exactly the wicked old rows of chester rank with feudalism exactly in short europe  there was light for observation however in an incident that occurred just before they turned back to luncheon  waymarsh had been for a quarter of an hour exceptionally mute and distant and something or otherstrether was never to make out exactly whatproved as it were too much for him after his comrades had stood for three minutes taking in while they leaned on an old balustrade that guarded the edge of the row a particularly crooked and huddled streetview  he thinks us sophisticated he thinks us worldly he thinks us wicked he thinks us all sorts of queer things strether reflected for wondrous were the vague quantities our friend had within a couple of short days acquired the habit of conveniently and conclusively lumping together there seemed moreover a direct connexion between some such inference and a sudden grim dash taken by waymarsh to the opposite side  this movement was startlingly sudden and his companions at first supposed him to have espied to be pursuing the glimpse of an acquaintance they next made out however that an open door had instantly received him and they then recognised him as engulfed in the establishment of a jeweller behind whose glittering front he was lost to view  the fact had somehow the note of a demonstration and it left each of the others to show a face almost of fear  but miss gostrey broke into a laugh whats the matter with him  well said strether he cant stand it  but cant stand what  anything  europe  then how will that jeweller help him  strether seemed to make it out from their position between the interstices of arrayed watches of closehung dangling gewgaws youll see  ah thats just whatif he buys anythingim afraid of  that i shall see something rather dreadful  strether studied the finer appearances  he may buy everything  then dont you think we ought to follow him  not for worlds  besides we cant  were paralysed  we exchange a long scared look we publicly tremble  the thing is you see we realise he has struck for freedom  she wondered but she laughed  ah what a price to pay and i was preparing some for him so cheap  no no strether went on frankly amused now dont call it that the kind of freedom you deal in is dear  then as to justify himself am i not in my way trying it  its this  being here you mean with me  yes and talking to you as i do  ive known you a few hours and ive known him all my life so that if the ease i thus take with you about him isnt magnificentand the thought of it held him a momentwhy its rather base  its magnificent said miss gostrey to make an end of it  and you should hear she added the ease i takeand i above all intend to takewith mr waymarsh  strether thought  about me  ah thats no equivalent the equivalent would be waymarshs himself serving me uphis remorseless analysis of me  and hell never do thathe was sadly clear  hell never remorselessly analyse me he quite held her with the authority of this  hell never say a word to you about me  she took it in she did it justice yet after an instant her reason her restless irony disposed of it  of course he wont for what do you take people that theyre able to say words about anything able remorselessly to analyse  there are not many like you and me  it will be only because hes too stupid  it stirred in her friend a sceptical echo which was at the same time the protest of the faith of years  waymarsh stupid  compared with you  strether had still his eyes on the jewellers front and he waited a moment to answer  hes a success of a kind that i havent approached  do you mean he has made money  he makes itto my belief  and i said strether though with a back quite as bent have never made anything  im a perfectly equipped failure  he feared an instant shed ask him if he meant he was poor and he was glad she didnt for he really didnt know to what the truth on this unpleasant point mightnt have prompted her  she only however confirmed his assertion  thank goodness youre a failureits why i so distinguish you anything else today is too hideous  look about youlook at the successes  would you be one on your honour  look moreover she continued at me  for a little accordingly their eyes met  i see strether returned you too are out of it  the superiority you discern in me she concurred announces my futility  if you knew she sighed the dreams of my youth but our realities are what has brought us together  were beaten brothers in arms  he smiled at her kindly enough but he shook his head  it doesnt alter the fact that youre expensive  youve cost me already  but he had hung fire  cost you what  well my pastin one great lump  but no matter he laughed ill pay with my last penny  her attention had unfortunately now been engaged by their comrades return for waymarsh met their view as he came out of his shop  i hope he hasnt paid she said with his last though im convinced he has been splendid and has been so for you  ah nonot that  then for me  quite as little  waymarsh was by this time near enough to show signs his friend could read though he seemed to look almost carefully at nothing in particular  then for himself  for nobody  for nothing  for freedom  but what has freedom to do with it  strethers answer was indirect  to be as good as you and me  but different  she had had time to take in their companions face and with it as such things were easy for her she took in all  differentyes but better  if waymarsh was sombre he was also indeed almost sublime  he told them nothing left his absence unexplained and though they were convinced he had made some extraordinary purchase they were never to learn its nature  he only glowered grandly at the tops of the old gables  its the sacred rage strether had had further time to say and this sacred rage was to become between them for convenient comprehension the description of one of his periodical necessities  it was strether who eventually contended that it did make him better than they  but by that time miss gostrey was convinced that she didnt want to be better than strether      book second     i   those occasions on which strether was in association with the exile from milrose to see the sacred rage glimmer through would doubtless have their due periodicity but our friend had meanwhile to find names for many other matters  on no evening of his life perhaps as he reflected had he had to supply so many as on the third of his short stay in london an evening spent by miss gostreys side at one of the theatres to which he had found himself transported without his own hand raised on the mere expression of a conscientious wonder  she knew her theatre she knew her play as she had triumphantly known three days running everything else and the moment filled to the brim for her companion that apprehension of the interesting which whether or no the interesting happened to filter through his guide strained now to its limits his brief opportunity  waymarsh hadnt come with them he had seen plays enough he signified before strether had joined himan affirmation that had its full force when his friend ascertained by questions that he had seen two and a circus questions as to what he had seen had on him indeed an effect only less favourable than questions as to what he hadnt  he liked the former to be discriminated but how could it be done strether asked of their constant counsellor without discriminating the latter  miss gostrey had dined with him at his hotel face to face over a small table on which the lighted candles had rosecoloured shades and the rosecoloured shades and the small table and the soft fragrance of the ladyhad anything to his mere sense ever been so softwere so many touches in he scarce knew what positive high picture  he had been to the theatre even to the opera in boston with mrs newsome more than once acting as her only escort but there had been no little confronted dinner no pink lights no whiff of vague sweetness as a preliminary one of the results of which was that at present mildly rueful though with a sharpish accent he actually asked himself why there hadnt there was much the same difference in his impression of the noticed state of his companion whose dress was cut down as he believed the term to be in respect to shoulders and bosom in a manner quite other than mrs newsomes and who wore round her throat a broad red velvet band with an antique jewelhe was rather complacently sure it was antiqueattached to it in front  mrs newsomes dress was never in any degree cut down and she never wore round her throat a broad red velvet band  if she had moreover would it ever have served so to carry on and complicate as he now almost felt his vision  it would have been absurd of him to trace into ramifications the effect of the ribbon from which miss gostreys trinket depended had he not for the hour at the best been so given over to uncontrolled perceptions  what was it but an uncontrolled perception that his friends velvet band somehow added in her appearance to the value of every other itemto that of her smile and of the way she carried her head to that of her complexion of her lips her teeth her eyes her hair  what certainly had a man conscious of a mans work in the world to do with red velvet bands he wouldnt for anything have so exposed himself as to tell miss gostrey how much he liked hers yet he had none the less not only caught himself in the actfrivolous no doubt idiotic and above all unexpectedof liking it  he had in addition taken it as a startingpoint for fresh backward fresh forward fresh lateral flights  the manner in which mrs newsomes throat was encircled suddenly represented for him in an alien order almost as many things as the manner in which miss gostreys was  mrs newsome wore at operatic hours a black silk dressvery handsome he knew it was handsomeand an ornament that his memory was able further to identify as a ruche  he had his association indeed with the ruche but it was rather imperfectly romantic  he had once said to the wearerand it was as free a remark as he had ever made to herthat she looked with her ruff and other matters like queen elizabeth and it had after this in truth been his fancy that as a consequence of that tenderness and an acceptance of the idea the form of this special tribute to the frill had grown slightly more marked  the connexion as he sat there and let his imagination roam was to strike him as vaguely pathetic but there it all was and pathetic was doubtless in the conditions the best thing it could possibly be  it had assuredly existed at any rate for it seemed now to come over him that no gentleman of his age at woollett could ever to a lady of mrs newsomes which was not much less than his have embarked on such a simile  all sorts of things in fact now seemed to come over him comparatively few of which his chronicler can hope for space to mention  it came over him for instance that miss gostrey looked perhaps like mary stuart  lambert strether had a candour of fancy which could rest for an instant gratified in such an antithesis  it came over him that never beforeno literally neverhad a lady dined with him at a public place before going to the play  the publicity of the place was just in the matter for strether the rare strange thing it affected him almost as the achievement of privacy might have affected a man of a different experience  he had married in the faraway years so young as to have missed the time natural in boston for taking girls to the museum and it was absolutely true of hint thateven after the close of the period of conscious detachment occupying the centre of his life the grey middle desert of the two deaths that of his wife and that ten years later of his boyhe had never taken any one anywhere  it came over him in especialthough the monition had as happened already sounded fitfully gleamed in other formsthat the business he had come out on hadnt yet been so brought home to him as by the sight of the people about him  she gave him the impression his friend at first more straight than he got it for himselfgave it simply by saying with offhand illumination  oh yes theyre typesbut after he had taken it he made to the full his own use of it both while he kept silence for the four acts and while he talked in the intervals it was an evening it was a world of types and this was a connexion above all in which the figures and faces in the stalls were interchangeable with those on the stage  he felt as if the play itself penetrated him with the naked elbow of his neighbour a great stripped handsome redhaired lady who conversed with a gentleman on her other side in stray dissyllables which had for his ear in the oddest way in the world so much sound that he wondered they hadnt more sense and he recognised by the same law beyond the footlights what he was pleased to take for the very flush of english life  he had distracted drops in which he couldnt have said if it were actors or auditors who were most true and the upshot of which each time was the consciousness of new contacts  however he viewed his job it was types he should have to tackle  those before him and around him were not as the types of woollett where for that matter it had begun to seem to him that there must only have been the male and the female these made two exactly even with the individual varieties here on the other hand apart from the personal and the sexual rangewhich might be greater or lessa series of strong stamps had been applied as it were from without stamps that his observation played with as before a glass case on a table it might have passed from medal to medal and from copper to gold  it befell that in the drama precisely there was a bad woman in a yellow frock who made a pleasant weak goodlooking young man in perpetual evening dress do the most dreadful things  strether felt himself on the whole not afraid of the yellow frock but he was vaguely anxious over a certain kindness into which he found himself drifting for its victim  he hadnt come out he reminded himself to be too kind or indeed to be kind at all to chadwick newsome  would chad also be in perpetual evening dress he somehow rather hoped itit seemed so to add to this young mans general amenability though he wondered too if to fight him with his own weapons he himself a thought almost startling would have likewise to be  this young man furthermore would have been much more easy to handleat least for himthan appeared probable in respect to chad  it came up for him with miss gostrey that there were things of which she would really perhaps after all have heard and she admitted when a little pressed that she was never quite sure of what she heard as distinguished from things such as on occasions like the present she only extravagantly guessed  i seem with this freedom you see to have guessed mr chad  hes a young man on whose head high hopes are placed at woollett a young man a wicked woman has got hold of and whom his family over there have sent you out to rescue  youve accepted the mission of separating him from the wicked woman  are you quite sure shes very bad for him  something in his manner showed it as quite pulling him up  of course we are  wouldnt you be  oh i dont know  one never doesdoes onebeforehand  one can only judge on the facts  yours are quite new to me im really not in the least as you see in possession of them  so it will be awfully interesting to have them from you  if youre satisfied thats all thats required  i mean if youre sure you are sure sure it wont do  that he should lead such a life  rather  oh but i dont know you see about his life youve not told me about his life  she may be charminghis life  charmingstrether stared before him  shes base venalout of the streets  i see  and he  chad wretched boy  of what type and temper is he she went on as strether had lapsed  wellthe obstinate  it was as if for a moment he had been going to say more and had then controlled himself  that was scarce what she wished  do you like him  this time he was prompt  no  how can i  do you mean because of your being so saddled with him  im thinking of his mother said strether after a moment  he has darkened her admirable life  he spoke with austerity  he has worried her half to death  oh thats of course odious  she had a pause as if for renewed emphasis of this truth but it ended on another note  is her life very admirable  extraordinarily  there was so much in the tone that miss gostrey had to devote another pause to the appreciation of it  and has he only her  i dont mean the bad woman in paris she quickly addedfor i assure you i shouldnt even at the best be disposed to allow him more than one  but has he only his mother  he has also a sister older than himself and married and theyre both remarkably fine women  very handsome you mean  this promptitudealmost as he might have thought this precipitation gave him a brief drop but he came up again mrs newsome i think is handsome though shes not of course with a son of twentyeight and a daughter of thirty in her very first youth  she married however extremely young  and is wonderful miss gostrey asked for her age  strether seemed to feel with a certain disquiet the pressure of it i dont say shes wonderful  or rather he went on the next moment i do say it  its exactly what she iswonderful  but i wasnt thinking of her appearance he explainedstriking as that doubtless is  i was thinkingwell of many other things  he seemed to look at these as if to mention some of them then took pulling himself up another turn  about mrs pocock people may differ  is that the daughters namepocock  thats the daughters name strether sturdily confessed  and people may differ you mean about her beauty  about everything  but you admire her  he gave his friend a glance as to show how he could bear this im perhaps a little afraid of her  oh said miss gostrey i see her from here you may say then i see very fast and very far but ive already shown you i do  the young man and the two ladies she went on are at any rate all the family  quite all  his father has been dead ten years and theres no brother nor any other sister  theyd do said strether anything in the world for him  and youd do anything in the world for them  he shifted again she had made it perhaps just a shade too affirmative for his nerves  oh i dont know  youd do at any rate this and the anything theyd do is represented by their making you do it  ah they couldnt have comeeither of them  theyre very busy people and mrs newsome in particular has a large full life  shes moreover highly nervousand not at all strong  you mean shes an american invalid  he carefully distinguished  theres nothing she likes less than to be called one but she would consent to be one of those things i think he laughed if it were the only way to be the other  consent to be an american in order to be an invalid  no said strether the other way round  shes at any rate delicate sensitive highstrung  she puts so much of herself into everything  ah maria knew these things  that she has nothing left for anything else  of course she hasnt  to whom do you say it  highstrung dont i spend my life for them jamming down the pedal  i see moreover how it has told on you  strether took this more lightly  oh i jam down the pedal too  well she lucidly returned we must from this moment bear on it together with all our might  and she forged ahead  have they money  but it was as if while her energetic image still held him her enquiry fell short  mrs newsome he wished further to explain hasnt moreover your courage on the question of contact  if she had come it would have been to see the person herself  the woman  ah but thats courage  noits exaltation which is a very different thing  courage he however accommodatingly threw out is what you have  she shook her head  you say that only to patch me upto cover the nudity of my want of exaltation  ive neither the one nor the other ive mere battered indifference  i see that what you mean miss gostrey pursued is that if your friend had come she would take great views and the great views to put it simply would be too much for her  strether looked amused at her notion of the simple but he adopted her formula  everythings too much for her  ah then such a service as this of yours  is more for her than anything else  yesfar more  but so long as it isnt too much for me  her condition doesnt matter  surely not we leave her condition out we take it that is for granted  i see it her condition as behind and beneath you yet at the same time i see it as bearing you up  oh it does bear me up strether laughed  well then as yours bears me nothing mores needed  with which she put again her question  has mrs newsome money  this time he heeded  oh plenty  thats the root of the evil theres money to very large amounts in the concern  chad has had the free use of a great deal  but if hell pull himself together and come home all the same hell find his account in it  she had listened with all her interest  and i hope to goodness youll find yours  hell take up his definite material reward said strether without acknowledgement of this  hes at the parting of the ways  he can come into the business nowhe cant come later  is there a business  lord yesa big brave bouncing business  a roaring trade  a great shop  yesa workshop a great production a great industry  the concerns a manufactureand a manufacture that if its only properly looked after may well be on the way to become a monopoly its a little thing they makemake better it appears than other people can or than other people at any rate do  mr newsome being a man of ideas at least in that particular line strether explained put them on it with great effect and gave the place altogether in his time an immense lift  its a place in itself  well quite a number of buildings almost a little industrial colony but above all its a thing  the article produced  and what is the article produced  strether looked about him as in slight reluctance to say then the curtain which he saw about to rise came to his aid  ill tell you next time  but when the next time came he only said hed tell her later onafter they should have left the theatre for she had immediately reverted to their topic and even for himself the picture of the stage was now overlaid with another image  his postponements however made her wonderwonder if the article referred to were anything bad  and she explained that she meant improper or ridiculous or wrong  but strether so far as that went could satisfy her unmentionable  oh no we constantly talk of it we are quite familiar and brazen about it  only as a small trivial rather ridiculous object of the commonest domestic use its just wanting inwhat shall i say  well dignity or the least approach to distinction  right here therefore with everything about us so grand in short he shrank  its a false note  sadly  its vulgar  but surely not vulgarer than this  then on his wondering as she herself had done  than everything about us  she seemed a trifle irritated  what do you take this for  why forcomparativelydivine  this dreadful london theatre  its impossible if you really want to know  oh then laughed strether i dont really want to know  it made between them a pause which she however still fascinated by the mystery of the production at woollett presently broke rather ridiculous  clothespins  saleratus  shoepolish  it brought him round  noyou dont even burn  i dont think you know youll guess it  how then can i judge how vulgar it is  youll judge when i do tell youand he persuaded her to patience but it may even now frankly be mentioned that he in the sequel never was to tell her  he actually never did so and it moreover oddly occurred that by the law within her of the incalculable her desire for the information dropped and her attitude to the question converted itself into a positive cultivation of ignorance  in ignorance she could humour her fancy and that proved a useful freedom  she could treat the little nameless object as indeed unnameableshe could make their abstention enormously definite  there might indeed have been for strether the portent of this in what she next said  is it perhaps then because its so badbecause your industry as you call it is so vulgarthat mr chad wont come back  does he feel the taint  is he staying away not to be mixed up in it  oh strether laughed it wouldnt appearwould itthat he feels taints hes glad enough of the money from it and the moneys his whole basis  theres appreciation in thati mean as to the allowance his mother has hitherto made him  she has of course the resource of cutting this allowance off but even then he has unfortunately and on no small scale his independent supplymoney left him by his grandfather her own father  wouldnt the fact you mention then miss gostrey asked make it just more easy for him to be particular  isnt he conceivable as fastidious about the sourcethe apparent and public sourceof his income  strether was able quite goodhumouredly to entertain the proposition the source of his grandfathers wealthand thereby of his own share in itwas not particularly noble  and what source was it  strether cast about  wellpractices  in business  infamies  he was an old swindler  oh he said with more emphasis than spirit i shant describe him nor narrate his exploits  lord what abysses and the late mr newsome then  well what about him  was he like the grandfather  nohe was on the other side of the house  and he was different  miss gostrey kept it up  better  her friend for a moment hung fire  no  her comment on his hesitation was scarce the less marked for being mute  thank you  now dont you see she went on why the boy doesnt come home  hes drowning his shame  his shame  what shame  what shame  comment donc  the shame  but where and when strether asked is the shamewhere is any shametoday  the men i speak ofthey did as every one does and besides being ancient history it was all a matter of appreciation  she showed how she understood  mrs newsome has appreciated  ah i cant speak for her  in the midst of such doingsand as i understand you profiting by them she at least has remained exquisite  oh i cant talk of her strether said  i thought she was just what you could talk of  you dont trust me miss gostrey after a moment declared  it had its effect  well her money is spent her life conceived and carried on with a large beneficence  thats a kind of expiation of wrongs  gracious she added before he could speak how intensely you make me see her  if you see her strether dropped its all thats necessary  she really seemed to have her  i feel that  she is in spite of everything handsome  this at least enlivened him  what do you mean by everything  well i mean you  with which she had one of her swift changes of ground  you say the concern needs looking after  but doesnt mrs newsome look after it  so far as possible  shes wonderfully able but its not her affair and her lifes a good deal overcharged  she has many many things  and you also  oh yesive many too if you will  i see  but what i mean is miss gostrey amended do you also look after the business  oh no i dont touch the business  only everything else  well yessome things  as for instance  strether obligingly thought  well the review  the reviewyou have a review  certainly  woollett has a reviewwhich mrs newsome for the most part magnificently pays for and which i not at all magnificently edit  my names on the cover strether pursued and im really rather disappointed and hurt that you seem never to have heard of it  she neglected for a moment this grievance  and what kind of a review is it  his serenity was now completely restored  well its green  do you mean in political colour as they say herein thought  no i mean the covers greenof the most lovely shade  and with mrs newsomes name on it too  he waited a little  oh as for that you must judge if she peeps out shes behind the whole thing but shes of a delicacy and a discretion  miss gostrey took it all  im sure  she would be  i dont underrate her  she must be rather a swell  oh yes shes rather a swell  a woollett swellbon i like the idea of a woollett swell  and you must be rather one too to be so mixed up with her  ah no said strether thats not the way it works  but she had already taken him up  the way it worksyou neednt tell meis of course that you efface yourself  with my name on the cover he lucidly objected  ah but you dont put it on for yourself  i beg your pardonthats exactly what i do put it on for  its exactly the thing that im reduced to doing for myself  it seems to rescue a little you see from the wreck of hopes and ambitions the refuseheap of disappointments and failures  my one presentable little scrap of an identity  on this she looked at him as to say many things but what she at last simply said was  she likes to see it there  youre the bigger swell of the two she immediately continued  because you think youre not one  she thinks she is one  however miss gostrey added she thinks youre one too  youre at all events the biggest she can get hold of  she embroidered she abounded i dont say it to interfere between you but on the day she gets hold of a bigger one  strether had thrown back his head as in silent mirth over something that struck him in her audacity or felicity and her flight meanwhile was already higher  therefore close with her  close with her he asked as she seemed to hang poised  before you lose your chance  their eyes met over it  what do you mean by closing  and what do i mean by your chance  ill tell you when you tell me all the things you dont  is it her greatest fad she briskly pursued  the review  he seemed to wonder how he could best describe it this resulted however but in a sketch  its her tribute to the ideal  i see  you go in for tremendous things  we go in for the unpopular sidethat is so far as we dare  and how far do you dare  well she very far  i much less  i dont begin to have her faith she provides said strether three fourths of that  and she provides as ive confided to you all the money  it evoked somehow a vision of gold that held for a little miss gostreys eyes and she looked as if she heard the bright dollars shovelled in  i hope then you make a good thing  i never made a good thing he at once returned  she just waited  dont you call it a good thing to be loved  oh were not loved  were not even hated  were only just sweetly ignored  she had another pause  you dont trust me she once more repeated  dont i when i lift the last veiltell you the very secret of the prisonhouse  again she met his eyes but to the result that after an instant her own turned away with impatience  you dont sell  oh im glad of that after which however and before he could protest she was off again shes just a moral swell  he accepted gaily enough the definition  yesi really think that describes her  but it had for his friend the oddest connexion  how does she do her hair  he laughed out  beautifully  ah that doesnt tell me  however it doesnt matteri know  its tremendously neata real reproach quite remarkably thick and without as yet a single strand of white  there  he blushed for her realism but gaped at her truth  youre the very deuce  what else should i be  it was as the very deuce i pounced on you but dont let it trouble you for everything but the very deuceat our ageis a bore and a delusion and even he himself after all but half a joy  with which on a single sweep of her wing she resumed  you assist her to expiatewhich is rather hard when youve yourself not sinned  its she who hasnt sinned strether replied  ive sinned the most  ah miss gostrey cynically laughed what a picture of her have you robbed the widow and the orphan  ive sinned enough said strether  enough for whom  enough for what  well to be where i am  thank you they were disturbed at this moment by the passage between their knees and the back of the seats before them of a gentleman who had been absent during a part of the performance and who now returned for the close but the interruption left miss gostrey time before the subsequent hush to express as a sharp finality her sense of the moral of all their talk  i knew you had something up your sleeve  this finality however left them in its turn at the end of the play as disposed to hang back as if they had still much to say so that they easily agreed to let every one go before themthey found an interest in waiting  they made out from the lobby that the night had turned to rain yet miss gostrey let her friend know that he wasnt to see her home  he was simply to put her by herself into a fourwheeler she liked so in london of wet nights after wild pleasures thinking things over on the return in lonely fourwheelers  this was her great time she intimated for pulling herself together  the delays caused by the weather the struggle for vehicles at the door gave them occasion to subside on a divan at the back of the vestibule and just beyond the reach of the fresh damp gusts from the street  here strethers comrade resumed that free handling of the subject to which his own imagination of it already owed so much  does your young friend in paris like you  it had almost after the interval startled him  oh i hope not why should he  why shouldnt he miss gostrey asked  that youre coming down on him need have nothing to do with it  you see more in it he presently returned than i  of course i see you in it  well then you see more in me  than you see in yourself  very likely  thats always ones right what i was thinking of she explained is the possible particular effect on him of his milieu  oh his milieu  strether really felt he could imagine it better now than three hours before  do you mean it can only have been so lowering  why thats my very startingpoint  yes but you start so far back  what do his letters say  nothing  he practically ignores usor spares us  he doesnt write  i see  but there are all the same she went on two quite distinct things thatgiven the wonderful place hes inmay have happened to him  one is that he may have got brutalised  the other is that he may have got refined  strether staredthis was a novelty  refined  oh she said quietly there are refinements  the way of it made him after looking at her break into a laugh you have them  as one of the signs she continued in the same tone they constitute perhaps the worst  he thought it over and his gravity returned  is it a refinement not to answer his mothers letters  she appeared to have a scruple but she brought it out  oh i should say the greatest of all  well said strether im quite content to let it as one of the signs pass for the worst that i know he believes he can do what he likes with me  this appeared to strike her  how do you know it  oh im sure of it  i feel it in my bones  feel he can do it  feel that he believes he can  it may come to the same thing strether laughed  she wouldnt however have this  nothing for you will ever come to the same thing as anything else  and she understood what she meant it seemed sufficiently to go straight on  you say that if he does break hell come in for things at home  quite positively  hell come in for a particular chancea chance that any properly constituted young man would jump at  the business has so developed that an opening scarcely apparent three years ago but which his fathers will took account of as in certain conditions possible and which under that will attaches to chads availing himself of it a large contingent advantagethis opening the conditions having come about now simply awaits him  his mother has kept it for him holding out against strong pressure till the last possible moment  it requires naturally as it carries with it a handsome part a large share in profits his being on the spot and making a big effort for a big result thats what i mean by his chance if he misses it he comes in as you say for nothing  and to see that he doesnt miss it is in a word what ive come out for  she let it all sink in  what youve come out for then is simply to render him an immense service  well poor strether was willing to take it so  ah if you like  he stands as they say if you succeed with him to gain  oh a lot of advantages  strether had them clearly at his fingers ends  by which you mean of course a lot of money  well not only  im acting with a sense for him of other things too consideration and comfort and securitythe general safety of being anchored by a strong chain  he wants as i see him to be protected protected i mean from life  ah voilaher thought fitted with a click  from life  what you really want to get him home for is to marry him  well thats about the size of it  of course she said its rudimentary  but to any one in particular  he smiled at this looking a little more conscious  you get everything out  for a moment again their eyes met  you put everything in  he acknowledged the tribute by telling her  to mamie pocock  she wondered then gravely even exquisitely as if to make the oddity also fit  his own niece  oh you must yourself find a name for the relation  his brotherinlaws sister  mrs jims sisterinlaw  it seemed to have on miss gostrey a certain hardening effect  and who in the worlds mrs jim  chads sisterwho was sarah newsome  shes marrieddidnt i mention itto jim pocock  ah yes she tacitly replied but he had mentioned things then however with all the sound it could have who in the worlds jim pocock she asked  why sallys husband  thats the only way we distinguish people at woollett he goodhumoredly explained  and is it a great distinctionbeing sallys husband  he considered  i think there can be scarcely a greaterunless it may become one in the future to be chads wife  then how do they distinguish you  they dontexcept as ive told you by the green cover  once more their eyes met on it and she held him an instant  the green cover wontnor will any coveravail you with me  youre of a depth of duplicity  still she could in her own large grasp of the real condone it  is mamie a great parti  oh the greatest we haveour prettiest brightest girl  miss gostrey seemed to fix the poor child  i know what they can be and with money  not perhaps with a great deal of thatbut with so much of everything else that we dont miss it  we dont miss money much you know strether added in general in america in pretty girls  no she conceded but i know also what you do sometimes miss and do you she asked yourself admire her  it was a question he indicated that there might be several ways of taking but he decided after an instant for the humorous havent i sufficiently showed you how i admire any pretty girl  her interest in his problem was by this time such that it scarce left her freedom and she kept close to the facts  i supposed that at woollett you wanted themwhat shall i call itblameless  i mean your young men for your pretty girls  so did i strether confessed  but you strike there a curious factthe fact that woollett too accommodates itself to the spirit of the age and the increasing mildness of manners  everything changes and i hold that our situation precisely marks a date  we should prefer them blameless but we have to make the best of them as we find them since the spirit of the age and the increasing mildness send them so much more to paris  youve to take them back as they come  when they do come  bon once more she embraced it all but she had a moment of thought poor chad  ah said strether cheerfully mamie will save him  she was looking away still in her vision and she spoke with impatience and almost as if he hadnt understood her  youll save him  thats wholl save him  oh but with mamies aid  unless indeed you mean he added that i shall effect so much more with yours  it made her at last again look at him  youll do moreas youre so much betterthan all of us put together  i think im only better since ive known you strether bravely returned  the depletion of the place the shrinkage of the crowd and now comparatively quiet withdrawal of its last elements had already brought them nearer the door and put them in relation with a messenger of whom he bespoke miss gostreys cab  but this left them a few minutes more which she was clearly in no mood not to use  youve spoken to me of whatby your successmr chad stands to gain  but youve not spoken to me of what you do  oh ive nothing more to gain said strether very simply  she took it as even quite too simple  you mean youve got it all down  youve been paid in advance  ah dont talk about payment he groaned  something in the tone of it pulled her up but as their messenger still delayed she had another chance and she put it in another way whatby failuredo you stand to lose  he still however wouldnt have it  nothing he exclaimed and on the messengers at this instant reappearing he was able to sink the subject in their responsive advance  when a few steps up the street under a lamp he had put her into her fourwheeler and she had asked him if the man had called for him no second conveyance he replied before the door was closed  you wont take me with you  not for the world  then i shall walk  in the rain  i like the rain said strether  goodnight  she kept him a moment while his hand was on the door by not answering after which she answered by repeating her question what do you stand to lose  why the question now affected him as other he couldnt have said he could only this time meet it otherwise  everything  so i thought  then you shall succeed  and to that end im yours  ah dear lady he kindly breathed  till death said maria gostrey  goodnight    ii   strether called his second morning in paris on the bankers of the rue scribe to whom his letter of credit was addressed and he made this visit attended by waymarsh in whose company he had crossed from london two days before  they had hastened to the rue scribe on the morrow of their arrival but strether had not then found the letters the hope of which prompted this errand  he had had as yet none at all hadnt expected them in london but had counted on several in paris and disconcerted now had presently strolled back to the boulevard with a sense of injury that he felt himself taking for as good a start as any other  it would serve this spur to his spirit he reflected as pausing at the top of the street he looked up and down the great foreign avenue it would serve to begin business with  his idea was to begin business immediately and it did much for him the rest of his day that the beginning of business awaited him  he did little else till night but ask himself what he should do if he hadnt fortunately had so much to do but he put himself the question in many different situations and connexions  what carried him hither and yon was an admirable theory that nothing he could do wouldnt be in some manner related to what he fundamentally had on hand or would beshould he happen to have a scruplewasted for it  he did happen to have a scruplea scruple about taking no definite step till he should get letters but this reasoning carried it off  a single day to feel his feethe had felt them as yet only at chester and in londonwas he could consider none too much and having as he had often privately expressed it paris to reckon with he threw these hours of freshness consciously into the reckoning  they made it continually greater but that was what it had best be if it was to be anything at all and he gave himself up till far into the evening at the theatre and on the return after the theatre along the bright congested boulevard to feeling it grow  waymarsh had accompanied him this time to the play and the two men had walked together as a first stage from the gymnase to the cafe riche into the crowded terrace of which establishmentthe night or rather the morning for midnight had struck being bland and populousthey had wedged themselves for refreshment waymarsh as a result of some discussion with his friend had made a marked virtue of his having now let himself go and there had been elements of impression in their halfhour over their watered beerglasses that gave him his occasion for conveying that he held this compromise with his stiffer self to have become extreme  he conveyed itfor it was still after all his stiffer self who gloomed out of the glare of the terracein solemn silence and there was indeed a great deal of critical silence every way between the companions even till they gained the place de lopera as to the character of their nocturnal progress  this morning there were lettersletters which had reached london apparently all together the day of strethers journey and had taken their time to follow him so that after a controlled impulse to go into them in the receptionroom of the bank which reminding him of the postoffice at woollett affected him as the abutment of some transatlantic bridge he slipped them into the pocket of his loose grey overcoat with a sense of the felicity of carrying them off  waymarsh who had had letters yesterday had had them again today and waymarsh suggested in this particular no controlled impulses  the last one he was at all events likely to be observed to struggle with was clearly that of bringing to a premature close any visit to the rue scribe strether had left him there yesterday he wanted to see the papers and he had spent by what his friend could make out a succession of hours with the papers  he spoke of the establishment with emphasis as a post of superior observation just as he spoke generally of his actual damnable doom as a device for hiding from him what was going on europe was best described to his mind as an elaborate engine for dissociating the confined american from that indispensable knowledge and was accordingly only rendered bearable by these occasional stations of relief traps for the arrest of wandering western airs  strether on his side set himself to walk againhe had his relief in his pocket and indeed much as he had desired his budget the growth of restlessness might have been marked in him from the moment he had assured himself of the superscription of most of the missives it contained  this restlessness became therefore his temporary law he knew he should recognise as soon as see it the best place of all for settling down with his chief correspondent  he had for the next hour an accidental air of looking for it in the windows of shops he came down the rue de la paix in the sun and passing across the tuileries and the river indulged more than onceas if on finding himself determinedin a sudden pause before the bookstalls of the opposite quay  in the garden of the tuileries he had lingered on two or three spots to look it was as if the wonderful paris spring had stayed him as he roamed  the prompt paris morning struck its cheerful notesin a soft breeze and a sprinkled smell in the light flit over the gardenfloor of bareheaded girls with the buckled strap of oblong boxes in the type of ancient thrifty persons basking betimes where terracewalls were warm in the bluefrocked brasslabelled officialism of humble rakers and scrapers in the deep references of a straightpacing priest or the sharp ones of a whitegaitered redlegged soldier  he watched little brisk figures figures whose movement was as the tick of the great paris clock take their smooth diagonal from point to point the air had a taste as of something mixed with art something that presented nature as a whitecapped masterchef  the palace was gone strether remembered the palace and when he gazed into the irremediable void of its site the historic sense in him might have been freely at playthe play under which in paris indeed it so often winces like a touched nerve  he filled out spaces with dim symbols of scenes he caught the gleam of white statues at the base of which with his letters out he could tilt back a strawbottomed chair  but his drift was for reasons to the other side and it floated him unspent up the rue de seine and as far as the luxembourg  in the luxembourg gardens he pulled up here at last he found his nook and here on a penny chair from which terraces alleys vistas fountains little trees in green tubs little women in white caps and shrill little girls at play all sunnily composed together he passed an hour in which the cup of his impressions seemed truly to overflow but a week had elapsed since he quitted the ship and there were more things in his mind than so few days could account for  more than once during the time he had regarded himself as admonished but the admonition this morning was formidably sharp  it took as it hadnt done yet the form of a questionthe question of what he was doing with such an extraordinary sense of escape  this sense was sharpest after he had read his letters but that was also precisely why the question pressed  four of the letters were from mrs newsome and none of them short she had lost no time had followed on his heels while he moved so expressing herself that he now could measure the probable frequency with which he should hear  they would arrive it would seem her communications at the rate of several a week he should be able to count it might even prove on more than one by each mail  if he had begun yesterday with a small grievance he had therefore an opportunity to begin today with its opposite  he read the letters successively and slowly putting others back into his pocket but keeping these for a long time afterwards gathered in his lap  he held them there lost in thought as if to prolong the presence of what they gave him or as if at the least to assure them their part in the constitution of some lucidity his friend wrote admirably and her tone was even more in her style than in her voicehe might almost for the hour have had to come this distance to get its full carrying quality yet the plentitude of his consciousness of difference consorted perfectly with the deepened intensity of the connexion  it was the difference the difference of being just where he was and as he was that formed the escapethis difference was so much greater than he had dreamed it would be and what he finally sat there turning over was the strange logic of his finding himself so free  he felt it in a manner his duty to think out his state to approve the process and when he came in fact to trace the steps and add up the items they sufficiently accounted for the sum he had never expectedthat was the truth of itagain to find himself young and all the years and other things it had taken to make him so were exactly his present arithmetic  he had to make sure of them to put his scruple to rest  it all sprang at bottom from the beauty of mrs newsomes desire that he should be worried with nothing that was not of the essence of his task by insisting that he should thoroughly intermit and break she had so provided for his freedom that she would as it were have only herself to thank  strether could not at this point indeed have completed his thought by the image of what she might have to thank herself for  the image at best of his own likenesspoor lambert strether washed up on the sunny strand by the waves of a single day poor lambert strether thankful for breathingtime and stiffening himself while he gasped  there he was and with nothing in his aspect or his posture to scandalise it was only true that if he had seen mrs newsome coming he would instinctively have jumped up to walk away a little  he would have come round and back to her bravely but he would have had first to pull himself together  she abounded in news of the situation at home proved to him how perfectly she was arranging for his absence told him who would take up this and who take up that exactly where he had left it gave him in fact chapter and verse for the moral that nothing would suffer  it filled for him this tone of hers all the air yet it struck him at the same time as the hum of vain things  this latter effect was what he tried to justifyand with the success that grave though the appearance he at last lighted on a form that was happy  he arrived at it by the inevitable recognition of his having been a fortnight before one of the weariest of men  if ever a man had come off tired lambert strether was that man and hadnt it been distinctly on the ground of his fatigue that his wonderful friend at home had so felt for him and so contrived  it seemed to him somehow at these instants that could he only maintain with sufficient firmness his grasp of that truth it might become in a manner his compass and his helm  what he wanted most was some idea that would simplify and nothing would do this so much as the fact that he was done for and finished  if it had been in such a light that he had just detected in his cup the dregs of youth that was a mere flaw of the surface of his scheme  he was so distinctly faggedout that it must serve precisely as his convenience and if he could but consistently be good for little enough he might do everything he wanted  everything he wanted was comprised moreover in a single boonthe common unattainable art of taking things as they came  he appeared to himself to have given his best years to an active appreciation of the way they didnt come but perhapsas they would seemingly here be things quite otherthis long ache might at last drop to rest  he could easily see that from the moment he should accept the notion of his foredoomed collapse the last thing he would lack would be reasons and memories  oh if he should do the sum no slate would hold the figures the fact that he had failed as he considered in everything in each relation and in half a dozen trades as he liked luxuriously to put it might have made might still make for an empty present but it stood solidly for a crowded past  it had not been so much achievement missed a light yoke nor a short load  it was at present as if the backward picture had hung there the long crooked course grey in the shadow of his solitude  it had been a dreadful cheerful sociable solitude a solitude of life or choice of community but though there had been people enough all round it there had been but three or four persons in it  waymarsh was one of these and the fact struck him just now as marking the record  mrs newsome was another and miss gostrey had of a sudden shown signs of becoming a third  beyond behind them was the pale figure of his real youth which held against its breast the two presences paler than itselfthe young wife he had early lost and the young son he had stupidly sacrificed  he had again and again made out for himself that he might have kept his little boy his little dull boy who had died at school of rapid diphtheria if he had not in those years so insanely given himself to merely missing the mother  it was the soreness of his remorse that the child had in all likelihood not really been dullhad been dull as he had been banished and neglected mainly because the father had been unwittingly selfish this was doubtless but the secret habit of sorrow which had slowly given way to time yet there remained an ache sharp enough to make the spirit at the sight now and again of some fair young man just growing up wince with the thought of an opportunity lost  had ever a man he had finally fallen into the way of asking himself lost so much and even done so much for so little  there had been particular reasons why all yesterday beyond other days he should have had in one ear this cold enquiry  his name on the green cover where he had put it for mrs newsome expressed him doubtless just enough to make the worldthe world as distinguished both for more and for less from woollettask who he was  he had incurred the ridicule of having to have his explanation explained  he was lambert strether because he was on the cover whereas it should have been for anything like glory that he was on the cover because he was lambert strether  he would have done anything for mrs newsome have been still more ridiculousas he might for that matter have occasion to be yet which came to saying that this acceptance of fate was all he had to show at fiftyfive  he judged the quantity as small because it was small and all the more egregiously since it couldnt as he saw the case so much as thinkably have been larger  he hadnt had the gift of making the most of what he tried and if he had tried and tried againno one but himself knew how oftenit appeared to have been that he might demonstrate what else in default of that could be made  old ghosts of experiments came back to him old drudgeries and delusions and disgusts old recoveries with their relapses old fevers with their chills broken moments of good faith others of still better doubt adventures for the most part of the sort qualified as lessons  the special spring that had constantly played for him the day before was the recognitionfrequent enough to surprise himof the promises to himself that he had after his other visit never kept  the reminiscence today most quickened for him was that of the vow taken in the course of the pilgrimage that newlymarried with the war just over and helplessly young in spite of it he had recklessly made with the creature who was so much younger still  it had been a bold dash for which they had taken money set apart for necessities but kept sacred at the moment in a hundred ways and in none more so than by this private pledge of his own to treat the occasion as a relation formed with the higher culture and see that as they said at woollett it should bear a good harvest  he had believed sailing home again that he had gained something great and his theorywith an elaborate innocent plan of reading digesting coming back even every few yearshad then been to preserve cherish and extend it as such plans as these had come to nothing however in respect to acquisitions still more precious it was doubtless little enough of a marvel that he should have lost account of that handful of seed  buried for long years in dark corners at any rate these few germs had sprouted again under fortyeight hours of paris  the process of yesterday had really been the process of feeling the general stirred life of connexions long since individually dropped  strether had become acquainted even on this ground with short gusts of speculationsudden flights of fancy in louvre galleries hungry gazes through clear plates behind which lemoncoloured volumes were as fresh as fruit on the tree  there were instants at which he could ask whether since there had been fundamentally so little question of his keeping anything the fate after all decreed for him hadnt been only to be kept  kept for something in that event that he didnt pretend didnt possibly dare as yet to divine something that made him hover and wonder and laugh and sigh made him advance and retreat feeling half ashamed of his impulse to plunge and more than half afraid of his impulse to wait  he remembered for instance how he had gone back in the sixties with lemoncoloured volumes in general on the brain as well as with a dozenselected for his wife tooin his trunk and nothing had at the moment shown more confidence than this invocation of the finer taste they were still somewhere at home the dozenstale and soiled and never sent to the binder but what had become of the sharp initiation they represented  they represented now the mere sallow paint on the door of the temple of taste that he had dreamed of raising upa structure he had practically never carried further  strethers present highest flights were perhaps those in which this particular lapse figured to him as a symbol a symbol of his long grind and his want of odd moments his want moreover of money of opportunity of positive dignity  that the memory of the vow of his youth should in order to throb again have had to wait for this last as he felt it of all his accidentsthat was surely proof enough of how his conscience had been encumbered  if any further proof were needed it would have been to be found in the fact that as he perfectly now saw he had ceased even to measure his meagreness a meagreness that sprawled in this retrospect vague and comprehensive stretching back like some unmapped hinterland from a rough coastsettlement  his conscience had been amusing itself for the fortyeight hours by forbidding him the purchase of a book he held off from that held off from everything from the moment he didnt yet call on chad he wouldnt for the world have taken any other step on this evidence however of the way they actually affected him he glared at the lemoncoloured covers in confession of the subconsciousness that all the same in the great desert of the years he must have had of them  the green covers at home comprised by the law of their purpose no tribute to letters it was of a mere rich kernel of economics politics ethics that glazed and as mrs newsome maintained rather against his view preeminently pleasant to touch they formed the specious shell  without therefore any needed instinctive knowledge of what was coming out in paris on the bright highway he struck himself at present as having more than once flushed with a suspicion  he couldnt otherwise at present be feeling so many fears confirmed  there were movements he was too late for werent they with the fun of them already spent  there were sequences he had missed and great gaps in the procession  he might have been watching it all recede in a golden cloud of dust  if the playhouse wasnt closed his seat had at least fallen to somebody else  he had had an uneasy feeling the night before that if he was at the theatre at allthough he indeed justified the theatre in the specific sense and with a grotesqueness to which his imagination did all honour as something he owed poor waymarshhe should have been there with and as might have been said for chad  this suggested the question of whether he could properly have taken him to such a play and what effectit was a point that suddenly rosehis peculiar responsibility might be held in general to have on his choice of entertainment  it had literally been present to him at the gymnasewhere one was held moreover comparatively safethat having his young friend at his side would have been an odd feature of the work of redemption and this quite in spite of the fact that the picture presented might well confronted with chads own private stage have seemed the pattern of propriety  he clearly hadnt come out in the name of propriety but to visit unattended equivocal performances yet still less had he done so to undermine his authority by sharing them with the graceless youth  was he to renounce all amusement for the sweet sake of that authority and would such renouncement give him for chad a moral glamour  the little problem bristled the more by reason of poor strethers fairly open sense of the irony of things  were there then sides on which his predicament threatened to look rather droll to him  should he have to pretend to believeeither to himself or the wretched boythat there was anything that could make the latter worse  wasnt some such pretence on the other hand involved in the assumption of possible processes that would make him better  his greatest uneasiness seemed to peep at him out of the imminent impression that almost any acceptance of paris might give ones authority away  it hung before him this morning the vast bright babylon like some huge iridescent object a jewel brilliant and hard in which parts were not to be discriminated nor differences comfortably marked  it twinkled and trembled and melted together and what seemed all surface one moment seemed all depth the next  it was a place of which unmistakeably chad was fond wherefore if he strether should like it too much what on earth with such a bond would become of either of them  it all depended of coursewhich was a gleam of lighton how the too much was measured though indeed our friend fairly felt while he prolonged the meditation i describe that for himself even already a certain measure had been reached it will have been sufficiently seen that he was not a man to neglect any good chance for reflexion  was it at all possible for instance to like paris enough without liking it too much  he luckily however hadnt promised mrs newsome not to like it at all  he was ready to recognise at this stage that such an engagement would have tied his hands  the luxembourg gardens were incontestably just so adorable at this hour by reasonin addition to their intrinsic charmof his not having taken it  the only engagement he had taken when he looked the thing in the face was to do what he reasonably could  it upset him a little none the less and after a while to find himself at last remembering on what current of association he had been floated so far  old imaginations of the latin quarter had played their part for him and he had duly recalled its having been with this scene of rather ominous legend that like so many young men in fiction as well as in fact chad had begun  he was now quite out of it with his home as strether figured the place in the boulevard malesherbes which was perhaps why repairing not to fail of justice either to the elder neighbourhood our friend had felt he could allow for the element of the usual the immemorial without courting perturbation  he was not at least in danger of seeing the youth and the particular person flaunt by together and yet he was in the very air of whichjust to feel what the early natural note must have beenhe wished most to take counsel  it became at once vivid to him that he had originally had for a few days an almost envious vision of the boys romantic privilege  melancholy murger with francine and musette and rodolphe at home in the company of the tattered oneif he not in his single self two or threeof the unbound the papercovered dozen on the shelf and when chad had written five years ago after a sojourn then already prolonged to six months that he had decided to go in for economy and the real thing strethers fancy had quite fondly accompanied him in this migration which was to convey him as they somewhat confusedly learned at woollett across the bridges and up the montagne saintegenevieve  this was the regionchad had been quite distinct about itin which the best french and many other things were to be learned at least cost and in which all sorts of clever fellows compatriots there for a purpose formed an awfully pleasant set  the clever fellows the friendly countrymen were mainly young painters sculptors architects medical students but they were chad sagely opined a much more profitable lot to be witheven on the footing of not being quite one of themthan the terrible toughs strether remembered the edifying discrimination of the american bars and banks roundabout the opera  chad had thrown out in the communications following this onefor at that time he did once in a while communicatethat several members of a band of earnest workers under one of the great artists had taken him right in making him dine every night almost for nothing at their place and even pressing him not to neglect the hypothesis of there being as much in him as in any of them  there had been literally a moment at which it appeared there might be something in him there had been at any rate a moment at which he had written that he didnt know but what a month or two more might see him enrolled in some atelier  the season had been one at which mrs newsome was moved to gratitude for small mercies it had broken on them all as a blessing that their absentee had perhaps a consciencethat he was sated in fine with idleness was ambitious of variety  the exhibition was doubtless as yet not brilliant but strether himself even by that time much enlisted and immersed had determined on the part of the two ladies a temperate approval and in fact as he now recollected a certain austere enthusiasm  but the very next thing that happened had been a dark drop of the curtain  the son and brother had not browsed long on the montagne saintegenevievehis effective little use of the name of which like his allusion to the best french appeared to have been but one of the notes of his rough cunning  the light refreshment of these vain appearances had not accordingly carried any of them very far  on the other hand it had gained chad time it had given him a chance unchecked to strike his roots had paved the way for initiations more direct and more deep  it was strethers belief that he had been comparatively innocent before this first migration and even that the first effects of the migration would not have been without some particular bad accident to have been deplored  there had been three monthshe had sufficiently figured it outin which chad had wanted to try  he had tried though not very hardhe had had his little hour of good faith  the weakness of this principle in him was that almost any accident attestedly bad enough was stronger  such had at any rate markedly been the case for the precipitation of a special series of impressions they had proved successively these impressionsall of musette and francine but musette and francine vulgarised by the larger evolution of the typeirresistibly sharp  he had taken up by what was at the time to be shrinkingly gathered as it was scantly mentioned with one ferociously interested little person after another  strether had read somewhere of a latin motto a description of the hours observed on a clock by a traveller in spain and he had been led to apply it in thought to chads number one number two number three  omnes vulnerant ultima necatthey had all morally wounded the last had morally killed  the last had been longest in possessionin possession that is of whatever was left of the poor boys finer mortality  and it hadnt been she it had been one of her early predecessors who had determined the second migration the expensive return and relapse the exchange again as was fairly to be presumed of the vaunted best french for some special variety of the worst  he pulled himself then at last together for his own progress back not with the feeling that he had taken his walk in vain  he prolonged it a little in the immediate neighbourhood after he had quitted his chair and the upshot of the whole morning for him was that his campaign had begun  he had wanted to put himself in relation and he would be hanged if he were not in relation  he was that at no moment so much as while under the old arches of the odeon he lingered before the charming openair array of literature classic and casual  he found the effect of tone and tint in the long charged tables and shelves delicate and appetising the impressionsubstituting one kind of lowpriced consommation for anothermight have been that of one of the pleasant cafes that overlapped under an awning to the pavement but he edged along grazing the tables with his hands firmly behind him he wasnt there to dip to consumehe was there to reconstruct  he wasnt there for his own profitnot that is the direct he was there on some chance of feeling the brush of the wing of the stray spirit of youth  he felt it in fact he had it beside him the old arcade indeed as his inner sense listened gave out the faint sound as from far off of the wild waving of wings  they were folded now over the breasts of buried generations but a flutter or two lived again in the turned page of shockheaded slouchhatted loiterers whose young intensity of type in the direction of pale acuteness deepened his vision and even his appreciation of racial differences and whose manipulation of the uncut volume was too often however but a listening at closed doors  he reconstructed a possible groping chad of three or four years before a chad who had after all simplyfor that was the only way to see itbeen too vulgar for his privilege  surely it was a privilege to have been young and happy just there  well the best thing strether knew of him was that he had had such a dream  but his own actual business half an hour later was with a third floor on the boulevard malesherbesso much as that was definite and the fact of the enjoyment by the thirdfloor windows of a continuous balcony to which he was helped by this knowledge had perhaps something to do with his lingering for five minutes on the opposite side of the street  there were points as to which he had quite made up his mind and one of these bore precisely on the wisdom of the abruptness to which events had finally committed him a policy that he was pleased to find not at all shaken as he now looked at his watch and wondered  he had announced himselfsix months before had written out at least that chad wasnt to be surprised should he see him some day turn up  chad had thereupon in a few words of rather carefully colourless answer offered him a general welcome and strether ruefully reflecting that he might have understood the warning as a hint to hospitality a bid for an invitation had fallen back upon silence as the corrective most to his own taste  he had asked mrs newsome moreover not to announce him again he had so distinct an opinion on his attacking his job should he attack it at all in his own way  not the least of this ladys high merits for him was that he could absolutely rest on her word  she was the only woman he had known even at woollett as to whom his conviction was positive that to lie was beyond her art sarah pocock for instance her own daughter though with social ideals as they said in some respects differentsarah who was in her way aesthetic had never refused to human commerce that mitigation of rigour there were occasions when he had distinctly seen her apply it  since accordingly at all events he had had it from mrs newsome that she had at whatever cost to her more strenuous view conformed in the matter of preparing chad wholly to his restrictions he now looked up at the fine continuous balcony with a safe sense that if the case had been bungled the mistake was at least his property was there perhaps just a suspicion of that in his present pause on the edge of the boulevard and well in the pleasant light  many things came over him here and one of them was that he should doubtless presently know whether he had been shallow or sharp another was that the balcony in question didnt somehow show as a convenience easy to surrender  poor strether had at this very moment to recognise the truth that wherever one paused in paris the imagination reacted before one could stop it  this perpetual reaction put a price if one would on pauses but it piled up consequences till there was scarce room to pick ones steps among them  what call had he at such a juncture for example to like chads very house  high broad clearhe was expert enough to make out in a moment that it was admirably builtit fairly embarrassed our friend by the quality that as he would have said it sprang on him  he had struck off the fancy that it might as a preliminary be of service to him to be seen by a happy accident from the thirdstory windows which took all the march sun but of what service was it to find himself making out after a moment that the quality sprung the quality produced by measure and balance the fine relation of part to part and space to space was probablyaided by the presence of ornament as positive as it was discreet and by the complexion of the stone a cold fair grey warmed and polished a little by lifeneither more nor less than a case of distinction such a case as he could only feel unexpectedly as a sort of delivered challenge meanwhile however the chance he had allowed forthe chance of being seen in time from the balconyhad become a fact  two or three of the windows stood open to the violet air and before strether had cut the knot by crossing a young man had come out and looked about him had lighted a cigarette and tossed the match over and then resting on the rail had given himself up to watching the life below while he smoked  his arrival contributed in its order to keeping strether in position the result of which in turn was that strether soon felt himself noticed  the young man began to look at him as in acknowledgement of his being himself in observation  this was interesting so far as it went but the interest was affected by the young mans not being chad  strether wondered at first if he were perhaps chad altered and then saw that this was asking too much of alteration  the young man was light bright and alertwith an air too pleasant to have been arrived at by patching  strether had conceived chad as patched but not beyond recognition  he was in presence he felt of amendments enough as they stood it was a sufficient amendment that the gentleman up there should be chads friend  he was young too then the gentleman up therehe was very young young enough apparently to be amused at an elderly watcher to be curious even to see what the elderly watcher would do on finding himself watched  there was youth in that there was youth in the surrender to the balcony there was youth for strether at this moment in everything but his own business and chads thus pronounced association with youth had given the next instant an extraordinary quick lift to the issue the balcony the distinguished front testified suddenly for strethers fancy to something that was up and up they placed the whole case materially and as by an admirable image on a level that he found himself at the end of another moment rejoicing to think he might reach  the young man looked at him still he looked at the young man and the issue by a rapid process was that this knowledge of a perched privacy appeared to him the last of luxuries  to him too the perched privacy was open and he saw it now but in one lightthat of the only domicile the only fireside in the great ironic city on which he had the shadow of a claim miss gostrey had a fireside she had told him of it and it was something that doubtless awaited him but miss gostrey hadnt yet arrivedshe mightnt arrive for days and the sole attenuation of his excluded state was his vision of the small the admittedly secondary hotel in the byestreet from the rue de la paix in which her solicitude for his purse had placed him which affected him somehow as all indoor chill glassroofed court and slippery staircase and which by the same token expressed the presence of waymarsh even at times when waymarsh might have been certain to be round at the bank  it came to pass before he moved that waymarsh and waymarsh alone waymarsh not only undiluted but positively strengthened struck him as the present alternative to the young man in the balcony  when he did move it was fairly to escape that alternative  taking his way over the street at last and passing through the portecochere of the house was like consciously leaving waymarsh out  however he would tell him all about it      book third     i   strether told waymarsh all about it that very evening on their dining together at the hotel which neednt have happened he was all the while aware hadnt he chosen to sacrifice to this occasion a rarer opportunity  the mention to his companion of the sacrifice was moreover exactly what introduced his recitalor as he would have called it with more confidence in his interlocutor his confession his confession was that he had been captured and that one of the features of the affair had just failed to be his engaging himself on the spot to dinner  as by such a freedom waymarsh would have lost him he had obeyed his scruple and he had likewise obeyed another scruplewhich bore on the question of his himself bringing a guest  waymarsh looked gravely ardent over the finished soup at this array of scruples strether hadnt yet got quite used to being so unprepared for the consequences of the impression he produced  it was comparatively easy to explain however that he hadnt felt sure his guest would please  the person was a young man whose acquaintance he had made but that afternoon in the course of rather a hindered enquiry for another personan enquiry his new friend had just prevented in fact from being vain  oh said strether ive all sorts of things to tell youand he put it in a way that was a virtual hint to waymarsh to help him to enjoy the telling  he waited for his fish he drank of his wine he wiped his long moustache he leaned back in his chair he took in the two english ladies who had just creaked past them and whom he would even have articulately greeted if they hadnt rather chilled the impulse so that all he could do wasby way of doing somethingto say merci francois out quite loud when his fish was brought everything was there that he wanted everything that could make the moment an occasion that would do beautifullyeverything but what waymarsh might give  the little waxed salleamanger was sallow and sociable francois dancing over it all smiles was a man and a brother the highshouldered patronne with her highheld muchrubbed hands seemed always assenting exuberantly to something unsaid the paris evening in short was for strether in the very taste of the soup in the goodness as he was innocently pleased to think it of the wine in the pleasant coarse texture of the napkin and the crunch of the thickcrusted bread  these all were things congruous with his confession and his confession was that he hadit would come out properly just there if waymarsh would only take it properlyagreed to breakfast out at twelve literally the next day  he didnt quite know where the delicacy of the case came straight up in the remembrance of his new friends well see ill take you somewherefor it had required little more than that after all to let him right in  he was affected after a minute face to face with his actual comrade by the impulse to overcolour there had already been things in respect to which he knew himself tempted by this perversity  if waymarsh thought them bad he should at least have his reason for his discomfort so strether showed them as worse  still he was now in his way sincerely perplexed  chad had been absent from the boulevard malesherbeswas absent from paris altogether he had learned that from the concierge but had nevertheless gone up and gone upthere were no two ways about itfrom an uncontrollable a really if one would depraved curiosity the concierge had mentioned to him that a friend of the tenant of the troisieme was for the time in possession and this had been strethers pretext for a further enquiry an experiment carried on under chads roof without his knowledge  i found his friend in fact there keeping the place warm as he called it for him chad himself being as appears in the south  he went a month ago to cannes and though his return begins to be looked for it cant be for some days  i might you see perfectly have waited a week might have beaten a retreat as soon as i got this essential knowledge  but i beat no retreat i did the opposite i stayed i dawdled i trifled above all i looked round  i saw in fine andi dont know what to call iti sniffed  its a detail but its as if there were somethingsomething very goodto sniff  waymarshs face had shown his friend an attention apparently so remote that the latter was slightly surprised to find it at this point abreast with him  do you mean a smell what of  a charming scent  but i dont know  waymarsh gave an inferential grunt  does he live there with a woman  i dont know  waymarsh waited an instant for more then resumed  has he taken her off with him  and will he bring her backstrether fell into the enquiry  but he wound it up as before  i dont know  the way he wound it up accompanied as this was with another drop back another degustation of the leoville another wipe of his moustache and another good word for francois seemed to produce in his companion a slight irritation  then what the devil do you know  well said strether almost gaily i guess i dont know anything his gaiety might have been a tribute to the fact that the state he had been reduced to did for him again what had been done by his talk of the matter with miss gostrey at the london theatre  it was somehow enlarging and the air of that amplitude was now doubtless more or lessand all for waymarsh to feelin his further response  thats what i found out from the young man  but i thought you said you found out nothing  nothing but thatthat i dont know anything  and what good does that do you  its just said strether what ive come to you to help me to discover  i mean anything about anything over here  i felt that up there  it regularly rose before me in its might  the young man moreoverchads friendas good as told me so  as good as told you you know nothing about anything  waymarsh appeared to look at some one who might have as good as told him how old is he  well i guess not thirty  yet you had to take that from him  oh i took a good deal moresince as i tell you i took an invitation to dejeuner  and are you going to that unholy meal  if youll come with me  he wants you too you know  i told him about you  he gave me his card strether pursued and his names rather funny  its john little bilham and he says his two surnames are on account of his being small inevitably used together  well waymarsh asked with due detachment from these details whats he doing up there  his account of himself is that hes only a little artistman that seemed to me perfectly to describe him  but hes yet in the phase of study this you know is the great artschoolto pass a certain number of years in which he came over  and hes a great friend of chads and occupying chads rooms just now because theyre so pleasant  hes very pleasant and curious too strether addedthough hes not from boston  waymarsh looked already rather sick of him  where is he from  strether thought  i dont know that either  but hes notoriously as he put it himself not from boston  well waymarsh moralised from dry depths every one cant notoriously be from boston  why he continued is he curious  perhaps just for thatfor one thing but really strether added for everything  when you meet him youll see  oh i dont want to meet him waymarsh impatiently growled  why dont he go home  strether hesitated  well because he likes it over here  this appeared in particular more than waymarsh could bear  he ought then to be ashamed of himself and as you admit that you think so too why drag him in  strethers reply again took time  perhaps i do think so myselfthough i dont quite yet admit it  im not a bit sureits again one of the things i want to find out  i liked him and can you like people but no matter  he pulled himself up  theres no doubt i want you to come down on me and squash me  waymarsh helped himself to the next course which however proving not the dish he had just noted as supplied to the english ladies had the effect of causing his imagination temporarily to wander but it presently broke out at a softer spot  have they got a handsome place up there  oh a charming place full of beautiful and valuable things  i never saw such a placeand strethers thought went back to it for a little artistman  he could in fact scarce express it  but his companion who appeared now to have a view insisted well  well life can hold nothing better  besides theyre things of which hes in charge  so that he does doorkeeper for your precious pair can life waymarsh enquired hold nothing better than that  then as strether silent seemed even yet to wonder doesnt he know what she is he went on  i dont know  i didnt ask him  i couldnt  it was impossible  you wouldnt either  besides i didnt want to  no more would you strether in short explained it at a stroke  you cant make out over here what people do know  then what did you come over for  well i suppose exactly to see for myselfwithout their aid  then what do you want mine for  oh strether laughed youre not one of them  i do know what you know  as however this last assertion caused waymarsh again to look at him hardsuch being the latters doubt of its implicationshe felt his justification lame  which was still more the case when waymarsh presently said  look here strether  quit this  our friend smiled with a doubt of his own  do you mean my tone  nodamn your tone  i mean your nosing round  quit the whole job let them stew in their juice  youre being used for a thing you aint fit for  people dont take a finetooth comb to groom a horse  am i a finetooth comb strether laughed  its something i never called myself  its what you are all the same  you aint so young as you were but youve kept your teeth  he acknowledged his friends humour  take care i dont get them into you youd like them my friends at home waymarsh he declared youd really particularly like them  and i knowit was slightly irrelevant but he gave it sudden and singular forcei know theyd like you  oh dont work them off on me waymarsh groaned  yet strether still lingered with his hands in his pockets  its really quite as indispensable as i say that chad should be got back  indispensable to whom to you  yes strether presently said  because if you get him you also get mrs newsome  strether faced it  yes  and if you dont get him you dont get her  it might be merciless but he continued not to flinch  i think it might have some effect on our personal understanding  chads of real importanceor can easily become so if he willto the business  and the business is of real importance to his mothers husband  well i naturally want what my future wife wants  and the thing will be much better if we have our own man in it  if you have your own man in it in other words waymarsh said youll marryyou personallymore money  shes already rich as i understand you but shell be richer still if the business can be made to boom on certain lines that youve laid down  i havent laid them down strether promptly returned  mr newsomewho knew extraordinarily well what he was aboutlaid them down ten years ago  oh well waymarsh seemed to indicate with a shake of his mane that didnt matter youre fierce for the boom anyway  his friend weighed a moment in silence the justice of the charge i can scarcely be called fierce i think when i so freely take my chance of the possibility the danger of being influenced in a sense counter to mrs newsomes own feelings  waymarsh gave this proposition a long hard look  i see  youre afraid yourself of being squared  but youre a humbug he added all the same  oh strether quickly protested  yes you ask me for protectionwhich makes you very interesting and then you wont take it  you say you want to be squashed  ah but not so easily dont you see strether demanded where my interest as already shown you lies it lies in my not being squared if im squared wheres my marriage if i miss my errand i miss that and if i miss that i miss everythingim nowhere  waymarshbut all relentlesslytook this in  what do i care where you are if youre spoiled  their eyes met on it an instant  thank you awfully strether at last said  but dont you think her judgement of that  ought to content me no  it kept them again face to face and the end of this was that strether again laughed  you do her injustice  you really must know her goodnight  he breakfasted with mr bilham on the morrow and as inconsequently befell with waymarsh massively of the party  the latter announced at the eleventh hour and much to his friends surprise that damn it he would as soon join him as do anything else on which they proceeded together strolling in a state of detachment practically luxurious for them to the boulevard malesherbes a couple engaged that day with the sharp spell of paris as confessedly it might have been seen as any couple among the daily thousands so compromised  they walked wandered wondered and a little lost themselves strether hadnt had for years so rich a consciousness of timea bag of gold into which he constantly dipped for a handful  it was present to him that when the little business with mr bilham should be over he would still have shining hours to use absolutely as he liked  there was no great pulse of haste yet in this process of saving chad nor was that effect a bit more marked as he sat half an hour later with his legs under chads mahogany with mr bilham on one side with a friend of mr bilhams on the other with waymarsh stupendously opposite and with the great hum of paris coming up in softness vaguenessfor strether himself indeed already positive sweetnessthrough the sunny windows toward which the day before his curiosity had raised its wings from below  the feeling strongest with him at that moment had borne fruit almost faster than he could taste it and strether literally felt at the present hour that there was a precipitation in his fate  he had known nothing and nobody as he stood in the street but hadnt his view now taken a bound in the direction of every one and of every thing  whats he up to whats he up tosomething like that was at the back of his head all the while in respect to little bilham but meanwhile till he should make out every one and every thing were as good as represented for him by the combination of his host and the lady on his left  the lady on his left the lady thus promptly and ingeniously invited to meet mr strether and mr waymarshit was the way she herself expressed her casewas a very marked person a person who had much to do with our friends asking himself if the occasion werent in its essence the most baited the most gilded of traps baited it could properly be called when the repast was of so wise a savour and gilded surrounding objects seemed inevitably to need to be when miss barracewhich was the ladys namelooked at them with convex parisian eyes and through a glass with a remarkably long tortoiseshell handle  why miss barrace mature meagre erect and eminently gay highly adorned perfectly familiar freely contradictions and reminding him of some lastcentury portrait of a clever head without powderwhy miss barrace should have been in particular the note of a trap strether couldnt on the spot have explained he blinked in the light of a conviction that he should know later on and know wellas it came over him for that matter with force that he should need to  he wondered what he was to think exactly of either of his new friends since the young man chads intimate and deputy had in thus constituting the scene practised so much more subtly than he had been prepared for and since in especial miss barrace surrounded clearly by every consideration hadnt scrupled to figure as a familiar object  it was interesting to him to feel that he was in the presence of new measures other standards a different scale of relations and that evidently here were a happy pair who didnt think of things at all as he and waymarsh thought  nothing was less to have been calculated in the business than that it should now be for him as if he and waymarsh were comparatively quite at one  the latter was magnificentthis at least was an assurance privately given him by miss barrace  oh your friends a type the grand old americanwhat shall one call it the hebrew prophet ezekiel jeremiah who used when i was a little girl in the rue montaigne to come to see my father and who was usually the american minister to the tuileries or some other court  i havent seen one these ever so many years the sight of it warms my poor old chilled heart this specimen is wonderful in the right quarter you know hell have a succes fou strether hadnt failed to ask what the right quarter might be much as he required his presence of mind to meet such a change in their scheme oh the artistquarter and that kind of thing here already for instance as you see  he had been on the point of echoing hereis this the artistquarter but she had already disposed of the question with a wave of all her tortoiseshell and an easy bring him to me  he knew on the spot how little he should be able to bring him for the very air was by this time to his sense thick and hot with poor waymarshs judgement of it he was in the trap still more than his companion and unlike his companion not making the best of it which was precisely what doubtless gave him his admirable sombre glow  little did miss barrace know that what was behind it was his grave estimate of her own laxity the general assumption with which our two friends had arrived had been that of finding mr bilham ready to conduct them to one or other of those resorts of the earnest the aesthetic fraternity which were shown among the sights of paris  in this character it would have justified them in a proper insistence on discharging their score  waymarshs only proviso at the last had been that nobody should pay for him but he found himself as the occasion developed paid for on a scale as to which strether privately made out that he already nursed retribution  strether was conscious across the table of what worked in him conscious when they passed back to the small salon to which the previous evening he himself had made so rich a reference conscious most of all as they stepped out to the balcony in which one would have had to be an ogre not to recognise the perfect place for easy aftertastes  these things were enhanced for miss barrace by a succession of excellent cigarettesacknowledged acclaimed as a part of the wonderful supply left behind him by chadin an almost equal absorption of which strether found himself blindly almost wildly pushing forward  he might perish by the sword as well as by famine and he knew that his having abetted the lady by an excess that was rare with him would count for little in the sumas waymarsh might so easily add it upof her licence  waymarsh had smoked of old smoked hugely but waymarsh did nothing now and that gave him his advantage over people who took things up lightly just when others had laid them heavily down  strether had never smoked and he felt as if he flaunted at his friend that this had been only because of a reason  the reason it now began to appear even to himself was that he had never had a lady to smoke with  it was this ladys being there at all however that was the strange free thing perhaps since she was there her smoking was the least of her freedoms  if strether had been sure at each juncture of whatwith bilham in especialshe talked about he might have traced others and winced at them and felt waymarsh wince but he was in fact so often at sea that his sense of the range of reference was merely general and that he on several different occasions guessed and interpreted only to doubt  he wondered what they meant but there were things he scarce thought they could be supposed to mean and oh nonot that was at the end of most of his ventures  this was the very beginning with him of a condition as to which later on it will be seen he found cause to pull himself up and he was to remember the moment duly as the first step in a process  the central fact of the place was neither more nor less when analysedand a pressure superficial sufficedthan the fundamental impropriety of chads situation round about which they thus seemed cynically clustered accordingly since they took it for granted they took for granted all that was in connexion with it taken for granted at woollettmatters as to which verily he had been reduced with mrs newsome to the last intensity of silence  that was the consequence of their being too bad to be talked about and was the accompaniment by the same token of a deep conception of their badness  it befell therefore that when poor strether put it to himself that their badness was ultimately or perhaps even insolently what such a scene as the one before him was so to speak built upon he could scarce shirk the dilemma of reading a roundabout echo of them into almost anything that came up  this he was well aware was a dreadful necessity but such was the stern logic he could only gather of a relation to the irregular life  it was the way the irregular life sat upon bilham and miss barrace that was the insidious the delicate marvel  he was eager to concede that their relation to it was all indirect for anything else in him would have shown the grossness of bad manners but the indirectness was none the less consonantthat was strikingwith a grateful enjoyment of everything that was chads  they spoke of him repeatedly invoking his good name and good nature and the worst confusion of mind for strether was that all their mention of him was of a kind to do him honour they commended his munificence and approved his taste and in doing so sat down as it seemed to strether in the very soil out of which these things flowered  our friends final predicament was that he himself was sitting down for the time with them and there was a supreme moment at which compared with his collapse waymarshs erectness affected him as really high  one thing was certainhe saw he must make up his mind  he must approach chad must wait for him deal with him master him but he mustnt dispossess himself of the faculty of seeing things as they were  he must bring him to himnot go himself as it were so much of the way  he must at any rate be clearer as to whatshould he continue to do that for conveniencehe was still condoning  it was on the detail of this quantityand what could the fact be but mystifyingthat bilham and miss barrace threw so little light  so there they were    ii   when miss gostrey arrived at the end of a week she made him a sign he went immediately to see her and it wasnt till then that he could again close his grasp on the idea of a corrective this idea however was luckily all before him again from the moment he crossed the threshold of the little entresol of the quartier marboeuf into which she had gathered as she said picking them up in a thousand flights and funny little passionate pounces the makings of a final nest  he recognised in an instant that there really there only he should find the boon with the vision of which he had first mounted chads stairs he might have been a little scared at the picture of how much more in this place he should know himself in hadnt his friend been on the spot to measure the amount to his appetite  her compact and crowded little chambers almost dusky as they at first struck him with accumulations represented a supreme general adjustment to opportunities and conditions  wherever he looked he saw an old ivory or an old brocade and he scarce knew where to sit for fear of a misappliance  the life of the occupant struck him of a sudden as more charged with possession even than chads or than miss barraces wide as his glimpse had lately become of the empire of things what was before him still enlarged it the lust of the eyes and the pride of life had indeed thus their temple  it was the innermost nook of the shrineas brown as a pirates cave  in the brownness were glints of gold patches of purple were in the gloom objects all that caught through the muslin with their high rarity the light of the low windows nothing was clear about them but that they were precious and they brushed his ignorance with their contempt as a flower in a liberty taken with him might have been whisked under his nose but after a full look at his hostess he knew none the less what most concerned him  the circle in which they stood together was warm with life and every question between them would live there as nowhere else a question came up as soon as they had spoken for his answer with a laugh was quickly  well theyve got hold of me  much of their talk on this first occasion was his development of that truth  he was extraordinarily glad to see her expressing to her frankly what she most showed him that one might live for years without a blessing unsuspected but that to know it at last for no more than three days was to need it or miss it for ever  she was the blessing that had now become his need and what could prove it better than that without her he had lost himself  what do you mean she asked with an absence of alarm that correcting him as if he had mistaken the period of one of her pieces gave him afresh a sense of her easy movement through the maze he had but begun to tread  what in the name of all the pococks have you managed to do  why exactly the wrong thing  ive made a frantic friend of little bilham  ah that sort of thing was of the essence of your case and to have been allowed for from the first  and it was only after this that quite as a minor matter she asked who in the world little bilham might be when she learned that he was a friend of chads and living for the time in chads rooms in chads absence quite as if acting in chads spirit and serving chads cause she showed however more interest  should you mind my seeing him only once you know she added  oh the oftener the better  hes amusinghes original  he doesnt shock you miss gostrey threw out  never in the world we escape that with a perfection i feel it to be largely no doubt because i dont halfunderstand him but our modus vivendi isnt spoiled even by that  you must dine with me to meet him strether went on  then youll see  are you giving dinners  yesthere i am  thats what i mean  all her kindness wondered  that youre spending too much money  dear nothey seem to cost so little  but that i do it to them i ought to hold off  she thought againshe laughed  the money you must be spending to think it cheap but i must be out of itto the naked eye  he looked for a moment as if she were really failing him  then you wont meet them  it was almost as if she had developed an unexpected personal prudence  she hesitated  who are theyfirst  why little bilham to begin with  he kept back for the moment miss barrace  and chadwhen he comesyou must absolutely see  when then does he come  when bilham has had time to write him and hear from him about me bilham however he pursued will report favourablyfavourably for chad  that will make him not afraid to come  i want you the more therefore you see for my bluff  oh youll do yourself for your bluff  she was perfectly easy at the rate youve gone im quiet  ah but i havent said strether made one protest  she turned it over  havent you been seeing what theres to protest about  he let her with this however ruefully have the whole truth  i havent yet found a single thing  isnt there any one with him then  of the sort i came out about  strether took a moment  how do i know and what do i care  oh ohand her laughter spread  he was struck in fact by the effect on her of his joke  he saw now how he meant it as a joke she saw however still other things though in an instant she had hidden them youve got at no facts at all  he tried to muster them  well he has a lovely home  ah that in paris she quickly returned proves nothing  that is rather it disproves nothing  they may very well you see the people your mission is concerned with have done it for him  exactly  and it was on the scene of their doings then that waymarsh and i sat guzzling  oh if you forbore to guzzle here on scenes of doings she replied you might easily die of starvation  with which she smiled at him youve worse before you  ah ive everything before me  but on our hypothesis you know they must be wonderful  they are said miss gostrey  youre not therefore you see she added wholly without facts  theyve been in effect wonderful  to have got at something comparatively definite appeared at last a little to helpa wave by which moreover the next moment recollection was washed  my young man does admit furthermore that theyre our friends great interest  is that the expression he uses  strether more exactly recalled  nonot quite  something more vivid  less  he had bent with neared glasses over a group of articles on a small stand and at this he came up  it was a mere allusion but on the lookout as i was it struck me  awful you know as chad isthose were bilhams words  awful you know  ohand miss gostrey turned them over  she seemed however satisfied  well what more do you want  he glanced once more at a bibelot or two and everything sent him back but it is all the same as if they wished to let me have it between the eyes  she wondered  quoi donc  why what i speak of  the amenity  they can stun you with that as well as with anything else  oh she answered youll come round i must see them each she went on for myself  i mean mr bilham and mr newsomemr bilham naturally first  once onlyonce for each that will do but face to facefor half an hour  whats mr chad she immediately pursued doing at cannes  decent men dont go to cannes with thewell with the kind of ladies you mean  dont they  strether asked with an interest in decent men that amused her  no elsewhere but not to cannes  cannes is different  cannes is better  cannes is best  i mean its all people you knowwhen you do know them  and if he does why thats different too  he must have gone alone  she cant be with him  i havent strether confessed in his weakness the least idea there seemed much in what she said but he was able after a little to help her to a nearer impression  the meeting with little bilham took place by easy arrangement in the great gallery of the louvre and when standing with his fellow visitor before one of the splendid titiansthe overwhelming portrait of the young man with the strangelyshaped glove and the bluegrey eyeshe turned to see the third member of their party advance from the end of the waxed and gilded vista he had a sense of having at last taken hold  he had agreed with miss gostreyit dated even from chesterfor a morning at the louvre and he had embraced independently the same idea as thrown out by little bilham whom he had already accompanied to the museum of the luxembourg  the fusion of these schemes presented no difficulty and it was to strike him again that in little bilhams company contrarieties in general dropped  oh hes all righthes one of us miss gostrey after the first exchange soon found a chance to murmur to her companion and strether as they proceeded and paused and while a quick unanimity between the two appeared to have phrased itself in half a dozen remarksstrether knew that he knew almost immediately what she meant and took it as still another sign that he had got his job in hand  this was the more grateful to him that he could think of the intelligence now serving him as an acquisition positively new he wouldnt have known even the day before what she meantthat is if she meant what he assumed that they were intense americans together  he had just worked roundand with a sharper turn of the screw than any yetto the conception of an american intense as little bilham was intense  the young man was his first specimen the specimen had profoundly perplexed him at present however there was light  it was by little bilhams amazing serenity that he had at first been affected but he had inevitably in his circumspection felt it as the trail of the serpent the corruption as he might conveniently have said of europe whereas the promptness with which it came up for miss gostrey but as a special little form of the oldest thing they knew justified it at once to his own vision as well he wanted to be able to like his specimen with a clear good conscience and this fully permitted it  what had muddled him was precisely the small artistmans wayit was so completeof being more american than anybody  but it now for the time put strether vastly at his ease to have this view of a new way  the amiable youth then looked out as it had first struck strether at a world in respect to which he hadnt a prejudice the one our friend most instantly missed was the usual one in favour of an occupation accepted  little bilham had an occupation but it was only an occupation declined and it was by his general exemption from alarm anxiety or remorse on this score that the impression of his serenity was made  he had come out to paris to paintto fathom that is at large that mystery but study had been fatal to him so far as anything could be fatal and his productive power faltered in proportion as his knowledge grew strether had gathered from him that at the moment of his finding him in chads rooms he hadnt saved from his shipwreck a scrap of anything but his beautiful intelligence and his confirmed habit of paris  he referred to these things with an equal fond familiarity and it was sufficiently clear that as an outfit they still served him  they were charming to strether through the hour spent at the louvre where indeed they figured for him as an unseparated part of the charged iridescent air the glamour of the name the splendour of the space the colour of the masters  yet they were present too wherever the young man led and the day after the visit to the louvre they hung in a different walk about the steps of our party  he had invited his companions to cross the river with him offering to show them his own poor place and his own poor place which was very poor gave to his idiosyncrasies for stretherthe small sublime indifference and independences that had struck the latter as freshan odd and engaging dignity he lived at the end of an alley that went out of an old short cobbled street a street that went in turn out of a new long smooth avenuestreet and avenue and alley having however in common a sort of social shabbiness and he introduced them to the rather cold and blank little studio which he had lent to a comrade for the term of his elegant absence  the comrade was another ingenuous compatriot to whom he had wired that tea was to await them regardless and this reckless repast and the second ingenuous compatriot and the faraway makeshift life with its jokes and its gaps its delicate daubs and its three or four chairs its overflow of taste and conviction and its lack of nearly all elsethese things wove round the occasion a spell to which our hero unreservedly surrendered  he liked the ingenuous compatriotsfor two or three others soon gathered he liked the delicate daubs and the free discriminationsinvolving references indeed involving enthusiasms and execrations that made him as they said sit up he liked above all the legend of goodhumoured poverty of mutual accommodation fairly raised to the romantic that he soon read into the scene  the ingenuous compatriots showed a candour he thought surpassing even the candour of woollett they were redhaired and longlegged they were quaint and queer and dear and droll they made the place resound with the vernacular which he had never known so marked as when figuring for the chosen language he must suppose of contemporary art  they twanged with a vengeance the aesthetic lyrethey drew from it wonderful airs this aspect of their life had an admirable innocence and he looked on occasion at maria gostrey to see to what extent that element reached her  she gave him however for the hour as she had given him the previous day no further sign than to show how she dealt with boys meeting them with the air of old parisian practice that she had for every one for everything in turn wonderful about the delicate daubs masterful about the way to make tea trustful about the legs of chairs and familiarly reminiscent of those in the other time the named the numbered or the caricatured who had flourished or failed disappeared or arrived she had accepted with the best grace her second course of little bilham and had said to strether the previous afternoon on his leaving them that since her impression was to be renewed she would reserve judgement till after the new evidence  the new evidence was to come as it proved in a day or two  he soon had from maria a message to the effect that an excellent box at the francais had been lent her for the following night it seeming on such occasions not the least of her merits that she was subject to such approaches  the sense of how she was always paying for something in advance was equalled on strethers part only by the sense of how she was always being paid all of which made for his consciousness in the larger air of a lively bustling traffic the exchange of such values as were not for him to handle  she hated he knew at the french play anything but a boxjust as she hated at the english anything but a stall and a box was what he was already in this phase girding himself to press upon her but she had for that matter her community with little bilham  she too always on the great issues showed as having known in time it made her constantly beforehand with him and gave him mainly the chance to ask himself how on the day of their settlement their account would stand  he endeavoured even now to keep it a little straight by arranging that if he accepted her invitation she should dine with him first but the upshot of this scruple was that at eight oclock on the morrow he awaited her with waymarsh under the pillared portico  she hadnt dined with him and it was characteristic of their relation that she had made him embrace her refusal without in the least understanding it  she ever caused her rearrangements to affect him as her tenderest touches  it was on that principle for instance that giving him the opportunity to be amiable again to little bilham she had suggested his offering the young man a seat in their box  strether had dispatched for this purpose a small blue missive to the boulevard malesherbes but up to the moment of their passing into the theatre he had received no response to his message  he held however even after they had been for some time conveniently seated that their friend who knew his way about would come in at his own right moment  his temporary absence moreover seemed as never yet to make the right moment for miss gostrey  strether had been waiting till tonight to get back from her in some mirrored form her impressions and conclusions she had elected as they said to see little bilham once but now she had seen him twice and had nevertheless not said more than a word  waymarsh meanwhile sat opposite him with their hostess between and miss gostrey spoke of herself as an instructor of youth introducing her little charges to a work that was one of the glories of literature the glory was happily unobjectionable and the little charges were candid for herself she had travelled that road and she merely waited on their innocence  but she referred in due time to their absent friend whom it was clear they should have to give up  he either wont have got your note she said or you wont have got his  he has had some kind of hindrance and of course for that matter you know a man never writes about coming to a box  she spoke as if with her look it might have been waymarsh who had written to the youth and the latters face showed a mixture of austerity and anguish  she went on however as if to meet this  hes far and away you know the best of them  the best of whom maam  why of all the long processionthe boys the girls or the old men and old women as they sometimes really are the hope as one may say of our country  theyve all passed year after year but there has been no one in particular ive ever wanted to stop  i feeldont youthat i want to stop little bilham hes so exactly right as he is  she continued to talk to waymarsh  hes too delightful  if hell only not spoil it but they always will they always do they always have  i dont think waymarsh knows strether said after a moment quite what its open to bilham to spoil  it cant be a good american waymarsh lucidly enough replied for it didnt strike me the young man had developed much in that shape  ah miss gostrey sighed the name of the good american is as easily given as taken away what is it to begin with to be one and whats the extraordinary hurry  surely nothing thats so pressing was ever so little defined  its such an order really that before we cook you the dish we must at least have your receipt  besides the poor chicks have time what ive seen so often spoiled she pursued is the happy attitude itself the state of faith andwhat shall i call itthe sense of beauty youre right about himshe now took in strether little bilham has them to a charm we must keep little bilham along then she was all again for waymarsh  the others have all wanted so dreadfully to do something and theyve gone and done it in too many cases indeed  it leaves them never the same afterwards the charms always somehow broken  now he i think you know really wont  he wont do the least dreadful little thing  we shall continue to enjoy him just as he is  nohes quite beautiful  he sees everything  he isnt a bit ashamed  he has every scrap of the courage of it that one could ask  only think what he might do one wants reallyfor fear of some accidentto keep him in view at this very moment perhaps what maynt he be up to  ive had my disappointmentsthe poor things are never really safe or only at least when you have them under your eye one can never completely trust them  ones uneasy and i think thats why i most miss him now  she had wound up with a laugh of enjoyment over her embroidery of her ideaan enjoyment that her face communicated to strether who almost wished none the less at this moment that she would let poor waymarsh alone  he knew more or less what she meant but the fact wasnt a reason for her not pretending to waymarsh that he didnt  it was craven of him perhaps but he would for the high amenity of the occasion have liked waymarsh not to be so sure of his wit  her recognition of it gave him away and before she had done with him or with that article would give him worse  what was he all the same to do  he looked across the box at his friend their eyes met something queer and stiff something that bore on the situation but that it was better not to touch passed in silence between them  well the effect of it for strether was an abrupt reaction a final impatience of his own tendency to temporise  where was that taking him anyway  it was one of the quiet instants that sometimes settle more matters than the outbreaks dear to the historic muse  the only qualification of the quietness was the synthetic oh hang it into which strethers share of the silence soundlessly flowered  it represented this mute ejaculation a final impulse to burn his ships  these ships to the historic muse may seem of course mere cockles but when he presently spoke to miss gostrey it was with the sense at least of applying the torch  is it then a conspiracy  between the two young men  well i dont pretend to be a seer or a prophetess she presently replied but if im simply a woman of sense hes working for you tonight  i dont quite know howbut its in my bones  and she looked at him at last as if little material as she yet gave him hed really understand  for an opinion thats my opinion  he makes you out too well not to  not to work for me tonight  strether wondered  then i hope he isnt doing anything very bad  theyve got you she portentously answered  do you mean he is  theyve got you she merely repeated  though she disclaimed the prophetic vision she was at this instant the nearest approach he had ever met to the priestess of the oracle  the light was in her eyes you must face it now  he faced it on the spot  they had arranged  every move in the game  and theyve been arranging ever since  he has had every day his little telegram from cannes  it made strether open his eyes  do you know that  i do better  i see it  this was before i met him what i wondered whether i was to see  but as soon as i met him i ceased to wonder and our second meeting made me sure  i took him all in he was actinghe is stillon his daily instructions  so that chad has done the whole thing  oh nonot the whole  weve done some of it  you and i and europe  europeyes strether mused  dear old paris she seemed to explain  but there was more and with one of her turns she risked it  and dear old waymarsh you she declared have been a good bit of it  he sat massive  a good bit of what maam  why of the wonderful consciousness of our friend here  youve helped too in your way to float him to where he is  and where the devil is he  she passed it on with a laugh  where the devil strether are you  he spoke as if he had just been thinking it out  well quite already in chads hands it would seem  and he had had with this another thought  will that bejust all through bilhamthe way hes going to work it  it would be for him you know an idea and chad with an idea  well she asked while the image held him  well is chadwhat shall i saymonstrous  oh as much as you like but the idea you speak of she said wont have been his best  hell have a better  it wont be all through little bilham that hell work it  this already sounded almost like a hope destroyed  through whom else then  thats what we shall see  but quite as she spoke she turned and strether turned for the door of the box had opened with the click of the ouvreuse  from the lobby and a gentleman a stranger to them had come in with a quick step  the door closed behind him and though their faces showed him his mistake his air which was striking was all good confidence  the curtain had just again arisen and in the hush of the general attention strethers challenge was tacit as was also the greeting with a quickly deprecating hand and smile of the unannounced visitor  he discreetly signed that he would wait would stand and these things and his face one look from which she had caught had suddenly worked for miss gostrey  she fitted to them all an answer for strethers last question  the solid stranger was simply the answeras she now turning to her friend indicated  she brought it straight out for himit presented the intruder  why through this gentleman  the gentleman indeed at the same time though sounding for strether a very short name did practically as much to explain strether gasped the name backthen only had he seen miss gostrey had said more than she knew  they were in presence of chad himself  our friend was to go over it afterwards again and againhe was going over it much of the time that they were together and they were together constantly for three or four days  the note had been so strongly struck during that first halfhour that everything happening since was comparatively a minor development  the fact was that his perception of the young mans identityso absolutely checked for a minutehad been quite one of the sensations that count in life he certainly had never known one that had acted as he might have said with more of a crowded rush  and the rush though both vague and multitudinous had lasted a long time protected as it were yet at the same time aggravated by the circumstance of its coinciding with a stretch of decorous silence they couldnt talk without disturbing the spectators in the part of the balcony just below them and it for that matter came to stretherbeing a thing of the sort that did come to himthat these were the accidents of a high civilisation the imposed tribute to propriety the frequent exposure to conditions usually brilliant in which relief has to await its time  relief was never quite near at hand for kings queens comedians and other such people and though you might be yourself not exactly one of those you could yet in leading the life of high pressure guess a little how they sometimes felt  it was truly the life of high pressure that strether had seemed to feel himself lead while he sat there close to chad during the long tension of the act  he was in presence of a fact that occupied his whole mind that occupied for the halfhour his senses themselves all together but he couldnt without inconvenience show anythingwhich moreover might count really as luck  what he might have shown had he shown at all was exactly the kind of emotionthe emotion of bewildermentthat he had proposed to himself from the first whatever should occur to show least  the phenomenon that had suddenly sat down there with him was a phenomenon of change so complete that his imagination which had worked so beforehand felt itself in the connexion without margin or allowance  it had faced every contingency but that chad should not be chad and this was what it now had to face with a mere strained smile and an uncomfortable flush  he asked himself if by any chance before he should have in some way to commit himself he might feel his mind settled to the new vision might habituate it so to speak to the remarkable truth but oh it was too remarkable the truth for what could be more remarkable than this sharp rupture of an identity  you could deal with a man as himselfyou couldnt deal with him as somebody else  it was a small source of peace moreover to be reduced to wondering how little he might know in such an event what a sum he was setting you  he couldnt absolutely not know for you couldnt absolutely not let him  it was a case then simply a strong case as people nowadays called such things a case of transformation unsurpassed and the hope was but in the general law that strong cases were liable to control from without perhaps he strether himself was the only person after all aware of it even miss gostrey with all her science wouldnt be would sheand he had never seen any one less aware of anything than waymarsh as he glowered at chad  the social sightlessness of his old friends survey marked for him afresh and almost in an humiliating way the inevitable limits of direct aid from this source  he was not certain however of not drawing a shade of compensation from the privilege as yet untasted of knowing more about something in particular than miss gostrey did  his situation too was a case for that matter and he was now so interested quite so privately agog about it that he had already an eye to the fun it would be to open up to her afterwards  he derived during his halfhour no assistance from her and just this fact of her not meeting his eyes played a little it must be confessed into his predicament  he had introduced chad in the first minutes under his breath and there was never the primness in her of the person unacquainted but she had none the less betrayed at first no vision but of the stage where she occasionally found a pretext for an appreciative moment that she invited waymarsh to share  the latters faculty of participation had never had all round such an assault to meet the pressure on him being the sharper for this chosen attitude in her as strether judged it of isolating for their natural intercourse chad and himself this intercourse was meanwhile restricted to a frank friendly look from the young man something markedly like a smile but falling far short of a grin and to the vivacity of strethers private speculation as to whether he carried himself like a fool  he didnt quite see how he could so feel as one without somehow showing as one  the worst of that question moreover was that he knew it as a symptom the sense of which annoyed him  if im going to be odiously conscious of how i may strike the fellow he reflected it was so little what i came out for that i may as well stop before i begin  this sage consideration too distinctly seemed to leave untouched the fact that he was going to be conscious  he was conscious of everything but of what would have served him  he was to know afterwards in the watches of the night that nothing would have been more open to him than after a minute or two to propose to chad to seek with him the refuge of the lobby he hadnt only not proposed it but had lacked even the presence of mind to see it as possible  he had stuck there like a schoolboy wishing not to miss a minute of the show though for that portion of the show then presented he hadnt had an instants real attention  he couldnt when the curtain fell have given the slightest account of what had happened  he had therefore further not at that moment acknowledged the amenity added by this acceptance of his awkwardness to chads general patience hadnt he none the less known at the very timeknown it stupidly and without reactionthat the boy was accepting something  he was modestly benevolent the boythat was at least what he had been capable of the superiority of making out his chance to be and one had ones self literally not had the gumption to get in ahead of him  if we should go into all that occupied our friend in the watches of the night we should have to mend our pen but an instance or two may mark for us the vividness with which he could remember  he remembered the two absurdities that if his presence of mind had failed were the things that had had most to do with it  he had never in his life seen a young man come into a box at ten oclock at night and would if challenged on the question in advance have scarce been ready to pronounce as to different ways of doing so  but it was in spite of this definite to him that chad had had a way that was wonderful  a fact carrying with it an implication that as one might imagine it he knew he had learned how  here already then were abounding results he had on the spot and without the least trouble of intention taught strether that even in so small a thing as that there were different ways  he had done in the same line still more than this had by a mere shake or two of the head made his old friend observe that the change in him was perhaps more than anything else for the eye a matter of the marked streaks of grey extraordinary at his age in his thick black hair as well as that this new feature was curiously becoming to him did something for him as characterisation also evenof all things in the worldas refinement that had been a good deal wanted  strether felt however he would have had to confess that it wouldnt have been easy just now on this and other counts in the presence of what had been supplied to be quite clear as to what had been missed  a reflexion a candid critic might have made of old for instance was that it would have been happier for the son to look more like the mother but this was a reflexion that at present would never occur  the ground had quite fallen away from it yet no resemblance whatever to the mother had supervened  it would have been hard for a young mans face and air to disconnect themselves more completely than chads at this juncture from any discerned from any imaginable aspect of a new england female parent  that of course was no more than had been on the cards but it produced in strether none the less one of those frequent phenomena of mental reference with which all judgement in him was actually beset  again and again as the days passed he had had a sense of the pertinence of communicating quickly with woollettcommunicating with a quickness with which telegraphy alone would rhyme the fruit really of a fine fancy in him for keeping things straight for the happy forestalment of error  no one could explain better when needful nor put more conscience into an account or a report which burden of conscience is perhaps exactly the reason why his heart always sank when the clouds of explanation gathered  his highest ingenuity was in keeping the sky of life clear of them whether or no he had a grand idea of the lucid he held that nothing ever was in factfor any one elseexplained  one went through the vain motions but it was mostly a waste of life  a personal relation was a relation only so long as people either perfectly understood or better still didnt care if they didnt from the moment they cared if they didnt it was living by the sweat of ones brow and the sweat of ones brow was just what one might buy ones self off from by keeping the ground free of the wild weed of delusion  it easily grew too fast and the atlantic cable now alone could race with it  that agency would each day have testified for him to something that was not what woollett had argued  he was not at this moment absolutely sure that the effect of the morrowsor rather of the nightsappreciation of the crisis wouldnt be to determine some brief missive  have at last seen him but oh dearsome temporary relief of that sort seemed to hover before him  it hovered somehow as preparing them allyet preparing them for what  if he might do so more luminously and cheaply he would tick out in four words  awfully oldgrey hair to this particular item in chads appearance he constantly during their mute halfhour reverted as if so very much more than he could have said had been involved in it  the most he could have said would have been  if hes going to make me feel young which indeed however carried with it quite enough  if strether was to feel young that is it would be because chad was to feel old and an aged and hoary sinner had been no part of the scheme  the question of chadwicks true time of life was doubtless what came up quickest after the adjournment of the two when the play was over to a cafe in the avenue de lopera  miss gostrey had in due course been perfect for such a step she had known exactly what they wantedto go straight somewhere and talk and strether had even felt she had known what he wished to say and that he was arranging immediately to begin  she hadnt pretended this as she had pretended on the other hand to have divined waymarshs wish to extend to her an independent protection homeward but strether nevertheless found how after he had chad opposite to him at a small table in the brilliant halls that his companion straightway selected sharply and easily discriminated from others it was quite to his mind as if she heard him speak as if sitting up a mile away in the little apartment he knew she would listen hard enough to catch  he found too that he liked that idea and he wished that by the same token mrs newsome might have caught as well  for what had above all been determined in him as a necessity of the first order was not to lose another hour nor a fraction of one was to advance to overwhelm with a rush  this was how he would anticipateby a nightattack as might beany forced maturity that a crammed consciousness of paris was likely to take upon itself to assert on behalf of the boy  he knew to the full on what he had just extracted from miss gostrey chads marks of alertness but they were a reason the more for not dawdling  if he was himself moreover to be treated as young he wouldnt at all events be so treated before he should have struck out at least once  his arms might be pinioned afterwards but it would have been left on record that he was fifty  the importance of this he had indeed begun to feel before they left the theatre it had become a wild unrest urging him to seize his chance  he could scarcely wait for it as they went he was on the verge of the indecency of bringing up the question in the street he fairly caught himself going onso he afterwards invidiously named itas if there would be for him no second chance should the present be lost  not till on the purple divan before the perfunctory bock he had brought out the words themselves was he sure for that matter that the present would be saved      book fourth     i   ive come you know to make you break with everything neither more nor less and take you straight home so youll be so good as immediately and favourably to consider itstrether face to face with chad after the play had sounded these words almost breathlessly and with an effect at first positively disconcerting to himself alone for chads receptive attitude was that of a person who had been gracefully quiet while the messenger at last reaching him has run a mile through the dust  during some seconds after he had spoken strether felt as if he had made some such exertion he was not even certain that the perspiration wasnt on his brow  it was the kind of consciousness for which he had to thank the look that while the strain lasted the young mans eyes gave him  they reflectedand the deuce of the thing was that they reflected really with a sort of shyness of kindnesshis momentarily disordered state which fact brought on in its turn for our friend the dawn of a fear that chad might simply take it outtake everything outin being sorry for him  such a fear any fear was unpleasant  but everything was unpleasant it was odd how everything had suddenly turned so  this however was no reason for letting the least thing go  strether had the next minute proceeded as roundly as if with an advantage to follow up of course im a busybody if you want to fight the case to the death but after all mainly in the sense of having known you and having given you such attention as you kindly permitted when you were in jackets and knickerbockers  yesit was knickerbockers im busybody enough to remember that and that you had for your agei speak of the first faraway timetremendously stout legs well we want you to break your mothers hearts passionately set upon it but she has above and beyond that excellent arguments and reasons  ive not put them into her headi neednt remind you how little shes a person who needs that  but they existyou must take it from me as a friend both of hers and yoursfor myself as well  i didnt invent them i didnt originally work them out but i understand them i think i can explain themby which i mean make you actively do them justice and thats why you see me here you had better know the worst at once  its a question of an immediate rupture and an immediate return  ive been conceited enough to dream i can sugar that pill  i take at any rate the greatest interest in the question  i took it already before i left home and i dont mind telling you that altered as you are i take it still more now that ive seen you  youre older andi dont know what to call itmore of a handful but youre by so much the more i seem to make out to our purpose  do i strike you as improved  strether was to recall that chad had at this point enquired  he was likewise to recalland it had to count for some time as his greatest comfortthat it had been given him as they said at woollett to reply with some presence of mind  i havent the least idea  he was really for a while to like thinking he had been positively hard  on the point of conceding that chad had improved in appearance but that to the question of appearance the remark must be confined he checked even that compromise and left his reservation bare  not only his moral but also as it were his aesthetic sense had a little to pay for this chad being unmistakeablyand wasnt it a matter of the confounded grey hair againhandsomer than he had ever promised  that however fell in perfectly with what strether had said they had no desire to keep down his proper expansion and he wouldnt be less to their purpose for not looking as he had too often done of old only bold and wild  there was indeed a signal particular in which he would distinctly be more so  strether didnt as he talked absolutely follow himself he only knew he was clutching his thread and that he held it from moment to moment a little tighter his mere uninterruptedness during the few minutes helped him to do that  he had frequently for a month turned over what he should say on this very occasion and he seemed at last to have said nothing he had thought ofeverything was so totally different  but in spite of all he had put the flag at the window  this was what he had done and there was a minute during which he affected himself as having shaken it hard flapped it with a mighty flutter straight in front of his companions nose  it gave him really almost the sense of having already acted his part  the momentary reliefas if from the knowledge that nothing of that at least could be undonesprang from a particular cause the cause that had flashed into operation in miss gostreys box with direct apprehension with amazed recognition and that had been concerned since then in every throb of his consciousness what it came to was that with an absolutely new quantity to deal with one simply couldnt know  the new quantity was represented by the fact that chad had been made over  that was all whatever it was it was everything  strether had never seen the thing so done beforeit was perhaps a speciality of paris  if one had been present at the process one might little by little have mastered the result but he was face to face as matters stood with the finished business it had freely been noted for him that he might be received as a dog among skittles but that was on the basis of the old quantity he had originally thought of lines and tones as things to be taken but these possibilities had now quite melted away  there was no computing at all what the young man before him would think or feel or say on any subject whatever  this intelligence strether had afterwards to account for his nervousness reconstituted as he might just as he had also reconstituted the promptness with which chad had corrected his uncertainty  an extraordinarily short time had been required for the correction and there had ceased to be anything negative in his companions face and air as soon as it was made  your engagement to my mother has become then what they call here a fait accompliit had consisted the determinant touch in nothing more than that  well that was enough strether had felt while his answer hung fire he had felt at the same time however that nothing could less become him than that it should hang fire too long  yes he said brightly it was on the happy settlement of the question that i started  you see therefore to what tune im in your family moreover he added ive been supposing youd suppose it  oh ive been supposing it for a long time and what you tell me helps me to understand that you should want to do something  to do something i mean said chad to commemorate an event sowhat do they call itso auspicious  i see you make out and not unnaturally he continued that bringing me home in triumph as a sort of weddingpresent to mother would commemorate it better than anything else  you want to make a bonfire in fact he laughed and you pitch me on  thank you thank you he laughed again  he was altogether easy about it and this made strether now see how at bottom and in spite of the shade of shyness that really cost him nothing he had from the first moment been easy about everything  the shade of shyness was mere good taste  people with manners formed could apparently have as one of their best cards the shade of shyness too he had leaned a little forward to speak his elbows were on the table and the inscrutable new face that he had got somewhere and somehow was brought by the movement nearer to his critics there was a fascination for that critic in its not being this ripe physiognomy the face that under observation at least he had originally carried away from woollett  strether found a certain freedom on his own side in defining it as that of a man of the worlda formula that indeed seemed to come now in some degree to his relief that of a man to whom things had happened and were variously known  in gleams in glances the past did perhaps peep out of it but such lights were faint and instantly merged  chad was brown and thick and strong and of old chad had been rough  was all the difference therefore that he was actually smooth possibly for that he was smooth was as marked as in the taste of a sauce or in the rub of a hand  the effect of it was generalit had retouched his features drawn them with a cleaner line  it had cleared his eyes and settled his colour and polished his fine square teeththe main ornament of his face and at the same time that it had given him a form and a surface almost a design it had toned his voice established his accent encouraged his smile to more play and his other motions to less he had formerly with a great deal of action expressed very little and he now expressed whatever was necessary with almost none at all  it was as if in short he had really copious perhaps but shapeless been put into a firm mould and turned successfully out  the phenomenonstrether kept eyeing it as a phenomenon an eminent casewas marked enough to be touched by the finger  he finally put his hand across the table and laid it on chads arm if youll promise mehere on the spot and giving me your word of honourto break straight off youll make the future the real right thing for all of us alike  youll ease off the strain of this decent but none the less acute suspense in which ive for so many days been waiting for you and let me turn in to rest  i shall leave you with my blessing and go to bed in peace  chad again fell back at this and his hands pocketed settled himself a little in which posture he looked though he rather anxiously smiled only the more earnest  then strether seemed to see that he was really nervous and he took that as what he would have called a wholesome sign  the only mark of it hitherto had been his more than once taking off and putting on his widebrimmed crush hat  he had at this moment made the motion again to remove it then had only pushed it back so that it hung informally on his strong young grizzled crop  it was a touch that gave the note of the familiarthe intimate and the belatedto their quiet colloquy and it was indeed by some such trivial aid that strether became aware at the same moment of something else  the observation was at any rate determined in him by some light too fine to distinguish from so many others but it was none the less sharply determined  chad looked unmistakeably during these instantswell as strether put it to himself all he was worth  our friend had a sudden apprehension of what that would on certain sides be he saw him in a flash as the young man marked out by women and for a concentrated minute the dignity the comparative austerity as he funnily fancied it of this character affected him almost with awe there was an experience on his interlocutors part that looked out at him from under the displaced hat and that looked out moreover by a force of its own the deep fact of its quantity and quality and not through chads intending bravado or swagger that was then the way men marked out by women wereand also the men by whom the women were doubtless in turn sufficiently distinguished  it affected strether for thirty seconds as a relevant truth a truth which however the next minute had fallen into its relation  cant you imagine there being some questions chad asked that a fellowhowever much impressed by your charming way of stating thingswould like to put to you first  oh yeseasily  im here to answer everything  i think i can even tell you things of the greatest interest to you that you wont know enough to ask me  well take as many days to it as you like but i want strether wound up to go to bed now  really  chad had spoken in such surprise that he was amused  cant you believe itwith what you put me through  the young man seemed to consider  oh i havent put you through muchyet  do you mean theres so much more to come  strether laughed  all the more reason then that i should gird myself  and as if to mark what he felt he could by this time count on he was already on his feet  chad still seated stayed him with a hand against him as he passed between their table and the next  oh we shall get on  the tone was as who should say everything strether could have desired and quite as good the expression of face with which the speaker had looked up at him and kindly held him  all these things lacked was their not showing quite so much as the fruit of experience yes experience was what chad did play on him if he didnt play any grossness of defiance  of course experience was in a manner defiance but it wasnt at any raterather indeed quite the contrarygrossness which was so much gained  he fairly grew older strether thought while he himself so reasoned  then with his mature pat of his visitors arm he also got up and there had been enough of it all by this time to make the visitor feel that something was settled  wasnt it settled that he had at least the testimony of chads own belief in a settlement  strether found himself treating chads profession that they would get on as a sufficient basis for going to bed  he hadnt nevertheless after this gone to bed directly for when they had again passed out together into the mild bright night a check had virtually sprung from nothing more than a small circumstance which might have acted only as confirming quiescence there were people expressive sound projected light still abroad and after they had taken in for a moment through everything the great clear architectural street they turned off in tacit union to the quarter of strethers hotel  of course chad here abruptly began of course mothers making things out with you about me has been naturaland of course also youve had a good deal to go upon still you must have filled out  he had stopped leaving his friend to wonder a little what point he wished to make and this it was that enabled strether meanwhile to make one  oh weve never pretended to go into detail  we werent in the least bound to that  it was filling out enough to miss you as we did  but chad rather oddly insisted though under the high lamp at their corner where they paused he had at first looked as if touched by strethers allusion to the long sense at home of his absence  what i mean is you must have imagined  imagined what  wellhorrors  it affected strether  horrors were so littlesuperficially at leastin this robust and reasoning image  but he was none the less there to be veracious  yes i dare say we have imagined horrors  but wheres the harm if we havent been wrong  chad raised his face to the lamp and it was one of the moments at which he had in his extraordinary way most his air of designedly showing himself  it was as if at these instants he just presented himself his identity so rounded off his palpable presence and his massive young manhood as such a link in the chain as might practically amount to a kind of demonstration  it was as ifand how but anomalouslyhe couldnt after all help thinking sufficiently well of these things to let them go for what they were worth  what could there be in this for strether but the hint of some selfrespect some sense of power oddly perverted something latent and beyond access ominous and perhaps enviable the intimation had the next thing in a flash taken on a namea name on which our friend seized as he asked himself if he werent perhaps really dealing with an irreducible young pagan this descriptionhe quite jumped at ithad a sound that gratified his mental ear so that of a sudden he had already adopted it  paganyes that was wasnt it  what chad would logically be  it was what he must be  it was what he was  the idea was a clue and instead of darkening the prospect projected a certain clearness strether made out in this quick ray that a pagan was perhaps at the pass they had come to the thing most wanted at woollett theyd be able to do with onea good one hed find an openingyes and strethers imagination even now prefigured and accompanied the first appearance there of the rousing personage he had only the slight discomfort of feeling as the young man turned away from the lamp that his thought had in the momentary silence possibly been guessed  well ive no doubt said chad youve come near enough  the details as you say dont matter it has been generally the case that ive let myself go  but im coming roundim not so bad now  with which they walked on again to strethers hotel  do you mean the latter asked as they approached the door that there isnt any woman with you now  but pray what has that to do with it  why its the whole question  of my going home  chad was clearly surprised  oh not much do you think that when i want to go any one will have any power  to keep youstrether took him straight upfrom carrying out your wish  well our idea has been that somebody has hithertoor a good many persons perhapskept you pretty well from wanting thats whatif youre in anybodys handsmay again happen  you dont answer my questionhe kept it up but if you arent in anybodys hands so much the better  theres nothing then but what makes for your going  chad turned this over  i dont answer your question  he spoke quite without resenting it  well such questions have always a rather exaggerated side  one doesnt know quite what you mean by being in womens hands its all so vague  one is when one isnt  one isnt when one is  and then one cant quite give people away  he seemed kindly to explain  ive never got stuckso very hard and as against anything at any time really better i dont think ive ever been afraid  there was something in it that held strether to wonder and this gave him time to go on  he broke out as with a more helpful thought  dont you know how i like paris itself  the upshot was indeed to make our friend marvel  oh if thats all thats the matter with you  it was he who almost showed resentment  chads smile of a truth more than met it  but isnt that enough  strether hesitated but it came out  not enough for your mother spoken however it sounded a trifle oddthe effect of which was that chad broke into a laugh  strether at this succumbed as well though with extreme brevity  permit us to have still our theory  but if you are so free and so strong youre inexcusable ill write in the morning he added with decision  ill say ive got you  this appeared to open for chad a new interest  how often do you write  oh perpetually  and at great length  strether had become a little impatient  i hope its not found too great  oh im sure not  and you hear as often  again strether paused  as often as i deserve  mother writes said chad a lovely letter  strether before the closed portecochere fixed him a moment its more my boy than you do  but our suppositions dont matter he added if youre actually not entangled  chads pride seemed none the less a little touched  i never was thatlet me insist  i always had my own way  with which he pursued and i have it at present  then what are you here for  what has kept you strether asked if you have been able to leave  it made chad after a stare throw himself back  do you think ones kept only by women  his surprise and his verbal emphasis rang out so clear in the still street that strether winced till he remembered the safety of their english speech  is that the young man demanded what they think at woollett  at the good faith in the question strether had changed colour feeling that as he would have said he had put his foot in it  he had appeared stupidly to misrepresent what they thought at woollett but before he had time to rectify chad again was upon him  i must say then you show a low mind  it so fell in unhappily for strether with that reflexion of his own prompted in him by the pleasant air of the boulevard malesherbes that its disconcerting force was rather unfairly great  it was a dig that administered by himselfand administered even to poor mrs newsomewas no more than salutary but administered by chadand quite logicallyit came nearer drawing blood  they hadnt a low mindnor any approach to one yet incontestably they had worked and with a certain smugness on a basis that might be turned against them  chad had at any rate pulled his visitor up he had even pulled up his admirable mother he had absolutely by a turn of the wrist and a jerk of the farflung noose pulled up in a bunch woollett browsing in its pride  there was no doubt woollett had insisted on his coarseness and what he at present stood there for in the sleeping street was by his manner of striking the other note to make of such insistence a preoccupation compromising to the insisters  it was exactly as if they had imputed to him a vulgarity that he had by a mere gesture caused to fall from him  the devil of the case was that strether felt it by the same stroke as falling straight upon himself  he had been wondering a minute ago if the boy werent a pagan and he found himself wondering now if he werent by chance a gentleman  it didnt in the least on the spot spring up helpfully for him that a person couldnt at the same time be both there was nothing at this moment in the air to challenge the combination there was everything to give it on the contrary something of a flourish  it struck strether into the bargain as doing something to meet the most difficult of the questions though perhaps indeed only by substituting another  wouldnt it be precisely by having learned to be a gentleman that he had mastered the consequent trick of looking so well that one could scarce speak to him straight but what in the world was the clue to such a prime producing cause there were too many clues then that strether still lacked and these clues to clues were among them what it accordingly amounted to for him was that he had to take full in the face a fresh attribution of ignorance  he had grown used by this time to reminders especially from his own lips of what he didnt know but he had borne them because in the first place they were private and because in the second they practically conveyed a tribute  he didnt know what was bad andas others didnt know how little he knew ithe could put up with his state but if he didnt know in so important a particular what was good chad at least was now aware he didnt and that for some reason affected our friend as curiously public  it was in fact an exposed condition that the young man left him in long enough for him to feel its chilltill he saw fit in a word generously again to cover him  this last was in truth what chad quite gracefully did  but he did it as with a simple thought that met the whole of the case  oh im all right  it was what strether had rather bewilderedly to go to bed on    ii   it really looked true moreover from the way chad was to behave after this  he was full of attentions to his mothers ambassador in spite of which all the while the latters other relations rather remarkably contrived to assert themselves  strethers sittings pen in hand with mrs newsome up in his own room were broken yet they were richer and they were more than ever interspersed with the hours in which he reported himself in a different fashion but with scarce less earnestness and fulness to maria gostrey  now that as he would have expressed it he had really something to talk about he found himself in respect to any oddity that might reside for him in the double connexion at once more aware and more indifferent  he had been fine to mrs newsome about his useful friend but it had begun to haunt his imagination that chad taking up again for her benefit a pen too long disused might possibly be finer  it wouldnt at all do he saw that anything should come up for him at chads hand but what specifically was to have come the greatest divergence from which would be precisely the element of any lubrication of their intercourse by levity it was accordingly to forestall such an accident that he frankly put before the young man the several facts just as they had occurred of his funny alliance  he spoke of these facts pleasantly and obligingly as the whole story and felt that he might qualify the alliance as funny if he remained sufficiently grave about it  he flattered himself that he even exaggerated the wild freedom of his original encounter with the wonderful lady he was scrupulously definite about the absurd conditions in which they had made acquaintancetheir having picked each other up almost in the street and he had finest inspiration of all a conception of carrying the war into the enemys country by showing surprise at the enemys ignorance  he had always had a notion that this last was the grand style of fighting the greater therefore the reason for it as he couldnt remember that he had ever before fought in the grand style  every one according to this knew miss gostrey  how came it chad didnt know her  the difficulty the impossibility was really to escape it strether put on him by what he took for granted the burden of proof of the contrary  this tone was so far successful as that chad quite appeared to recognise her as a person whose fame had reached him but against his acquaintance with whom much mischance had worked  he made the point at the same time that his social relations such as they could be called were perhaps not to the extent strether supposed with the rising flood of their compatriots  he hinted at his having more and more given way to a different principle of selection the moral of which seemed to be that he went about little in the colony  for the moment certainly he had quite another interest  it was deep what he understood and strether for himself could only so observe it he couldnt see as yet how deep  might he not all too soon for there was really too much of their question that chad had already committed himself to liking  he liked to begin with his prospective stepfather which was distinctly what had not been on the cards  his hating him was the untowardness for which strether had been best prepared he hadnt expected the boys actual form to give him more to do than his imputed  it gave him more through suggesting that he must somehow make up to himself for not being sure he was sufficiently disagreeable  that had really been present to him as his only way to be sure he was sufficiently thorough  the point was that if chads tolerance of his thoroughness were insincere were but the best of devices for gaining time it none the less did treat everything as tacitly concluded  that seemed at the end of ten days the upshot of the abundant the recurrent talk through which strether poured into him all it concerned him to know put him in full possession of facts and figures  never cutting these colloquies short by a minute chad behaved looked and spoke as if he were rather heavily perhaps even a trifle gloomily but none the less fundamentally and comfortably free  he made no crude profession of eagerness to yield but he asked the most intelligent questions probed at moments abruptly even deeper than his friends layer of information justified by these touches the native estimate of his latent stuff and had in every way the air of trying to live reflectively into the square bright picture  he walked up and down in front of this production sociably took strethers arm at the points at which he stopped surveyed it repeatedly from the right and from the left inclined a critical head to either quarter and while he puffed a still more critical cigarette animadverted to his companion on this passage and that  strether sought reliefthere were hours when he required itin repeating himself it was in truth not to be blinked that chad had a way the main question as yet was of what it was a way to  it made vulgar questions no more easy but that was unimportant when all questions save those of his own asking had dropped  that he was free was answer enough and it wasnt quite ridiculous that this freedom should end by presenting itself as what was difficult to move his changed state his lovely home his beautiful things his easy talk his very appetite for strether insatiable and when all was said flatteringwhat were such marked matters all but the notes of his freedom  he had the effect of making a sacrifice of it just in these handsome forms to his visitor which was mainly the reason the visitor was privately for the time a little out of countenance strether was at this period again and again thrown back on a felt need to remodel somehow his plan  he fairly caught himself shooting rueful glances shy looks of pursuit toward the embodied influence the definite adversary who had by a stroke of her own failed him and on a fond theory of whose palpable presence he had under mrs newsomes inspiration altogether proceeded  he had once or twice in secret literally expressed the irritated wish that she would come out and find her  he couldnt quite yet force it upon woollett that such a career such a perverted young life showed after all a certain plausible side did in the case before them flaunt something like an impunity for the social man but he could at least treat himself to the statement that would prepare him for the sharpest echo this echoas distinct over there in the dry thin air as some shrill heading above a column of printseemed to reach him even as he wrote  he says theres no woman he could hear mrs newsome report in capitals almost of newspaper size to mrs pocock and he could focus in mrs pocock the response of the reader of the journal  he could see in the younger ladys face the earnestness of her attention and catch the full scepticism of her but slightly delayed what is there then  just so he could again as little miss the mothers clear decision  theres plenty of disposition no doubt to pretend there isnt  strether had after posting his letter the whole scene out and it was a scene during which coming and going as befell he kept his eye not least upon the daughter  he had his fine sense of the conviction mrs pocock would take occasion to reaffirma conviction bearing as he had from the first deeply divined it to bear on mr strethers essential inaptitude  she had looked him in his conscious eyes even before he sailed and that she didnt believe he would find the woman had been written in her book hadnt she at the best but a scant faith in his ability to find women it wasnt even as if he had found her motherso much more to her discrimination had her mother performed the finding  her mother had in a case her private judgement of which remained educative of mrs pococks critical sense found the man  the man owed his unchallenged state in general to the fact that mrs newsomes discoveries were accepted at woollett but he knew in his bones our friend did how almost irresistibly mrs pocock would now be moved to show what she thought of his own  give her a free hand would be the moral and the woman would soon be found  his impression of miss gostrey after her introduction to chad was meanwhile an impression of a person almost unnaturally on her guard he struck himself as at first unable to extract from her what he wished though indeed of what he wished at this special juncture he would doubtless have contrived to make but a crude statement  it sifted and settled nothing to put to her tout betement as she often said do you like him ehthanks to his feeling it actually the least of his needs to heap up the evidence in the young mans favour he repeatedly knocked at her door to let her have it afresh that chads casewhatever else of minor interest it might yieldwas first and foremost a miracle almost monstrous  it was the alteration of the entire man and was so signal an instance that nothing else for the intelligent observer couldcould itsignify  its a plot he declaredtheres more in it than meets the eye  he gave the rein to his fancy  its a plant  his fancy seemed to please her  whose then  well the party responsible is i suppose the fate that waits for one the dark doom that rides  what i mean is that with such elements one cant count  ive but my poor individual my modest human means it isnt playing the game to turn on the uncanny  all ones energy goes to facing it to tracking it  one wants confound it dont you see he confessed with a queer faceone wants to enjoy anything so rare  call it then lifehe puzzled it outcall it poor dear old life simply that springs the surprise nothing alters the fact that the surprise is paralysing or at any rate engrossingall practically hang it that one sees that one can see  her silences were never barren nor even dull  is that what youve written home  he tossed it off  oh dear yes  she had another pause while across her carpets he had another walk if you dont look out youll have them straight over  oh but ive said hell go back  and will he miss gostrey asked  the special tone of it made him pulling up look at her long whats that but just the question ive spent treasures of patience and ingenuity in giving you by the sight of himafter everything had led upevery facility to answer  what is it but just the thing i came here today to get out of you  will he  nohe wont she said at last  hes not free  the air of it held him  then youve all the while known  ive known nothing but what ive seen and i wonder she declared with some impatience that you didnt see as much  it was enough to be with him there  in the box  yes he rather blankly urged  wellto feel sure  sure of what  she got up from her chair at this with a nearer approach than she had ever yet shown to dismay at his dimness  she even fairly pausing for it spoke with a shade of pity  guess  it was a shade fairly that brought a flush into his face so that for a moment as they waited together their difference was between them you mean that just your hour with him told you so much of his story very good im not such a fool on my side as that i dont understand you or as that i didnt in some degree understand him  that he has done what he liked most isnt among any of us a matter the least in dispute  theres equally little question at this time of day of what it is he does like most  but im not talking he reasonably explained of any mere wretch he may still pick up  im talking of some person who in his present situation may have held her own may really have counted  thats exactly what i am said miss gostrey  but she as quickly made her point  i thought you thoughtor that they think at woollettthat thats what mere wretches necessarily do  mere wretches necessarily dont she declared with spirit  there must behind every appearance to the contrary still be somebodysomebody whos not a mere wretch since we accept the miracle what else but such a somebody can such a miracle be  he took it in  because the fact itself is the woman  a woman  some woman or other  its one of the things that have to be  but you mean then at least a good one  a good woman  she threw up her arms with a laugh  i should call her excellent  then why does he deny her  miss gostrey thought a moment  because shes too good to admit dont you see she went on how she accounts for him  strether clearly more and more did see yet it made him also see other things  but isnt what we want that he shall account for her  well he does  what you have before you is his way  you must forgive him if it isnt quite outspoken  in paris such debts are tacit  strether could imagine but still even when the womans good  again she laughed out  yes and even when the man is theres always a caution in such cases she more seriously explainedfor what it may seem to show  theres nothing thats taken as showing so much here as sudden unnatural goodness  ah then youre speaking now strether said of people who are not nice  i delight she replied in your classifications  but do you want me she asked to give you in the matter on this ground the wisest advice im capable of  dont consider her dont judge her at all in herself  consider her and judge her only in chad  he had the courage at least of his companions logic  because then i shall like her  he almost looked with his quick imagination as if he already did though seeing at once also the full extent of how little it would suit his book  but is that what i came out for  she had to confess indeed that it wasnt  but there was something else  dont make up your mind  there are all sorts of things  you havent seen him all  this on his side strether recognised but his acuteness none the less showed him the danger  yes but if the more i see the better he seems  well she found something  that may bebut his disavowal of her isnt all the same pure consideration  theres a hitch  she made it out  its the effort to sink her  strether winced at the image  to sink  well i mean theres a struggle and a part of it is just what he hides  take timethats the only way not to make some mistake that youll regret  then youll see  he does really want to shake her off  our friend had by this time so got into the vision that he almost gasped  after all she has done for him  miss gostrey gave him a look which broke the next moment into a wonderful smile  hes not so good as you think  they remained with him these words promising him in their character of warning considerable help but the support he tried to draw from them found itself on each renewal of contact with chad defeated by something else  what could it be this disconcerting force he asked himself but the sense constantly renewed that chad wasquite in fact insisted on beingas good as he thought  it seemed somehow as if he couldnt but be as good from the moment he wasnt as bad  there was a succession of days at all events when contact with himand in its immediate effect as if it could produce no otherelbowed out of strethers consciousness everything but itself  little bilham once more pervaded the scene but little bilham became even in a higher degree than he had originally been one of the numerous forms of the inclusive relation a consequence promoted to our friends sense by two or three incidents with which we have yet to make acquaintance waymarsh himself for the occasion was drawn into the eddy it absolutely though but temporarily swallowed him down and there were days when strether seemed to bump against him as a sinking swimmer might brush a submarine object  the fathomless medium held themchads manner was the fathomless medium and our friend felt as if they passed each other in their deep immersion with the round impersonal eye of silent fish  it was practically produced between them that waymarsh was giving him then his chance and the shade of discomfort that strether drew from the allowance resembled not a little the embarrassment he had known at school as a boy when members of his family had been present at exhibitions  he could perform before strangers but relatives were fatal and it was now as if comparatively waymarsh were a relative  he seemed to hear him say strike up then and to enjoy a foretaste of conscientious domestic criticism  he had struck up so far as he actually could chad knew by this time in profusion what he wanted and what vulgar violence did his fellow pilgrim expect of him when he had really emptied his mind  it went somehow to and fro that what poor waymarsh meant was i told you sothat youd lose your immortal soul but it was also fairly explicit that strether had his own challenge and that since they must go to the bottom of things he wasted no more virtue in watching chad than chad wasted in watching him  his dip for dutys sakewhere was it worse than waymarshs own  for he neednt have stopped resisting and refusing neednt have parleyed at that rate with the foe  the strolls over paris to see something or call somewhere were accordingly inevitable and natural and the late sessions in the wondrous troisieme the lovely home when men dropped in and the picture composed more suggestively through the haze of tobacco of music more or less good and of talk more or less polyglot were on a principle not to be distinguished from that of the mornings and the afternoons  nothing strether had to recognise as he leaned back and smoked could well less resemble a scene of violence than even the liveliest of these occasions  they were occasions of discussion none the less and strether had never in his life heard so many opinions on so many subjects  there were opinions at woollett but only on three or four  the differences were there to match if they were doubtless deep though few they were quietthey were as might be said almost as shy as if people had been ashamed of them  people showed little diffidence about such things on the other hand in the boulevard malesherbes and were so far from being ashamed of themor indeed of anything elsethat they often seemed to have invented them to avert those agreements that destroy the taste of talk  no one had ever done that at woollett though strether could remember times when he himself had been tempted to it without quite knowing why  he saw why at presenthe had but wanted to promote intercourse  these however were but parenthetic memories and the turn taken by his affair on the whole was positively that if his nerves were on the stretch it was because he missed violence  when he asked himself if none would then in connexion with it ever come at all he might almost have passed as wondering how to provoke it it would be too absurd if such a vision as that should have to be invoked for relief it was already marked enough as absurd that he should actually have begun with flutters and dignities on the score of a single accepted meal  what sort of a brute had he expected chad to be anywaystrether had occasion to make the enquiry but was careful to make it in private  he could himself comparatively recent as it wasit was truly but the fact of a few days sincefocus his primal crudity but he would on the approach of an observer as if handling an illicit possession have slipped the reminiscence out of sight  there were echoes of it still in mrs newsomes letters and there were moments when these echoes made him exclaim on her want of tact  he blushed of course at once still more for the explanation than for the ground of it  it came to him in time to save his manners that she couldnt at the best become tactful as quickly as he  her tact had to reckon with the atlantic ocean the general postoffice and the extravagant curve of the globe  chad had one day offered tea at the boulevard malesherbes to a chosen few a group again including the unobscured miss barrace and strether had on coming out walked away with the acquaintance whom in his letters to mrs newsome he always spoke of as the little artistman  he had had full occasion to mention him as the other party so oddly to the only close personal alliance observation had as yet detected in chads existence  little bilhams way this afternoon was not strethers but he had none the less kindly come with him and it was somehow a part of his kindness that as it had sadly begun to rain they suddenly found themselves seated for conversation at a cafe in which they had taken refuge  he had passed no more crowded hour in chads society than the one just ended he had talked with miss barrace who had reproached him with not having come to see her and he had above all hit on a happy thought for causing waymarshs tension to relax  something might possibly be extracted for the latter from the idea of his success with that lady whose quick apprehension of what might amuse her had given strether a free hand what had she meant if not to ask whether she couldnt help him with his splendid encumbrance and mightnt the sacred rage at any rate be kept a little in abeyance by thus creating for his comrades mind even in a world of irrelevance the possibility of a relation  what was it but a relation to be regarded as so decorative and in especial on the strength of it to be whirled away amid flounces and feathers in a coupe lined by what strether could make out with dark blue brocade he himself had never been whirled awaynever at least in a coupe and behind a footman he had driven with miss gostrey in cabs with mrs pocock a few times in an open buggy with mrs newsome in a fourseated cart and occasionally up at the mountains on a buckboard but his friends actual adventure transcended his personal experience he now showed his companion soon enough indeed how inadequate as a general monitor this last queer quantity could once more feel itself  what game under the sun is he playing  he signified the next moment that his allusion was not to the fat gentleman immersed in dominoes on whom his eyes had begun by resting but to their host of the previous hour as to whom there on the velvet bench with a final collapse of all consistency he treated himself to the comfort of indiscretion where do you see him come out  little bilham in meditation looked at him with a kindness almost paternal dont you like it over here  strether laughed outfor the tone was indeed droll he let himself go what has that to do with it  the only thing ive any business to like is to feel that im moving him  thats why i ask you whether you believe i am  is the creatureand he did his best to show that he simply wished to ascertainhonest  his companion looked responsible but looked it through a small dim smile  what creature do you mean  it was on this that they did have for a little a mute interchange is it untrue that hes free  how then strether asked wondering does he arrange his life  is the creature you mean chad himself little bilham said  strether here with a rising hope just thought we must take one of them at a time  but his coherence lapsed  is there some woman  of whom hes really afraid of course i meanor who does with him what she likes  its awfully charming of you bilham presently remarked not to have asked me that before  oh im not fit for my job  the exclamation had escaped our friend but it made little bilham more deliberate  chads a rare case he luminously observed hes awfully changed he added  then you see it too  the way he has improved  oh yesi think every one must see it but im not sure said little bilham that i didnt like him about as well in his other state  then this is really a new state altogether  well the young man after a moment returned im not sure he was really meant by nature to be quite so good  its like the new edition of an old book that one has been fond ofrevised and amended brought up to date but not quite the thing one knew and loved  however that may be at all events he pursued i dont think you know that hes really playing as you call it any game  i believe he really wants to go back and take up a career hes capable of one you know that will improve and enlarge him still more  he wont then little bilham continued to remark be my pleasant wellrubbed oldfashioned volume at all  but of course im beastly immoral  im afraid it would be a funny world altogethera world with things the way i like them  i ought i dare say to go home and go into business myself  only id simply rather diesimply  and ive not the least difficulty in making up my mind not to and in knowing exactly why and in defending my ground against all comers  all the same he wound up i assure you i dont say a word against itfor himself i meanto chad  i seem to see it as much the best thing for him  you see hes not happy  do istrether stared  ive been supposing i see just the oppositean extraordinary case of the equilibrium arrived at and assured  oh theres a lot behind it  ah there you are strether exclaimed  thats just what i want to get at  you speak of your familiar volume altered out of recognition well whos the editor  little bilham looked before him a minute in silence  he ought to get married  that would do it  and he wants to  wants to marry her  again little bilham waited and with a sense that he had information strether scarce knew what was coming  he wants to be free  he isnt used you see the young man explained in his lucid way to being so good  strether hesitated  then i may take it from you that he is good  his companion matched his pause but making it up with a quiet fulness do take it from me  well then why isnt he free  he swears to me he is but meanwhile does nothingexcept of course that hes so kind to meto prove it and couldnt really act much otherwise if he werent  my question to you just now was exactly on this queer impression of his diplomacy  as if instead of really giving ground his line were to keep me on here and set me a bad example  as the halfhour meanwhile had ebbed strether paid his score and the waiter was presently in the act of counting out change  our friend pushed back to him a fraction of it with which after an emphatic recognition the personage in question retreated  you give too much little bilham permitted himself benevolently to observe  oh i always give too much strether helplessly sighed  but you dont he went on as if to get quickly away from the contemplation of that doom answer my question  why isnt he free  little bilham had got up as if the transaction with the waiter had been a signal and had already edged out between the table and the divan the effect of this was that a minute later they had quitted the place the gratified waiter alert again at the open door strether had found himself deferring to his companions abruptness as to a hint that he should be answered as soon as they were more isolated  this happened when after a few steps in the outer air they had turned the next comer there our friend had kept it up why isnt he free if hes good  little bilham looked him full in the face  because its a virtuous attachment  this had settled the question so effectually for the timethat is for the next few daysthat it had given strether almost a new lease of life  it must be added however that thanks to his constant habit of shaking the bottle in which life handed him the wine of experience he presently found the taste of the lees rising as usual into his draught his imagination had in other words already dealt with his young friends assertion of which it had made something that sufficiently came out on the very next occasion of his seeing maria gostrey  this occasion moreover had been determined promptly by a new circumstancea circumstance he was the last man to leave her for a day in ignorance of  when i said to him last night he immediately began that without some definite word from him now that will enable me to speak to them over there of our sailingor at least of mine giving them some sort of datemy responsibility becomes uncomfortable and my situation awkward when i said that to him what do you think was his reply  and then as she this time gave it up  why that he has two particular friends two ladies mother and daughter about to arrive in pariscoming back from an absence and that he wants me so furiously to meet them know them and like them that i shall oblige him by kindly not bringing our business to a crisis till he has had a chance to see them again himself  is that strether enquired the way hes going to try to get off  these are the people he explained that he must have gone down to see before i arrived  theyre the best friends he has in the world and they take more interest than any one else in what concerns him  as im his next best he sees a thousand reasons why we should comfortably meet  he hasnt broached the question sooner because their return was uncertainseemed in fact for the present impossible  but he more than intimates thatif you can believe ittheir desire to make my acquaintance has had to do with their surmounting difficulties  theyre dying to see you miss gostrey asked  dying  of course said strether theyre the virtuous attachment he had already told her about thathad seen her the day after his talk with little bilham and they had then threshed out together the bearing of the revelation  she had helped him to put into it the logic in which little bilham had left it slightly deficient strether hadnt pressed him as to the object of the preference so unexpectedly described feeling in the presence of it with one of his irrepressible scruples a delicacy from which he had in the quest of the quite other article worked himself sufficiently free  he had held off as on a small principle of pride from permitting his young friend to mention a name wishing to make with this the great point that chads virtuous attachments were none of his business  he had wanted from the first not to think too much of his dignity but that was no reason for not allowing it any little benefit that might turn up  he had often enough wondered to what degree his interference might pass for interested so that there was no want of luxury in letting it be seen whenever he could that he didnt interfere  that had of course at the same time not deprived him of the further luxury of much private astonishment which however he had reduced to some order before communicating his knowledge  when he had done this at last it was with the remark that surprised as miss gostrey might like himself at first be she would probably agree with him on reflexion that such an account of the matter did after all fit the confirmed appearances  nothing certainly on all the indications could have been a greater change for him than a virtuous attachment and since they had been in search of the word as the french called it of that change little bilhams announcementthough so long and so oddly delayedwould serve as well as another she had assured strether in fact after a pause that the more she thought of it the more it did serve and yet her assurance hadnt so weighed with him as that before they parted he hadnt ventured to challenge her sincerity  didnt she believe the attachment was virtuoushe had made sure of her again with the aid of that question the tidings he brought her on this second occasion were moreover such as would help him to make surer still  she showed at first none the less as only amused  you say there are two  an attachment to them both then would i suppose almost necessarily be innocent  our friend took the point but he had his clue  maynt he be still in the stage of not quite knowing which of them mother or daughter he likes best  she gave it more thought  oh it must be the daughterat his age  possibly  yet what do we know strether asked about hers  she may be old enough  old enough for what  why to marry chad  that may be you know what they want  and if chad wants it too and little bilham wants it and even we at a pinch could do with itthat is if she doesnt prevent repatriationwhy it may be plain sailing yet  it was always the case for him in these counsels that each of his remarks as it came seemed to drop into a deeper well  he had at all events to wait a moment to hear the slight splash of this one i dont see why if mr newsome wants to marry the young lady he hasnt already done it or hasnt been prepared with some statement to you about it and if he both wants to marry her and is on good terms with them why isnt he free  strether responsively wondered indeed  perhaps the girl herself doesnt like him  then why does he speak of them to you as he does  strethers mind echoed the question but also again met it  perhaps its with the mother hes on good terms  as against the daughter  well if shes trying to persuade the daughter to consent to him what could make him like the mother more  only strether threw out why shouldnt the daughter consent to him  oh said miss gostrey maynt it be that every one else isnt quite so struck with him as you  doesnt regard him you mean as such an eligible young man  is that what ive come to he audibly and rather gravely sought to know however he went on his marriage is what his mother most desiresthat is if it will help  and oughtnt any marriage to help they must want himhe had already worked it outto be better off almost any girl he may marry will have a direct interest in his taking up his chances  it wont suit her at least that he shall miss them  miss gostrey cast about  noyou reason well but of course on the other hand theres always dear old woollett itself  oh yes he musedtheres always dear old woollett itself  she waited a moment  the young lady maynt find herself able to swallow that quantity  she may think its paying too much she may weigh one thing against another  strether ever restless in such debates took a vague turn it will all depend on who she is  that of coursethe proved ability to deal with dear old woollett since im sure she does deal with itis what makes so strongly for mamie  mamie  he stopped short at her tone before her then though seeing that it represented not vagueness but a momentary embarrassed fulness let his exclamation come  you surely havent forgotten about mamie  no i havent forgotten about mamie she smiled  theres no doubt whatever that theres ever so much to be said for her mamies my girl she roundly declared  strether resumed for a minute his walk  shes really perfectly lovely you know  far prettier than any girl ive seen over here yet  thats precisely on what i perhaps most build  and she mused a moment in her friends way  i should positively like to take her in hand  he humoured the fancy though indeed finally to deprecate it  oh but dont in your zeal go over to her i need you most and cant you know be left  but she kept it up  i wish theyd send her out to me  if they knew you he returned they would  ah but dont theyafter all that as ive understood you youve told them about me  he had paused before her again but he continued his course they willbefore as you say ive done  then he came out with the point he had wished after all most to make  it seems to give away now his game  this is what he has been doingkeeping me along for  he has been waiting for them  miss gostrey drew in her lips  you see a good deal in it  i doubt if i see as much as you  do you pretend he went on that you dont see  well whatshe pressed him as he paused  why that there must be a lot between themand that it has been going on from the first even from before i came  she took a minute to answer  who are they thenif its so grave  it maynt be graveit may be gay  but at any rate its marked only i dont know strether had to confess anything about them their name for instance was a thing that after little bilhams information i found it a kind of refreshment not to feel obliged to follow up  oh she returned if you think youve got off  her laugh produced in him a momentary gloom  i dont think ive got off  i only think im breathing for about five minutes  i dare say i shall have at the best still to get on  a look over it all passed between them and the next minute he had come back to good humour  i dont meanwhile take the smallest interest in their name  nor in their nationalityamerican french english polish  i dont care the least little hang he smiled for their nationality  it would be nice if theyre polish he almost immediately added  very nice indeed  the transition kept up her spirits  so you see you do care  he did this contention a modified justice  i think i should if they were polish  yes he thoughtthere might be joy in that  let us then hope for it  but she came after this nearer to the question  if the girls of the right age of course the mother cant be  i mean for the virtuous attachment  if the girls twentyand she cant be lessthe mother must be at least forty so it puts the mother out  shes too old for him  strether arrested again considered and demurred  do you think so do you think any one would be too old for him  im eighty and im too young  but perhaps the girl he continued isnt twenty perhaps shes only tenbut such a little dear that chad finds himself counting her in as an attraction of the acquaintance perhaps shes only five perhaps the mothers but fiveandtwentya charming young widow  miss gostrey entertained the suggestion  she is a widow then  i havent the least idea  they once more in spite of this vagueness exchanged a looka look that was perhaps the longest yet it seemed in fact the next thing to require to explain itself which it did as it could  i only feel what ive told youthat he has some reason  miss gostreys imagination had taken its own flight  perhaps shes not a widow  strether seemed to accept the possibility with reserve  still he accepted it  then thats why the attachmentif its to heris virtuous  but she looked as if she scarce followed  why is it virtuous ifsince shes freetheres nothing to impose on it any condition  he laughed at her question  oh i perhaps dont mean as virtuous as that your idea is that it can be virtuousin any sense worthy of the nameonly if shes not free  but what does it become then he asked for her  ah thats another matter  he said nothing for a moment and she soon went on  i dare say youre right at any rate about mr newsomes little plan  he has been trying youhas been reporting on you to these friends  strether meanwhile had had time to think more  then wheres his straightness  well as we say its struggling up breaking out asserting itself as it can  we can be on the side you see of his straightness we can help him  but he has made out said miss gostrey that youll do  do for what  why for themfor ces dames  he has watched you studied you liked youand recognised that they must  its a great compliment to you my dear man for im sure theyre particular  you came out for a success well she gaily declared youre having it  he took it from her with momentary patience and then turned abruptly away  it was always convenient to him that there were so many fine things in her room to look at  but the examination of two or three of them appeared soon to have determined a speech that had little to do with them  you dont believe in it  in what  in the character of the attachment  in its innocence  but she defended herself  i dont pretend to know anything about it everythings possible  we must see  see he echoed with a groan  havent we seen enough  i havent she smiled  but do you suppose then little bilham has lied  you must find out  it made him almost turn pale  find out any more  he had dropped on a sofa for dismay but she seemed as she stood over him to have the last word  wasnt what you came out for to find out all      book fifth     i   the sunday of the next week was a wonderful day and chad newsome had let his friend know in advance that he had provided for it there had already been a question of his taking him to see the great gloriani who was at home on sunday afternoons and at whose house for the most part fewer bores were to be met than elsewhere but the project through some accident had not had instant effect and now revived in happier conditions  chad had made the point that the celebrated sculptor had a queer old garden for which the weatherspring at last frank and fairwas propitious and two or three of his other allusions had confirmed for strether the expectation of something special  he had by this time for all introductions and adventures let himself recklessly go cherishing the sense that whatever the young man showed him he was showing at least himself  he could have wished indeed so far as this went that chad were less of a mere cicerone for he was not without the impressionnow that the vision of his game his plan his deep diplomacy did recurrently assert itselfof his taking refuge from the realities of their intercourse in profusely dispensing as our friend mentally phrased et panem et circenses our friend continued to feel rather smothered in flowers though he made in his other moments the almost angry inference that this was only because of his odious ascetic suspicion of any form of beauty  he periodically assured himselffor his reactions were sharpthat he shouldnt reach the truth of anything till he had at least got rid of that  he had known beforehand that madame de vionnet and her daughter would probably be on view an intimation to that effect having constituted the only reference again made by chad to his good friends from the south  the effect of strethers talk about them with miss gostrey had been quite to consecrate his reluctance to pry something in the very air of chads silencejudged in the light of that talkoffered it to him as a reserve he could markedly match  it shrouded them about with he scarce knew what a consideration a distinction he was in presence at any rateso far as it placed him thereof ladies and the one thing that was definite for him was that they themselves should be to the extent of his responsibility in presence of a gentleman  was it because they were very beautiful very clever or even very goodwas it for one of these reasons that chad was so to speak nursing his effect  did he wish to spring them in the woollett phrase with a fuller forceto confound his critic slight though as yet the criticism with some form of merit exquisitely incalculable the most the critic had at all events asked was whether the persons in question were french and that enquiry had been but a proper comment on the sound of their name  yes  that is no had been chads reply but he had immediately added that their english was the most charming in the world so that if strether were wanting an excuse for not getting on with them he wouldnt in the least find one  never in fact had stretherin the mood into which the place had quickly launched himfelt for himself less the need of an excuse  those he might have found would have been at the worst all for the others the people before him in whose liberty to be as they were he was aware that he positively rejoiced  his fellow guests were multiplying and these things their liberty their intensity their variety their conditions at large were in fusion in the admirable medium of the scene  the place itself was a great impressiona small pavilion clearfaced and sequestered an effect of polished parquet of fine white panel and spare sallow gilt of decoration delicate and rare in the heart of the faubourg saintgermain and on the edge of a cluster of gardens attached to old noble houses  far back from streets and unsuspected by crowds reached by a long passage and a quiet court it was as striking to the unprepared mind he immediately saw as a treasure dug up giving him too more than anything yet the note of the range of the immeasurable town and sweeping away as by a last brave brush his usual landmarks and terms it was in the garden a spacious cherished remnant out of which a dozen persons had already passed that chads host presently met them while the tall birdhaunted trees all of a twitter with the spring and the weather and the high partywalls on the other side of which grave hotels stood off for privacy spoke of survival transmission association a strong indifferent persistent order  the day was so soft that the little party had practically adjourned to the open air but the open air was in such conditions all a chamber of state  strether had presently the sense of a great convent a convent of missions famous for he scarce knew what a nursery of young priests of scattered shade of straight alleys and chapelbells that spread its mass in one quarter he had the sense of names in the air of ghosts at the windows of signs and tokens a whole range of expression all about him too thick for prompt discrimination  this assault of images became for a moment in the address of the distinguished sculptor almost formidable  gloriani showed him in such perfect confidence on chads introduction of him a fine worn handsome face a face that was like an open letter in a foreign tongue with his genius in his eyes his manners on his lips his long career behind him and his honours and rewards all round the great artist in the course of a single sustained look and a few words of delight at receiving him affected our friend as a dazzling prodigy of type strether had seen in museumsin the luxembourg as well as more reverently later on in the new york of the billionairesthe work of his hand knowing too that after an earlier time in his native rome he had migrated in midcareer to paris where with a personal lustre almost violent he shone in a constellation  all of which was more than enough to crown him for his guest with the light with the romance of glory  strether in contact with that element as he had never yet so intimately been had the consciousness of opening to it for the happy instant all the windows of his mind of letting this rather grey interior drink in for once the sun of a clime not marked in his old geography  he was to remember again repeatedly the medallike italian face in which every line was an artists own in which time told only as tone and consecration and he was to recall in especial as the penetrating radiance as the communication of the illustrious spirit itself the manner in which while they stood briefly in welcome and response face to face he was held by the sculptors eyes he wasnt soon to forget them was to think of them all unconscious unintending preoccupied though they were as the source of the deepest intellectual sounding to which he had ever been exposed  he was in fact quite to cherish his vision of it to play with it in idle hours only speaking of it to no one and quite aware he couldnt have spoken without appearing to talk nonsense  was what it had told him or what it had asked him the greater of the mysteries was it the most special flare unequalled supreme of the aesthetic torch lighting that wondrous world for ever or was it above all the long straight shaft sunk by a personal acuteness that life had seasoned to steel  nothing on earth could have been stranger and no one doubtless more surprised than the artist himself but it was for all the world to strether just then as if in the matter of his accepted duty he had positively been on trial the deep human expertness in glorianis charming smileoh the terrible life behind itwas flashed upon him as a test of his stuff  chad meanwhile after having easily named his companion had still more easily turned away and was already greeting other persons present he was as easy clever chad with the great artist as with his obscure compatriot and as easy with every one else as with either this fell into its place for strether and made almost a new light giving him as a concatenation something more he could enjoy he liked gloriani but should never see him again of that he was sufficiently sure  chad accordingly who was wonderful with both of them was a kind of link for hopeless fancy an implication of possibilitiesoh if everything had been different strether noted at all events that he was thus on terms with illustrious spirits and also thatyes distinctlyhe hadnt in the least swaggered about it  our friend hadnt come there only for this figure of abel newsomes son but that presence threatened to affect the observant mind as positively central gloriani indeed remembering something and excusing himself pursued chad to speak to him and strether was left musing on many things  one of them was the question of whether since he had been tested he had passed did the artist drop him from having made out that he wouldnt do he really felt just today that he might do better than usual hadnt he done well enough so far as that went in being exactly so dazzled and in not having too as he almost believed wholly hidden from his host that he felt the latters plummet  suddenly across the garden he saw little bilham approach and it was a part of the fit that was on him that as their eyes met he guessed also his knowledge if he had said to him on the instant what was uppermost he would have said  have i passedfor of course i know one has to pass here little bilham would have reassured him have told him that he exaggerated and have adduced happily enough the argument of little bilhams own very presence which in truth he could see was as easy a one as glorianis own or as chads  he himself would perhaps then after a while cease to be frightened would get the point of view for some of the facestypes tremendously alien alien to woollettthat he had already begun to take in  who were they all the dispersed groups and couples the ladies even more unlike those of woollett than the gentlementhis was the enquiry that when his young friend had greeted him he did find himself making  oh theyre every oneall sorts and sizes of course i mean within limits though limits down perhaps rather more than limits up  there are always artistshes beautiful and inimitable to the cher confrere and then gros bonnets of many kindsambassadors cabinet ministers bankers generals what do i know even jews above all always some awfully nice womenand not too many sometimes an actress an artist a great performerbut only when theyre not monsters and in particular the right femmes du monde you can fancy his history on that sidei believe its fabulous they never give him up  yet he keeps them down  no one knows how he manages its too beautiful and bland never too manyand a mighty good thing too just a perfect choice but there are not in any way many bores it has always been so he has some secret its extraordinary  and you dont find it out  hes the same to every one  he doesnt ask questions  ah doesnt he strether laughed  bilham met it with all his candour  how then should i be here  oh for what you tell me  youre part of the perfect choice  well the young man took in the scene  it seems rather good today  strether followed the direction of his eyes  are they all this time femmes du monde  little bilham showed his competence  pretty well  this was a category our friend had a feeling for a light romantic and mysterious on the feminine element in which he enjoyed for a little watching it  are there any poles  his companion considered  i think i make out a portuguee but ive seen turks  strether wondered desiring justice  they seemall the womenvery harmonious  oh in closer quarters they come out and then while strether was aware of fearing closer quarters though giving himself again to the harmonies well little bilham went on it is at the worst rather good you know  if you like it you feel it this way that shows youre not in the least out but you always know things he handsomely added immediately  strether liked it and felt it only too much so i say dont lay traps for me he rather helplessly murmured  well his companion returned hes wonderfully kind to us  to us americans you mean  oh nohe doesnt know anything about that  thats half the battle herethat you can never hear politics  we dont talk them i mean to poor young wretches of all sorts  and yet its always as charming as this its as if by something in the air our squalor didnt show  it puts us all backinto the last century  im afraid strether said amused that it puts me rather forward oh ever so far  into the next but isnt that only little bilham asked because youre really of the century before  the century before the last thank you strether laughed  if i ask you about some of the ladies it cant be then that i may hope as such a specimen of the rococo to please them  on the contrary they adorewe all adore herethe rococo and where is there a better setting for it than the whole thing the pavilion and the garden together there are lots of people with collections little bilham smiled as he glanced round  youll be secured  it made strether for a moment give himself again to contemplation there were faces he scarce knew what to make of  were they charming or were they only strange he mightnt talk politics yet he suspected a pole or two  the upshot was the question at the back of his head from the moment his friend had joined him  have madame de vionnet and her daughter arrived  i havent seen them yet but miss gostrey has come  shes in the pavilion looking at objects  one can see shes a collector little bilham added without offence  oh yes shes a collector and i knew she was to come  is madame de vionnet a collector strether went on  rather i believe almost celebrated  the young man met on it a little his friends eyes  i happen to knowfrom chad whom i saw last nightthat theyve come back but only yesterday he wasnt sureup to the last  this accordingly little bilham went on will beif they are heretheir first appearance after their return  strether very quickly turned these things over  chad told you last night to me on our way here he said nothing about it  but did you ask him  strether did him the justice  i dare say not  well said little bilham youre not a person to whom its easy to tell things you dont want to know  though it is easy i admitits quite beautiful he benevolently added when you do want to  strether looked at him with an indulgence that matched his intelligence  is that the deep reasoning on whichabout these ladiesyouve been yourself so silent  little bilham considered the depth of his reasoning  i havent been silent  i spoke of them to you the other day the day we sat together after chads teaparty  strether came round to it  they then are the virtuous attachment  i can only tell you that its what they pass for  but isnt that enough what more than a vain appearance does the wisest of us know i commend you the young man declared with a pleasant emphasis the vain appearance  strether looked more widely round and what he saw from face to face deepened the effect of his young friends words  is it so good  magnificent  strether had a pause  the husbands dead  dear no  alive  oh said strether  after which as his companion laughed how then can it be so good  youll see for yourself  one does see  chads in love with the daughter  thats what i mean  strether wondered  then wheres the difficulty  why arent you and iwith our grander bolder ideas  oh mine strether said rather strangely  but then as if to attenuate  you mean they wont hear of woollett  little bilham smiled  isnt that just what you must see about  it had brought them as she caught the last words into relation with miss barrace whom strether had already observedas he had never before seen a lady at a partymoving about alone  coming within sound of them she had already spoken and she took again through her longhandled glass all her amused and amusing possession  how much poor mr strether you seem to have to see about but you cant say she gaily declared that i dont do what i can to help you  mr waymarsh is placed  ive left him in the house with miss gostrey  the way little bilham exclaimed mr strether gets the ladies to work for him hes just preparing to draw in another to pouncedont you see himon madame de vionnet  madame de vionnet  oh oh oh miss barrace cried in a wonderful crescendo  there was more in it our friend made out than met the ear  was it after all a joke that he should be serious about anything he envied miss barrace at any rate her power of not being  she seemed with little cries and protests and quick recognitions movements like the darts of some fine highfeathered freepecking bird to stand before life as before some full shopwindow  you could fairly hear as she selected and pointed the tap of her tortoiseshell against the glass  its certain that we do need seeing about only im glad its not i who have to do it one does no doubt begin that way then suddenly one finds that one has given it up  its too much its too difficult  youre wonderful you people she continued to strether for not feeling those thingsby which i mean impossibilities  you never feel them you face them with a fortitude that makes it a lesson to watch you  ah butlittle bilham put it with discouragementwhat do we achieve after all we see about you and reportwhen we even go so far as reporting  but nothings done  oh you mr bilham she replied as with an impatient rap on the glass youre not worth sixpence you come over to convert the savagesfor i know you verily did i remember youand the savages simply convert you  not even the young man woefully confessed  they havent gone through that form  theyve simplythe cannibalseaten me converted me if you like but converted me into food  im but the bleached bones of a christian  well then there we are  onlyand miss barrace appealed again to stretherdont let it discourage you  youll break down soon enough but youll meanwhile have had your moments  il faut en avoir  i always like to see you while you last  and ill tell you who will last  waymarshhe had already taken her up  she laughed out as at the alarm of it  hell resist even miss gostrey  so grand is it not to understand  hes wonderful  he is indeed strether conceded  he wouldnt tell me of this affaironly said he had an engagement but with such a gloom you must let me insist as if it had been an engagement to be hanged then silently and secretly he turns up here with you  do you call that lasting  oh i hope its lasting miss barrace said  but he only at the best bears with me  he doesnt understandnot one little scrap hes delightful  hes wonderful she repeated  michelangelesquelittle bilham completed her meaning  he is a success  moses on the ceiling brought down to the floor overwhelming colossal but somehow portable  certainly if you mean by portable she returned looking so well in ones carriage  hes too funny beside me in his comer he looks like somebody somebody foreign and famous en exil so that people wonderits very amusingwhom im taking about  i show him paris show him everything and he never turns a hair  hes like the indian chief one reads about who when he comes up to washington to see the great father stands wrapt in his blanket and gives no sign  i might be the great fatherfrom the way he takes everything  she was delighted at this hit of her identity with that personageit fitted so her character she declared it was the title she meant henceforth to adopt  and the way he sits too in the corner of my room only looking at my visitors very hard and as if he wanted to start something they wonder what he does want to start  but hes wonderful miss barrace once more insisted  he has never started anything yet  it presented him none the less in truth to her actual friends who looked at each other in intelligence with frank amusement on bilhams part and a shade of sadness on strethers  strethers sadness sprangfor the image had its grandeurfrom his thinking how little he himself was wrapt in his blanket how little in marble halls all too oblivious of the great father he resembled a really majestic aboriginal  but he had also another reflexion youve all of you here so much visual sense that youve somehow all run to it  there are moments when it strikes one that you havent any other  any moral little bilham explained watching serenely across the garden the several femmes du monde  but miss barrace has a moral distinction he kindly continued speaking as if for strethers benefit not less than for her own  have you strether scarce knowing what he was about asked of her almost eagerly  oh not a distinctionshe was mightily amused at his tonemr bilhams too good  but i think i may say a sufficiency  yes a sufficiency have you supposed strange things of meand she fixed him again through all her tortoiseshell with the droll interest of it you are all indeed wonderful  i should awfully disappoint you i do take my stand on my sufficiency  but i know i confess she went on strange people  i dont know how it happens i dont do it on purpose it seems to be my doomas if i were always one of their habits  its wonderful i dare say moreover she pursued with an interested gravity that i do that we all do here run too much to mere eye  but how can it be helped were all looking at each otherand in the light of paris one sees what things resemble  thats what the light of paris seems always to show  its the fault of the light of parisdear old light  dear old paris little bilham echoed  everything every one shows miss barrace went on  but for what they really are strether asked  oh i like your boston reallys  but sometimesyes  dear old paris then strether resignedly sighed while for a moment they looked at each other  then he broke out  does madame de vionnet do that i mean really show for what she is  her answer was prompt  shes charming  shes perfect  then why did you a minute ago say oh oh oh at her name  she easily remembered  why just because  shes wonderful  ah she toostrether had almost a groan  but miss barrace had meanwhile perceived relief  why not put your question straight to the person who can answer it best  no said little bilham dont put any question wait ratherit will be much more funto judge for yourself  he has come to take you to her    ii   on which strether saw that chad was again at hand and he afterwards scarce knew absurd as it may seem what had then quickly occurred the moment concerned him he felt more deeply than he could have explained and he had a subsequent passage of speculation as to whether on walking off with chad he hadnt looked either pale or red the only thing he was clear about was that luckily nothing indiscreet had in fact been said and that chad himself was more than ever in miss barraces great sense wonderful  it was one of the connexionsthough really why it should be after all was none so apparentin which the whole change in him came out as most striking  strether recalled as they approached the house that he had impressed him that first night as knowing how to enter a box  well he impressed him scarce less now as knowing how to make a presentation  it did something for strethers own qualitymarked it as estimated so that our poor friend conscious and passive really seemed to feel himself quite handed over and delivered absolutely as he would have said made a present of given away  as they reached the house a young woman about to come forth appeared unaccompanied on the steps at the exchange with whom of a word on chads part strether immediately perceived that obligingly kindly she was there to meet them chad had left her in the house but she had afterwards come halfway and then the next moment had joined them in the garden her air of youth for strether was at first almost disconcerting while his second impression was not less sharply a degree of relief at there not having just been with the others any freedom used about her  it was upon him at a touch that she was no subject for that and meanwhile on chads introducing him she had spoken to him very simply and gently in an english clearly of the easiest to her yet unlike any other he had ever heard  it wasnt as if she tried nothing he could see after they had been a few minutes together was as if she tried but her speech charming correct and odd was like a precaution against her passing for a pole  there were precautions he seemed indeed to see only when there were really dangers  later on he was to feel many more of them but by that time he was to feel other things besides  she was dressed in black but in black that struck him as light and transparent she was exceedingly fair and though she was as markedly slim her face had a roundness with eyes far apart and a little strange her smile was natural and dim her hat not extravagant he had only perhaps a sense of the clink beneath her fine black sleeves of more gold bracelets and bangles than he had ever seen a lady wear chad was excellently free and light about their encounter it was one of the occasions on which strether most wished he himself might have arrived at such ease and such humour  here you are then face to face at last youre made for each othervous allez voir and i bless your union  it was indeed after he had gone off as if he had been partly serious too  this latter motion had been determined by an enquiry from him about jeanne to which her mother had replied that she was probably still in the house with miss gostrey to whom she had lately committed her  ah but you know the young man had rejoined he must see her with which while strether pricked up his ears he had started as if to bring her leaving the other objects of his interest together strether wondered to find miss gostrey already involved feeling that he missed a link but feeling also with small delay how much he should like to talk with her of madame de vionnet on this basis of evidence  the evidence as yet in truth was meagre which for that matter was perhaps a little why his expectation had had a drop  there was somehow not quite a wealth in her and a wealth was all that in his simplicity he had definitely prefigured  still it was too much to be sure already that there was but a poverty  they moved away from the house and with eyes on a bench at some distance he proposed that they should sit down  ive heard a great deal about you she said as they went but he had an answer to it that made her stop short  well about you madame de vionnet ive heard im bound to say almost nothingthose struck him as the only words he himself could utter with any lucidity conscious as he was and as with more reason of the determination to be in respect to the rest of his business perfectly plain and go perfectly straight  it hadnt at any rate been in the least his idea to spy on chads proper freedom  it was possibly however at this very instant and under the impression of madame de vionnets pause that going straight began to announce itself as a matter for care  she had only after all to smile at him ever so gently in order to make him ask himself if he werent already going crooked it might be going crooked to find it of a sudden just only clear that she intended very definitely to be what he would have called nice to him  this was what passed between them while for another instant they stood still he couldnt at least remember afterwards what else it might have been  the thing indeed really unmistakeable was its rolling over him as a wave that he had been in conditions incalculable and unimaginable a subject of discussion  he had been on some ground that concerned her answered for which gave her an advantage he should never be able to match  hasnt miss gostrey she asked said a good word for me  what had struck him first was the way he was bracketed with that lady and he wondered what account chad would have given of their acquaintance  something not as yet traceable at all events had obviously happened  i didnt even know of her knowing you  well now shell tell you all  im so glad youre in relation with her  this was one of the thingsthe all miss gostrey would now tell himthat with every deference to present preoccupation was uppermost for strether after they had taken their seat  one of the others was at the end of five minutes that sheoh incontestably yesdiffered less differed that is scarcely at allwell superficially speaking from mrs newsome or even from mrs pocock she was ever so much younger than the one and not so young as the other but what was there in her if anything that would have made it impossible he should meet her at woollett and wherein was her talk during their moments on the bench together not the same as would have been found adequate for a woollett gardenpartyunless perhaps truly in not being quite so bright  she observed to him that mr newsome had to her knowledge taken extraordinary pleasure in his visit but there was no good lady at woollett who wouldnt have been at least up to that was there in chad by chance after all deep down a principle of aboriginal loyalty that had made him for sentimental ends attach himself to elements happily encountered that would remind him most of the old air and the old soil why accordingly be in a flutterstrether could even put it that wayabout this unfamiliar phenomenon of the femme du monde  on these terms mrs newsome herself was as much of one  little bilham verily had testified that they came out the ladies of the type in close quarters but it was just in these quartersnow comparatively closethat he felt madame de vionnets common humanity  she did come out and certainly to his relief but she came out as the usual thing there might be motives behind but so could there often be even at woollett  the only thing was that if she showed him she wished to like himas the motives behind might conceivably promptit would possibly have been more thrilling for him that she should have shown as more vividly alien  ah she was neither turk nor polewhich would be indeed flat once more for mrs newsome and mrs pocock  a lady and two gentlemen had meanwhile however approached their bench and this accident stayed for the time further developments  they presently addressed his companion the brilliant strangers she rose to speak to them and strether noted how the escorted lady though mature and by no means beautiful had more of the bold high look the range of expensive reference that he had as might have been said made his plans for  madame de vionnet greeted her as duchesse and was greeted in turn while talk started in french as ma toutebelle little facts that had their due their vivid interest for strether madame de vionnet didnt none the less introduce hima note he was conscious of as false to the woollett scale and the woollett humanity though it didnt prevent the duchess who struck him as confident and free very much what he had obscurely supposed duchesses from looking at him as straight and as hardfor it was hardas if she would have liked all the same to know him  oh yes my dear its all right its me and who are you with your interesting wrinkles and your most effective is it the handsomest is it the ugliest of nosessome such loose handful of bright flowers she seemed fragrantly enough to fling at him  strether almost wonderedat such a pace was he goingif some divination of the influence of either party were what determined madame de vionnets abstention  one of the gentlemen in any case succeeded in placing himself in close relation with our friends companion a gentleman rather stout and importantly short in a hat with a wonderful wide curl to its brim and a frock coat buttoned with an effect of superlative decision  his french had quickly turned to equal english and it occurred to strether that he might well be one of the ambassadors  his design was evidently to assert a claim to madame de vionnets undivided countenance and he made it good in the course of a minuteled her away with a trick of three words a trick played with a social art of which strether looking after them as the four whose backs were now all turned moved off felt himself no master  he sank again upon his bench and while his eyes followed the party reflected as he had done before on chads strange communities  he sat there alone for five minutes with plenty to think of above all with his sense of having suddenly been dropped by a charming woman overlaid now by other impressions and in fact quite cleared and indifferent  he hadnt yet had so quiet a surrender he didnt in the least care if nobody spoke to him more  he might have been by his attitude in for something of a march so broad that the want of ceremony with which he had just been used could fall into its place as but a minor incident of the procession  besides there would be incidents enough as he felt when this term of contemplation was closed by the reappearance of little bilham who stood before him a moment with a suggestive well in which he saw himself reflected as disorganised as possibly floored  he replied with a well intended to show that he wasnt floored in the least  no indeed he gave it out as the young man sat down beside him that if at the worst he had been overturned at all he had been overturned into the upper air the sublimer element with which he had an affinity and in which he might be trusted a while to float  it wasnt a descent to earth to say after an instant and in sustained response to the reference youre quite sure her husbands living  oh dear yes  ah then  ah then what  strether had after all to think  well im sorry for them  but it didnt for the moment matter more than that  he assured his young friend he was quite content  they wouldnt stir were all right as they were  he didnt want to be introduced had been introduced already about as far as he could go  he had seen moreover an immensity liked gloriani who as miss barrace kept saying was wonderful had made out he was sure the halfdozen other men who were distinguished the artists the critics and oh the great dramatisthim it was easy to spot but wantedno thanks reallyto talk with none of them having nothing at all to say and finding it would do beautifully as it was do beautifully because what it waswell was just simply too late and when after this little bilham submissive and responsive but with an eye to the consolation nearest easily threw off some better late than never all he got in return for it was a sharp better early than late  this note indeed the next thing overflowed for strether into a quiet stream of demonstration that as soon as he had let himself go he felt as the real relief  it had consciously gathered to a head but the reservoir had filled sooner than he knew and his companions touch was to make the waters spread there were some things that had to come in time if they were to come at all  if they didnt come in time they were lost for ever  it was the general sense of them that had overwhelmed him with its long slow rush  its not too late for you on any side and you dont strike me as in danger of missing the train besides which people can be in general pretty well trusted of coursewith the clock of their freedom ticking as loud as it seems to do hereto keep an eye on the fleeting hour all the same dont forget that youre youngblessedly young be glad of it on the contrary and live up to it live all you can its a mistake not to  it doesnt so much matter what you do in particular so long as you have your life  if you havent had that what have you had this place and these impressionsmild as you may find them to wind a man up so all my impressions of chad and of people ive seen at his placewell have had their abundant message for me have just dropped that into my mind  i see it now  i havent done so enough beforeand now im old too old at any rate for what i see  oh i do see at least and more than youd believe or i can express  its too late and its as if the train had fairly waited at the station for me without my having had the gumption to know it was there now i hear its faint receding whistle miles and miles down the line what one loses one loses make no mistake about that  the affairi mean the affair of lifecouldnt no doubt have been different for me for its at the best a tin mould either fluted and embossed with ornamental excrescences or else smooth and dreadfully plain into which a helpless jelly ones consciousness is pouredso that one takes the form as the great cook says and is more or less compactly held by it one lives in fine as one can still one has the illusion of freedom therefore dont be like me without the memory of that illusion  i was either at the right time too stupid or too intelligent to have it i dont quite know which of course at present im a case of reaction against the mistake and the voice of reaction should no doubt always be taken with an allowance  but that doesnt affect the point that the right time is now yours  the right time is any time that one is still so lucky as to have  youve plenty thats the great thing youre as i say damn you so happily and hatefully young dont at any rate miss things out of stupidity  of course i dont take you for a fool or i shouldnt be addressing you thus awfully  do what you like so long as you dont make my mistake  for it was a mistake live  slowly and sociably with full pauses and straight dashes strether had so delivered himself holding little bilham from step to step deeply and gravely attentive  the end of all was that the young man had turned quite solemn and that this was a contradiction of the innocent gaiety the speaker had wished to promote  he watched for a moment the consequence of his words and then laying a hand on his listeners knee and as if to end with the proper joke  and now for the eye i shall keep on you  oh but i dont know that i want to be at your age too different from you  ah prepare while youre about it said strether to be more amusing  little bilham continued to think but at last had a smile  well you are amusingto me  impayable as you say no doubt  but what am i to myself strether had risen with this giving his attention now to an encounter that in the middle of the garden was in the act of taking place between their host and the lady at whose side madame de vionnet had quitted him this lady who appeared within a few minutes to have left her friends awaited glorianis eager approach with words on her lips that strether couldnt catch but of which her interesting witty face seemed to give him the echo he was sure she was prompt and fine but also that she had met her match and he likedin the light of what he was quite sure was the duchesss latent insolencethe good humour with which the great artist asserted equal resources  were they this pair of the great worldand was he himself for the moment and thus related to them by his observation in it then there was something in the great world covertly tigerish which came to him across the lawn and in the charming air as a waft from the jungle yet it made him admire most of the two made him envy the glossy male tiger magnificently marked these absurdities of the stirred sense fruits of suggestion ripening on the instant were all reflected in his next words to little bilham i knowif we talk of thatwhom i should enjoy being like  little bilham followed his eyes but then as with a shade of knowing surprise  gloriani  our friend had in fact already hesitated though not on the hint of his companions doubt in which there were depths of critical reserve  he had just made out in the now full picture something and somebody else another impression had been superimposed  a young girl in a white dress and a softly plumed white hat had suddenly come into view and what was presently clear was that her course was toward them  what was clearer still was that the handsome young man at her side was chad newsome and what was clearest of all was that she was therefore mademoiselle de vionnet that she was unmistakeably prettybright gentle shy happy wonderfuland that chad now with a consummate calculation of effect was about to present her to his old friends vision what was clearest of all indeed was something much more than this something at the single stroke of whichand wasnt it simply juxtapositionall vagueness vanished  it was the click of a springhe saw the truth  he had by this time also met chads look there was more of it in that and the truth accordingly so far as bilhams enquiry was concerned had thrust in the answer oh chadit was that rare youth he should have enjoyed being like the virtuous attachment would be all there before him the virtuous attachment would be in the very act of appeal for his blessing jeanne de vionnet this charming creature would be exquisitely intensely nowthe object of it  chad brought her straight up to him and chad was oh yes at this momentfor the glory of woollett or whateverbetter still even than gloriani  he had plucked this blossom he had kept it overnight in water and at last as he held it up to wonder he did enjoy his effect  that was why strether had felt at first the breath of calculationand why moreover as he now knew his look at the girl would be for the young man a sign of the latters success  what young man had ever paraded about that way without a reason a maiden in her flower  and there was nothing in his reason at present obscure  her type sufficiently told of itthey wouldnt they couldnt want her to go to woollett  poor woollett and what it might missthough brave chad indeed too and what it might gain brave chad however had just excellently spoken  this is a good little friend of mine who knows all about you and has moreover a message for you  and this my dearhe had turned to the child herselfis the best man in the world who has it in his power to do a great deal for us and whom i want you to like and revere as nearly as possible as much as i do  she stood there quite pink a little frightened prettier and prettier and not a bit like her mother  there was in this last particular no resemblance but that of youth to youth and here was in fact suddenly strethers sharpest impression  it went wondering dazed embarrassed back to the woman he had just been talking with it was a revelation in the light of which he already saw she would become more interesting so slim and fresh and fair she had yet put forth this perfection so that for really believing it of her for seeing her to any such developed degree as a mother comparison would be urgent  well what was it now but fairly thrust upon him  mamma wishes me to tell you before we go the girl said that she hopes very much youll come to see us very soon she has something important to say to you  she quite reproaches herself chad helpfully explained  you were interesting her so much when she accidentally suffered you to be interrupted  ah dont mention it strether murmured looking kindly from one to the other and wondering at many things  and im to ask you for myself jeanne continued with her hands clasped together as if in some small learnt prayerim to ask you for myself if you wont positively come  leave it to me dearill take care of it chad genially declared in answer to this while strether himself almost held his breath  what was in the girl was indeed too soft too unknown for direct dealing so that one could only gaze at it as at a picture quite staying ones own hand  but with chad he was now on groundchad he could meet so pleasant a confidence in that and in everything did the young man freely exhale  there was the whole of a story in his tone to his companion and he spoke indeed as if already of the family  it made strether guess the more quickly what it might be about which madame de vionnet was so urgent  having seen him then she had found him easy she wished to have it out with him that some way for the young people must be discovered some way that would not impose as a condition the transplantation of her daughter  he already saw himself discussing with this lady the attractions of woollett as a residence for chads companion was that youth going now to trust her with the affairso that it would be after all with one of his ladyfriends that his mothers missionary should be condemned to deal  it was quite as if for an instant the two men looked at each other on this question  but there was no mistaking at last chads pride in the display of such a connexion  this was what had made him so carry himself while three minutes before he was bringing it into view what had caused his friend first catching sight of him to be so struck with his air  it was in a word just when he thus finally felt chad putting things straight off on him that he envied him as he had mentioned to little bilham most  the whole exhibition however was but a matter of three or four minutes and the author of it had soon explained that as madame de vionnet was immediately going on this could be for jeanne but a snatch  they would all meet again soon and strether was meanwhile to stay and amuse himselfill pick you up again in plenty of time he took the girl off as he had brought her and strether with the faint sweet foreignness of her au revoir monsieur in his ears as a note almost unprecedented watched them recede side by side and felt how once more her companions relation to her got an accent from it  they disappeared among the others and apparently into the house whereupon our friend turned round to give out to little bilham the conviction of which he was full  but there was no little bilham any more little bilham had within the few moments for reasons of his own proceeded further  a circumstance by which in its order strether was also sensibly affected    iii   chad was not in fact on this occasion to keep his promise of coming back but miss gostrey had soon presented herself with an explanation of his failure  there had been reasons at the last for his going off with ces dames and he had asked her with much instance to come out and take charge of their friend  she did so strether felt as she took her place beside him in a manner that left nothing to desire  he had dropped back on his bench alone again for a time and the more conscious for little bilhams defection of his unexpressed thought in respect to which however this next converser was a still more capacious vessel  its the child he had exclaimed to her almost as soon as she appeared and though her direct response was for some time delayed he could feel in her meanwhile the working of this truth  it might have been simply as she waited that they were now in presence altogether of truth spreading like a flood and not for the moment to be offered her in the mere cupful inasmuch as who should ces dames prove to be but persons about whomonce thus face to face with themshe found she might from the first have told him almost everything this would have freely come had he taken the simple precaution of giving her their name  there could be no better exampleand she appeared to note it with high amusementthan the way making things out already so much for himself he was at last throwing precautions to the winds  they were neither more nor less she and the childs mother than old schoolfriendsfriends who had scarcely met for years but whom this unlookedfor chance had brought together with a rush  it was a relief miss gostrey hinted to feel herself no longer groping she was unaccustomed to grope and as a general thing he might well have seen made straight enough for her clue  with the one she had now picked up in her hands there need be at least no waste of wonder  shes coming to see methats for you strethers counsellor continued but i dont require it to know where i am  the waste of wonder might be proscribed but strether characteristically was even by this time in the immensity of space by which you mean that you know where she is  she just hesitated  i mean that if she comes to see me i shallnow that ive pulled myself round a bit after the shocknot be at home  strether hung poised  you call ityour recognitiona shock  she gave one of her rare flickers of impatience  it was a surprise an emotion  dont be so literal  i wash my hands of her  poor strethers face lengthened  shes impossible  shes even more charming than i remembered her  then whats the matter  she had to think how to put it  well im impossible  its impossible  everythings impossible  he looked at her an instant  i see where youre coming out everythings possible their eyes had on it in fact an exchange of some duration after which he pursued  isnt it that beautiful child then as she still said nothing  why dont you mean to receive her  her answer in an instant rang clear  because i wish to keep out of the business  it provoked in him a weak wail  youre going to abandon me now  no im only going to abandon her  shell want me to help her with you  and i wont  youll only help me with her  well then  most of the persons previously gathered had in the interest of tea passed into the house and they had the gardens mainly to themselves  the shadows were long the last call of the birds who had made a home of their own in the noble interspaced quarter sounded from the high trees in the other gardens as well those of the old convent and of the old hotels it was as if our friends had waited for the full charm to come out strethers impressions were still present it was as if something had happened that nailed them made them more intense but he was to ask himself soon afterwards that evening what really had happenedconscious as he could after all remain that for a gentleman taken and taken the first time into the great world the world of ambassadors and duchesses the items made a meagre total  it was nothing new to him however as we know that a man might haveat all events such a man as hean amount of experience out of any proportion to his adventures so that though it was doubtless no great adventure to sit on there with miss gostrey and hear about madame de vionnet the hour the picture the immediate the recent the possibleas well as the communication itself not a note of which failed to reverberateonly gave the moments more of the taste of history  it was history to begin with that jeannes mother had been threeandtwenty years before at geneva schoolmate and good girlfriend to maria gostrey who had moreover enjoyed since then though interruptedly and above all with a long recent drop other glimpses of her  twentythree years put them both on no doubt and madame de vionnetthough she had married straight after schoolcouldnt be today an hour less than thirtyeight this made her ten years older than chadthough ten years also if strether liked older than she looked the least at any rate that a prospective motherinlaw could be expected to do with  she would be of all mothersinlaw the most charming unless indeed through some perversity as yet insupposeable she should utterly belie herself in that relation  there was none surely in which as maria remembered her she mustnt be charming and this frankly in spite of the stigma of failure in the tie where failure always most showed  it was no test therewhen indeed was it a test therefor monsieur de vionnet had been a brute  she had lived for years apart from himwhich was of course always a horrid position but miss gostreys impression of the matter had been that she could scarce have made a better thing of it had she done it on purpose to show she was amiable  she was so amiable that nobody had had a word to say which was luckily not the case for her husband  he was so impossible that she had the advantage of all her merits  it was still history for strether that the comte de vionnetit being also history that the lady in question was a countessshould now under miss gostreys sharp touch rise before him as a high distinguished polished impertinent reprobate the product of a mysterious order it was history further that the charming girl so freely sketched by his companion should have been married out of hand by a mother another figure of striking outline full of dark personal motive it was perhaps history most of all that this company was as a matter of course governed by such considerations as put divorce out of the question  ces gensla dont divorce you know any more than they emigrate or abjurethey think it impious and vulgar a fact in the light of which they seemed but the more richly special  it was all special it was all for strethers imagination more or less rich the girl at the genevese school an isolated interesting attaching creature then both sensitive and violent audacious but always forgiven was the daughter of a french father and an english mother who early left a widow had married againtried afresh with a foreigner in her career with whom she had apparently given her child no example of comfort  all these peoplethe people of the english mothers sidehad been of condition more or less eminent yet with oddities and disparities that had often since made maria thinking them over wonder what they really quite rhymed to  it was in any case her belief that the mother interested and prone to adventure had been without conscience had only thought of ridding herself most quickly of a possible an actual encumbrance  the father by her impression a frenchman with a name one knew had been a different matter leaving his child she clearly recalled a memory all fondness as well as an assured little fortune which was unluckily to make her more or less of a prey later on  she had been in particular at school dazzlingly though quite booklessly clever as polyglot as a little jewess which she wasnt oh no and chattering french english german italian anything one would in a way that made a clean sweep if not of prizes and parchments at least of every part whether memorised or improvised in the curtained costumed school repertory and in especial of all mysteries of race and vagueness of reference all swagger about home among their variegated mates  it would doubtless be difficult today as between french and english to name her and place her she would certainly show on knowledge miss gostrey felt as one of those convenient types who dont keep you explainingminds with doors as numerous as the manytongued cluster of confessionals at saint peters  you might confess to her with confidence in roumelian and even roumelian sins  therefore but strethers narrator covered her implication with a laugh a laugh by which his betrayal of a sense of the lurid in the picture was also perhaps sufficiently protected  he had a moment of wondering while his friend went on what sins might be especially roumelian  she went on at all events to the mention of her having met the young thingagain by some swiss lakein her first married state which had appeared for the few intermediate years not at least violently disturbed  she had been lovely at that moment delightful to her full of responsive emotion of amused recognitions and amusing reminders and then once more much later after a long interval equally but differently charmingtouching and rather mystifying for the five minutes of an encounter at a railwaystation en province during which it had come out that her life was all changed  miss gostrey had understood enough to see essentially what had happened and yet had beautifully dreamed that she was herself faultless  there were doubtless depths in her but she was all right strether would see if she wasnt  she was another person howeverthat had been promptly markedfrom the small child of nature at the geneva school a little person quite made over as foreign women were compared with american by marriage  her situation too had evidently cleared itself up there would have beenall that was possiblea judicial separation  she had settled in paris brought up her daughter steered her boat  it was no very pleasant boatespecially thereto be in but marie de vionnet would have headed straight  she would have friends certainlyand very good ones  there she was at all eventsand it was very interesting  her knowing mr chad didnt in the least prove she hadnt friends what it proved was what good ones he had i saw that said miss gostrey that night at the francais it came out for me in three minutes  i saw heror somebody like her and so she immediately added did you  oh nonot anybody like her strether laughed  but you mean he as promptly went on that she has had such an influence on him  miss gostrey was on her feet it was time for them to go  she has brought him up for her daughter  their eyes as so often in candid conference through their settled glasses met over it long after which strethers again took in the whole place  they were quite alone there now  mustnt she ratherin the time thenhave rushed it  ah she wont of course have lost an hour  but thats just the good motherthe good french one  you must remember that of herthat as a mother shes french and that for them theres a special providence it precisely howeverthat she maynt have been able to begin as far back as shed have likedmakes her grateful for aid  strether took this in as they slowly moved to the house on their way out  she counts on me then to put the thing through  yesshe counts on you  oh and first of all of course miss gostrey added on herwell convincing you  ah her friend returned she caught chad young  yes but there are women who are for all your times of life theyre the most wonderful sort  she had laughed the words out but they brought her companion the next thing to a stand  is what you mean that shell try to make a fool of me  well im wondering what she willwith an opportunitymake  what do you call strether asked an opportunity  my going to see her  ah you must go to see hermiss gostrey was a trifle evasive you cant not do that  youd have gone to see the other woman  i mean if there had been onea different sort  its what you came out for  it might be but strether distinguished  i didnt come out to see this sort  she had a wonderful look at him now  are you disappointed she isnt worse  he for a moment entertained the question then found for it the frankest of answers  yes  if she were worse shed be better for our purpose  it would be simpler  perhaps she admitted  but wont this be pleasanter  ah you know he promptly replied i didnt come outwasnt that just what you originally reproached me withfor the pleasant  precisely  therefore i say again what i said at first  you must take things as they come  besides miss gostrey added im not afraid for myself  for yourself  of your seeing her  i trust her  theres nothing shell say about me  in fact theres nothing she can  strether wonderedlittle as he had thought of this  then he broke out  oh you women  there was something in it at which she flushed  yesthere we are were abysses at last she smiled  but i risk her  he gave himself a shake  well then so do i  but he added as they passed into the house that he would see chad the first thing in the morning  this was the next day the more easily effected that the young man as it happened even before he was down turned up at his hotel strether took his coffee by habit in the public room but on his descending for this purpose chad instantly proposed an adjournment to what he called greater privacy  he had himself as yet had nothingthey would sit down somewhere together and when after a few steps and a turn into the boulevard they had for their greater privacy sat down among twenty others our friend saw in his companions move a fear of the advent of waymarsh  it was the first time chad had to that extent given this personage away and strether found himself wondering of what it was symptomatic  he made out in a moment that the youth was in earnest as he hadnt yet seen him which in its turn threw a ray perhaps a trifle startling on what they had each up to that time been treating as earnestness it was sufficiently flattering however that the real thingif this was at last the real thingshould have been determined as appeared precisely by an accretion of strethers importance  for this was what it quickly enough came tothat chad rising with the lark had rushed down to let him know while his morning consciousness was yet young that he had literally made the afternoon before a tremendous impression  madame de vionnet wouldnt couldnt rest till she should have some assurance from him that he would consent again to see her  the announcement was made across their marbletopped table while the foam of the hot milk was in their cups and its plash still in the air with the smile of chads easiest urbanity and this expression of his face caused our friends doubts to gather on the spot into a challenge of the lips  see herethat was all he only for the moment said again see here chad met it with all his air of straight intelligence while strether remembered again that fancy of the first impression of him the happy young pagan handsome and hard but oddly indulgent whose mysterious measure he had under the streetlamp tried mentally to take  the young pagan while a long look passed between them sufficiently understood  strether scarce needed at last to say the resti want to know where i am but he said it adding before any answer something more  are you engaged to be marriedis that your secretto the young lady  chad shook his head with the slow amenity that was one of his ways of conveying that there was time for everything  i have no secretthough i may have secrets i havent at any rate that one were not engaged  no  then wheres the hitch  do you mean why i havent already started with you chad beginning his coffee and buttering his roll was quite ready to explain nothing would have induced menothing will still induce menot to try to keep you here as long as you can be made to stay its too visibly good for you strether had himself plenty to say about this but it was amusing also to measure the march of chads tone  he had never been more a man of the world and it was always in his company present to our friend that one was seeing how in successive connexions a man of the world acquitted himself  chad kept it up beautifully my ideavoyonsis simply that you should let madame de vionnet know you simply that you should consent to know her  i dont in the least mind telling you that clever and charming as she is shes ever so much in my confidence all i ask of you is to let her talk to you youve asked me about what you call my hitch and so far as it goes shell explain it to you  shes herself my hitch hang itif you must really have it all out  but in a sense he hastened in the most wonderful manner to add that youll quite make out for yourself shes too good a friend confound her  too good i mean for me to leave withoutwithout it was his first hesitation  without what  well without my arranging somehow or other the damnable terms of my sacrifice  it will be a sacrifice then  it will be the greatest loss i ever suffered  i owe her so much  it was beautiful the way chad said these things and his plea was now confessedlyoh quite flagrantly and publiclyinteresting  the moment really took on for strether an intensity  chad owed madame de vionnet so much  what did that do then but clear up the whole mystery  he was indebted for alterations and she was thereby in a position to have sent in her bill for expenses incurred in reconstruction  what was this at bottom but what had been to be arrived at  strether sat there arriving at it while he munched toast and stirred his second cup  to do this with the aid of chads pleasant earnest face was also to do more besides  no never before had he been so ready to take him as he was  what was it that had suddenly so cleared up  it was just everybodys character that is everybodys butin a measurehis own strether felt his character receive for the instant a smutch from all the wrong things he had suspected or believed  the person to whom chad owed it that he could positively turn out such a comfort to other personssuch a person was sufficiently raised above any breath by the nature of her work and the young mans steady light  all of which was vivid enough to come and go quickly though indeed in the midst of it strether could utter a question  have i your word of honour that if i surrender myself to madame de vionnet youll surrender yourself to me  chad laid his hand firmly on his friends  my dear man you have it  there was finally something in his felicity almost embarrassing and oppressivestrether had begun to fidget under it for the open air and the erect posture  he had signed to the waiter that he wished to pay and this transaction took some moments during which he thoroughly felt while he put down money and pretendedit was quite hollowto estimate change that chads higher spirit his youth his practice his paganism his felicity his assurance his impudence whatever it might be had consciously scored a success well that was all right so far as it went his sense of the thing in question covered our friend for a minute like a veil through whichas if he had been muffledhe heard his interlocutor ask him if he mightnt take him over about five over was over the river and over the river was where madame de vionnet lived and five was that very afternoon  they got at last out of the placegot out before he answered  he lighted in the street a cigarette which again gave him more time  but it was already sharp for him that there was no use in time  what does she propose to do to me he had presently demanded  chad had no delays  are you afraid of her  oh immensely  dont you see it  well said chad she wont do anything worse to you than make you like her  its just of that im afraid  then its not fair to me  strether cast about  its fair to your mother  oh said chad are you afraid of her  scarcely less  or perhaps even more  but is this lady against your interests at home strether went on  not directly no doubt but shes greatly in favour of them here  and whatheredoes she consider them to be  well good relations  with herself  with herself  and what is it that makes them so good  what  well thats exactly what youll make out if youll only go as im supplicating you to see her  strether stared at him with a little of the wanness no doubt that the vision of more to make out could scarce help producing  i mean how good are they  oh awfully good  again strether had faltered but it was brief  it was all very well but there was nothing now he wouldnt risk  excuse me but i must reallyas i began by telling youknow where i am  is she bad  badchad echoed it but without a shock  is that whats implied  when relations are good strether felt a little silly and was even conscious of a foolish laugh at having it imposed on him to have appeared to speak so  what indeed was he talking about  his stare had relaxed he looked now all round him  but something in him brought him back though he still didnt know quite how to turn it  the two or three ways he thought of and one of them in particular were even with scruples dismissed too ugly  he none the less at last found something  is her life without reproach  it struck him directly he had found it as pompous and priggish so much so that he was thankful to chad for taking it only in the right spirit  the young man spoke so immensely to the point that the effect was practically of positive blandness  absolutely without reproach a beautiful life  allez donc voir  these last words were in the liberality of their confidence so imperative that strether went through no form of assent but before they separated it had been confirmed that he should be picked up at a quarter to five      book sixth     i   it was quite by halfpast fiveafter the two men had been together in madame de vionnets drawingroom not more than a dozen minutesthat chad with a look at his watch and then another at their hostess said genially gaily  ive an engagement and i know you wont complain if i leave him with you  hell interest you immensely and as for her he declared to strether i assure you if youre at all nervous shes perfectly safe  he had left them to be embarrassed or not by this guarantee as they could best manage and embarrassment was a thing that strether wasnt at first sure madame de vionnet escaped  he escaped it himself to his surprise but he had grown used by this time to thinking of himself as brazen  she occupied his hostess in the rue de bellechasse the first floor of an old house to which our visitors had had access from an old clean court  the court was large and open full of revelations for our friend of the habit of privacy the peace of intervals the dignity of distances and approaches the house to his restless sense was in the high homely style of an elder day and the ancient paris that he was always looking forsometimes intensely felt sometimes more acutely missedwas in the immemorial polish of the wide waxed staircase and in the fine boiseries the medallions mouldings mirrors great clear spaces of the greyishwhite salon into which he had been shown  he seemed at the very outset to see her in the midst of possessions not vulgarly numerous but hereditary cherished charming  while his eyes turned after a little from those of his hostess and chad freely talkednot in the least about him but about other people people he didnt know and quite as if he did know themhe found himself making out as a background of the occupant some glory some prosperity of the first empire some napoleonic glamour some dim lustre of the great legend elements clinging still to all the consular chairs and mythological brasses and sphinxes heads and faded surfaces of satin striped with alternate silk  the place itself went further backthat he guessed and how old paris continued in a manner to echo there but the postrevolutionary period the world he vaguely thought of as the world of chateaubriand of madame de stael even of the young lamartine had left its stamp of harps and urns and torches a stamp impressed on sundry small objects ornaments and relics  he had never before to his knowledge had present to him relics of any special dignity of a private orderlittle old miniatures medallions pictures books books in leather bindings pinkish and greenish with gilt garlands on the back ranged together with other promiscuous properties under the glass of brassmounted cabinets  his attention took them all tenderly into account they were among the matters that marked madame de vionnets apartment as something quite different from miss gostreys little museum of bargains and from chads lovely home he recognised it as founded much more on old accumulations that had possibly from time to time shrunken than on any contemporary method of acquisition or form of curiosity  chad and miss gostrey had rummaged and purchased and picked up and exchanged sifting selecting comparing whereas the mistress of the scene before him beautifully passive under the spell of transmissiontransmission from her fathers line he quite made up his mindhad only received accepted and been quiet  when she hadnt been quiet she had been moved at the most to some occult charity for some fallen fortune  there had been objects she or her predecessors might even conceivably have parted with under need but strether couldnt suspect them of having sold old pieces to get better ones  they would have felt no difference as to better or worse  he could but imagine their having feltperhaps in emigration in proscription for his sketch was slight and confusedthe pressure of want or the obligation of sacrifice  the pressure of wantwhatever might be the case with the other forcewas however presumably not active now for the tokens of a chastened ease still abounded after all many marks of a taste whose discriminations might perhaps have been called eccentric  he guessed at intense little preferences and sharp little exclusions a deep suspicion of the vulgar and a personal view of the right the general result of this was something for which he had no name on the spot quite ready but something he would have come nearest to naming in speaking of it as the air of supreme respectability the consciousness small still reserved but none the less distinct and diffused of private honour  the air of supreme respectabilitythat was a strange blank wall for his adventure to have brought him to break his nose against it had in fact as he was now aware filled all the approaches hovered in the court as he passed hung on the staircase as he mounted sounded in the grave rumble of the old bell as little electric as possible of which chad at the door had pulled the ancient but neatlykept tassel it formed in short the clearest medium of its particular kind that he had ever breathed  he would have answered for it at the end of a quarter of an hour that some of the glass cases contained swords and epaulettes of ancient colonels and generals medals and orders once pinned over hearts that had long since ceased to beat snuffboxes bestowed on ministers and envoys copies of works presented with inscriptions by authors now classic  at bottom of it all for him was the sense of her rare unlikeness to the women he had known  this sense had grown since the day before the more he recalled her and had been above all singularly fed by his talk with chad in the morning everything in fine made her immeasurably new and nothing so new as the old house and the old objects  there were books two or three on a small table near his chair but they hadnt the lemoncoloured covers with which his eye had begun to dally from the hour of his arrival and to the opportunity of a further acquaintance with which he had for a fortnight now altogether succumbed  on another table across the room he made out the great revue but even that familiar face conspicuous in mrs newsomes parlours scarce counted here as a modern note  he was sure on the spotand he afterwards knew he was rightthat this was a touch of chads own hand  what would mrs newsome say to the circumstance that chads interested influence kept her paperknife in the revue  the interested influence at any rate had as we say gone straight to the pointhad in fact soon left it quite behind  she was seated near the fire on a small stuffed and fringed chair one of the few modern articles in the room and she leaned back in it with her hands clasped in her lap and no movement in all her person but the fine prompt play of her deep young face  the fire under the low white marble undraped and academic had burnt down to the silver ashes of light wood one of the windows at a distance stood open to the mildness and stillness out of which in the short pauses came the faint sound pleasant and homely almost rustic of a plash and a clatter of sabots from some coachhouse on the other side of the court madame de vionnet while strether sat there wasnt to shift her posture by an inch i dont think you seriously believe in what youre doing she said but all the same you know im going to treat you quite as if i did  by which you mean strether directly replied quite as if you didnt  i assure you it wont make the least difference with me how you treat me  well she said taking that menace bravely and philosophically enough the only thing that really matters is that you shall get on with me  ah but i dont he immediately returned  it gave her another pause which however she happily enough shook off  will you consent to go on with me a littleprovisionallyas if you did  then it was that he saw how she had decidedly come all the way and there accompanied it an extraordinary sense of her raising from somewhere below him her beautiful suppliant eyes  he might have been perched at his doorstep or at his window and she standing in the road for a moment he let her stand and couldnt moreover have spoken  it had been sad of a sudden with a sadness that was like a cold breath in his face  what can i do he finally asked but listen to you as i promised chadwick  ah but what im asking you she quickly said isnt what mr newsome had in mind she spoke at present he saw as if to take courageously all her risk  this is my own idea and a different thing  it gave poor strether in truthuneasy as it made him toosomething of the thrill of a bold perception justified  well he answered kindly enough i was sure a moment since that some idea of your own had come to you  she seemed still to look up at him but now more serenely  i made out you were sureand that helped it to come  so you see she continued we do get on  oh but it appears to me i dont at all meet your request  how can i when i dont understand it  it isnt at all necessary you should understand it will do quite well enough if you simply remember it  only feel i trust youand for nothing so tremendous after all  just she said with a wonderful smile for common civility  strether had a long pause while they sat again face to face as they had sat scarce less conscious before the poor lady had crossed the stream  she was the poor lady for strether now because clearly she had some trouble and her appeal to him could only mean that her trouble was deep  he couldnt help it it wasnt his fault he had done nothing but by a turn of the hand she had somehow made their encounter a relation  and the relation profited by a mass of things that were not strictly in it or of it by the very air in which they sat by the high cold delicate room by the world outside and the little plash in the court by the first empire and the relics in the stiff cabinets by matters as far off as those and by others as near as the unbroken clasp of her hands in her lap and the look her expression had of being most natural when her eyes were most fixed  you count upon me of course for something really much greater than it sounds  oh it sounds great enough too she laughed at this  he found himself in time on the point of telling her that she was as miss barrace called it wonderful but catching himself up he said something else instead  what was it chads idea then that you should say to me  ah his idea was simply what a mans idea always isto put every effort off on the woman  the woman strether slowly echoed  the woman he likesand just in proportion as he likes her  in proportion toofor shifting the troubleas she likes him  strether followed it then with an abruptness of his own how much do you like chad  just as much as thatto take all with you on myself but she got at once again away from this  ive been trembling as if we were to stand or fall by what you may think of me and im even now she went on wonderfully drawing a long breathand yes truly taking a great couragefrom the hope that i dont in fact strike you as impossible  thats at all events clearly he observed after an instant the way i dont strike you  well she so far assented as you havent yet said you wont have the little patience with me i ask for  you draw splendid conclusions  perfectly  but i dont understand them strether pursued  you seem to me to ask for much more than you need  what at the worst for you what at the best for myself can i after all do  i can use no pressure that i havent used  you come really late with your request  ive already done all that for myself the case admits of  ive said my say and here i am  yes here you are fortunately madame de vionnet laughed  mrs newsome she added in another tone didnt think you can do so little  he had an hesitation but he brought the words out  well she thinks so now  do you mean by that but she also hung fire  do i mean what  she still rather faltered  pardon me if i touch on it but if im saying extraordinary things why perhaps maynt i  besides doesnt it properly concern us to know  to know what he insisted as after thus beating about the bush she had again dropped  she made the effort  has she given you up  he was amazed afterwards to think how simply and quietly he had met it not yet it was almost as if he were a trifle disappointedhad expected still more of her freedom  but he went straight on is that what chad has told you will happen to me  she was evidently charmed with the way he took it  if you mean if weve talked of itmost certainly  and the questions not what has had least to do with my wishing to see you  to judge if im the sort of man a woman can  precisely she exclaimedyou wonderful gentleman i do judgei have judged  a woman cant  youre safewith every right to be youd be much happier if youd only believe it  strether was silent a little then he found himself speaking with a cynicism of confidence of which even at the moment the sources were strange to him  i try to believe it  but its a marvel he exclaimed how you already get at it  oh she was able to say  remember how much i was on the way to it through mr newsomebefore i saw you  he thinks everything of your strength  well i can bear almost anything our friend briskly interrupted deep and beautiful on this her smile came back and with the effect of making him hear what he had said just as she had heard it  he easily enough felt that it gave him away but what in truth had everything done but that  it had been all very well to think at moments that he was holding her nose down and that he had coerced her  what had he by this time done but let her practically see that he accepted their relation  what was their relation moreoverthough light and brief enough in form as yetbut whatever she might choose to make it nothing could prevent hercertainly he couldntfrom making it pleasant  at the back of his head behind everything was the sense that she wasthere before him close to him in vivid imperative formone of the rare women he had so often heard of read of thought of but never met whose very presence look voice the mere contemporaneous fact of whom from the moment it was at all presented made a relation of mere recognition  that was not the kind of woman he had ever found mrs newsome a contemporaneous fact who had been distinctly slow to establish herself and at present confronted with madame de vionnet he felt the simplicity of his original impression of miss gostrey  she certainly had been a fact of rapid growth but the world was wide each day was more and more a new lesson  there were at any rate even among the stranger ones relations and relations of course i suit chads grand way he quickly added  he hasnt had much difficulty in working me in  she seemed to deny a little on the young mans behalf by the rise of her eyebrows an intention of any process at all inconsiderate you must know how grieved hed be if you were to lose anything  he believes you can keep his mother patient  strether wondered with his eyes on her  i see  thats then what you really want of me  and how am i to do it  perhaps youll tell me that  simply tell her the truth  and what do you call the truth  well any truthabout us allthat you see yourself  i leave it to you  thank you very much  i like strether laughed with a slight harshness the way you leave things  but she insisted kindly gently as if it wasnt so bad  be perfectly honest  tell her all  all he oddly echoed  tell her the simple truth madame de vionnet again pleaded  but what is the simple truth  the simple truth is exactly what im trying to discover  she looked about a while but presently she came back to him  tell her fully and clearly about us  strether meanwhile had been staring  you and your daughter  yeslittle jeanne and me  tell her she just slightly quavered you like us  and what good will that do me  or ratherhe caught himself upwhat good will it do you  she looked graver  none you believe really  strether debated  she didnt send me out to like you  oh she charmingly contended she sent you out to face the facts  he admitted after an instant that there was something in that  but how can i face them till i know what they are  do you want him he then braced himself to ask to marry your daughter  she gave a headshake as noble as it was prompt  nonot that  and he really doesnt want to himself  she repeated the movement but now with a strange light in her face he likes her too much  strether wondered  to be willing to consider you mean the question of taking her to america  to be willing to do anything with her but be immensely kind and nicereally tender of her  we watch over her and you must help us you must see her again  strether felt awkward  ah with pleasureshes so remarkably attractive  the mothers eagerness with which madame de vionnet jumped at this was to come back to him later as beautiful in its grace  the dear thing did please you then as he met it with the largest oh of enthusiasm  shes perfect  shes my joy  well im sure thatif one were near her and saw more of hershed be mine  then said madame de vionnet tell mrs newsome that  he wondered the more  what good will that do you as she appeared unable at once to say however he brought out something else  is your daughter in love with our friend  ah she rather startlingly answered i wish youd find out  he showed his surprise  i  a stranger  oh you wont be a strangerpresently  you shall see her quite i assure you as if you werent  it remained for him none the less an extraordinary notion  it seems to me surely that if her mother cant  ah little girls and their mothers today she rather inconsequently broke in  but she checked herself with something she seemed to give out as after all more to the point  tell her ive been good for him dont you think i have  it had its effect on himmore than at the moment he quite measured yet he was consciously enough touched  oh if its all you  well it may not be all she interrupted but its to a great extent  really and truly she added in a tone that was to take its place with him among things remembered  then its very wonderful  he smiled at her from a face that he felt as strained and her own face for a moment kept him so  at last she also got up  well dont you think that for that  i ought to save you  so it was that the way to meet herand the way as well in a manner to get offcame over him  he heard himself use the exorbitant word the very sound of which helped to determine his flight  ill save you if i can    ii   in chads lovely home however one evening ten days later he felt himself present at the collapse of the question of jeanne de vionnets shy secret  he had been dining there in the company of that young lady and her mother as well as of other persons and he had gone into the petit salon at chads request on purpose to talk with her the young man had put this to him as a favouri should like so awfully to know what you think of her  it will really be a chance for you he had said to see the jeune fillei mean the typeas she actually is and i dont think that as an observer of manners its a thing you ought to miss  it will be an impression thatwhatever else you takeyou can carry home with you where youll find again so much to compare it with  strether knew well enough with what chad wished him to compare it and though he entirely assented he hadnt yet somehow been so deeply reminded that he was being as he constantly though mutely expressed it used  he was as far as ever from making out exactly to what end but he was none the less constantly accompanied by a sense of the service he rendered  he conceived only that this service was highly agreeable to those who profited by it and he was indeed still waiting for the moment at which he should catch it in the act of proving disagreeable proving in some degree intolerable to himself  he failed quite to see how his situation could clear up at all logically except by some turn of events that would give him the pretext of disgust  he was building from day to day on the possibility of disgust but each day brought forth meanwhile a new and more engaging bend of the road  that possibility was now ever so much further from sight than on the eve of his arrival and he perfectly felt that should it come at all it would have to be at best inconsequent and violent  he struck himself as a little nearer to it only when he asked himself what service in such a life of utility he was after all rendering mrs newsome  when he wished to help himself to believe that he was still all right he reflectedand in fact with wonderon the unimpaired frequency of their correspondence in relation to which what was after all more natural than that it should become more frequent just in proportion as their problem became more complicated  certain it is at any rate that he now often brought himself balm by the question with the rich consciousness of yesterdays letter well what can i do more than thatwhat can i do more than tell her everything  to persuade himself that he did tell her had told her everything he used to try to think of particular things he hadnt told her  when at rare moments and in the watches of the night he pounced on one it generally showed itself to beto a deeper scrutinynot quite truly of the essence  when anything new struck him as coming up or anything already noted as reappearing he always immediately wrote as if for fear that if he didnt he would miss something and also that he might be able to say to himself from time to time she knows it noweven while i worry it was a great comfort to him in general not to have left past things to be dragged to light and explained not to have to produce at so late a stage anything not produced or anything even veiled and attenuated at the moment  she knew it now  that was what he said to himself tonight in relation to the fresh fact of chads acquaintance with the two ladiesnot to speak of the fresher one of his own  mrs newsome knew in other words that very night at woollett that he himself knew madame de vionnet and that he had conscientiously been to see her also that he had found her remarkably attractive and that there would probably be a good deal more to tell but she further knew or would know very soon that again conscientiously he hadnt repeated his visit and that when chad had asked him on the countesss behalfstrether made her out vividly with a thought at the back of his head a countessif he wouldnt name a day for dining with her he had replied lucidly thank you very muchimpossible  he had begged the young man would present his excuses and had trusted him to understand that it couldnt really strike one as quite the straight thing  he hadnt reported to mrs newsome that he had promised to save madame de vionnet but so far as he was concerned with that reminiscence he hadnt at any rate promised to haunt her house  what chad had understood could only in truth be inferred from chads behaviour which had been in this connexion as easy as in every other  he was easy always when he understood he was easier still if possible when he didnt he had replied that he would make it all right and he had proceeded to do this by substituting the present occasionas he was ready to substitute othersfor any for every occasion as to which his old friend should have a funny scruple  oh but im not a little foreign girl im just as english as i can be jeanne de vionnet had said to him as soon as in the petit salon he sank shyly enough on his own side into the place near her vacated by madame gloriani at his approach  madame gloriani who was in black velvet with white lace and powdered hair and whose somewhat massive majesty melted at any contact into the graciousness of some incomprehensible tongue moved away to make room for the vague gentleman after benevolent greetings to him which embodied as he believed in baffling accents some recognition of his face from a couple of sundays before  then he had remarkedmaking the most of the advantage of his yearsthat it frightened him quite enough to find himself dedicated to the entertainment of a little foreign girl  there were girls he wasnt afraid ofhe was quite bold with little americans  thus it was that she had defended herself to the endoh but im almost american too  thats what mamma has wanted me to bei mean like that for she has wanted me to have lots of freedom  she has known such good results from it  she was fairly beautiful to hima faint pastel in an oval frame he thought of her already as of some lurking image in a long gallery the portrait of a small oldtime princess of whom nothing was known but that she had died young  little jeanne wasnt doubtless to die young but one couldnt all the same bear on her lightly enough  it was bearing hard it was bearing as he in any case wouldnt bear to concern himself in relation to her with the question of a young man odious really the question of a young man one didnt treat such a person as a maidservant suspected of a follower  and then young men young menwell the thing was their business simply or was at all events hers  she was fluttered fairly feveredto the point of a little glitter that came and went in her eyes and a pair of pink spots that stayed in her cheekswith the great adventure of dining out and with the greater one still possibly of finding a gentleman whom she must think of as very very old a gentleman with eyeglasses wrinkles a long grizzled moustache  she spoke the prettiest english our friend thought that he had ever heard spoken just as he had believed her a few minutes before to be speaking the prettiest french he wondered almost wistfully if such a sweep of the lyre didnt react on the spirit itself and his fancy had in fact before he knew it begun so to stray and embroider that he finally found himself absent and extravagant sitting with the child in a friendly silence  only by this time he felt her flutter to have fortunately dropped and that she was more at her ease  she trusted him liked him and it was to come back to him afterwards that she had told him things  she had dipped into the waiting medium at last and found neither surge nor chillnothing but the small splash she could herself make in the pleasant warmth nothing but the safety of dipping and dipping again at the end of the ten minutes he was to spend with her his impressionwith all it had thrown off and all it had taken inwas complete  she had been free as she knew freedom partly to show him that unlike other little persons she knew she had imbibed that ideal she was delightfully quaint about herself but the vision of what she had imbibed was what most held him  it really consisted he was soon enough to feel in just one great little matter the fact that whatever her nature she was thoroughlyhe had to cast about for the word but it camebred he couldnt of course on so short an acquaintance speak for her nature but the idea of breeding was what she had meanwhile dropped into his mind  he had never yet known it so sharply presented  her mother gave it no doubt but her mother to make that less sensible gave so much else besides and on neither of the two previous occasions extraordinary woman strether felt anything like what she was giving tonight  little jeanne was a case an exquisite case of education whereas the countess whom it so amused him to think of by that denomination was a case also exquisite ofwell he didnt know what  he has wonderful taste notre jeune homme  this was what gloriani said to him on turning away from the inspection of a small picture suspended near the door of the room  the high celebrity in question had just come in apparently in search of mademoiselle de vionnet but while strether had got up from beside her their fellow guest with his eye sharply caught had paused for a long look  the thing was a landscape of no size but of the french school as our friend was glad to feel he knew and also of a qualitywhich he liked to think he should also have guessed its frame was large out of proportion to the canvas and he had never seen a person look at anything he thought just as gloriani with his nose very near and quick movements of the head from side to side and bottom to top examined this feature of chads collection  the artist used that word the next moment smiling courteously wiping his nippers and looking round him furtherpaying the place in short by the very manner of his presence and by something strether fancied he could make out in this particular glance such a tribute as to the latters sense settled many things once for all strether was conscious at this instant for that matter as he hadnt yet been of how round about him quite without him they were consistently settled  glorianis smile deeply italian he considered and finely inscrutable had had for him during dinner at which they were not neighbours an indefinite greeting but the quality in it was gone that had appeared on the other occasion to turn him inside out it was as if even the momentary link supplied by the doubt between them had snapped  he was conscious now of the final reality which was that there wasnt so much a doubt as a difference altogether all the more that over the difference the famous sculptor seemed to signal almost condolingly yet oh how vacantly as across some great flat sheet of water  he threw out the bridge of a charming hollow civility on which strether wouldnt have trusted his own full weight a moment  that idea even though but transient and perhaps belated had performed the office of putting strether more at his ease and the blurred picture had already droppeddropped with the sound of something else said and with his becoming aware by another quick turn that gloriani was now on the sofa talking with jeanne while he himself had in his ears again the familiar friendliness and the elusive meaning of the oh oh oh that had made him a fortnight before challenge miss barrace in vain she had always the air this picturesque and original lady who struck him so oddly as both antique and modernshe had always the air of taking up some joke that one had already had out with her  the point itself no doubt was what was antique and the use she made of it what was modern  he felt just now that her goodnatured irony did bear on something and it troubled him a little that she wouldnt be more explicit only assuring him with the pleasure of observation so visible in her that she wouldnt tell him more for the world  he could take refuge but in asking her what she had done with waymarsh though it must be added that he felt himself a little on the way to a clue after she had answered that this personage was in the other room engaged in conversation with madame de vionnet  he stared a moment at the image of such a conjunction then for miss barraces benefit he wondered is she too then under the charm  no not a bitmiss barrace was prompt  she makes nothing of him shes bored  she wont help you with him  oh strether laughed she cant do everything  of course notwonderful as she is  besides he makes nothing of her she wont take him from methough she wouldnt no doubt having other affairs in hand even if she could  ive never said miss barrace seen her fail with any one before  and tonight when shes so magnificent it would seem to her strangeif she minded  so at any rate i have him all  je suis tranquille  strether understood so far as that went but he was feeling for his clue  she strikes you tonight as particularly magnificent  surely  almost as ive never seen her  doesnt she you why its for you  he persisted in his candour  for me  oh oh oh cried miss barrace who persisted in the opposite of that quality  well he acutely admitted she is different  shes gay  shes gay miss barrace laughed  and she has beautiful shouldersthough theres nothing different in that  no said strether one was sure of her shoulders it isnt her shoulders  his companion with renewed mirth and the finest sense  between the puffs of her cigarette of the drollery of things appeared to find their conversation highly delightful  yes it isnt her shoulders   what then is it strether earnestly enquired  why its shesimply  its her mood  its her charm  of course its her charm but were speaking of the difference well miss barrace explained shes just brilliant as we used to say  thats all  shes various  shes fifty women  ah but only onestrether kept it clearat a time  perhaps  but in fifty times  oh we shant come to that our friend declared and the next moment he had moved in another direction  will you answer me a plain question  will she ever divorce  miss barrace looked at him through all her tortoiseshell  why should she  it wasnt what he had asked for he signified but he met it well enough  to marry chad  why should she marry chad  because im convinced shes very fond of him  she has done wonders for him  well then how could she do more  marrying a man or woman either miss barrace sagely went on is never the wonder for any jack and jill can bring that off  the wonder is their doing such things without marrying  strether considered a moment this proposition  you mean its so beautiful for our friends simply to go on so  but whatever he said made her laugh  beautiful  he nevertheless insisted  and that because its disinterested  she was now however suddenly tired of the question  yes thencall it that  besides shell never divorce  dont moreover she added believe everything you hear about her husband  hes not then strether asked a wretch  oh yes  but charming  do you know him  ive met him  hes bien aimable  to every one but his wife  oh for all i know to her tooto any to every woman  i hope you at any rate she pursued with a quick change appreciate the care i take of mr waymarsh  oh immensely but strether was not yet in line  at all events he roundly brought out the attachments an innocent one  mine and his  ah she laughed dont rob it of all interest  i mean our friends hereto the lady weve been speaking of that was what he had settled to as an indirect but none the less closely involved consequence of his impression of jeanne  that was where he meant to stay  its innocent he repeatedi see the whole thing  mystified by his abrupt declaration she had glanced over at gloriani as at the unnamed subject of his allusion but the next moment she had understood though indeed not before strether had noticed her momentary mistake and wondered what might possibly be behind that too  he already knew that the sculptor admired madame de vionnet but did this admiration also represent an attachment of which the innocence was discussable  he was moving verily in a strange air and on ground not of the firmest  he looked hard for an instant at miss barrace but she had already gone on  all right with mr newsome  why of course she isand she got gaily back to the question of her own good friend i dare say youre surprised that im not worn out with all i seeit being so muchof sitting bull  but im not you knowi dont mind him i bear up and we get on beautifully  im very strange im like that and often i cant explain  there are people who are supposed interesting or remarkable or whatever and who bore me to death and then there are others as to whom nobody can understand what anybody sees in themin whom i see no end of things  then after she had smoked a moment hes touching you know she said  know strether echoeddont i indeed  we must move you almost to tears  oh but i dont mean you she laughed  you ought to then for the worst sign of allas i must have it for youis that you cant help me  thats when a woman pities  ah but i do help you she cheerfully insisted  again he looked at her hard and then after a pause  no you dont  her tortoiseshell on its long chain rattled down  i help you with sitting bull  thats a good deal  oh that yes  but strether hesitated  do you mean he talks of me  so that i have to defend you  no never  i see strether mused  its too deep  thats his only fault she returnedthat everything with him is too deep  he has depths of silencewhich he breaks only at the longest intervals by a remark  and when the remark comes its always something he has seen or felt for himselfnever a bit banal that would be what one might have feared and what would kill me but never  she smoked again as she thus with amused complacency appreciated her acquisition  and never about you  we keep clear of you  were wonderful  but ill tell you what he does do she continued  he tries to make me presents  presents poor strether echoed conscious with a pang that he hadnt yet tried that in any quarter  why you see she explained hes as fine as ever in the victoria so that when i leave him as i often do almost for hourshe likes it soat the doors of shops the sight of him there helps me when i come out to know my carriage away off in the rank  but sometimes for a change he goes with me into the shops and then ive all i can do to prevent his buying me things  he wants to treat you  strether almost gasped at all he himself hadnt thought of  he had a sense of admiration  oh hes much more in the real tradition than i  yes he mused its the sacred rage  the sacred rage exactlyand miss barrace who hadnt before heard this term applied recognised its bearing with a clap of her gemmed hands  now i do know why hes not banal  but i do prevent him all the sameand if you saw what he sometimes selectsfrom buying  i save him hundreds and hundreds  i only take flowers  flowers strether echoed again with a rueful reflexion  how many nosegays had her present converser sent  innocent flowers she pursued as much as he likes  and he sends me splendours he knows all the best placeshe has found them for himself hes wonderful  he hasnt told them to me her friend smiled he has a life of his own  but strether had swung back to the consciousness that for himself after all it never would have done  waymarsh hadnt mrs waymarsh in the least to consider whereas lambert strether had constantly in the inmost honour of his thoughts to consider mrs newsome  he liked moreover to feel how much his friend was in the real tradition  yet he had his conclusion  what a rage it is he had worked it out  its an opposition  she followed but at a distance  thats what i feel  yet to what  well he thinks you know that ive a life of my own  and i havent  you havent  she showed doubt and her laugh confirmed it oh oh oh  nonot for myself  i seem to have a life only for other people  ah for them and with them just now for instance with  well with whom he asked before she had had time to say  his tone had the effect of making her hesitate and even as he guessed speak with a difference  say with miss gostrey  what do you do for her  it really made him wonder  nothing at all    iii   madame de vionnet having meanwhile come in was at present close to them and miss barrace hereupon instead of risking a rejoinder became again with a look that measured her from top to toe all mere longhandled appreciative tortoiseshell  she had struck our friend from the first of her appearing as dressed for a great occasion and she met still more than on either of the others the conception reawakened in him at their gardenparty the idea of the femme du monde in her habit as she lived  her bare shoulders and arms were white and beautiful the materials of her dress a mixture as he supposed of silk and crape were of a silvery grey so artfully composed as to give an impression of warm splendour and round her neck she wore a collar of large old emeralds the green note of which was more dimly repeated at other points of her apparel in embroidery in enamel in satin in substances and textures vaguely rich  her head extremely fair and exquisitely festal was like a happy fancy a notion of the antique on an old precious medal some silver coin of the renaissance while her slim lightness and brightness her gaiety her expression her decision contributed to an effect that might have been felt by a poet as half mythological and half conventional he could have compared her to a goddess still partly engaged in a morning cloud or to a seanymph waisthigh in the summer surge above all she suggested to him the reflexion that the femme du mondein these finest developments of the typewas like cleopatra in the play indeed various and multifold she had aspects characters days nightsor had them at least showed them by a mysterious law of her own when in addition to everything she happened also to be a woman of genius  she was an obscure person a muffled person one day and a showy person an uncovered person the next  he thought of madame de vionnet tonight as showy and uncovered though he felt the formula rough because thanks to one of the shortcuts of genius she had taken all his categories by surprise twice during dinner he had met chads eyes in a longish look but these communications had in truth only stirred up again old ambiguitiesso little was it clear from them whether they were an appeal or an admonition you see how im fixed was what they appeared to convey yet how he was fixed was exactly what strether didnt see  however perhaps he should see now  are you capable of the very great kindness of going to relieve newsome for a few minutes of the rather crushing responsibility of madame gloriani while i say a word if hell allow me to mr strether of whom ive a question to ask  our host ought to talk a bit to those other ladies and ill come back in a minute to your rescue she made this proposal to miss barrace as if her consciousness of a special duty had just flickeredup but that ladys recognition of strethers little start at itas at a betrayal on the speakers part of a domesticated statewas as mute as his own comment and after an instant when their fellow guest had goodnaturedly left them he had been given something else to think of  why has maria so suddenly gone  do you know  that was the question madame de vionnet had brought with her  im afraid ive no reason to give you but the simple reason ive had from her in a notethe sudden obligation to join in the south a sick friend who has got worse  ah then she has been writing you  not since she wenti had only a brief explanatory word before she started  i went to see her strether explainedit was the day after i called on youbut she was already on her way and her concierge told me that in case of my coming i was to be informed she had written to me  i found her note when i got home  madame de vionnet listened with interest and with her eyes on strethers face then her delicately decorated head had a small melancholy motion  she didnt write to me  i went to see her she added almost immediately after i had seen you and as i assured her i would do when i met her at glorianis  she hadnt then told me she was to be absent and i felt at her door as if i understood shes absentwith all respect to her sick friend though i know indeed she has plentyso that i may not see her  she doesnt want to meet me again  well she continued with a beautiful conscious mildness i liked and admired her beyond every one in the old time and she knew itperhaps thats precisely what has made her goand i dare say i havent lost her for ever  strether still said nothing he had a horror as he now thought of himself of being in question between womenwas in fact already quite enough on his way to that and there was moreover as it came to him perceptibly something behind these allusions and professions that should he take it in would square but ill with his present resolve to simplify it was as if for him all the same her softness and sadness were sincere  he felt that not less when she soon went on im extremely glad of her happiness  but it also left him mutesharp and fine though the imputation it conveyed what it conveyed was that he was maria gostreys happiness and for the least little instant he had the impulse to challenge the thought  he could have done so however only by saying what then do you suppose to be between us and he was wonderfully glad a moment later not to have spoken  he would rather seem stupid any day than fatuous and he drew back as well with a smothered inward shudder from the consideration of what womenof highlydeveloped type in particularmight think of each other  whatever he had come out for he hadnt come to go into that so that he absolutely took up nothing his interlocutress had now let drop  yet though he had kept away from her for days had laid wholly on herself the burden of their meeting again she hadnt a gleam of irritation to show him  well about jeanne now she smiledit had the gaiety with which she had originally come in he felt it on the instant to represent her motive and real errand but he had been schooling her of a truth to say much in proportion to his little  do you make out that she has a sentiment  i mean for mr newsome  almost resentful strether could at last be prompt  how can i make out such things  she remained perfectly goodnatured  ah but theyre beautiful little things and you make outdont pretendeverything in the world havent you she asked been talking with her  yes but not about chad  at least not much  oh you dont require much she reassuringly declared  but she immediately changed her ground  i hope you remember your promise of the other day  to save you as you called it  i call it so still  you will she insisted  you havent repented  he wondered  nobut ive been thinking what i meant  she kept it up  and not a little what i did  nothats not necessary  it will be enough if i know what i meant myself  and dont you know she asked by this time  again he had a pause  i think you ought to leave it to me but how long he added do you give me  it seems to me much more a question of how long you give me doesnt our friend here himself at any rate she went on perpetually make me present to you  not strether replied by ever speaking of you to me  he never does that  never  she considered and if the fact was disconcerting to her effectually concealed it  the next minute indeed she had recovered no he wouldnt  but do you need that  her emphasis was wonderful and though his eyes had been wandering he looked at her longer now  i see what you mean  of course you see what i mean  her triumph was gentle and she really had tones to make justice weep ive before me what he owes you  admit then that thats something she said yet still with the same discretion in her pride  he took in this note but went straight on  youve made of him what i see but what i dont see is how in the world youve done it  ah thats another question she smiled  the point is of what use is your declining to know me when to know mr newsomeas you do me the honour to find himis just to know me  i see he mused still with his eyes on her  i shouldnt have met you tonight  she raised and dropped her linked hands  it doesnt matter  if i trust you why cant you a little trust me too  and why cant you also she asked in another tone trust yourself  but she gave him no time to reply  oh i shall be so easy for you and im glad at any rate youve seen my child  im glad too he said but she does you no good  no goodmadame de vionnet had a clear stare  why shes an angel of light  thats precisely the reason  leave her alone  dont try to find out i mean he explained about what you spoke to me ofthe way she feels  his companion wondered  because one really wont  well because i ask you as a favour to myself not to  shes the most charming creature ive ever seen  therefore dont touch her dont knowdont want to know  and moreoveryesyou wont  it was an appeal of a sudden and she took it in  as a favour to you  wellsince you ask me  anything everything you ask she smiled  i shant know thennever thank you she added with peculiar gentleness as she turned away  the sound of it lingered with him making him fairly feel as if he had been tripped up and had a fall  in the very act of arranging with her for his independence he had under pressure from a particular perception inconsistently quite stupidly committed himself and with her subtlety sensitive on the spot to an advantage she had driven in by a single word a little golden nail the sharp intention of which he signally felt  he hadnt detached he had more closely connected himself and his eyes as he considered with some intensity this circumstance met another pair which had just come within their range and which struck him as reflecting his sense of what he had done  he recognised them at the same moment as those of little bilham who had apparently drawn near on purpose to speak to him and little bilham wasnt in the conditions the person to whom his heart would be most closed they were seated together a minute later at the angle of the room obliquely opposite the corner in which gloriani was still engaged with jeanne de vionnet to whom at first and in silence their attention had been benevolently given  i cant see for my life strether had then observed how a young fellow of any spiritsuch a one as you for instancecan be admitted to the sight of that young lady without being hard hit  why dont you go in little bilham  he remembered the tone into which he had been betrayed on the gardenbench at the sculptors reception and this might make up for that by being much more the right sort of thing to say to a young man worthy of any advice at all there would be some reason  some reason for what  why for hanging on here  to offer my hand and fortune to mademoiselle de vionnet  well strether asked to what lovelier apparition could you offer them  shes the sweetest little thing ive ever seen  shes certainly immense  i mean shes the real thing  i believe the pale pink petals are folded up there for some wondrous efflorescence in time to open that is to some great golden sun im unfortunately but a small farthing candle  what chance in such a field for a poor little painterman  oh youre good enough strether threw out  certainly im good enough  were good enough i consider nous autres for anything  but shes too good  theres the difference they wouldnt look at me  strether lounging on his divan and still charmed by the young girl whose eyes had consciously strayed to him he fancied with a vague smilestrether enjoying the whole occasion as with dormant pulses at last awake and in spite of new material thrust upon him thought over his companions words  whom do you mean by they she and her mother  she and her mother  and she has a father too who whatever else he may be certainly cant be indifferent to the possibilities she represents  besides theres chad  strether was silent a little  ah but he doesnt care for hernot i mean it appears after all in the sense im speaking of  hes not in love with her  nobut hes her best friend after her mother  hes very fond of her  he has his ideas about what can be done for her  well its very strange strether presently remarked with a sighing sense of fulness  very strange indeed  thats just the beauty of it  isnt it very much the kind of beauty you had in mind little bilham went on when you were so wonderful and so inspiring to me the other day didnt you adjure me in accents i shall never forget to see while ive a chance everything i canand really to see for it must have been that only you meant  well you did me no end of good and im doing my best  i do make it out a situation  so do i strether went on after a moment  but he had the next minute an inconsequent question  how comes chad so mixed up anyway  ah ah ahand little bilham fell back on his cushions  it reminded our friend of miss barrace and he felt again the brush of his sense of moving in a maze of mystic closed allusions  yet he kept hold of his thread  of course i understand really only the general transformation makes me occasionally gasp  chad with such a voice in the settlement of the future of a little countessno he declared it takes more time you say moreover he resumed that were inevitably people like you and me out of the running  the curious fact remains that chad himself isnt  the situation doesnt make for it but in a different one he could have her if he would  yes but thats only because hes rich and because theres a possibility of his being richer  they wont think of anything but a great name or a great fortune  well said strether hell have no great fortune on these lines he must stir his stumps  is that little bilham enquired what you were saying to madame de vionnet  noi dont say much to her  of course however strether continued he can make sacrifices if he likes  little bilham had a pause  oh hes not keen for sacrifices or thinks that is possibly that he has made enough  well it is virtuous his companion observed with some decision  thats exactly the young man dropped after a moment what i mean  it kept strether himself silent a little  ive made it out for myself he then went on ive really within the last halfhour got hold of it  i understand it in short at last which at firstwhen you originally spoke to mei didnt  nor when chad originally spoke to me either  oh said little bilham i dont think that at that time you believed me  yesi did and i believed chad too  it would have been odious and unmannerlyas well as quite perverseif i hadnt  what interest have you in deceiving me  the young man cast about  what interest have i  yes  chad might have  but you  ah ah ah little bilham exclaimed  it might on repetition as a mystification have irritated our friend a little but he knew once more as we have seen where he was and his being proof against everything was only another attestation that he meant to stay there  i couldnt without my own impression realise shes a tremendously clever brilliant capable woman and with an extraordinary charm on top of it allthe charm we surely all of us this evening know what to think of it isnt every clever brilliant capable woman that has it  in fact its rare with any woman  so there you are strether proceeded as if not for little bilhams benefit alone  i understand what a relation with such a womanwhat such a high fine friendshipmay be  it cant be vulgar or coarse anywayand thats the point  yes thats the point said little bilham  it cant be vulgar or coarse  and bless us and save us it isnt  its upon my word the very finest thing i ever saw in my life and the most distinguished  strether from beside him and leaning back with him as he leaned dropped on him a momentary look which filled a short interval and of which he took no notice  he only gazed before him with intent participation  of course what it has done for him strether at all events presently pursued of course what it has done for himthat is as to how it has so wonderfully workedisnt a thing i pretend to understand  ive to take it as i find it  there he is  there he is little bilham echoed  and its really and truly she i dont understand either even with my longer and closer opportunity but im like you he added i can admire and rejoice even when im a little in the dark  you see ive watched it for some three years and especially for this last  he wasnt so bad before it as i seem to have made out that you think  oh i dont think anything now strether impatiently broke in that is but what i do think i mean that originally for her to have cared for him  there must have been stuff in him  oh yes there was stuff indeed and much more of it than ever showed i dare say at home  still you know the young man in all fairness developed there was room for her and thats where she came in  she saw her chance and took it thats what strikes me as having been so fine  but of course he wound up he liked her first  naturally said strether  i mean that they first met somehow and somewherei believe in some american houseand she without in the least then intending it made her impression  then with time and opportunity he made his and after that she was as bad as he  strether vaguely took it up  as bad  she began that is to careto care very much  alone and in her horrid position she found it when once she had started an interest it was it is an interest and it didit continues to doa lot for herself as well  so she still cares  she cares in fact said little bilham thoughtfully more  strethers theory that it was none of his business was somehow not damaged by the way he took this  more you mean than he  on which his companion looked round at him and now for an instant their eyes met  more than he he repeated  little bilham for as long hung fire  will you never tell any one  strether thought  whom should i tell  why i supposed you reported regularly  to people at homestrether took him up  well i wont tell them this  the young man at last looked away  then she does now care more than he  oh strether oddly exclaimed  but his companion immediately met it  havent you after all had your impression of it  thats how youve got hold of him  ah but i havent got hold of him  oh i say  but it was all little bilham said  its at any rate none of my business  i mean strether explained nothing else than getting hold of him is  it appeared however to strike him as his business to add  the fact remains nevertheless that she has saved him  little bilham just waited  i thought that was what you were to do  but strether had his answer ready  im speakingin connexion with herof his manners and morals his character and life  im speaking of him as a person to deal with and talk with and live withspeaking of him as a social animal  and isnt it as a social animal that you also want him  certainly so that its as if she had saved him for us  it strikes you accordingly then the young man threw out as for you all to save her  oh for us all strether could but laugh at that  it brought him back however to the point he had really wished to make theyve accepted their situationhard as it is  theyre not freeat least shes not but they take whats left to them  its a friendship of a beautiful sort and thats what makes them so strong  theyre straight they feel and they keep each other up its doubtless she however who as you yourself have hinted feels it most  little bilham appeared to wonder what he had hinted  feels most that theyre straight  well feels that she is and the strength that comes from it  she keeps him upshe keeps the whole thing up  when people are able to its fine  shes wonderful wonderful as miss barrace says and he is in his way too however as a mere man he may sometimes rebel and not feel that he finds his account in it  she has simply given him an immense moral lift and what that can explain is prodigious thats why i speak of it as a situation  it is one if there ever was  and strether with his head back and his eyes on the ceiling seemed to lose himself in the vision of it  his companion attended deeply  you state it much better than i could oh you see it doesnt concern you  little bilham considered  i thought you said just now that it doesnt concern you either  well it doesnt a bit as madame de vionnets affair  but as we were again saying just now what did i come out for but to save him  yesto remove him  to save him by removal to win him over to himself thinking it best he shall take up businessthinking he must immediately do therefore whats necessary to that end  well said little bilham after a moment you have won him over he does think it best  he has within a day or two again said to me as much  and that strether asked is why you consider that he cares less than she  cares less for her than she for him  yes thats one of the reasons but other things too have given me the impression  a man dont you think little bilham presently pursued cant in such conditions care so much as a woman  it takes different conditions to make him and then perhaps he cares more  chad he wound up has his possible future before him  are you speaking of his business future  noon the contrary of the other the future of what you so justly call their situation  m de vionnet may live for ever  so that they cant marry  the young man waited a moment  not being able to marry is all theyve with any confidence to look forward to  a womana particular womanmay stand that strain  but can a man he propounded  strethers answer was as prompt as if he had already for himself worked it out  not without a very high ideal of conduct  but thats just what were attributing to chad  and how for that matter he mused does his going to america diminish the particular strain wouldnt it seem rather to add to it  out of sight out of mind his companion laughed  then more bravely wouldnt distance lessen the torment  but before strether could reply the thing is you see chad ought to marry he wound up  strether for a little appeared to think of it  if you talk of torments you dont diminish mine he then broke out  the next moment he was on his feet with a question  he ought to marry whom  little bilham rose more slowly  well some one he cansome thoroughly nice girl  strethers eyes as they stood together turned again to jeanne do you mean her  his friend made a sudden strange face  after being in love with her mother  no  but isnt it exactly your idea that he isnt in love with her mother  his friend once more had a pause  well he isnt at any rate in love with jeanne  i dare say not  how can he be with any other woman  oh that i admit  but being in love isnt you know herelittle bilham spoke in friendly reminderthought necessary in strictness for marriage  and what tormentto call a tormentcan there ever possibly be with a woman like that  as if from the interest of his own question strether had gone on without hearing  is it for her to have turned a man out so wonderfully too only for somebody else he appeared to make a point of this and little bilham looked at him now  when its for each other that people give things up they dont miss them  then he threw off as with an extravagance of which he was conscious let them face the future together  little bilham looked at him indeed  you mean that after all he shouldnt go back  i mean that if he gives her up  yes  well he ought to be ashamed of himself  but strether spoke with a sound that might have passed for a laugh      volume ii  book seventh     i   it wasnt the first time strether had sat alone in the great dim churchstill less was it the first of his giving himself up so far as conditions permitted to its beneficent action on his nerves  he had been to notre dame with waymarsh he had been there with miss gostrey he had been there with chad newsome and had found the place even in company such a refuge from the obsession of his problem that with renewed pressure from that source he had not unnaturally recurred to a remedy meeting the case for the moment so indirectly no doubt but so relievingly  he was conscious enough that it was only for the moment but good momentsif he could call them goodstill had their value for a man who by this time struck himself as living almost disgracefully from hand to mouth  having so well learnt the way he had lately made the pilgrimage more than once by himselfhad quite stolen off taking an unnoticed chance and making no point of speaking of the adventure when restored to his friends  his great friend for that matter was still absent as well as remarkably silent even at the end of three weeks miss gostrey hadnt come back  she wrote to him from mentone admitting that he must judge her grossly inconsequentperhaps in fact for the time odiously faithless but asking for patience for a deferred sentence throwing herself in short on his generosity  for her too she could assure him life was complicatedmore complicated than he could have guessed she had moreover made certain of himcertain of not wholly missing him on her returnbefore her disappearance  if furthermore she didnt burden him with letters it was frankly because of her sense of the other great commerce he had to carry on  he himself at the end of a fortnight had written twice to show how his generosity could be trusted but he reminded himself in each case of mrs newsomes epistolary manner at the times when mrs newsome kept off delicate ground  he sank his problem he talked of waymarsh and miss barrace of little bilham and the set over the river with whom he had again had tea and he was easy for convenience about chad and madame de vionnet and jeanne  he admitted that he continued to see them he was decidedly so confirmed a haunter of chads premises and that young mans practical intimacy with them was so undeniably great but he had his reason for not attempting to render for miss gostreys benefit the impression of these last days that would be to tell her too much about himselfit being at present just from himself he was trying to escape  this small struggle sprang not a little in its way from the same impulse that had now carried him across to notre dame the impulse to let things be to give them time to justify themselves or at least to pass  he was aware of having no errand in such a place but the desire not to be for the hour in certain other places a sense of safety of simplification which each time he yielded to it he amused himself by thinking of as a private concession to cowardice  the great church had no altar for his worship no direct voice for his soul but it was none the less soothing even to sanctity for he could feel while there what he couldnt elsewhere that he was a plain tired man taking the holiday he had earned  he was tired but he wasnt plainthat was the pity and the trouble of it he was able however to drop his problem at the door very much as if it had been the copper piece that he deposited on the threshold in the receptacle of the inveterate blind beggar  he trod the long dim nave sat in the splendid choir paused before the cluttered chapels of the east end and the mighty monument laid upon him its spell  he might have been a student under the charm of a museumwhich was exactly what in a foreign town in the afternoon of life he would have liked to be free to be  this form of sacrifice did at any rate for the occasion as well as another it made him quite sufficiently understand how within the precinct for the real refugee the things of the world could fall into abeyance  that was the cowardice probablyto dodge them to beg the question not to deal with it in the hard outer light but his own oblivions were too brief too vain to hurt any one but himself and he had a vague and fanciful kindness for certain persons whom he met figures of mystery and anxiety and whom with observation for his pastime he ranked as those who were fleeing from justice  justice was outside in the hard light and injustice too but one was as absent as the other from the air of the long aisles and the brightness of the many altars  thus it was at all events that one morning some dozen days after the dinner in the boulevard malesherbes at which madame de vionnet had been present with her daughter he was called upon to play his part in an encounter that deeply stirred his imagination  he had the habit in these contemplations of watching a fellow visitant here and there from a respectable distance remarking some note of behaviour of penitence of prostration of the absolved relieved state this was the manner in which his vague tenderness took its course the degree of demonstration to which it naturally had to confine itself  it hadnt indeed so felt its responsibility as when on this occasion he suddenly measured the suggestive effect of a lady whose supreme stillness in the shade of one of the chapels he had two or three times noticed as he made and made once more his slow circuit  she wasnt prostratenot in any degree bowed but she was strangely fixed and her prolonged immobility showed her while he passed and paused as wholly given up to the need whatever it was that had brought her there  she only sat and gazed before her as he himself often sat but she had placed herself as he never did within the focus of the shrine and she had lost herself he could easily see as he would only have liked to do she was not a wandering alien keeping back more than she gave but one of the familiar the intimate the fortunate for whom these dealings had a method and a meaning  she reminded our friendsince it was the way of nine tenths of his current impressions to act as recalls of things imaginedof some fine firm concentrated heroine of an old story something he had heard read something that had he had a hand for drama he might himself have written renewing her courage renewing her clearness in splendidlyprotected meditation  her back as she sat was turned to him but his impression absolutely required that she should be young and interesting and she carried her head moreover even in the sacred shade with a discernible faith in herself a kind of implied conviction of consistency security impunity  but what had such a woman come for if she hadnt come to pray  strethers reading of such matters was it must be owned confused but he wondered if her attitude were some congruous fruit of absolution of indulgence  he knew but dimly what indulgence in such a place might mean yet he had as with a soft sweep a vision of how it might indeed add to the zest of active rites  all this was a good deal to have been denoted by a mere lurking figure who was nothing to him but the last thing before leaving the church he had the surprise of a still deeper quickening  he had dropped upon a seat halfway down the nave and again in the museum mood was trying with head thrown back and eyes aloft to reconstitute a past to reduce it in fact to the convenient terms of victor hugo whom a few days before giving the rein for once in a way to the joy of life he had purchased in seventy bound volumes a miracle of cheapness parted with he was assured by the shopman at the price of the redandgold alone  he looked doubtless while he played his eternal nippers over gothic glooms sufficiently rapt in reverence but what his thought had finally bumped against was the question of where among packed accumulations so multiform a wedge would be able to enter  were seventy volumes in redandgold to be perhaps what he should most substantially have to show at woollett as the fruit of his mission  it was a possibility that held him a minuteheld him till he happened to feel that some one unnoticed had approached him and paused  turning he saw that a lady stood there as for a greeting and he sprang up as he next took her securely for madame de vionnet who appeared to have recognised him as she passed near him on her way to the door  she checked quickly and gaily a certain confusion in him came to meet it turned it back by an art of her own the confusion having threatened him as he knew her for the person he had lately been observing  she was the lurking figure of the dim chapel she had occupied him more than she guessed but it came to him in time luckily that he neednt tell her and that no harm after all had been done  she herself for that matter straightway showing she felt their encounter as the happiest of accidents had for him a you come here too that despoiled surprise of every awkwardness  i come often she said  i love this place but im terrible in general for churches  the old women who live in them all know me in fact im already myself one of the old women  its like that at all events that i foresee i shall end  looking about for a chair so that he instantly pulled one nearer she sat down with him again to the sound of an oh i like so much your also being fond  he confessed the extent of his feeling though she left the object vague and he was struck with the tact the taste of her vagueness which simply took for granted in him a sense of beautiful things he was conscious of how much it was affected this sense by something subdued and discreet in the way she had arranged herself for her special object and her morning walkhe believed her to have come on foot the way her slightly thicker veil was drawna mere touch but everything the composed gravity of her dress in which here and there a dull winecolour seemed to gleam faintly through black the charming discretion of her small compact head the quiet note as she sat of her folded greygloved hands  it was to strethers mind as if she sat on her own ground the light honours of which at an open gate she thus easily did him while all the vastness and mystery of the domain stretched off behind when people were so completely in possession they could be extraordinarily civil and our friend had indeed at this hour a kind of revelation of her heritage  she was romantic for him far beyond what she could have guessed and again he found his small comfort in the conviction that subtle though she was his impression must remain a secret from her  the thing that once more made him uneasy for secrets in general was this particular patience she could have with his own want of colour albeit that on the other hand his uneasiness pretty well dropped after he had been for ten minutes as colourless as possible and at the same time as responsive  the moments had already for that matter drawn their deepest tinge from the special interest excited in him by his vision of his companions identity with the person whose attitude before the glimmering altar had so impressed him  this attitude fitted admirably into the stand he had privately taken about her connexion with chad on the last occasion of his seeing them together  it helped him to stick fast at the point he had then reached it was there he had resolved that he would stick and at no moment since had it seemed as easy to do so  unassailably innocent was a relation that could make one of the parties to it so carry herself if it wasnt innocent why did she haunt the churchesinto which given the woman he could believe he made out she would never have come to flaunt an insolence of guilt  she haunted them for continued help for strength for peacesublime support which if one were able to look at it so she found from day to day  they talked in low easy tones and with lifted lingering looks about the great monument and its history and its beautyall of which madame de vionnet professed came to her most in the other the outer view  well presently after we go she said walk round it again if you like  im not in a particular hurry and it will be pleasant to look at it well with you  he had spoken of the great romancer and the great romance and of what to his imagination they had done for the whole mentioning to her moreover the exorbitance of his purchase the seventy blazing volumes that were so out of proportion  out of proportion to what  well to any other plunge  yet he felt even as he spoke how at that instant he was plunging  he had made up his mind and was impatient to get into the air for his purpose was a purpose to be uttered outside and he had a fear that it might with delay still slip away from him she however took her time she drew out their quiet gossip as if she had wished to profit by their meeting and this confirmed precisely an interpretation of her manner of her mystery  while she rose as he would have called it to the question of victor hugo her voice itself the light low quaver of her deference to the solemnity about them seemed to make her words mean something that they didnt mean openly help strength peace a sublime supportshe hadnt found so much of these things as that the amount wouldnt be sensibly greater for any scrap his appearance of faith in her might enable her to feel in her hand every little in a long strain helped and if he happened to affect her as a firm object she could hold on by he wouldnt jerk himself out of her reach  people in difficulties held on by what was nearest and he was perhaps after all not further off than sources of comfort more abstract  it was as to this he had made up his mind he had made it up that is to give her a sign  the sign would be thatthough it was her own affairhe understood the sign would be thatthough it was her own affairshe was free to clutch  since she took him for a firm objectmuch as he might to his own sense appear at times to rockhe would do his best to be one  the end of it was that half an hour later they were seated together for an early luncheon at a wonderful a delightful house of entertainment on the left banka place of pilgrimage for the knowing they were both aware the knowing who came for its great renown the homage of restless days from the other end of the town  strether had already been there three timesfirst with miss gostrey then with chad then with chad again and with waymarsh and little bilham all of whom he had himself sagaciously entertained and his pleasure was deep now on learning that madame de vionnet hadnt yet been initiated  when he had said as they strolled round the church by the river acting at last on what within he had made up his mind to will you if you have time come to dejeuner with me somewhere  for instance if you know it over there on the other side which is so easy a walkand then had named the place when he had done this she stopped short as for quick intensity and yet deep difficulty of response  she took in the proposal as if it were almost too charming to be true and there had perhaps never yet been for her companion so unexpected a moment of prideso fine so odd a case at any rate as his finding himself thus able to offer to a person in such universal possession a new a rare amusement  she had heard of the happy spot but she asked him in reply to a further question how in the world he could suppose her to have been there  he supposed himself to have supposed that chad might have taken her and she guessed this the next moment to his no small discomfort  ah let me explain she smiled that i dont go about with him in public i never have such chancesnot having them otherwiseand its just the sort of thing that as a quiet creature living in my hole i adore  it was more than kind of him to have thought of itthough frankly if he asked whether she had time she hadnt a single minute that however made no differenceshed throw everything over  every duty at home domestic maternal social awaited her but it was a case for a high line  her affairs would go to smash but hadnt one a right to ones snatch of scandal when one was prepared to pay  it was on this pleasant basis of costly disorder consequently that they eventually seated themselves on either side of a small table at a window adjusted to the busy quay and the shining bargeburdened seine where for an hour in the matter of letting himself go of diving deep strether was to feel he had touched bottom  he was to feel many things on this occasion and one of the first of them was that he had travelled far since that evening in london before the theatre when his dinner with maria gostrey between the pinkshaded candles had struck him as requiring so many explanations  he had at that time gathered them in the explanationshe had stored them up but it was at present as if he had either soared above or sunk below themhe couldnt tell which he could somehow think of none that didnt seem to leave the appearance of collapse and cynicism easier for him than lucidity  how could he wish it to be lucid for others for any one that he for the hour saw reasons enough in the mere way the bright clean ordered waterside life came in at the open windowthe mere way madame de vionnet opposite him over their intensely white tablelinen their omelette aux tomates their bottle of strawcoloured chablis thanked him for everything almost with the smile of a child while her grey eyes moved in and out of their talk back to the quarter of the warm spring air in which early summer had already begun to throb and then back again to his face and their human questions  their human questions became many before they had donemany more as one after the other came up than our friends free fancy had at all foreseen  the sense he had had before the sense he had had repeatedly the sense that the situation was running away with him had never been so sharp as now and all the more that he could perfectly put his finger on the moment it had taken the bit in its teeth  that accident had definitely occurred the other evening after chads dinner it had occurred as he fully knew at the moment when he interposed between this lady and her child when he suffered himself so to discuss with her a matter closely concerning them that her own subtlety marked by its significant thank you instantly sealed the occasion in her favour  again he had held off for ten days but the situation had continued out of hand in spite of that the fact that it was running so fast being indeed just why he had held off  what had come over him as he recognised her in the nave of the church was that holding off could be but a losing game from the instant she was worked for not only by her subtlety but by the hand of fate itself  if all the accidents were to fight on her sideand by the actual showing they loomed largehe could only give himself up  this was what he had done in privately deciding then and there to propose she should breakfast with him what did the success of his proposal in fact resemble but the smash in which a regular runaway properly ends  the smash was their walk their dejeuner their omelette the chablis the place the view their present talk and his present pleasure in itto say nothing wonder of wonders of her own  to this tune and nothing less accordingly was his surrender made good  it sufficiently lighted up at least the folly of holding off  ancient proverbs sounded for his memory in the tone of their words and the clink of their glasses in the hum of the town and the plash of the river  it was clearly better to suffer as a sheep than as a lamb  one might as well perish by the sword as by famine  marias still awaythat was the first thing she had asked him and when he had found the frankness to be cheerful about it in spite of the meaning he knew her to attach to miss gostreys absence she had gone on to enquire if he didnt tremendously miss her  there were reasons that made him by no means sure yet he nevertheless answered tremendously which she took in as if it were all she had wished to prove  then a man in trouble must be possessed somehow of a woman she said if she doesnt come in one way she comes in another  why do you call me a man in trouble  ah because thats the way you strike me  she spoke ever so gently and as if with all fear of wounding him while she sat partaking of his bounty  arent you in trouble  he felt himself colour at the question and then hated thathated to pass for anything so idiotic as woundable  woundable by chads lady in respect to whom he had come out with such a fund of indifferencewas he already at that point  perversely none the less his pause gave a strange air of truth to her supposition and what was he in fact but disconcerted at having struck her just in the way he had most dreamed of not doing  im not in trouble yet he at last smiled  im not in trouble now  well im always so  but that you sufficiently know  she was a woman who between courses could be graceful with her elbows on the table  it was a posture unknown to mrs newsome but it was easy for a femme du monde  yesi am now  there was a question you put to me he presently returned the night of chads dinner  i didnt answer it then and it has been very handsome of you not to have sought an occasion for pressing me about it since  she was instantly all there  of course i know what you allude to i asked you what you had meant by saying the day you came to see me just before you left me that youd save me  and you then saidat our friendsthat youd have really to wait to see for yourself what you did mean  yes i asked for time said strether  and it sounds now as you put it like a very ridiculous speech  oh she murmuredshe was full of attenuation  but she had another thought  if it does sound ridiculous why do you deny that youre in trouble  ah if i were he replied it wouldnt be the trouble of fearing ridicule  i dont fear it  what then do you  nothingnow  and he leaned back in his chair  i like your now she laughed across at him  well its precisely that it fully comes to me at present that ive kept you long enough  i know by this time at any rate what i meant by my speech and i really knew it the night of chads dinner  then why didnt you tell me  because it was difficult at the moment  i had already at that moment done something for you in the sense of what i had said the day i went to see you but i wasnt then sure of the importance i might represent this as having  she was all eagerness  and youre sure now  yes i see that practically ive done for youhad done for you when you put me your questionall that its as yet possible to me to do  i feel now he went on that it may go further than i thought  what i did after my visit to you he explained was to write straight off to mrs newsome about you and im at last from one day to the other expecting her answer  its this answer that will represent as i believe the consequences  patient and beautiful was her interest  i seethe consequences of your speaking for me  and she waited as if not to hustle him  he acknowledged it by immediately going on  the question you understand was how i should save you  well im trying it by thus letting her know that i consider you worth saving  i seei see  her eagerness broke through  how can i thank you enough  he couldnt tell her that however and she quickly pursued  you do really for yourself consider it  his only answer at first was to help her to the dish that had been freshly put before them  ive written to her again since thenive left her in no doubt of what i think  ive told her all about you  thanksnot so much  all about me she went onyes  all it seems to me youve done for him  ah and you might have added all it seems to me  she laughed again while she took up her knife and fork as in the cheer of these assurances  but youre not sure how shell take it  no ill not pretend im sure  voila  and she waited a moment  i wish youd tell me about her  oh said strether with a slightly strained smile all that need concern you about her is that shes really a grand person  madame de vionnet seemed to demur  is that all that need concern me about her  but strether neglected the question  hasnt chad talked to you  of his mother  yes a great dealimmensely  but not from your point of view  he cant our friend returned have said any ill of her  not the least bit  he has given me like you the assurance that shes really grand  but her being really grand is somehow just what hasnt seemed to simplify our case  nothing she continued is further from me than to wish to say a word against her but of course i feel how little she can like being told of her owing me anything  no woman ever enjoys such an obligation to another woman  this was a proposition strether couldnt contradict  and yet what other way could i have expressed to her what i felt  its what there was most to say about you  do you mean then that she will be good to me  its what im waiting to see  but ive little doubt she would he added if she could comfortably see you  it seemed to strike her as a happy a beneficent thought  oh then couldnt that be managed  wouldnt she come out  wouldnt she if you so put it to her  did you by any possibility she faintly quavered  oh nohe was prompt  not that  it would be much more to give an account of you thatsince theres no question of your paying the visiti should go home first  it instantly made her graver  and are you thinking of that  oh all the while naturally  stay with usstay with us she exclaimed on this  thats your only way to make sure  to make sure of what  why that he doesnt break up  you didnt come out to do that to him  doesnt it depend strether returned after a moment on what you mean by breaking up  oh you know well enough what i mean  his silence seemed again for a little to denote an understanding you take for granted remarkable things  yes i doto the extent that i dont take for granted vulgar ones youre perfectly capable of seeing that what you came out for wasnt really at all to do what youd now have to do  ah its perfectly simple strether goodhumouredly pleaded  ive had but one thing to doto put our case before him  to put it as it could only be put here on the spotby personal pressure  my dear lady he lucidly pursued my work you see is really done and my reasons for staying on even another day are none of the best  chads in possession of our case and professes to do it full justice  what remains is with himself  ive had my rest my amusement and refreshment ive had as we say at woollett a lovely time  nothing in it has been more lovely than this happy meeting with youin these fantastic conditions to which youve so delightfully consented  ive a sense of success  its what i wanted  my getting all this good is what chad has waited for and i gather that if im ready to go hes the same  she shook her head with a finer deeper wisdom  youre not ready if youre ready why did you write to mrs newsome in the sense youve mentioned to me  strether considered  i shant go before i hear from her  youre too much afraid of her he added  it produced between them a long look from which neither shrank  i dont think you believe thatbelieve ive not really reason to fear her  shes capable of great generosity strether presently stated  well then let her trust me a little  thats all i ask  let her recognise in spite of everything what ive done  ah remember our friend replied that she cant effectually recognise it without seeing it for herself  let chad go over and show her what youve done and let him plead with her there for it and as it were for you  she measured the depth of this suggestion  do you give me your word of honour that if she once has him there she wont do her best to marry him  it made her companion this enquiry look again a while out at the view after which he spoke without sharpness  when she sees for herself what he is  but she had already broken in  its when she sees for herself what he is that shell want to marry him most  strethers attitude that of due deference to what she said permitted him to attend for a minute to his luncheon  i doubt if that will come off  it wont be easy to make it  it will be easy if he remains thereand hell remain for the money the money appears to be as a probability so hideously much  well strether presently concluded nothing could really hurt you but his marrying  she gave a strange light laugh  putting aside what may really hurt him  but her friend looked at her as if he had thought of that too the question will come up of course of the future that you yourself offer him  she was leaning back now but she fully faced him  well let it come up  the point is that its for chad to make of it what he can  his being proof against marriage will show what he does make  if he is proof yesshe accepted the proposition  but for myself she added the question is what you make  ah i make nothing  its not my affair  i beg your pardon  its just there that since youve taken it up and are committed to it it most intensely becomes yours  youre not saving me i take it for your interest in myself but for your interest in our friend  the ones at any rate wholly dependent on the other  you cant in honour not see me through she wound up because you cant in honour not see him  strange and beautiful to him was her quiet soft acuteness  the thing that most moved him was really that she was so deeply serious  she had none of the portentous forms of it but he had never come in contact it struck him with a force brought to so fine a head  mrs newsome goodness knew was serious but it was nothing to this  he took it all in he saw it all together  no he mused i cant in honour not see him  her face affected him as with an exquisite light  you will then  i will  at this she pushed back her chair and was the next moment on her feet thank you she said with her hand held out to him across the table and with no less a meaning in the words than her lips had so particularly given them after chads dinner  the golden nail she had then driven in pierced a good inch deeper  yet he reflected that he himself had only meanwhile done what he had made up his mind to on the same occasion  so far as the essence of the matter went he had simply stood fast on the spot on which he had then planted his feet    ii   he received three days after this a communication from america in the form of a scrap of blue paper folded and gummed not reaching him through his bankers but delivered at his hotel by a small boy in uniform who under instructions from the concierge approached him as he slowly paced the little court  it was the evening hour but daylight was long now and paris more than ever penetrating  the scent of flowers was in the streets he had the whiff of violets perpetually in his nose and he had attached himself to sounds and suggestions vibrations of the air human and dramatic he imagined as they were not in other places that came out for him more and more as the mild afternoons deepeneda faroff hum a sharp near click on the asphalt a voice calling replying somewhere and as full of tone as an actors in a play  he was to dine at home as usual with waymarshthey had settled to that for thrift and simplicity and he now hung about before his friend came down  he read his telegram in the court standing still a long time where he had opened it and giving five minutes afterwards to the renewed study of it  at last quickly he crumpled it up as if to get it out of the way in spite of which however he kept it therestill kept it when at the end of another turn he had dropped into a chair placed near a small table  here with his scrap of paper compressed in his fist and further concealed by his folding his arms tight he sat for some time in thought gazed before him so straight that waymarsh appeared and approached him without catching his eye  the latter in fact struck with his appearance looked at him hard for a single instant and then as if determined to that course by some special vividness in it dropped back into the salon de lecture without addressing him  but the pilgrim from milrose permitted himself still to observe the scene from behind the clear glass plate of that retreat  strether ended as he sat by a fresh scrutiny of his compressed missive which he smoothed out carefully again as he placed it on his table  there it remained for some minutes until at last looking up he saw waymarsh watching him from within  it was on this that their eyes metmet for a moment during which neither moved  but strether then got up folding his telegram more carefully and putting it into his waistcoat pocket  a few minutes later the friends were seated together at dinner but strether had meanwhile said nothing about it and they eventually parted after coffee in the court with nothing said on either side our friend had moreover the consciousness that even less than usual was on this occasion said between them so that it was almost as if each had been waiting for something from the other  waymarsh had always more or less the air of sitting at the door of his tent and silence after so many weeks had come to play its part in their concert  this note indeed to strethers sense had lately taken a fuller tone and it was his fancy tonight that they had never quite so drawn it out yet it befell none the less that he closed the door to confidence when his companion finally asked him if there were anything particular the matter with him  nothing he replied more than usual  on the morrow however at an early hour he found occasion to give an answer more in consonance with the facts  what was the matter had continued to be so all the previous evening the first hours of which after dinner in his room he had devoted to the copious composition of a letter  he had quitted waymarsh for this purpose leaving him to his own resources with less ceremony than their wont but finally coming down again with his letter unconcluded and going forth into the streets without enquiry for his comrade  he had taken a long vague walk and one oclock had struck before his return and his reascent to his room by the aid of the glimmering candleend left for him on the shelf outside the porters lodge  he had possessed himself on closing his door of the numerous loose sheets of his unfinished composition and then without reading them over had torn them into small pieces  he had thereupon sleptas if it had been in some measure thanks to that sacrificethe sleep of the just and had prolonged his rest considerably beyond his custom  thus it was that when between nine and ten the tap of the knob of a walkingstick sounded on his door he had not yet made himself altogether presentable  chad newsomes bright deep voice determined quickly enough none the less the admission of the visitor  the little blue paper of the evening before plainly an object the more precious for its escape from premature destruction now lay on the sill of the open window smoothed out afresh and kept from blowing away by the superincumbent weight of his watch chad looking about with careless and competent criticism as he looked wherever he went immediately espied it and permitted himself to fix it for a moment rather hard  after which he turned his eyes to his host  it has come then at last  strether paused in the act of pinning his necktie  then you know youve had one too  no ive had nothing and i only know what i see  i see that thing and i guess  well he added it comes as pat as in a play for ive precisely turned up this morningas i would have done yesterday but it was impossibleto take you  to take me  strether had turned again to his glass  back at last as i promised  im readyive really been ready this month  ive only been waiting for youas was perfectly right but youre better now youre safei see that for myself youve got all your good  youre looking this morning as fit as a flea  strether at his glass finished dressing consulting that witness moreover on this last opinion  was he looking preternaturally fit there was something in it perhaps for chads wonderful eye but he had felt himself for hours rather in pieces  such a judgement however was after all but a contribution to his resolve it testified unwittingly to his wisdom  he was still firmer apparentlysince it shone in him as a lightthan he had flattered himself  his firmness indeed was slightly compromised as he faced about to his friend by the way this very personage lookedthough the case would of course have been worse hadnt the secret of personal magnificence been at every hour chads unfailing possession  there he was in all the pleasant morning freshness of itstrong and sleek and gay easy and fragrant and fathomless with happy health in his colour and pleasant silver in his thick young hair and the right word for everything on the lips that his clear brownness caused to show as red  he had never struck strether as personally such a success it was as if now for his definite surrender he had gathered himself vividly together  this sharply and rather strangely was the form in which he was to be presented to woollett  our friend took him in againhe was always taking him in and yet finding that parts of him still remained out though even thus his image showed through a mist of other things ive had a cable strether said from your mother  i dare say my dear man  i hope shes well  strether hesitated  noshes not well im sorry to have to tell you  ah said chad i must have had the instinct of it  all the more reason then that we should start straight off  strether had now got together hat gloves and stick but chad had dropped on the sofa as if to show where he wished to make his point he kept observing his companions things he might have been judging how quickly they could be packed  he might even have wished to hint that hed send his own servant to assist  what do you mean strether enquired by straight off  oh by one of next weeks boats  everything at this season goes out so light that berths will be easy anywhere  strether had in his hand his telegram which he had kept there after attaching his watch and he now offered it to chad who however with an odd movement declined to take it  thanks id rather not  your correspondence with mothers your own affair  im only with you both on it whatever it is  strether at this while their eyes met slowly folded the missive and put it in his pocket after which before he had spoken again chad broke fresh ground has miss gostrey come back  but when strether presently spoke it wasnt in answer  its not i gather that your mothers physically ill her health on the whole this spring seems to have been better than usual  but shes worried shes anxious and it appears to have risen within the last few days to a climax  weve tired out between us her patience  oh it isnt you chad generously protested  i beg your pardonit is me  strether was mild and melancholy but firm  he saw it far away and over his companions head  its very particularly me  well then all the more reason  marchons marchons said the young man gaily  his host however at this but continued to stand agaze and he had the next thing repeated his question of a moment before has miss gostrey come back  yes two days ago  then youve seen her  noim to see her today  but strether wouldnt linger now on miss gostrey  your mother sends me an ultimatum  if i cant bring you im to leave you im to come at any rate myself  ah but you can bring me now chad from his sofa reassuringly replied  strether had a pause  i dont think i understand you  why was it that more than a month ago you put it to me so urgently to let madame de vionnet speak for you  why  chad considered but he had it at his fingers ends  why but because i knew how well shed do it  it was the way to keep you quiet and to that extent do you good  besides he happily and comfortably explained i wanted you really to know her and to get the impression of herand you see the good that has done you  well said strether the way she has spoken for you all the sameso far as ive given her a chancehas only made me feel how much she wishes to keep you  if you make nothing of that i dont see why you wanted me to listen to her  why my dear man chad exclaimed i make everything of it how can you doubt  i doubt only because you come to me this morning with your signal to start  chad stared then gave a laugh  and isnt my signal to start just what youve been waiting for  strether debated he took another turn  this last month ive been awaiting i think more than anything else the message i have here  you mean youve been afraid of it  well i was doing my business in my own way  and i suppose your present announcement strether went on isnt merely the result of your sense of what ive expected  otherwise you wouldnt have put me in relation but he paused pulling up  at this chad rose  ah her wanting me not to go has nothing to do with it its only because shes afraidafraid of the way that over there i may get caught  but her fears groundless  he had met again his companions sufficiently searching look  are you tired of her  chad gave him in reply to this with a movement of the head the strangest slow smile he had ever had from him  never  it had immediately on strethers imagination so deep and soft an effect that our friend could only for the moment keep it before him never  never chad obligingly and serenely repeated  it made his companion take several more steps  then youre not afraid  afraid to go  strether pulled up again  afraid to stay  the young man looked brightly amazed  you want me now to stay  if i dont immediately sail the pococks will immediately come out thats what i mean said strether by your mothers ultimatum   chad showed a still livelier but not an alarmed interest  she has turned on sarah and jim  strether joined him for an instant in the vision  oh and you may be sure mamie  thats whom shes turning on  this also chad sawhe laughed out  mamieto corrupt me  ah said strether shes very charming  so youve already more than once told me  i should like to see her  something happy and easy something above all unconscious in the way he said this brought home again to his companion the facility of his attitude and the enviability of his state  see her then by all means and consider too strether went on that you really give your sister a lift in letting her come to you  you give her a couple of months of paris which she hasnt seen if im not mistaken since just after she was married and which im sure she wants but the pretext to visit  chad listened but with all his own knowledge of the world  she has had it the pretext these several years yet she has never taken it  do you mean you strether after an instant enquired  certainlythe lone exile  and whom do you mean said chad  oh i mean me  im her pretext  that isfor it comes to the same thingim your mothers  then why chad asked doesnt mother come herself  his friend gave him a long look  should you like her to  and as he for the moment said nothing its perfectly open to you to cable for her  chad continued to think  will she come if i do  quite possibly  but try and youll see  why dont you try chad after a moment asked  because i dont want to  chad thought  dont desire her presence here  strether faced the question and his answer was the more emphatic dont put it off my dear boy on me  welli see what you mean  im sure youd behave beautifully but you dont want to see her  so i wont play you that trick  ah strether declared i shouldnt call it a trick  youve a perfect right and it would be perfectly straight of you  then he added in a different tone youd have moreover in the person of madame de vionnet a very interesting relation prepared for her  their eyes on this proposition continued to meet but chads pleasant and bold never flinched for a moment  he got up at last and he said something with which strether was struck  she wouldnt understand her but that makes no difference  madame de vionnet would like to see her  shed like to be charming to her  she believes she could work it  strether thought a moment affected by this but finally turning away she couldnt  youre quite sure chad asked  well risk it if you like  strether who uttered this with serenity had urged a plea for their now getting into the air but the young man still waited  have you sent your answer  no ive done nothing yet  were you waiting to see me  no not that  only waitingand chad with this had a smile for himto see miss gostrey  nonot even miss gostrey  i wasnt waiting to see any one  i had only waited till now to make up my mindin complete solitude and since i of course absolutely owe you the information was on the point of going out with it quite made up  have therefore a little more patience with me  remember strether went on that thats what you originally asked me to have  ive had it you see and you see what has come of it  stay on with me  chad looked grave  how much longer  well till i make you a sign  i cant myself you know at the best or at the worst stay for ever  let the pococks come strether repeated  because it gains you time  yesit gains me time  chad as if it still puzzled him waited a minute  you dont want to get back to mother  not just yet  im not ready  you feel chad asked in a tone of his own the charm of life over here  immensely  strether faced it  youve helped me so to feel it that that surely neednt surprise you  no it doesnt surprise me and im delighted  but what my dear man chad went on with conscious queerness does it all lead to for you  the change of position and of relation for each was so oddly betrayed in the question that chad laughed out as soon as he had uttered itwhich made strether also laugh  well to my having a certitude that has been testedthat has passed through the fire but oh he couldnt help breaking out if within my first month here you had been willing to move with me  well said chad while he broke down as for weight of thought  well we should have been over there by now  ah but you wouldnt have had your fun  i should have had a month of it and im having now if you want to know strether continued enough to last me for the rest of my days  chad looked amused and interested yet still somewhat in the dark partly perhaps because strethers estimate of fun had required of him from the first a good deal of elucidation  it wouldnt do if i left you  left mestrether remained blank  only for a month or twotime to go and come  madame de vionnet chad smiled would look after you in the interval  to go back by yourself i remaining here  again for an instant their eyes had the question out after which strether said grotesque  but i want to see mother chad presently returned  remember how long it is since ive seen mother  long indeed and thats exactly why i was originally so keen for moving you  hadnt you shown us enough how beautifully you could do without it  oh but said chad wonderfully im better now  there was an easy triumph in it that made his friend laugh out again oh if you were worse i should know what to do with you  in that case i believe id have you gagged and strapped down carried on board resisting kicking  how much strether asked do you want to see mother  how muchchad seemed to find it in fact difficult to say  how much  why as much as youve made me  id give anything to see her  and youve left me chad went on in little enough doubt as to how much she wants it  strether thought a minute  well then if those things are really your motive catch the french steamer and sail tomorrow  of course when it comes to that youre absolutely free to do as you choose from the moment you cant hold yourself i can only accept your flight  ill fly in a minute then said chad if youll stay here  ill stay here till the next steamerthen ill follow you  and do you call that chad asked accepting my flight  certainlyits the only thing to call it  the only way to keep me here accordingly strether explained is by staying yourself  chad took it in  all the more that ive really dished you eh  dished me strether echoed as inexpressively as possible  why if she sends out the pococks it will be that she doesnt trust you and if she doesnt trust you that bears uponwell you know what  strether decided after a moment that he did know what and in consonance with this he spoke  you see then all the more what you owe me  well if i do see how can i pay  by not deserting me  by standing by me  oh i say  but chad as they went downstairs clapped a firm hand in the manner of a pledge upon his shoulder  they descended slowly together and had in the court of the hotel some further talk of which the upshot was that they presently separated  chad newsome departed and strether left alone looked about superficially for waymarsh  but waymarsh hadnt yet it appeared come down and our friend finally went forth without sight of him    iii   at four oclock that afternoon he had still not seen him but he was then as to make up for this engaged in talk about him with miss gostrey  strether had kept away from home all day given himself up to the town and to his thoughts wandered and mused been at once restless and absorbedand all with the present climax of a rich little welcome in the quartier marboeuf  waymarsh has been unbeknown to me im convincedfor miss gostrey had enquiredin communication with woollett the consequence of which was last night the loudest possible call for me  do you mean a letter to bring you home  noa cable which i have at this moment in my pocket a come back by the first ship  strethers hostess it might have been made out just escaped changing colour  reflexion arrived but in time and established a provisional serenity  it was perhaps exactly this that enabled her to say with duplicity and youre going  you almost deserve it when you abandon me so  she shook her head as if this were not worth taking up  my absence has helped youas ive only to look at you to see  it was my calculation and im justified  youre not where you were  and the thing she smiled was for me not to be there either  you can go of yourself  oh but i feel today he comfortably declared that i shall want you yet  she took him all in again  well i promise you not again to leave you but it will only be to follow you  youve got your momentum and can toddle alone  he intelligently accepted it  yesi suppose i can toddle  its the sight of that in fact that has upset waymarsh  he can bear itthe way i strike him as goingno longer  thats only the climax of his original feeling  he wants me to quit and he must have written to woollett that im in peril of perdition  ah good she murmured  but is it only your supposition  i make it outit explains  then he deniesor you havent asked him  ive not had time strether said i made it out but last night putting various things together and ive not been since then face to face with him  she wondered  because youre too disgusted  you cant trust yourself  he settled his glasses on his nose  do i look in a great rage  you look divine  theres nothing he went on to be angry about  he has done me on the contrary a service  she made it out  by bringing things to a head  how well you understand he almost groaned  waymarsh wont in the least at any rate when i have it out with him deny or extenuate  he has acted from the deepest conviction with the best conscience and after wakeful nights  hell recognise that hes fully responsible and will consider that he has been highly successful so that any discussion we may have will bring us quite together againbridge the dark stream that has kept us so thoroughly apart  we shall have at last in the consequences of his act something we can definitely talk about  she was silent a little  how wonderfully you take it but youre always wonderful  he had a pause that matched her own then he had with an adequate spirit a complete admission  its quite true  im extremely wonderful just now  i dare say in fact im quite fantastic and i shouldnt be at all surprised if i were mad  then tell me she earnestly pressed  as he however for the time answered nothing only returning the look with which she watched him she presented herself where it was easier to meet her  what will mr waymarsh exactly have done  simply have written a letter  one will have been quite enough  he has told them i want looking after  and do youshe was all interest  immensely  and i shall get it  by which you mean you dont budge  i dont budge  youve cabled  noive made chad do it  that you decline to come  that he declines  we had it out this morning and i brought him round he had come in before i was down to tell me he was readyready i mean to return  and he went off after ten minutes with me to say he wouldnt  miss gostrey followed with intensity  then youve stopped him  strether settled himself afresh in his chair  ive stopped him that is for the time  thathe gave it to her more vividlyis where i am  i see i see  but wheres mr newsome  he was ready she asked to go  all ready  and sincerelybelieving youd be  perfectly i think so that he was amazed to find the hand i had laid on him to pull him over suddenly converted into an engine for keeping him still  it was an account of the matter miss gostrey could weigh  does he think the conversion sudden  well said strether im not altogether sure what he thinks  im not sure of anything that concerns him except that the more ive seen of him the less ive found him what i originally expected hes obscure and thats why im waiting  she wondered  but for what in particular  for the answer to his cable  and what was his cable  i dont know strether replied it was to be when he left me according to his own taste  i simply said to him i want to stay and the only way for me to do so is for you to that i wanted to stay seemed to interest him and he acted on that  miss gostrey turned it over  he wants then himself to stay  he half wants it  that is he half wants to go  my original appeal has to that extent worked in him  nevertheless strether pursued he wont go  not at least so long as im here  but you cant his companion suggested stay here always  i wish you could  by no means  still i want to see him a little further  hes not in the least the case i supposed hes quite another case  and its as such that he interests me  it was almost as if for his own intelligence that deliberate and lucid our friend thus expressed the matter  i dont want to give him up  miss gostrey but desired to help his lucidity  she had however to be light and tactful  up you meanato his mother  well im not thinking of his mother now  im thinking of the plan of which i was the mouthpiece which as soon as we met i put before him as persuasively as i knew how and which was drawn up as it were in complete ignorance of all that in this last long period has been happening to him  it took no account whatever of the impression i was here on the spot immediately to begin to receive from himimpressions of which i feel sure im far from having had the last  miss gostrey had a smile of the most genial criticism  so your idea ismore or lessto stay out of curiosity  call it what you like i dont care what its called  so long as you do stay  certainly not then  i call it all the same immense fun maria gostrey declared and to see you work it out will be one of the sensations of my life  it is clear you can toddle alone  he received this tribute without elation  i shant be alone when the pococks have come  her eyebrows went up  the pococks are coming  that i mean is what will happenand happen as quickly as possiblein consequence of chads cable  theyll simply embark sarah will come to speak for her motherwith an effect different from my muddle  miss gostrey more gravely wondered  she then will take him back  very possiblyand we shall see  she must at any rate have the chance and she may be trusted to do all she can  and do you want that  of course said strether i want it  i want to play fair  but she had lost for a moment the thread  if it devolves on the pococks why do you stay  just to see that i do play fairand a little also no doubt that they do  strether was luminous as he had never been  i came out to find myself in presence of new factsfacts that have kept striking me as less and less met by our old reasons  the matters perfectly simple  new reasonsreasons as new as the facts themselvesare wanted and of this our friends at woollettchads and minewere at the earliest moment definitely notified  if any are producible mrs pocock will produce them shell bring over the whole collection theyll be he added with a pensive smile a part of the fun you speak of  she was quite in the current now and floating by his side  its mamieso far as ive had it from youwholl be their great card and then as his contemplative silence wasnt a denial she significantly added i think im sorry for her  i think i amand strether sprang up moving about a little as her eyes followed him  but it cant be helped  you mean her coming out cant be  he explained after another turn what he meant  the only way for her not to come is for me to go homeas i believe that on the spot i could prevent it  but the difficulty as to that is that if i do go home  i see i seeshe had easily understood  mr newsome will do the same and thats notshe laughed out nowto be thought of  strether had no laugh he had only a quiet comparatively placid look that might have shown him as proof against ridicule  strange isnt it  they had in the matter that so much interested them come so far as this without sounding another nameto which however their present momentary silence was full of a conscious reference strethers question was a sufficient implication of the weight it had gained with him during the absence of his hostess and just for that reason a single gesture from her could pass for him as a vivid answer  yet he was answered still better when she said in a moment will mr newsome introduce his sister  to madame de vionnet  strether spoke the name at last  i shall be greatly surprised if he doesnt  she seemed to gaze at the possibility  you mean youve thought of it and youre prepared  ive thought of it and im prepared  it was to her visitor now that she applied her consideration  bon you are magnificent  well he answered after a pause and a little wearily but still standing there before herwell thats what just once in all my dull days i think i shall like to have been  two days later he had news from chad of a communication from woollett in response to their determinant telegram this missive being addressed to chad himself and announcing the immediate departure for france of sarah and jim and mamie  strether had meanwhile on his own side cabled he had but delayed that act till after his visit to miss gostrey an interview by which as so often before he felt his sense of things cleared up and settled  his message to mrs newsome in answer to her own had consisted of the words judge best to take another month but with full appreciation of all reenforcements  he had added that he was writing but he was of course always writing it was a practice that continued oddly enough to relieve him to make him come nearer than anything else to the consciousness of doing something so that he often wondered if he hadnt really under his recent stress acquired some hollow trick one of the specious arts of makebelieve  wouldnt the pages he still so freely dispatched by the american post have been worthy of a showy journalist some master of the great new science of beating the sense out of words wasnt he writing against time and mainly to show he was kindsince it had become quite his habit not to like to read himself over  on those lines he could still be liberal yet it was at best a sort of whistling in the dark  it was unmistakeable moreover that the sense of being in the dark now pressed on him more sharplycreating thereby the need for a louder and livelier whistle  he whistled long and hard after sending his message he whistled again and again in celebration of chads news there was an interval of a fortnight in which this exercise helped him he had no great notion of what on the spot sarah pocock would have to say though he had indeed confused premonitions but it shouldnt be in her power to sayit shouldnt be in any ones anywhere to saythat he was neglecting her mother  he might have written before more freely but he had never written more copiously and he frankly gave for a reason at woollett that he wished to fill the void created there by sarahs departure  the increase of his darkness however and the quickening as i have called it of his tune resided in the fact that he was hearing almost nothing  he had for some time been aware that he was hearing less than before and he was now clearly following a process by which mrs newsomes letters could but logically stop he hadnt had a line for many days and he needed no proofthough he was in time to have plentythat she wouldnt have put pen to paper after receiving the hint that had determined her telegram she wouldnt write till sarah should have seen him and reported on him  it was strange though it might well be less so than his own behaviour appeared at woollett  it was at any rate significant and what was remarkable was the way his friends nature and manner put on for him through this very drop of demonstration a greater intensity  it struck him really that he had never so lived with her as during this period of her silence the silence was a sacred hush a finer clearer medium in which her idiosyncrasies showed he walked about with her sat with her drove with her and dined facetoface with hera rare treat in his life as he could perhaps have scarce escaped phrasing it and if he had never seen her so soundless he had never on the other hand felt her so highly so almost austerely herself pure and by the vulgar estimate cold but deep devoted delicate sensitive noble  her vividness in these respects became for him in the special conditions almost an obsession and though the obsession sharpened his pulses adding really to the excitement of life there were hours at which to be less on the stretch he directly sought forgetfulness  he knew it for the queerest of adventuresa circumstance capable of playing such a part only for lambert stretherthat in paris itself of all places he should find this ghost of the lady of woollett more importunate than any other presence  when he went back to maria gostrey it was for the change to something else  and yet after all the change scarcely operated for he talked to her of mrs newsome in these days as he had never talked before  he had hitherto observed in that particular a discretion and a law considerations that at present broke down quite as if relations had altered  they hadnt really altered he said to himself so much as that came to for if what had occurred was of course that mrs newsome had ceased to trust him there was nothing on the other hand to prove that he shouldnt win back her confidence  it was quite his present theory that he would leave no stone unturned to do so and in fact if he now told maria things about her that he had never told before this was largely because it kept before him the idea of the honour of such a womans esteem his relation with maria as well was strangely enough no longer quite the same this truththough not too disconcertinglyhad come up between them on the renewal of their meetings  it was all contained in what she had then almost immediately said to him it was represented by the remark she had needed but ten minutes to make and that he hadnt been disposed to gainsay  he could toddle alone and the difference that showed was extraordinary  the turn taken by their talk had promptly confirmed this difference his larger confidence on the score of mrs newsome did the rest and the time seemed already far off when he had held out his small thirsty cup to the spout of her pail  her pail was scarce touched now and other fountains had flowed for him she fell into her place as but one of his tributaries and there was a strange sweetnessa melancholy mildness that touched himin her acceptance of the altered order  it marked for himself the flight of time or at any rate what he was pleased to think of with irony and pity as the rush of experience it having been but the day before yesterday that he sat at her feet and held on by her garment and was fed by her hand  it was the proportions that were changed and the proportions were at all times he philosophised the very conditions of perception the terms of thought it was as if with her effective little entresol and and her wide acquaintance her activities varieties promiscuities the duties and devotions that took up nine tenths of her time and of which he got guardedly but the sidewindit was as if she had shrunk to a secondary element and had consented to the shrinkage with the perfection of tact  this perfection had never failed her it had originally been greater than his prime measure for it it had kept him quite apart kept him out of the shop as she called her huge general acquaintance made their commerce as quiet as much a thing of the home alonethe opposite of the shopas if she had never another customer she had been wonderful to him at first with the memory of her little entresol the image to which on most mornings at that time his eyes directly opened but now she mainly figured for him as but part of the bristling totalthough of course always as a person to whom he should never cease to be indebted  it would never be given to him certainly to inspire a greater kindness  she had decked him out for others and he saw at this point at least nothing she would ever ask for she only wondered and questioned and listened rendering him the homage of a wistful speculation  she expressed it repeatedly he was already far beyond her and she must prepare herself to lose him  there was but one little chance for her  often as she had said it he met itfor it was a touch he likedeach time the same way  my coming to grief  yesthen i might patch you up  oh for my real smash if it takes place there will be no patching  but you surely dont mean it will kill you  noworse  it will make me old  ah nothing can do that the wonderful and special thing about you is that you are at this time of day youth  then she always made further one of those remarks that she had completely ceased to adorn with hesitations or apologies and that had by the same token in spite of their extreme straightness ceased to produce in strether the least embarrassment  she made him believe them and they became thereby as impersonal as truth itself  its just your particular charm  his answer too was always the same  of course im youthyouth for the trip to europe  i began to be young or at least to get the benefit of it the moment i met you at chester and thats what has been taking place ever since  i never had the benefit at the proper timewhich comes to saying that i never had the thing itself  im having the benefit at this moment i had it the other day when i said to chad wait i shall have it still again when sarah pocock arrives its a benefit that would make a poor show for many people and i dont know who else but you and i frankly could begin to see in it what i feel  i dont get drunk i dont pursue the ladies i dont spend money i dont even write sonnets  but nevertheless im making up late for what i didnt have early  i cultivate my little benefit in my own little way  it amuses me more than anything that has happened to me in all my life  they may say what they likeits my surrender its my tribute to youth  one puts that in where one canit has to come in somewhere if only out of the lives the conditions the feelings of other persons chad gives me the sense of it for all his grey hairs which merely make it solid in him and safe and serene and she does the same for all her being older than he for all her marriageable daughter her separated husband her agitated history  though theyre young enough my pair i dont say theyre in the freshest way their own absolutely prime adolescence for that has nothing to do with it the point is that theyre mine  yes theyre my youth since somehow at the right time nothing else ever was  what i meant just now therefore is that it would all gogo before doing its workif they were to fail me  on which just here miss gostrey inveterately questioned  what do you in particular call its work  well to see me through  but through whatshe liked to get it all out of him  why through this experience  that was all that would come  it regularly gave her none the less the last word  dont you remember how in those first days of our meeting it was i who was to see you through  remember  tenderly deeplyhe always rose to it  youre just doing your part in letting me maunder to you thus  ah dont speak as if my part were small since whatever else fails you  you wont ever ever everhe thus took her up  oh i beg your pardon you necessarily you inevitably will  your conditionsthats what i meanwont allow me anything to do for you  let alonei see what you meanthat im drearily dreadfully old i am but theres a servicepossible for you to renderthat i know all the same i shall think of  and what will it be  this in fine however she would never tell him  you shall hear only if your smash takes place  as thats really out of the question i wont expose myselfa point at which for reasons of his own strether ceased to press  he came round for publicityit was the easiest thingto the idea that his smash was out of the question and this rendered idle the discussion of what might follow it  he attached an added importance as the days elapsed to the arrival of the pococks he had even a shameful sense of waiting for it insincerely and incorrectly  he accused himself of making believe to his own mind that sarahs presence her impression her judgement would simplify and harmonise he accused himself of being so afraid of what they might do that he sought refuge to beg the whole question in a vain fury  he had abundantly seen at home what they were in the habit of doing and he had not at present the smallest ground  his clearest vision was when he made out that what he most desired was an account more full and free of mrs newsomes state of mind than any he felt he could now expect from herself that calculation at least went hand in hand with the sharp consciousness of wishing to prove to himself that he was not afraid to look his behaviour in the face  if he was by an inexorable logic to pay for it he was literally impatient to know the cost and he held himself ready to pay in instalments  the first instalment would be precisely this entertainment of sarah as a consequence of which moreover he should know vastly better how he stood      book eighth     i   strether rambled alone during these few days the effect of the incident of the previous week having been to simplify in a marked fashion his mixed relations with waymarsh  nothing had passed between them in reference to mrs newsomes summons but that our friend had mentioned to his own the departure of the deputation actually at seagiving him thus an opportunity to confess to the occult intervention he imputed to him  waymarsh however in the event confessed to nothing and though this falsified in some degree strethers forecast the latter amusedly saw in it the same depth of good conscience out of which the dear mans impertinence had originally sprung  he was patient with the dear man now and delighted to observe how unmistakeably he had put on flesh he felt his own holiday so successfully large and free that he was full of allowances and charities in respect to those cabined and confined his instinct toward a spirit so strapped down as waymarshs was to walk round it on tiptoe for fear of waking it up to a sense of losses by this time irretrievable  it was all very funny he knew and but the difference as he often said to himself of tweedledum and tweedledeean emancipation so purely comparative that it was like the advance of the doormat on the scraper yet the present crisis was happily to profit by it and the pilgrim from milrose to know himself more than ever in the right  strether felt that when he heard of the approach of the pococks the impulse of pity quite sprang up in him beside the impulse of triumph that was exactly why waymarsh had looked at him with eyes in which the heat of justice was measured and shaded  he had looked very hard as if affectionately sorry for the friendthe friend of fiftyfivewhose frivolity had had thus to be recorded becoming however but obscurely sententious and leaving his companion to formulate a charge  it was in this general attitude that he had of late altogether taken refuge with the drop of discussion they were solemnly sadly superficial strether recognised in him the mere portentous rumination to which miss barrace had so goodhumouredly described herself as assigning a corner of her salon  it was quite as if he knew his surreptitious step had been divined and it was also as if he missed the chance to explain the purity of his motive but this privation of relief should be precisely his small penance  it was not amiss for strether that he should find himself to that degree uneasy  if he had been challenged or accused rebuked for meddling or otherwise pulled up he would probably have shown on his own system all the height of his consistency all the depth of his good faith  explicit resentment of his course would have made him take the floor and the thump of his fist on the table would have affirmed him as consciously incorruptible  had what now really prevailed with strether been but a dread of that thumpa dread of wincing a little painfully at what it might invidiously demonstrate however this might be at any rate one of the marks of the crisis was a visible a studied lapse in waymarsh of betrayed concern  as if to make up to his comrade for the stroke by which he had played providence he now conspicuously ignored his movements withdrew himself from the pretension to share them stiffened up his sensibility to neglect and clasping his large empty hands and swinging his large restless foot clearly looked to another quarter for justice  this made for independence on strethers part and he had in truth at no moment of his stay been so free to go and come  the early summer brushed the picture over and blurred everything but the near it made a vast warm fragrant medium in which the elements floated together on the best of terms in which rewards were immediate and reckonings postponed  chad was out of town again for the first time since his visitors first view of him he had explained this necessitywithout detail yet also without embarrassment the circumstance was one of those which in the young mans life testified to the variety of his ties  strether wasnt otherwise concerned with it than for its so testifyinga pleasant multitudinous image in which he took comfort he took comfort by the same stroke in the swing of chads pendulum back from that other swing the sharp jerk towards woollett so stayed by his own hand  he had the entertainment of thinking that if he had for that moment stopped the clock it was to promote the next minute this still livelier motion  he himself did what he hadnt done before he took two or three times whole days offirrespective of others of two or three taken with miss gostrey two or three taken with little bilham  he went to chartres and cultivated before the front of the cathedral a general easy beatitude he went to fontainebleau and imagined himself on the way to italy he went to rouen with a little handbag and inordinately spent the night  one afternoon he did something quite different finding himself in the neighbourhood of a fine old house across the river he passed under the great arch of its doorway and asked at the porters lodge for madame de vionnet  he had already hovered more than once about that possibility been aware of it in the course of ostensible strolls as lurking but round the corner  only it had perversely happened after his morning at notre dame that his consistency as he considered and intended it had come back to him whereby he had reflected that the encounter in question had been none of his making clinging again intensely to the strength of his position which was precisely that there was nothing in it for himself  from the moment he actively pursued the charming associate of his adventure from that moment his position weakened for he was then acting in an interested way  it was only within a few days that he had fixed himself a limit  he promised himself his consistency should end with sarahs arrival  it was arguing correctly to feel the title to a free hand conferred on him by this event  if he wasnt to be let alone he should be merely a dupe to act with delicacy  if he wasnt to be trusted he could at least take his ease  if he was to be placed under control he gained leave to try what his position might agreeably give him  an ideal rigour would perhaps postpone the trial till after the pococks had shown their spirit and it was to an ideal rigour that he had quite promised himself to conform  suddenly however on this particular day he felt a particular fear under which everything collapsed  he knew abruptly that he was afraid of himselfand yet not in relation to the effect on his sensibilities of another hour of madame de vionnet  what he dreaded was the effect of a single hour of sarah pocock as to whom he was visited in troubled nights with fantastic waking dreams  she loomed at him larger than life she increased in volume as she drew nearer she so met his eyes that his imagination taking after the first step all and more than all the strides he already felt her come down on him already burned under her reprobation with the blush of guilt already consented by way of penance to the instant forfeiture of everything he saw himself under her direction recommitted to woollett as juvenile offenders are committed to reformatories  it wasnt of course that woollett was really a place of discipline but he knew in advance that sarahs salon at the hotel would be  his danger at any rate in such moods of alarm was some concession on this ground that would involve a sharp rupture with the actual therefore if he waited to take leave of that actual he might wholly miss his chance  it was represented with supreme vividness by madame de vionnet and that is why in a word he waited no longer  he had seen in a flash that he must anticipate mrs pocock  he was accordingly much disappointed on now learning from the portress that the lady of his quest was not in paris  she had gone for some days to the country  there was nothing in this accident but what was natural yet it produced for poor strether a drop of all confidence  it was suddenly as if he should never see her again and as if moreover he had brought it on himself by not having been quite kind to her  it was the advantage of his having let his fancy lose itself for a little in the gloom that as by reaction the prospect began really to brighten from the moment the deputation from woollett alighted on the platform of the station  they had come straight from havre having sailed from new york to that port and having also thanks to a happy voyage made land with a promptitude that left chad newsome who had meant to meet them at the dock belated  he had received their telegram with the announcement of their immediate further advance just as he was taking the train for havre so that nothing had remained for him but to await them in paris  he hastily picked up strether at the hotel for this purpose and he even with easy pleasantry suggested the attendance of waymarsh as wellwaymarsh at the moment his cab rattled up being engaged under strethers contemplative range in a grave perambulation of the familiar court  waymarsh had learned from his companion who had already had a note delivered by hand from chad that the pococks were due and had ambiguously though as always impressively glowered at him over the circumstance carrying himself in a manner in which strether was now expert enough to recognise his uncertainty in the premises as to the best tone  the only tone he aimed at with confidence was a full tonewhich was necessarily difficult in the absence of a full knowledge  the pococks were a quantity as yet unmeasured and as he had practically brought them over so this witness had to that extent exposed himself  he wanted to feel right about it but could only at the best for the time feel vague i shall look to you you know immensely our friend had said to help me with them and he had been quite conscious of the effect of the remark and of others of the same sort on his comrades sombre sensibility  he had insisted on the fact that waymarsh would quite like mrs pocockone could be certain he would he would be with her about everything and she would also be with him and miss barraces nose in short would find itself out of joint  strether had woven this web of cheerfulness while they waited in the court for chad he had sat smoking cigarettes to keep himself quiet while caged and leonine his fellow traveller paced and turned before him  chad newsome was doubtless to be struck when he arrived with the sharpness of their opposition at this particular hour he was to remember as a part of it how waymarsh came with him and with strether to the street and stood there with a face halfwistful and halfrueful they talked of him the two others as they drove and strether put chad in possession of much of his own strained sense of things  he had already a few days before named to him the wire he was convinced their friend had pulleda confidence that had made on the young mans part quite hugely for curiosity and diversion  the action of the matter moreover strether could see was to penetrate he saw that is how chad judged a system of influence in which waymarsh had served as a determinantan impression just now quickened again with the whole bearing of such a fact on the youths view of his relatives  as it came up between them that they might now take their friend for a feature of the control of these latter now sought to be exerted from woollett strether felt indeed how it would be stamped all over him half an hour later for sarah pococks eyes that he was as much on chads side as waymarsh had probably described him  he was letting himself at present go there was no denying it it might be desperation it might be confidence he should offer himself to the arriving travellers bristling with all the lucidity he had cultivated  he repeated to chad what he had been saying in the court to waymarsh how there was no doubt whatever that his sister would find the latter a kindred spirit no doubt of the alliance based on an exchange of views that the pair would successfully strike up  they would become as thick as thieveswhich moreover was but a development of what strether remembered to have said in one of his first discussions with his mate struck as he had then already been with the elements of affinity between that personage and mrs newsome herself  i told him one day when he had questioned me on your mother that she was a person who when he should know her would rouse in him i was sure a special enthusiasm and that hangs together with the conviction we now feelthis certitude that mrs pocock will take him into her boat  for its your mothers own boat that shes pulling  ah said chad mothers worth fifty of sally  a thousand but when you presently meet her all the same youll be meeting your mothers representativejust as i shall  i feel like the outgoing ambassador said strether doing honour to his appointed successor  a moment after speaking as he had just done he felt he had inadvertently rather cheapened mrs newsome to her son an impression audibly reflected as at first seen in chads prompt protest  he had recently rather failed of apprehension of the young mans attitude and temperremaining principally conscious of how little worry at the worst he wasted and he studied him at this critical hour with renewed interest  chad had done exactly what he had promised him a fortnight previoushad accepted without another question his plea for delay  he was waiting cheerfully and handsomely but also inscrutably and with a slight increase perhaps of the hardness originally involved in his acquired high polish  he was neither excited nor depressed was easy and acute and deliberateunhurried unflurried unworried only at most a little less amused than usual  strether felt him more than ever a justification of the extraordinary process of which his own absurd spirit had been the arena he knew as their cab rolled along knew as he hadnt even yet known that nothing else than what chad had done and had been would have led to his present showing  they had made him these things what he was and the business hadnt been easy it had taken time and trouble it had cost above all a price  the result at any rate was now to be offered to sally which strether so far as that was concerned was glad to be there to witness  would she in the least make it out or take it in the result or would she in the least care for it if she did  he scratched his chin as he asked himself by what name when challengedas he was sure he should behe could call it for her  oh those were determinations she must herself arrive at since she wanted so much to see let her see then and welcome  she had come out in the pride of her competence yet it hummed in strethers inner sense that she practically wouldnt see  that this was moreover what chad shrewdly suspected was clear from a word that next dropped from him  theyre children they play at lifeand the exclamation was significant and reassuring  it implied that he hadnt then for his companions sensibility appeared to give mrs newsome away and it facilitated our friends presently asking him if it were his idea that mrs pocock and madame de vionnet should become acquainted  strether was still more sharply struck hereupon with chads lucidity  why isnt that exactlyto get a sight of the company i keepwhat she has come out for  yesim afraid it is strether unguardedly replied  chads quick rejoinder lighted his precipitation  why do you say youre afraid  well because i feel a certain responsibility  its my testimony i imagine that will have been at the bottom of mrs pococks curiosity my letters as ive supposed you to understand from the beginning have spoken freely  ive certainly said my little say about madame de vionnet  all that for chad was beautifully obvious  yes but youve only spoken handsomely  never more handsomely of any woman  but its just that tone  that tone said chad that has fetched her  i dare say but ive no quarrel with you about it  and no more has madame de vionnet dont you know by this time how she likes you  ohand strether had with his groan a real pang of melancholy for all ive done for her  ah youve done a great deal  chads urbanity fairly shamed him and he was at this moment absolutely impatient to see the face sarah pocock would present to a sort of thing as he synthetically phrased it to himself with no adequate forecast of which despite his admonitions she would certainly arrive ive done this  well this is all right  she likes chad comfortably remarked  to be liked  it gave his companion a moments thought  and shes sure mrs pocock will  no i say that for you  she likes your liking her its so much as it were chad laughed to the good  however she doesnt despair of sarah either and is prepared on her own side to go all lengths  in the way of appreciation  yes and of everything else  in the way of general amiability hospitality and welcome  shes under arms chad laughed again shes prepared  strether took it in then as if an echo of miss barrace were in the air  shes wonderful  you dont begin to know how wonderful  there was a depth in it to strethers ear of confirmed luxuryalmost a kind of unconscious insolence of proprietorship but the effect of the glimpse was not at this moment to foster speculation there was something so conclusive in so much graceful and generous assurance  it was in fact a fresh evocation and the evocation had before many minutes another consequence  well i shall see her oftener now  i shall see her as much as i likeby your leave which is what i hitherto havent done  it has been said chad but without reproach only your own fault i tried to bring you together and she my dear fellowi never saw her more charming to any man  but youve got your extraordinary ideas  well i did have strether murmured while he felt both how they had possessed him and how they had now lost their authority  he couldnt have traced the sequence to the end but it was all because of mrs pocock  mrs pocock might be because of mrs newsome but that was still to be proved  what came over him was the sense of having stupidly failed to profit where profit would have been precious  it had been open to him to see so much more of her and he had but let the good days pass  fierce in him almost was the resolve to lose no more of them and he whimsically reflected while at chads side he drew nearer to his destination that it was after all sarah who would have quickened his chance  what her visit of inquisition might achieve in other directions was as yet all obscureonly not obscure that it would do supremely much to bring two earnest persons together  he had but to listen to chad at this moment to feel it for chad was in the act of remarking to him that they of course both counted on himhe himself and the other earnest personfor cheer and support  it was brave to strether to hear him talk as if the line of wisdom they had struck out was to make things ravishing to the pococks  no if madame de vionnet compassed that compassed the ravishment of the pococks madame de vionnet would be prodigious  it would be a beautiful plan if it succeeded and it all came to the question of sarahs being really bribeable  the precedent of his own case helped strether perhaps but little to consider she might prove so it being distinct that her character would rather make for every possible difference  this idea of his own bribeability set him apart for himself with the further mark in fact that his case was absolutely proved  he liked always where lambert strether was concerned to know the worst and what he now seemed to know was not only that he was bribeable but that he had been effectually bribed  the only difficulty was that he couldnt quite have said with what  it was as if he had sold himself but hadnt somehow got the cash  that however was what characteristically would happen to him  it would naturally be his kind of traffic  while he thought of these things he reminded chad of the truth they mustnt lose sight ofthe truth that with all deference to her susceptibility to new interests sarah would have come out with a high firm definite purpose  she hasnt come out you know to be bamboozled we may all be ravishingnothing perhaps can be more easy for us but she hasnt come out to be ravished  she has come out just simply to take you home  oh well with her ill go said chad goodhumouredly  i suppose youll allow that  and then as for a minute strether said nothing or is your idea that when ive seen her i shant want to go  as this question however again left his friend silent he presently went on my own idea at any rate is that they shall have while theyre here the best sort of time  it was at this that strether spoke  ah there you are i think if you really wanted to go  well said chad to bring it out  well you wouldnt trouble about our good time  you wouldnt care what sort of a time we have  chad could always take in the easiest way in the world any ingenious suggestion  i see  but can i help it  im too decent  yes youre too decent strether heavily sighed  and he felt for the moment as if it were the preposterous end of his mission  it ministered for the time to this temporary effect that chad made no rejoinder  but he spoke again as they came in sight of the station do you mean to introduce her to miss gostrey  as to this strether was ready  no  but havent you told me they know about her  i think ive told you your mother knows  and wont she have told sally  thats one of the things i want to see  and if you find she has  will i then you mean bring them together  yes said chad with his pleasant promptness  to show her theres nothing in it  strether hesitated  i dont know that i care very much what she may think theres in it  not if it represents what mother thinks  ah what does your mother think  there was in this some sound of bewilderment  but they were just driving up and help of a sort might after all be quite at hand  isnt that my dear man what were both just going to make out    ii   strether quitted the station half an hour later in different company chad had taken charge for the journey to the hotel of sarah mamie the maid and the luggage all spaciously installed and conveyed and it was only after the four had rolled away that his companion got into a cab with jim  a strange new feeling had come over strether in consequence of which his spirits had risen it was as if what had occurred on the alighting of his critics had been something other than his fear though his fear had vet not been of an instant scene of violence  his impression had been nothing but what was inevitablehe said that to himself yet relief and reassurance had softly dropped upon him  nothing could be so odd as to be indebted for these things to the look of faces and the sound of voices that had been with him to satiety as he might have said for years but he now knew all the same how uneasy he had felt that was brought home to him by his present sense of a respite  it had come moreover in the flash of an eye it had come in the smile with which sarah whom at the window of her compartment they had effusively greeted from the platform rustled down to them a moment later fresh and handsome from her cool june progress through the charming land  it was only a sign but enough she was going to be gracious and unallusive she was going to play the larger gamewhich was still more apparent after she had emerged from chads arms in her direct greeting to the valued friend of her family  strether was then as much as ever the valued friend of her family it was something he could at all events go on with and the manner of his response to it expressed even for himself how little he had enjoyed the prospect of ceasing to figure in that likeness  he had always seen sarah gracioushad in fact rarely seen her shy or dry her marked thinlipped smile intense without brightness and as prompt to act as the scrape of a safetymatch the protrusion of her rather remarkably long chin which in her case represented invitation and urbanity and not as in most others pugnacity and defiance the penetration of her voice to a distance the general encouragement and approval of her manner were all elements with which intercourse had made him familiar but which he noted today almost as if she had been a new acquaintance this first glimpse of her had given a brief but vivid accent to her resemblance to her mother he could have taken her for mrs newsome while she met his eyes as the train rolled into the station  it was an impression that quickly dropped mrs newsome was much handsomer and while sarah inclined to the massive her mother had at an age still the girdle of a maid also the latters chin was rather short than long and her smile by good fortune much more oh ever so much more mercifully vague  strether had seen mrs newsome reserved he had literally heard her silent though he had never known her unpleasant it was the case with mrs pocock that he had known her unpleasant even though he had never known her not affable  she had forms of affability that were in a high degree assertive nothing for instance had ever been more striking than that she was affable to jim  what had told in any case at the window of the train was her high clear forehead that forehead which her friends for some reason always thought of as a brow the long reach of her eyesit came out at this juncture in such a manner as to remind him oddly enough also of that of waymarshs and the unusual gloss of her dark hair dressed and hatted after her mothers refined example with such an avoidance of extremes that it was always spoken of at woollett as their own though this analogy dropped as soon as she was on the platform it had lasted long enough to make him feel all the advantage as it were of his relief  the woman at home the woman to whom he was attached was before him just long enough to give him again the measure of the wretchedness in fact really of the shame of their having to recognise the formation between them of a split  he had taken this measure in solitude and meditation  but the catastrophe as sarah steamed up looked for its seconds unprecedentedly dreadfulor proved more exactly altogether unthinkable so that his finding something free and familiar to respond to brought with it an instant renewal of his loyalty  he had suddenly sounded the whole depth had gasped at what he might have lost  well he could now for the quarter of an hour of their detention hover about the travellers as soothingly as if their direct message to him was that he had lost nothing  he wasnt going to have sarah write to her mother that night that he was in any way altered or strange  there had been times enough for a month when it had seemed to him that he was strange that he was altered in every way but that was a matter for himself he knew at least whose business it was not it was not at all events such a circumstance as sarahs own unaided lights would help her to  even if she had come out to flash those lights more than yet appeared she wouldnt make much headway against mere pleasantness  he counted on being able to be merely pleasant to the end and if only from incapacity moreover to formulate anything different  he couldnt even formulate to himself his being changed and queer it had taken place the process somewhere deep down maria gostrey had caught glimpses of it but how was he to fish it up even if he desired for mrs pocock  this was then the spirit in which he hovered and with the easier throb in it much indebted furthermore to the impression of high and established adequacy as a pretty girl promptly produced in him by mamie  he had wondered vaguelyturning over many things in the fidget of his thoughtsif mamie were as pretty as woollett published her as to which issue seeing her now again was to be so swept away by woolletts opinion that this consequence really let loose for the imagination an avalanche of others  there were positively five minutes in which the last word seemed of necessity to abide with a woollett represented by a mamie  this was the sort of truth the place itself would feel it would send her forth in confidence it would point to her with triumph it would take its stand on her with assurance it would be conscious of no requirements she didnt meet of no question she couldnt answer  well it was right strether slipped smoothly enough into the cheerfulness of saying  granted that a community might be best represented by a young lady of twentytwo mamie perfectly played the part played it as if she were used to it and looked and spoke and dressed the character  he wondered if she mightnt in the high light of paris a cool full studiolight becoming yet treacherous show as too conscious of these matters but the next moment he felt satisfied that her consciousness was after all empty for its size rather too simple than too mixed and that the kind way with her would be not to take many things out of it but to put as many as possible in  she was robust and conveniently tall just a trifle too bloodlessly fair perhaps but with a pleasant public familiar radiance that affirmed her vitality  she might have been receiving for woollett wherever she found herself and there was something in her manner her tone her motion her pretty blue eyes her pretty perfect teeth and her very small too small nose that immediately placed her to the fancy between the windows of a hot bright room in which voices were highup at that end to which people were brought to be presented they were there to congratulate these images and strethers renewed vision on this hint completed the idea  what mamie was like was the happy bride the bride after the church and just before going away  she wasnt the mere maiden and yet was only as much married as that quantity came to  she was in the brilliant acclaimed festal stage well might it last her long  strether rejoiced in these things for chad who was all genial attention to the needs of his friends besides having arranged that his servant should reinforce him the ladies were certainly pleasant to see and mamie would be at any time and anywhere pleasant to exhibit she would look extraordinarily like his young wifethe wife of a honeymoon should he go about with her but that was his own affairor perhaps it was hers it was at any rate something she couldnt help strether remembered how he had seen him come up with jeanne de vionnet in glorianis garden and the fancy he had had about thatthe fancy obscured now thickly overlaid with others the recollection was during these minutes his only note of trouble  he had often in spite of himself wondered if chad but too probably were not with jeanne the object of a still and shaded flame  it was on the cards that the child might be tremulously in love and this conviction now flickered up not a bit the less for his disliking to think of it for its being in a complicated situation a complication the more and for something indescribable in mamie something at all events straightway lent her by his own mind something that gave her value gave her intensity and purpose as the symbol of an opposition  little jeanne wasnt really at all in questionhow could she beyet from the moment miss pocock had shaken her skirts on the platform touched up the immense bows of her hat and settled properly over her shoulder the strap of her moroccoandgilt travellingsatchel from that moment little jeanne was opposed  it was in the cab with jim that impressions really crowded on strether giving him the strangest sense of length of absence from people among whom he had lived for years  having them thus come out to him was as if he had returned to find them  and the droll promptitude of jims mental reaction threw his own initiation far back into the past whoever might or mightnt be suited by what was going on among them jim for one would certainly be  his instant recognitionfrank and whimsicalof what the affair was for him gave strether a glow of pleasure  i say you know this is about my shape and if it hadnt been for you so he broke out as the charming streets met his healthy appetite and he wound up after an expressive nudge with a clap of his companions knee and an oh you youyou are doing it that was charged with rich meaning strether felt in it the intention of homage but with a curiosity otherwise occupied postponed taking it up  what he was asking himself for the time was how sarah pocock in the opportunity already given her had judged her brotherfrom whom he himself as they finally at the station separated for their different conveyances had had a look into which he could read more than one message  however sarah was judging her brother chads conclusion about his sister and about her husband and her husbands sister was at the least on the way not to fail of confidence strether felt the confidence and that as the look between them was an exchange what he himself gave back was relatively vague  this comparison of notes however could wait everything struck him as depending on the effect produced by chad  neither sarah nor mamie had in any way at the stationwhere they had had after all ample timebroken out about it which to make up for this was what our friend had expected of jim as soon as they should find themselves together  it was queer to him that he had that noiseless brush with chad an ironic intelligence with this youth on the subject of his relatives an intelligence carried on under their nose and as might be said at their expensesuch a matter marked again for him strongly the number of stages he had come albeit that if the number seemed great the time taken for the final one was but the turn of a hand  he had before this had many moments of wondering if he himself werent perhaps changed even as chad was changed  only what in chad was conspicuous improvementwell he had no name ready for the working in his own organism of his own more timid dose  he should have to see first what this action would amount to and for his occult passage with the young man after all the directness of it had no greater oddity than the fact that the young mans way with the three travellers should have been so happy a manifestation  strether liked him for it on the spot as he hadnt yet liked him it affected him while it lasted as he might have been affected by some light pleasant perfect work of art  to that degree that he wondered if they were really worthy of it took it in and did it justice to that degree that it would have been scarce a miracle if there in the luggageroom while they waited for their things sarah had pulled his sleeve and drawn him aside youre right we havent quite known what you mean mother and i but now we see chads magnificent what can one want more  if this is the kind of thing  on which they might as it were have embraced and begun to work together  ah how much as it was for all her bridling brightnesswhich was merely general and noticed nothingwould they work together strether knew he was unreasonable he set it down to his being nervous  people couldnt notice everything and speak of everything in a quarter of an hour  possibly no doubt also he made too much of chads display yet none the less when at the end of five minutes in the cab jim pocock had said nothing eitherhadnt said that is what strether wanted though he had said much elseit all suddenly bounced back to their being either stupid or wilful  it was more probably on the whole the former so that that would be the drawback of the bridling brightness  yes they would bridle and be bright they would make the best of what was before them but their observation would fail it would be beyond them they simply wouldnt understand  of what use would it be then that they had comeif they werent to be intelligent up to that point unless indeed he himself were utterly deluded and extravagant  was he on this question of chads improvement fantastic and away from the truth  did he live in a false world a world that had grown simply to suit him and was his present slight irritationin the face now of jims silence in particularbut the alarm of the vain thing menaced by the touch of the real  was this contribution of the real possibly the mission of the pocockshad they come to make the work of observation as he had practised observation crack and crumble and to reduce chad to the plain terms in which honest minds could deal with him  had they come in short to be sane where strether was destined to feel that he himself had only been silly  he glanced at such a contingency but it failed to hold him long when once he had reflected that he would have been silly in this case with maria gostrey and little bilham with madame de vionnet and little jeanne with lambert strether in fine and above all with chad newsome himself  wouldnt it be found to have made more for reality to be silly with these persons than sane with sarah and jim  jim in fact he presently made up his mind was individually out of it jim didnt care jim hadnt come out either for chad or for him jim in short left the moral side to sally and indeed simply availed himself now for the sense of recreation of the fact that he left almost everything to sally  he was nothing compared to sally and not so much by reason of sallys temper and will as by that of her more developed type and greater acquaintance with the world  he quite frankly and serenely confessed as he sat there with strether that he felt his type hang far in the rear of his wifes and still further if possible in the rear of his sisters  their types he well knew were recognised and acclaimed whereas the most a leading woollett businessman could hope to achieve socially and for that matter industrially was a certain freedom to play into this general glamour  the impression he made on our friend was another of the things that marked our friends road  it was a strange impression especially as so soon produced strether had received it he judged all in the twenty minutes it struck him at least as but in a minor degree the work of the long woollett years  pocock was normally and consentingly though not quite wittingly out of the question  it was despite his being normal it was despite his being cheerful it was despite his being a leading woollett businessman and the determination of his fate left him thus perfectly usualas everything else about it was clearly to his sense not less so  he seemed to say that there was a whole side of life on which the perfectly usual was for leading woollett businessmen to be out of the question  he made no more of it than that and strether so far as jim was concerned desired to make no more  only strethers imagination as always worked and he asked himself if this side of life were not somehow connected for those who figured on it with the fact of marriage  would his relation to it had he married ten years before have become now the same as pococks might it even become the same should he marry in a few months  should he ever know himself as much out of the question for mrs newsome as jim knew himselfin a dim wayfor mrs jim  to turn his eyes in that direction was to be personally reassured he was different from pocock he had affirmed himself differently and was held after all in higher esteem  what none the less came home to him however at this hour was that the society over there that of which sarah and mamieand in a more eminent way mrs newsome herselfwere specimens was essentially a society of women and that poor jim wasnt in it  he himself lambert strether was as yet in some degreewhich was an odd situation for a man but it kept coming back to him in a whimsical way that he should perhaps find his marriage had cost him his place  this occasion indeed whatever that fancy represented was not a time of sensible exclusion for jim who was in a state of manifest response to the charm of his adventure  small and fat and constantly facetious strawcoloured and destitute of marks he would have been practically indistinguishable hadnt his constant preference for lightgrey clothes for white hats for very big cigars and very little stories done what it could for his identity  there were signs in him though none of them plaintive of always paying for others and the principal one perhaps was just this failure of type  it was with this that he paid rather than with fatigue or waste and also doubtless a little with the effort of humournever irrelevant to the conditions to the relations with which he was acquainted  he gurgled his joy as they rolled through the happy streets he declared that his trip was a regular windfall and that he wasnt there he was eager to remark to hang back from anything  he didnt know quite what sally had come for but he had come for a good time strether indulged him even while wondering if what sally wanted her brother to go back for was to become like her husband he trusted that a good time was to be out and out the programme for all of them and he assented liberally to jims proposal that disencumbered and irresponsiblehis things were in the omnibus with those of the othersthey should take a further turn round before going to the hotel  it wasnt for him to tackle chadit was sallys job and as it would be like her he felt to open fire on the spot it wouldnt be amiss of them to hold off and give her time  strether on his side only asked to give her time so he jogged with his companion along boulevards and avenues trying to extract from meagre material some forecast of his catastrophe  he was quick enough to see that jim pocock declined judgement had hovered quite round the outer edge of discussion and anxiety leaving all analysis of their question to the ladies alone and now only feeling his way toward some small droll cynicism  it broke out afresh the cynicismit had already shown a flickerin a but slightly deferred  well hanged if i would if i were he  you mean you wouldnt in chads place  give up this to go back and boss the advertising  poor jim with his arms folded and his little legs out in the open fiacre drank in the sparkling paris noon and carried his eyes from one side of their vista to the other  why i want to come right out and live here myself  and i want to live while i am here too  i feel with youoh youve been grand old man and ive twiggedthat it aint right to worry chad  i dont mean to persecute him i couldnt in conscience  its thanks to you at any rate that im here and im sure im much obliged  youre a lovely pair  there were things in this speech that strether let pass for the time dont you then think it important the advertising should be thoroughly taken in hand  chad will be so far as capacity is concerned he went on the man to do it  where did he get his capacity jim asked over here  he didnt get it over here and the wonderful thing is that over here he hasnt inevitably lost it  he has a natural turn for business an extraordinary head  he comes by that strether explained honestly enough  hes in that respect his fathers son and alsofor shes wonderful in her way toohis mothers  he has other tastes and other tendencies but mrs newsome and your wife are quite right about his having that  hes very remarkable  well i guess he is  jim pocock comfortably sighed  but if youve believed so in his making us hum why have you so prolonged the discussion  dont you know weve been quite anxious about you  these questions were not informed with earnestness but strether saw he must none the less make a choice and take a line  because you see ive greatly liked it  ive liked my paris i dare say ive liked it too much  oh you old wretch jim gaily exclaimed  but nothings concluded strether went on  the case is more complex than it looks from woollett  oh well it looks bad enough from woollett jim declared  even after all ive written  jim bethought himself  isnt it what youve written that has made mrs newsome pack us off  that at least and chads not turning up  strether made a reflexion of his own  i see  that she should do something was no doubt inevitable and your wife has therefore of course come out to act  oh yes jim concurredto act  but sally comes out to act you know he lucidly added every time she leaves the house  she never comes out but she does act  shes acting moreover now for her mother and that fixes the scale then he wound up opening all his senses to it with a renewed embrace of pleasant paris  we havent all the same at woollett got anything like this  strether continued to consider  im bound to say for you all that you strike me as having arrived in a very mild and reasonable frame of mind  you dont show your claws  i felt just now in mrs pocock no symptom of that  she isnt fierce he went on  im such a nervous idiot that i thought she might be  oh dont you know her well enough pocock asked to have noticed that she never gives herself away any more than her mother ever does they aint fierce either of em they let you come quite close  they wear their fur the smooth side outthe warm side in do you know what they are jim pursued as he looked about him giving the question as strether felt but half his caredo you know what they are  theyre about as intense as they can live  yesand strethers concurrence had a positive precipitation theyre about as intense as they can live  they dont lash about and shake the cage said jim who seemed pleased with his analogy and its at feedingtime that theyre quietest  but they always get there  they do indeedthey always get there strether replied with a laugh that justified his confession of nervousness  he disliked to be talking sincerely of mrs  newsome with pocock he could have talked insincerely  but there was something he wanted to know a need created in him by her recent intermission by his having given from the first so much as now more than ever appeared to him and got so little  it was as if a queer truth in his companions metaphor had rolled over him with a rush  she had been quiet at feedingtime she had fed and sarah had fed with her out of the big bowl of all his recent free communication his vividness and pleasantness his ingenuity and even his eloquence while the current of her response had steadily run thin jim meanwhile however it was true slipped characteristically into shallowness from the moment he ceased to speak out of the experience of a husband  but of course chad has now the advantage of being there before her if he doesnt work that for all its worth  he sighed with contingent pity at his brotherinlaws possible want of resource he has worked it on you pretty well eh and he asked the next moment if there were anything new at the varieties which he pronounced in the american manner  they talked about the varietiesstrether confessing to a knowledge which produced again on pococks part a play of innuendo as vague as a nurseryrhyme yet as aggressive as an elbow in his side and they finished their drive under the protection of easy themes strether waited to the end but still in vain for any show that jim had seen chad as different  and he could scarce have explained the discouragement he drew from the absence of this testimony  it was what he had taken his own stand on  so far as he had taken a stand and if they were all only going to see nothing he had only wasted his time he gave his friend till the very last moment till they had come into sight of the hotel and when poor pocock only continued cheerful and envious and funny he fairly grew to dislike him to feel him extravagantly common  if they were all going to see nothingstrether knew  as this came back to him that he was also letting pocock represent for him what mrs newsome wouldnt see  he went on disliking in the light of jims commonness to talk to him about that lady yet just before the cab pulled up he knew the extent of his desire for the real word from woollett  has mrs newsome at all given way  given wayjim echoed it with the practical derision of his sense of a long past  under the strain i mean of hope deferred of disappointment repeated and thereby intensified  oh is she prostrate you meanhe had his categories in hand why yes shes prostratejust as sally is  but theyre never so lively you know as when theyre prostrate  ah sarahs prostrate strether vaguely murmured  its when theyre prostrate that they most sit up  and mrs newsomes sitting up  all night my boyfor you  and jim fetched him  with a vulgar little guffaw a thrust that gave relief to the picture  but he had got what he wanted  he felt on the spot that this was the real word from woollett  so dont you go home jim added while he alighted and while his friend letting him profusely pay the cabman  sat on in a momentary muse  strether wondered if that were the real word too    iii   as the door of mrs pococks salon was pushed open for him the next day well before noon he was reached by a voice with a charming sound that made him just falter before crossing the threshold  madame de vionnet was already on the field and this gave the drama a quicker pace than he felt it as yetthough his suspense had increasedin the power of any act of his own to do he had spent the previous evening with all his old friends together yet he would still have described himself as quite in the dark in respect to a forecast of their influence on his situation it was strange now none the less that in the light of this unexpected note of her presence he felt madame de vionnet a part of that situation as she hadnt even yet been  she was alone he found himself assuming with sarah and there was a bearing in thatsomehow beyond his controlon his personal fate  yet she was only saying something quite easy and independentthe thing she had come as a good friend of chads on purpose to say there isnt anything at all  i should be so delighted  it was clear enough when they were there before him how she had been received  he saw this as sarah got up to greet him from something fairly hectic in sarahs face  he saw furthermore that they werent as had first come to him alone together he was at no loss as to the identity of the broad high back presented to him in the embrasure of the window furthest from the door waymarsh whom he had today not yet seen  whom he only knew to have left the hotel before him  and who had taken part the night previous on mrs  pococks kind invitation conveyed by chad in the entertainment informal but cordial promptly offered by that ladywaymarsh had anticipated him even as madame de vionnet had done and with his hands in his pockets and his attitude unaffected by strethers entrance was looking out in marked detachment at the rue de rivoli  the latter felt it in the airit was immense how waymarsh could mark thingsthat he had remained deeply dissociated from the overture to their hostess that we have recorded on madame de vionnets side  he had conspicuously tact besides a stiff general view and this was why he had left mrs pocock to struggle alone  he would outstay the visitor he would unmistakeably wait to what had he been doomed for months past but waiting  therefore she was to feel that she had him in reserve what support she drew from this was still to be seen for although sarah was vividly bright she had given herself up for the moment to an ambiguous flushed formalism  she had had to reckon more quickly than she expected but it concerned her first of all to signify that she was not to be taken unawares  strether arrived precisely in time for her showing it  oh youre too good but i dont think i feel quite helpless  i have my brotherand these american friends  and then you know ive been to paris  i know paris said sally pocock in a tone that breathed a certain chill on strethers heart  ah but a woman in this tiresome place where everythings always changing a woman of good will madame de vionnet threw off can always help a woman  im sure you knowbut we know perhaps different things she too visibly wished to make no mistake but it was a fear of a different order and more kept out of sight  she smiled in welcome at strether she greeted him more familiarly than mrs pocock she put out her hand to him without moving from her place and it came to him in the course of a minute and in the oddest way thatyes positivelyshe was giving him over to ruin she was all kindness and ease but she couldnt help so giving him she was exquisite and her being just as she was poured for sarah a sudden rush of meaning into his own equivocations  how could she know how she was hurting him  she wanted to show as simple and humblein the degree compatible with operative charm but it was just this that seemed to put him on her side  she struck him as dressed as arranged as prepared infinitely to conciliatewith the very poetry of good taste in her view of the conditions of her early call  she was ready to advise about dressmakers and shops she held herself wholly at the disposition of chads family strether noticed her card on the tableher coronet and her comtesseand the imagination was sharp in him of certain private adjustments in sarahs mind  she had never he was sure sat with a comtesse before and such was the specimen of that class he had been keeping to play on her  she had crossed the sea very particularly for a look at her but he read in madame de vionnets own eyes that this curiosity hadnt been so successfully met as that she herself wouldnt now have more than ever need of him  she looked much as she had looked to him that morning at notre dame he noted in fact the suggestive sameness of her discreet and delicate dress  it seemed to speakperhaps a little prematurely or too finelyof the sense in which she would help mrs pocock with the shops  the way that lady took her in moreover added depth to his impression of what miss gostrey by their common wisdom had escaped  he winced as he saw himself but for that timely prudence ushering in maria as a guide and an example  there was however a touch of relief for him in his glimpse so far as he had got it of sarahs line  she knew paris madame de vionnet had for that matter lightly taken this up  ah then youve a turn for that an affinity that belongs to your family your brother though his long experience makes a difference i admit has become one of us in a marvellous way and she appealed to strether in the manner of a woman who could always glide off with smoothness into another subject  wasnt he struck with the way mr newsome had made the place his own and hadnt he been in a position to profit by his friends wondrous expertness  strether felt the bravery at the least of her presenting herself so promptly to sound that note and yet asked himself what other note after all she could strike from the moment she presented herself at all  she could meet mrs pocock only on the ground of the obvious and what feature of chads situation was more eminent than the fact that he had created for himself a new set of circumstances  unless she hid herself altogether she could show but as one of these an illustration of his domiciled and indeed of his confirmed condition  and the consciousness of all this in her charming eyes was so clear and fine that as she thus publicly drew him into her boat she produced in him such a silent agitation as he was not to fail afterwards to denounce as pusillanimous  ah dont be so charming to mefor it makes us intimate and after all what is between us when ive been so tremendously on my guard and have seen you but half a dozen times  he recognised once more the perverse law that so inveterately governed his poor personal aspects  it would be exactly like the way things always turned out for him that he should affect mrs pocock and waymarsh as launched in a relation in which he had really never been launched at all they were at this very momentthey could only beattributing to him the full licence of it and all by the operation of her own tone with him whereas his sole licence had been to cling with intensity to the brink not to dip so much as a toe into the flood but the flicker of his fear on this occasion was not as may be added to repeat itself it sprang up for its moment only to die down and then go out for ever  to meet his fellow visitors invocation and with sarahs brilliant eyes on him answer was quite sufficiently to step into her boat  during the rest of the time her visit lasted he felt himself proceed to each of the proper offices successively for helping to keep the adventurous skiff afloat  it rocked beneath him but he settled himself in his place he took up an oar and since he was to have the credit of pulling pulled  that will make it all the pleasanter if it so happens that we do meet madame de vionnet had further observed in reference to mrs pococks mention of her initiated state and she had immediately added that after all her hostess couldnt be in need with the good offices of mr strether so close at hand  its he i gather who has learnt to know his paris and to love it better than any one ever before in so short a time so that between him and your brother when it comes to the point how can you possibly want for good guidance  the great thing mr strether will show you she smiled is just to let ones self go  oh ive not let myself go very far strether answered feeling quite as if he had been called upon to hint to mrs pocock how parisians could talk  im only afraid of showing i havent let myself go far enough  ive taken a good deal of time but i must quite have had the air of not budging from one spot he looked at sarah in a manner that he thought she might take as engaging and he made under madame de vionnets protection as it were his first personal point  what has really happened has been that all the while ive done what i came out for  yet it only at first gave madame de vionnet a chance immediately to take him up  youve renewed acquaintance with your friendyouve learnt to know him again she spoke with such cheerful helpfulness that they might in a common cause have been calling together and pledged to mutual aid  waymarsh at this as if he had been in question straightway turned from the window  oh yes countesshe has renewed acquaintance with me and he has i guess learnt something about me though i dont know how much he has liked it  its for strether himself to say whether he has felt it justifies his course  oh but you said the countess gaily are not in the least what he came out foris he really strether and i hadnt you at all in my mind  i was thinking of mr newsome of whom we think so much and with whom precisely mrs pocock has given herself the opportunity to take up threads  what a pleasure for you both madame de vionnet with her eyes on sarah bravely continued  mrs pocock met her handsomely but strether quickly saw she meant to accept no version of her movements or plans from any other lips she required no patronage and no support which were but other names for a false position she would show in her own way what she chose to show and this she expressed with a dry glitter that recalled to him a fine woollett winter morning  ive never wanted for opportunities to see my brother  weve many things to think of at home and great responsibilities and occupations and our homes not an impossible place  weve plenty of reasons sarah continued a little piercingly for everything we doand in short she wouldnt give herself the least little scrap away  but she added as one who was always bland and who could afford a concession  ive come becausewell because we do come  ah then fortunatelymadame de vionnet breathed it to the air five minutes later they were on their feet for her to take leave standing together in an affability that had succeeded in surviving a further exchange of remarks only with the emphasised appearance on waymarshs part of a tendency to revert in a ruminating manner and as with an instinctive or a precautionary lightening of his tread to an open window and his point of vantage  the glazed and gilded room all red damask ormolu mirrors clocks looked south and the shutters were bowed upon the summer morning but the tuileries garden and what was beyond it over which the whole place hung were things visible through gaps so that the farspreading presence of paris came up in coolness dimness and invitation in the twinkle of gilttipped palings the crunch of gravel the click of hoofs the crack of whips things that suggested some parade of the circus  i think it probable said mrs pocock that i shall have the opportunity of going to my brothers ive no doubt its very pleasant indeed she spoke as to strether but her face was turned with an intensity of brightness to madame de vionnet and there was a moment during which while she thus fronted her our friend expected to hear her add  im much obliged to you im sure for inviting me there he guessed that for five seconds these words were on the point of coming he heard them as clearly as if they had been spoken but he presently knew they had just failedknew it by a glance quick and fine from madame de vionnet which told him that she too had felt them in the air but that the point had luckily not been made in any manner requiring notice  this left her free to reply only to what had been said  that the boulevard malesherbes may be common ground for us offers me the best prospect i see for the pleasure of meeting you again  oh i shall come to see you since youve been so good  and mrs pocock looked her invader well in the eyes  the flush in sarahs cheeks had by this time settled to a small definite crimson spot that was not without its own bravery she held her head a good deal up and it came to strether that of the two at this moment she was the one who most carried out the idea of a countess  he quite took in however that she would really return her visitors civility  she wouldnt report again at woollett without at least so much producible history as that in her pocket  i want extremely to be able to show you my little daughter madame de vionnet went on and i should have brought her with me if i hadnt wished first to ask your leave  i was in hopes i should perhaps find miss pocock of whose being with you ive heard from mr newsome and whose acquaintance i should so much like my child to make  if i have the pleasure of seeing her and you do permit it i shall venture to ask her to be kind to jeanne  mr strether will tell youshe beautifully kept it upthat my poor girl is gentle and good and rather lonely theyve made friends he and she ever so happily and he doesnt i believe think ill of her  as for jeanne herself he has had the same success with her that i know he has had here wherever he has turned she seemed to ask him for permission to say these things or seemed rather to take it softly and happily with the ease of intimacy for granted and he had quite the consciousness now that not to meet her at any point more than halfway would be odiously basely to abandon her yes he was with her and opposed even in this covert this semisafe fashion to those who were not he felt strangely and confusedly but excitedly inspiringly how much and how far  it was as if he had positively waited in suspense for something from her that would let him in deeper so that he might show her how he could take it  and what did in fact come as she drew out a little her farewell served sufficiently the purpose  as his success is a matter that im sure hell never mention for himself i feel you see the less scruple which its very good of me to say you know by the way she added as she addressed herself to him considering how little direct advantage ive gained from your triumphs with me  when does one ever see you  i wait at home and i languish  youll have rendered me the service mrs pocock at least she wound up of giving me one of my muchtoorare glimpses of this gentleman  i certainly should be sorry to deprive you of anything that seems so much as you describe it your natural due  mr strether and i are very old friends sarah allowed but the privilege of his society isnt a thing i shall quarrel about with any one  and yet dear sarah he freely broke in i feel when i hear you say that that you dont quite do justice to the important truth of the extent to whichas youre also mineim your natural due  i should like much better he laughed to see you fight for me  she met him mrs pocock on this with an arrest of speechwith a certain breathlessness as he immediately fancied on the score of a freedom for which she wasnt quite prepared  it had flared upfor all the harm he had intended by itbecause confoundedly he didnt want any more to be afraid about her than he wanted to be afraid about madame de vionnet  he had never naturally called her anything but sarah at home and though he had perhaps never quite so markedly invoked her as his dear that was somehow partly because no occasion had hitherto laid so effective a trap for it but something admonished him now that it was too lateunless indeed it were possibly too early and that he at any rate shouldnt have pleased mrs pocock the more by it  well mr strether she murmured with vagueness yet with sharpness while her crimson spot burned a trifle brighter and he was aware that this must be for the present the limit of her response madame de vionnet had already however come to his aid and waymarsh as if for further participation moved again back to them  it was true that the aid rendered by madame de vionnet was questionable it was a sign that for all one might confess to with her and for all she might complain of not enjoying she could still insidiously show how much of the material of conversation had accumulated between them  the real truth is you know that you sacrifice one without mercy to dear old maria  she leaves no room in your life for anybody else  do you know she enquired of mrs pocock about dear old maria  the worst is that miss gostrey is really a wonderful woman  oh yes indeed strether answered for her mrs pocock knows about miss gostrey  your mother sarah must have told you about her your mother knows everything he sturdily pursued  and i cordially admit he added with his conscious gaiety of courage that shes as wonderful a woman as you like  ah it isnt i who like dear mr strether anything to do with the matter sarah pocock promptly protested and im by no means sure i havefrom my mother or from any one elsea notion of whom youre talking about  well he wont let you see her you know madame de vionnet sympathetically threw in  he never lets meold friends as we are i mean as i am with maria  he reserves her for his best hours keeps her consummately to himself only gives us others the crumbs of the feast  well countess ive had some of the crumbs waymarsh observed with weight and covering her with his large look which led her to break in before he could go on  comment donc he shares her with you she exclaimed in droll stupefaction  take care you dont have before you go much further rather more of all ces dames than you may know what to do with  but he only continued in his massive way  i can post you about the lady mrs pocock so far as you may care to hear  ive seen her quite a number of times and i was practically present when they made acquaintance  ive kept my eye on her right along but i dont know as theres any real harm in her  harm madame de vionnet quickly echoed  why shes the dearest and cleverest of all the clever and dear  well you run her pretty close countess waymarsh returned with spirit though theres no doubt shes pretty well up in things she knows her way round europe  above all theres no doubt she does love strether  ah but we all do thatwe all love strether  it isnt a merit their fellow visitor laughed keeping to her idea with a good conscience at which our friend was aware that he marvelled though he trusted also for it as he met her exquisitely expressive eyes to some later light  the prime effect of her tone howeverand it was a truth which his own eyes gave back to her in sad ironic playcould only be to make him feel that to say such things to a man in public a woman must practically think of him as ninety years old  he had turned awkwardly responsively red he knew at her mention of maria gostrey sarah pococks presencethe particular quality of ithad made this inevitable and then he had grown still redder in proportion as he hated to have shown anything at all  he felt indeed that he was showing much as uncomfortably and almost in pain he offered up his redness to waymarsh who strangely enough seemed now to be looking at him with a certain explanatory yearning  something deepsomething built on their old old relationpassed in this complexity between them he got the sidewind of a loyalty that stood behind all actual queer questions  waymarshs dry bare humouras it gave itself to be takengloomed out to demand justice  well if you talk of miss barrace ive my chance too it appeared stiffly to nod and it granted that it was giving him away but struggled to add that it did so only to save him  the sombre glow stared it at him till it fairly sounded outto save you poor old man to save you to save you in spite of yourself yet it was somehow just this communication that showed him to himself as more than ever lost still another result of it was to put before him as never yet that between his comrade and the interest represented by sarah there was already a basis  beyond all question now yes  waymarsh had been in occult relation with mrs newsomeout out it all came in the very effort of his face  yes youre feeling my handhe as good as proclaimed it but only because this at least i shall have got out of the damned old world  that i shall have picked up the pieces into which it has caused you to crumble it was as if in short after an instant strether had not only had it from him but had recognised that so far as this went the instant had cleared the air our friend understood and approved he had the sense that they wouldnt otherwise speak of it  this would be all and it would mark in himself a kind of intelligent generosity  it was with grim sarah thensarah grim for all her gracethat waymarsh had begun at ten oclock in the morning to save him  wellif he could poor dear man with his big bleak kindness  the upshot of which crowded perception was that strether on his own side still showed no more than he absolutely had to  he showed the least possible by saying to mrs pocock after an interval much briefer than our glance at the picture reflected in him oh its as true as they pleasetheres no miss gostrey for any one but menot the least little peep  i keep her to myself  well its very good of you to notify me sarah replied without looking at him and thrown for a moment by this discrimination as the direction of her eyes showed upon a dimly desperate little community with madame de vionnet  but i hope i shant miss her too much  madame de vionnet instantly rallied  and you knowthough it might occur to oneit isnt in the least that hes ashamed of her shes reallyin a wayextremely goodlooking  ah but extremely strether laughed while he wondered at the odd part he found thus imposed on him  it continued to be so by every touch from madame de vionnet  well as i say you know i wish you would keep me a little more to yourself couldnt you name some day for me some hourand better soon than late  ill be at home whenever it best suits you therei cant say fairer  strether thought a moment while waymarsh and mrs pocock affected him as standing attentive  i did lately call on you  last weekwhile chad was out of town  yesand i was away as it happened too  you choose your moments well  but dont wait for my next absence for i shant make another madame de vionnet declared while mrs pococks here  that vow neednt keep you long fortunately sarah observed with reasserted suavity  i shall be at present but a short time in paris i have my plans for other countries  i meet a number of charming friendsand her voice seemed to caress that description of these persons  ah then her visitor cheerfully replied all the more reason tomorrow for instance or next day she continued to strether tuesday would do for me beautifully  tuesday then with pleasure  and at halfpast fiveor at six  it was ridiculous but mrs pocock and waymarsh struck him as fairly waiting for his answer  it was indeed as if they were arranged gathered for a performance the performance of europe by his confederate and himself  well the performance could only go on  say five fortyfive  five fortyfivegood and now at last madame de vionnet must leave them though it carried for herself the performance a little further i did hope so much also to see miss pocock maynt i still  sarah hesitated but she rose equal  shell return your visit with me  shes at present out with mr pocock and my brother  i seeof course mr newsome has everything to show them  he has told me so much about her  my great desires to give my daughter the opportunity of making her acquaintance  im always on the lookout for such chances for her  if i didnt bring her today it was only to make sure first that youd let me after which the charming woman risked a more intense appeal  it wouldnt suit you also to mention some near time so that we shall be sure not to lose you  strether on his side waited for sarah likewise had after all to perform and it occupied him to have been thus reminded that she had stayed at homeand on her first morning of pariswhile chad led the others forth  oh she was up to her eyes if she had stayed at home she had stayed by an understanding arrived at the evening before that waymarsh would come and find her alone  this was beginning wellfor a first day in paris and the thing might be amusing yet  but madame de vionnets earnestness was meanwhile beautiful  you may think me indiscreet but ive such a desire my jeanne shall know an american girl of the really delightful kind  you see i throw myself for it on your charity  the manner of this speech gave strether such a sense of depths below it and behind it as he hadnt yet hadministered in a way that almost frightened him to his dim divinations of reasons but if sarah still in spite of it faltered this was why he had time for a sign of sympathy with her petitioner  let me say then dear lady to back your plea that miss mamie is of the most delightful kind of allis charming among the charming  even waymarsh though with more to produce on the subject could get into motion in time  yes countess the american girls a thing that your country must at least allow ours the privilege to say we can show you  but her full beauty is only for those who know how to make use of her  ah then smiled madame de vionnet thats exactly what i want to do im sure she has much to teach us  it was wonderful but what was scarce less so was that strether found himself by the quick effect of it moved another way  oh that may be  but dont speak of your own exquisite daughter you know as if she werent pure perfection  i at least wont take that from you mademoiselle de vionnet he explained in considerable form to mrs pocock is pure perfection  mademoiselle de vionnet is exquisite  it had been perhaps a little portentous but ah sarah simply glittered  waymarsh himself for that matter apparently recognised in respect to the facts the need of a larger justice and he had with it an inclination to sarah  miss janes strikingly handsomein the regular french style  it somehow made both strether and madame de vionnet laugh out though at the very moment he caught in sarahs eyes as glancing at the speaker a vague but unmistakeable you too  it made waymarsh in fact look consciously over her head  madame de vionnet meanwhile however made her point in her own way  i wish indeed i could offer you my poor child as a dazzling attraction  it would make ones position simple enough  shes as good as she can be but of course shes different and the question is nowin the light of the way things seem to goif she isnt after all too different too different i mean from the splendid type every one is so agreed that your wonderful country produces  on the other hand of course mr newsome who knows it so well has as a good friend dear kind man that he is done everything he canto keep us from fatal benightednessfor my small shy creature well she wound up after mrs pocock had signified in a murmur still a little stiff that she would speak to her own young charge on the questionwell we shall sit my child and i and wait and wait and wait for you but her last fine turn was for strether  do speak of us in such a way  as that something cant but come of it  oh something shall come of it  i take a great interest he further declared and in proof of it the next moment he had gone with her down to her carriage      book ninth     i   the difficulty is strether said to madame de vionnet a couple of days later that i cant surprise them into the smallest sign of his not being the same old chad theyve been for the last three years glowering at across the sea  they simply wont give any and as a policy you knowwhat you call a parti pris a deep gamethats positively remarkable  it was so remarkable that our friend had pulled up before his hostess with the vision of it he had risen from his chair at the end of ten minutes and begun as a help not to worry to move about before her quite as he moved before maria  he had kept his appointment with her to the minute and had been intensely impatient though divided in truth between the sense of having everything to tell her and the sense of having nothing at all  the short interval had in the face of their complication multiplied his impressionsit being meanwhile to be noted moreover that he already frankly already almost publicly viewed the complication as common to them  if madame de vionnet under sarahs eyes had pulled him into her boat there was by this time no doubt whatever that he had remained in it and that what he had really most been conscious of for many hours together was the movement of the vessel itself  they were in it together this moment as they hadnt yet been and he hadnt at present uttered the least of the words of alarm or remonstrance that had died on his lips at the hotel  he had other things to say to her than that she had put him in a position so quickly had his position grown to affect him as quite excitingly altogether richly inevitable  that the outlook howevergiven the point of exposurehadnt cleared up half so much as he had reckoned was the first warning she received from him on his arrival  she had replied with indulgence that he was in too great a hurry and had remarked soothingly that if she knew how to be patient surely he might be  he felt her presence on the spot he felt her tone and everything about her as an aid to that effort and it was perhaps one of the proofs of her success with him that he seemed so much to take his ease while they talked by the time he had explained to her why his impressions though multiplied still baffled him it was as if he had been familiarly talking for hours  they baffled him because sarahwell sarah was deep deeper than she had ever yet had a chance to show herself he didnt say that this was partly the effect of her opening so straight down as it were into her mother and that given mrs newsomes profundity the shaft thus sunk might well have a reach but he wasnt without a resigned apprehension that at such a rate of confidence between the two women he was likely soon to be moved to show how already at moments it had been for him as if he were dealing directly with mrs newsome  sarah to a certainty would have begun herself to feel it in himand this naturally put it in her power to torment him the more  from the moment she knew he could be tormented  but why can you behis companion was surprised at his use of the word  because im made soi think of everything  ah one must never do that she smiled  one must think of as few things as possible  then he answered one must pick them out right  but all i mean isfor i express myself with violencethat shes in a position to watch me  theres an element of suspense for me and she can see me wriggle  but my wriggling doesnt matter he pursued  i can bear it  besides i shall wriggle out  the picture at any rate stirred in her an appreciation that he felt to be sincere  i dont see how a man can be kinder to a woman than you are to me  well kind was what he wanted to be yet even while her charming eyes rested on him with the truth of this he none the less had his humour of honesty  when i say suspense i mean you know he laughed suspense about my own case too  oh yesabout your own case too  it diminished his magnanimity but she only looked at him the more tenderly  not however he went on that i want to talk to you about that its my own little affair and i mentioned it simply as part of mrs pococks advantage no no though there was a queer present temptation in it and his suspense was so real that to fidget was a relief he wouldnt talk to her about mrs newsome wouldnt work off on her the anxiety produced in him by sarahs calculated omissions of reference  the effect she produced of representing her mother had been producedand that was just the immense the uncanny part of itwithout her having so much as mentioned that lady  she had brought no message had alluded to no question had only answered his enquiries with hopeless limited propriety  she had invented a way of meeting themas if he had been a polite perfunctory poor relation of distant degreethat made them almost ridiculous in him  he couldnt moreover on his own side ask much without appearing to publish how he had lately lacked news a circumstance of which it was sarahs profound policy not to betray a suspicion  these things all the same he wouldnt breathe to madame de vionnetmuch as they might make him walk up and down and what he didnt sayas well as what she didnt for she had also her high decenciesenhanced the effect of his being there with her at the end of ten minutes more intimately on the basis of saving her than he had yet had occasion to be  it ended in fact by being quite beautiful between them the number of things they had a manifest consciousness of not saying  he would have liked to turn her critically to the subject of mrs pocock but he so stuck to the line he felt to be the point of honour and of delicacy that he scarce even asked her what her personal impression had been he knew it for that matter without putting her to trouble that she wondered how with such elements sarah could still have no charm was one of the principal things she held her tongue about strether would have been interested in her estimate of the elementsindubitably there some of them and to be appraised according to tastebut he denied himself even the luxury of this diversion  the way madame de vionnet affected him today was in itself a kind of demonstration of the happy employment of gifts  how could a woman think sarah had charm who struck one as having arrived at it herself by such different roads  on the other hand of course sarah wasnt obliged to have it  he felt as if somehow madame de vionnet was  the great question meanwhile was what chad thought of his sister which was naturally ushered in by that of sarahs apprehension of chad that they could talk of and with a freedom purchased by their discretion in other senses  the difficulty however was that they were reduced as yet to conjecture  he had given them in the day or two as little of a lead as sarah and madame de vionnet mentioned that she hadnt seen him since his sisters arrival  and does that strike you as such an age  she met it in all honesty  oh i wont pretend i dont miss him sometimes i see him every day  our friendships like that  make what you will of it she whimsically smiled a little flicker of the kind occasional in her that had more than once moved him to wonder what he might best make of her  but hes perfectly right she hastened to add and i wouldnt have him fail in any way at present for the world id sooner not see him for three months i begged him to be beautiful to them and he fully feels it for himself  strether turned away under his quick perception she was so odd a mixture of lucidity and mystery  she fell in at moments with the theory about her he most cherished and she seemed at others to blow it into air  she spoke now as if her art were all an innocence and then again as if her innocence were all an art oh hes giving himself up and hell do so to the end  how can he but want now that its within reach his full impressionwhich is much more important you know than either yours or mine  but hes just soaking strether said as he came back hes going in conscientiously for a saturation  im bound to say he is very good  ah she quietly replied to whom do you say it  and then more quietly still  hes capable of anything  strether more than reaffirmedoh hes excellent  i more and more like he insisted to see him with them though the oddity of this tone between them grew sharper for him even while they spoke it placed the young man so before them as the result of her interest and the product of her genius acknowledged so her part in the phenomenon and made the phenomenon so rare that more than ever yet he might have been on the very point of asking her for some more detailed account of the whole business than he had yet received from her  the occasion almost forced upon him some question as to how she had managed and as to the appearance such miracles presented from her own singularly close place of survey the moment in fact however passed giving way to more present history and he continued simply to mark his appreciation of the happy truth  its a tremendous comfort to feel how one can trust him and then again while for a little she said nothingas if after all to her trust there might be a special limit  i mean for making a good show to them  yes she thoughtfully returnedbut if they shut their eyes to it  strether for an instant had his own thought  well perhaps that wont matter  you mean because he probablydo what they willwont like them  oh do what they will  they wont do much especially if sarah hasnt morewell more than one has yet made outto give  madame de vionnet weighed it  ah she has all her grace  it was a statement over which for a little they could look at each other sufficiently straight and though it produced no protest from strether the effect was somehow as if he had treated it as a joke she may be persuasive and caressing with him she may be eloquent beyond words she may get hold of him she wound upwell as neither you nor i have  yes she mayand now strether smiled  but he has spent all his time each day with jim  hes still showing jim round  she visibly wondered  then how about jim  strether took a turn before he answered  hasnt he given you jim hasnt he before this done him for you  he was a little at a loss doesnt he tell you things  she hesitated  noand their eyes once more gave and took not as you do  you somehow make me see themor at least feel them and i havent asked too much she added ive of late wanted so not to worry him  ah for that so have i he said with encouraging assent so thatas if she had answered everythingthey were briefly sociable on it it threw him back on his other thought with which he took another turn stopping again however presently with something of a glow you see jims really immense  i think it will be jim wholl do it  she wondered  get hold of him  nojust the other thing  counteract sarahs spell and he showed now our friend how far he had worked it out  jims intensely cynical  oh dear jim madame de vionnet vaguely smiled  yes literallydear jim  hes awful  what he wants heaven forgive him is to help us  you meanshe was eagerhelp me  well chad and me in the first place  but he throws you in too though without as yet seeing you much  only so far as he does see youif you dont mindhe sees you as awful  awfulshe wanted it all  a regular bad onethough of course of a tremendously superior kind dreadful delightful irresistible  ah dear jim  i should like to know him  i must  yes naturally  but will it do  you may you know strether suggested disappoint him  she was droll and humble about it  i can but try  but my wickedness then she went on is my recommendation for him  your wickedness and the charms with which in such a degree as yours he associates it  he understands you see that chad and i have above all wanted to have a good time and his view is simple and sharp nothing will persuade himin the light that is of my behaviourthat i really didnt quite as much as chad come over to have one before it was too late  he wouldnt have expected it of me but men of my age at woollettand especially the least likely oneshave been noted as liable to strange outbreaks belated uncanny clutches at the unusual the ideal  its an effect that a lifetime of woollett has quite been observed as having and i thus give it to you in jims view for what its worth  now his wife and his motherinlaw strether continued to explain have as in honour bound no patience with such phenomena late or earlywhich puts jim as against his relatives on the other side  besides he added i dont think he really wants chad back if chad doesnt come  hell havemadame de vionnet quite apprehendedmore of the free hand  well chads the bigger man  so hell work now en dessous to keep him quiet  nohe wont work at all and he wont do anything en dessous hes very decent and wont be a traitor in the camp  but hell be amused with his own little view of our duplicity hell sniff up what he supposes to be paris from morning till night and hell be as to the rest for chadwell just what he is  she thought it over  a warning  he met it almost with glee  you are as wonderful as everybody says and then to explain all he meant  i drove him about for his first hour and do you know whatall beautifully unconscioushe most put before me  why that something like that is at bottom as an improvement to his present state as in fact the real redemption of it what they think it may not be too late to make of our friend with which as taking it in she seemed in her recurrent alarm bravely to gaze at the possibility he completed his statement  but it is too late  thanks to you  it drew from her again one of her indefinite reflexions  oh meafter all  he stood before her so exhilarated by his demonstration that he could fairly be jocular  everythings comparative  youre better than that  youshe could but answer himare better than anything but she had another thought  will mrs pocock come to me  oh yesshell do that  as soon that is as my friend waymarshher friend nowleaves her leisure  she showed an interest  is he so much her friend as that  why didnt you see it all at the hotel  ohshe was amusedall is a good deal to say  i dont knowi forget  i lost myself in her  you were splendid strether returnedbut all isnt a good deal to say  its only a little  yet its charming so far as it goes  she wants a man to herself  and hasnt she got you  do you think she looked at meor even at youas if she had strether easily dismissed that irony  every one you see must strike her as having somebody  youve got chadand chad has got you  i seeshe made of it what she could  and youve got maria  well he on his side accepted that  ive got maria  and maria has got me  so it goes  but mr jimwhom has he got  oh he has gotor its as if he hadthe whole place  but for mr waymarshshe recalledisnt miss barrace before any one else  he shook his head  miss barrace is a raffinee and her amusement wont lose by mrs pocock  it will gain ratherespecially if sarah triumphs and she comes in for a view of it  how well you know us madame de vionnet at this frankly sighed  noit seems to me its we that i know  i know sarahits perhaps on that ground only that my feet are firm  waymarsh will take her round while chad takes jimand i shall be i assure you delighted for both of them  sarah will have had what she requiresshe will have paid her tribute to the ideal and he will have done about the same  in paris its in the airso what can one do less  if theres a point that beyond any other sarah wants to make its that she didnt come out to be narrow  we shall feel at least that  oh she sighed the quantity we seem likely to feel  but what becomes in these conditions of the girl  of mamieif were all provided  ah for that said strether you can trust chad  to be you mean all right to her  to pay her every attention as soon as he has polished off jim he wants what jim can give himand what jim really wontthough he has had it all and more than all from me  he wants in short his own personal impression and hell get itstrong  but as soon as he has got it mamie wont suffer  oh mamie mustnt suffer madame de vionnet soothingly emphasised  but strether could reassure her  dont fear  as soon as he has done with jim jim will fall to me  and then youll see  it was as if in a moment she saw already yet she still waited then is she really quite charming she asked  he had got up with his last words and gathered in his hat and gloves i dont know im watching  im studying the case as it wereand i dare say i shall be able to tell you  she wondered  is it a case  yesi think so  at any rate i shall see  but havent you known her before  yes he smiledbut somehow at home she wasnt a case she has become one since it was as if he made it out for himself she has become one here  so very very soon  he measured it laughing  not sooner than i did  and you became one  very very soon  the day i arrived  her intelligent eyes showed her thought of it  ah but the day you arrived you met maria  whom has miss pocock met  he paused again but he brought it out  hasnt she met chad  certainlybut not for the first time  hes an old friend at which strether had a slow amused significant headshake that made her go on you mean that for her at least hes a new personthat she sees him as different  she sees him as different  and how does she see him  strether gave it up  how can one tell how a deep little girl sees a deep young man  is every one so deep  is she too  so it strikes me deeper than i thought  but wait a littlebetween us well make it out  youll judge for that matter yourself  madame de vionnet looked for the moment fairly bent on the chance then she will come with heri mean mamie with mrs pocock  certainly  her curiosity if nothing else will in any case work that  but leave it all to chad  ah wailed madame de vionnet turning away a little wearily the things i leave to chad  the tone of it made him look at her with a kindness that showed his vision of her suspense  but he fell back on his confidence oh welltrust him  trust him all the way he had indeed no sooner so spoken than the queer displacement of his point of view appeared again to come up for him in the very sound which drew from him a short laugh immediately checked  he became still more advisory when they do come give them plenty of miss jeanne  let mamie see her well  she looked for a moment as if she placed them face to face for mamie to hate her  he had another of his corrective headshakes  mamie wont trust them  she looked at him hard and then as if it were what she must always come back to  its you i trust  but i was sincere she said at the hotel  i did i do want my child  wellstrether waited with deference while she appeared to hesitate as to how to put it  well to do what she can for me  strether for a little met her eyes on it after which something that might have been unexpected to her came from him  poor little duck  not more expected for himself indeed might well have been her echo of it  poor little duck  but she immensely wants herself she said to see our friends cousin  is that what she thinks her  its what we call the young lady  he thought again then with a laugh  well your daughter will help you  and now at last he took leave of her as he had been intending for five minutes  but she went part of the way with him accompanying him out of the room and into the next and the next  her noble old apartment offered a succession of three the first two of which indeed on entering smaller than the last but each with its faded and formal air enlarged the office of the antechamber and enriched the sense of approach  strether fancied them liked them and passing through them with her more slowly now met a sharp renewal of his original impression  he stopped he looked back the whole thing made a vista which he found high melancholy and sweetfull once more of dim historic shades of the faint faraway cannonroar of the great empire it was doubtless half the projection of his mind but his mind was a thing that among old waxed parquets pale shades of pink and green pseudoclassic candelabra he had always needfully to reckon with they could easily make him irrelevant the oddity the originality the poetryhe didnt know what to call itof chads connexion reaffirmed for him its romantic side they ought to see this you know  they must  the pococksshe looked about in deprecation she seemed to see gaps he didnt  mamie and sarahmamie in particular  my shabby old place  but their things  oh their things  you were talking of what will do something for you  so that it strikes you she broke in that my poor place may oh she ruefully mused that would be desperate  do you know what i wish he went on  i wish mrs newsome herself could have a look  she stared missing a little his logic  it would make a difference  her tone was so earnest that as he continued to look about he laughed it might  but youve told her you tell me  all about you  yes a wonderful story  but theres all the indescribablewhat one gets only on the spot  thank you she charmingly and sadly smiled  its all about me here he freely continued  mrs newsome feels things  but she seemed doomed always to come back to doubt  no one feels so much as you  nonot any one  so much the worse then for every one  its very easy  they were by this time in the antechamber still alone together as she hadnt rung for a servant  the antechamber was high and square grave and suggestive too a little cold and slippery even in summer and with a few old prints that were precious strether divined on the walls he stood in the middle slightly lingering vaguely directing his glasses while leaning against the doorpost of the room she gently pressed her cheek to the side of the recess  you would have been a friend  iit startled him a little  for the reason you say  youre not stupid and then abruptly as if bringing it out were somehow founded on that fact were marrying jeanne  it affected him on the spot as a move in a game and he was even then not without the sense that that wasnt the way jeanne should be married  but he quickly showed his interest thoughas quickly afterwards struck himwith an absurd confusion of mind  you you andanot chad  of course it was the childs father who made the we but to the childs father it would have cost him an effort to allude  yet didnt it seem the next minute that monsieur de vionnet was after all not in questionsince she had gone on to say that it was indeed to chad she referred and that he had been in the whole matter kindness itself  if i must tell you all it is he himself who has put us in the way  i mean in the way of an opportunity that so far as i can yet see is all i could possibly have dreamed of  for all the trouble monsieur de vionnet will ever take  it was the first time she had spoken to him of her husband and he couldnt have expressed how much more intimate with her it suddenly made him feel  it wasnt much in truththere were other things in what she was saying that were far more but it was as if while they stood there together so easily in these cold chambers of the past the single touch had shown the reach of her confidence but our friend she asked hasnt then told you  he has told me nothing  well it has come with rather a rushall in a very few days and hasnt moreover yet taken a form that permits an announcement  its only for youabsolutely you alonethat i speak i so want you to know the sense he had so often had since the first hour of his disembarkment of being further and further in treated him again at this moment to another twinge but in this wonderful way of her putting him in there continued to be something exquisitely remorseless monsieur de vionnet will accept what he must accept he has proposed half a dozen thingseach one more impossible than the other and he wouldnt have found this if he lives to a hundred chad found it she continued with her lighted faintly flushed her conscious confidential face in the quietest way in the world or rather it found himfor everything finds him i mean finds him right  youll think we do such things strangelybut at my age she smiled one has to accept ones conditions  our young mans people had seen her one of his sisters a charming womanwe know all about themhad observed her somewhere with me  she had spoken to her brotherturned him on and we were again observed poor jeanne and i without our in the least knowing it  it was at the beginning of the winter it went on for some time it outlasted our absence it began again on our return and it luckily seems all right  the young man had met chad and he got a friend to approach himas having a decent interest in us  mr newsome looked well before he leaped he kept beautifully quiet and satisfied himself fully then only he spoke  its what has for some time past occupied us  it seems as if it were what would do really really all one could wish  there are only two or three points to be settledthey depend on her father  but this time i think were safe  strether consciously gaping a little had fairly hung upon her lips i hope so with all my heart and then he permitted himself does nothing depend on her  ah naturally everything did  but shes pleased comme tout  she has been perfectly free and heour young friendis really a combination i quite adore him  strether just made sure  you mean your future soninlaw  future if we all bring it off  ah well said strether decorously i heartily hope you may there seemed little else for him to say though her communication had the oddest effect on him  vaguely and confusedly he was troubled by it feeling as if he had even himself been concerned in something deep and dim  he had allowed for depths but these were greater  and it was as if oppressivelyindeed absurdlyhe was responsible for what they had now thrown up to the surface  it wasthrough something ancient and cold in itwhat he would have called the real thing  in short his hostesss news though he couldnt have explained why was a sensible shock and his oppression a weight he felt he must somehow or other immediately get rid of  there were too many connexions missing to make it tolerable he should do anything else  he was prepared to sufferbefore his own inner tribunalfor chad he was prepared to suffer even for madame de vionnet  but he wasnt prepared to suffer for the little girl so now having said the proper thing he wanted to get away  she held him an instant however with another appeal  do i seem to you very awful  awful  why so  but he called it to himself even as he spoke his biggest insincerity yet  our arrangements are so different from yours  mine  oh he could dismiss that too  i havent any arrangements  then you must accept mine all the more that theyre excellent theyre founded on a vieille sagesse  there will be much more if all goes well for you to hear and to know and everything believe me for you to like  dont be afraid youll be satisfied thus she could talk to him of what of her innermost lifefor that was what it came tohe must accept thus she could extraordinarily speak as if in such an affair his being satisfied had an importance  it was all a wonder and made the whole case larger  he had struck himself at the hotel before sarah and waymarsh as being in her boat but where on earth was he now  this question was in the air till her own lips quenched it with another  and do you suppose hewho loves her sowould do anything reckless or cruel  he wondered what he supposed  do you mean your young man  i mean yours  i mean mr newsome it flashed for strether the next moment a finer light and the light deepened as she went on he takes thank god the truest tenderest interest in her  it deepened indeed  oh im sure of that  you were talking she said about ones trusting him  you see then how i do  he waited a momentit all came  i seei see he felt he really did see  he wouldnt hurt her for the world norassuming she marries at allrisk anything that might make against her happiness andwillingly at leasthe would never hurt me  her face with what he had by this time grasped told him more than her words whether something had come into it or whether he only read clearer her whole storywhat at least he then took for suchreached out to him from it  with the initiative she now attributed to chad it all made a sense and this sensea light a lead was what had abruptly risen before him  he wanted once more to get off with these things which was at last made easy a servant having for his assistance on hearing voices in the hall just come forward all that strether had made out was while the man opened the door and impersonally waited summed up in his last word  i dont think you know chad will tell me anything  noperhaps not yet  and i wont as yet speak to him  ah thats as youll think best  you must judge  she had finally given him her hand which he held a moment  how much i have to judge  everything said madame de vionnet  a remark that was indeedwith the refined disguised suppressed passion of her facewhat he most carried away    ii   so far as a direct approach was concerned sarah had neglected him for the week now about to end with a civil consistency of chill that giving him a higher idea of her social resource threw him back on the general reflexion that a woman could always be amazing it indeed helped a little to console him that he felt sure she had for the same period also left chads curiosity hanging though on the other hand for his personal relief chad could at least go through the various motionsand he made them extraordinarily numerousof seeing she had a good time  there wasnt a motion on which in her presence poor strether could so much as venture and all he could do when he was out of it was to walk over for a talk with maria  he walked over of course much less than usual but he found a special compensation in a certain halfhour during which toward the close of a crowded empty expensive day his several companions seemed to him so disposed of as to give his forms and usages a rest  he had been with them in the morning and had nevertheless called on the pococks in the afternoon but their whole group he then found had dispersed after a fashion of which it would amuse miss gostrey to hear  he was sorry again gratefully sorry she was so out of itshe who had really put him in but she had fortunately always her appetite for news  the pure flame of the disinterested burned in her cave of treasures as a lamp in a byzantine vault  it was just now as happened that for so fine a sense as hers a near view would have begun to pay  within three days precisely the situation on which he was to report had shown signs of an equilibrium the effect of his look in at the hotel was to confirm this appearance if the equilibrium might only prevail sarah was out with waymarsh mamie was out with chad and jim was out alone  later on indeed he himself was booked to jim was to take him that evening to the varietieswhich strether was careful to pronounce as jim pronounced them  miss gostrey drank it in  what then tonight do the others do  well it has been arranged  waymarsh takes sarah to dine at bignons  she wondered  and what do they do after  they cant come straight home  no they cant come straight homeat least sarah cant its their secret but i think ive guessed it then as she waited the circus  it made her stare a moment longer then laugh almost to extravagance theres no one like you  like mehe only wanted to understand  like all of you togetherlike all of us  woollett milrose and their products  were abysmalbut may we never be less so mr newsome she continued meanwhile takes miss pocock  preciselyto the francais  to see what you took waymarsh and me to a familybill  ah then may mr chad enjoy it as i did  but she saw so much in things  do they spend their evenings your young people like that alone together  well theyre young peoplebut theyre old friends  i see i see  and do they dinefor a differenceat brebants  oh where they dine is their secret too  but ive my idea that it will be very quietly at chads own place  shell come to him there alone  they looked at each other a moment  he has known her from a child besides said strether with emphasis mamies remarkable  shes splendid  she wondered  do you mean she expects to bring it off  getting hold of him  noi think not  she doesnt want him enoughor doesnt believe in her power on which as he said nothing she continued  she finds she doesnt care for him  noi think she finds she does  but thats what i mean by so describing her  its if she does that shes splendid  but well see he wound up where she comes out  you seem to show me sufficiently miss gostrey laughed where she goes in  but is her childhoods friend she asked permitting himself recklessly to flirt with her  nonot that  chads also splendid  theyre all splendid he declared with a sudden strange sound of wistfulness and envy theyre at least happy  happyit appeared with their various difficulties to surprise her  welli seem to myself among them the only one who isnt  she demurred  with your constant tribute to the ideal  he had a laugh at his tribute to the ideal but he explained after a moment his impression  i mean theyre living  theyre rushing about ive already had my rushing  im waiting  but arent you she asked by way of cheer waiting with me  he looked at her in all kindness  yesif it werent for that  and you help me to wait she said  however she went on ive really something for you that will help you to wait and which you shall have in a minute  only theres something more i want from you first i revel in sarah  so do i  if it werent he again amusedly sighed for that  well you owe more to women than any man i ever saw  we do seem to keep you going  yet sarah as i see her must be great  she is strether fully assented  great  whatever happens she wont with these unforgettable days have lived in vain  miss gostrey had a pause  you mean she has fallen in love  i mean she wonders if she hasntand it serves all her purpose  it has indeed maria laughed served womens purposes before  yesfor giving in  but i doubt if the ideaas an ideahas ever up to now answered so well for holding out  thats her tribute to the idealwe each have our own  its her romanceand it seems to me better on the whole than mine  to have it in paris too he explainedon this classic ground in this charged infectious air with so sudden an intensity  well its more than she expected  she has had in short to recognise the breaking out for her of a real affinityand with everything to enhance the drama  miss gostrey followed  jim for instance  jim  jim hugely enhances  jim was made to enhance  and then mr waymarsh  its the crowning touchit supplies the colour hes positively separated  and she herself unfortunately isntthat supplies the colour too miss gostrey was all there  but somehow  is he in love  strether looked at her a long time then looked all about the room then came a little nearer  will you never tell any one in the world as long as ever you live  never it was charming  he thinks sarah really is  but he has no fear strether hastened to add  of her being affected by it  of his being  he likes it but he knows she can hold out  hes helping her hes floating her over by kindness  maria rather funnily considered it  floating her over in champagne the kindness of dining her nose to nose at the hour when all paris is crowding to profane delights and in thewell in the great temple as one hears of it of pleasure  thats just it for both of them strether insistedand all of a supreme innocence  the parisian place the feverish hour the putting before her of a hundred francs worth of food and drink which theyll scarcely touchall thats the dear mans own romance the expensive kind expensive in francs and centimes in which he abounds and the circus afterwardswhich is cheaper but which hell find some means of making as dear as possiblethats also his tribute to the ideal  it does for him  hell see her through  they wont talk of anything worse than you and me  well were bad enough perhaps thank heaven she laughed to upset them  mr waymarsh at any rate is a hideous old coquette and the next moment she had dropped everything for a different pursuit  what you dont appear to know is that jeanne de vionnet has become engaged shes to marryit has been definitely arrangedyoung monsieur de montbron  he fairly blushed  thenif you know itits out  dont i often know things that are not out  however she said this will be out tomorrow  but i see ive counted too much on your possible ignorance  youve been before me and i dont make you jump as i hoped  he gave a gasp at her insight  you never fail  ive had my jump i had it when i first heard  then if you knew why didnt you tell me as soon as you came in  because i had it from her as a thing not yet to be spoken of  miss gostrey wondered  from madame de vionnet herself  as a probabilitynot quite a certainty  a good cause in which chad has been working  so ive waited  you need wait no longer she returned  it reached me yesterdayroundabout and accidental but by a person who had had it from one of the young mans own peopleas a thing quite settled  i was only keeping it for you  you thought chad wouldnt have told me  she hesitated  well if he hasnt  he hasnt  and yet the thing appears to have been practically his doing  so there we are  there we are maria candidly echoed  thats why i jumped  i jumped he continued to explain because it means this disposition of the daughter that theres now nothing else nothing else but him and the mother  stillit simplifies  it simplifieshe fully concurred  but thats precisely where we are  it marks a stage in his relation  the act is his answer to mrs newsomes demonstration  it tells maria asked the worst  the worst  but is the worst what he wants sarah to know  he doesnt care for sarah  at which miss gostreys eyebrows went up  you mean she has already dished herself  strether took a turn about he had thought it out again and again before this to the end but the vista seemed each time longer  he wants his good friend to know the best  i mean the measure of his attachment  she asked for a sign and he thought of that one  there it is  a concession to her jealousy  strether pulled up  yescall it that  make it luridfor that makes my problem richer  certainly let us have it luridfor i quite agree with you that we want none of our problems poor  but let us also have it clear can he in the midst of such a preoccupation or on the heels of it have seriously cared for jeannecared i mean as a young man at liberty would have cared  well strether had mastered it  i think he can have thought it would be charming if he could care  it would be nicer  nicer than being tied up to marie  yesthan the discomfort of an attachment to a person he can never hope short of a catastrophe to marry  and he was quite right said strether  it would certainly have been nicer  even when a things already nice there mostly is some other thing that would have been niceror as to which we wonder if it wouldnt  but his question was all the same a dream  he couldnt care in that way  he is tied up to marie  the relation is too special and has gone too far  its the very basis and his recent lively contribution toward establishing jeanne in life has been his definite and final acknowledgement to madame de vionnet that he has ceased squirming i doubt meanwhile he went on if sarah has at all directly attacked him  his companion brooded  but wont he wish for his own satisfaction to make his ground good to her  nohell leave it to me hell leave everything to me  i sort of feelhe worked it outthat the whole thing will come upon me  yes i shall have every inch and every ounce of it  i shall be used for it  and strether lost himself in the prospect  then he fancifully expressed the issue  to the last drop of my blood  maria however roundly protested  ah youll please keep a drop for me  i shall have a use for itwhich she didnt however follow up she had come back the next moment to another matter mrs pocock with her brother is trusting only to her general charm  so it would seem  and the charms not working  well strether put it otherwise shes sounding the note of homewhich is the very best thing she can do  the best for madame de vionnet  the best for home itself  the natural one the right one  right maria asked when it fails  strether had a pause  the difficultys jim  jims the note of home  she debated  ah surely not the note of mrs newsome  but he had it all  the note of the home for which mrs newsome wants himthe home of the business  jim stands with his little legs apart at the door of that tent and jim is frankly speaking extremely awful  maria stared  and you in you poor thing for your evening with him  oh hes all right for me strether laughed  any ones good enough for me  but sarah shouldnt all the same have brought him she doesnt appreciate him  his friend was amused with this statement of it  doesnt know you mean how bad he is  strether shook his head with decision  not really  she wondered  then doesnt mrs newsome  it made him frankly do the same  well nosince you ask me  maria rubbed it in  not really either  not at all  she rates him rather high with which indeed immediately he took himself up  well he is good too in his way it depends on what you want him for  miss gostrey however wouldnt let it depend on anythingwouldnt have it and wouldnt want him at any price  it suits my book she said that he should be impossible and it suits it still better she more imaginatively added that mrs newsome doesnt know he is  strether in consequence had to take it from her but he fell back on something else  ill tell you who does really know  mr waymarsh  never  never indeed  im not always thinking of mr waymarsh in fact i find now i never am then he mentioned the person as if there were a good deal in it  mamie  his own sister  oddly enough it but let her down  what good will that do  none perhaps  but thereas usualwe are    iii   there they were yet again accordingly for two days more when strether on being at mrs pococks hotel ushered into that ladys salon found himself at first assuming a mistake on the part of the servant who had introduced him and retired  the occupants hadnt come in for the room looked empty as only a room can look in paris of a fine afternoon when the faint murmur of the huge collective life carried on out of doors strays among scattered objects even as a summer air idles in a lonely garden  our friend looked about and hesitated observed on the evidence of a table charged with purchases and other matters that sarah had become possessedby no aid from himof the last number of the salmoncoloured revue noted further that mamie appeared to have received a present of fromentins maitres dautrefois from chad who had written her name on the cover and pulled up at the sight of a heavy letter addressed in a hand he knew this letter forwarded by a banker and arriving in mrs pococks absence had been placed in evidence and it drew from the fact of its being unopened a sudden queer power to intensify the reach of its author  it brought home to him the scale on which mrs newsomefor she had been copious indeed this timewas writing to her daughter while she kept him in durance and it had altogether such an effect upon him as made him for a few minutes stand still and breathe low  in his own room at his own hotel he had dozens of wellfilled envelopes superscribed in that character and there was actually something in the renewal of his interrupted vision of the character that played straight into the so frequent question of whether he werent already disinherited beyond appeal  it was such an assurance as the sharp downstrokes of her pen hadnt yet had occasion to give him but they somehow at the present crisis stood for a probable absoluteness in any decree of the writer  he looked at sarahs name and address in short as if he had been looking hard into her mothers face and then turned from it as if the face had declined to relax  but since it was in a manner as if mrs newsome were thereby all the more instead of the less in the room and were conscious sharply and sorely conscious of himself so he felt both held and hushed summoned to stay at least and take his punishment  by staying accordingly he took itcreeping softly and vaguely about and waiting for sarah to come in  she would come in if he stayed long enough and he had now more than ever the sense of her success in leaving him a prey to anxiety  it wasnt to be denied that she had had a happy instinct from the point of view of woollett in placing him thus at the mercy of her own initiative it was very well to try to say he didnt carethat she might break ground when she would might never break it at all if she wouldnt and that he had no confession whatever to wait upon her with  he breathed from day to day an air that damnably required clearing and there were moments when he quite ached to precipitate that process  he couldnt doubt that should she only oblige him by surprising him just as he then was a clarifying scene of some sort would result from the concussion  he humbly circulated in this spirit till he suddenly had a fresh arrest  both the windows of the room stood open to the balcony but it was only now that in the glass of the leaf of one of them folded back he caught a reflexion quickly recognised as the colour of a ladys dress  somebody had been then all the while on the balcony and the person whoever it might be was so placed between the windows as to be hidden from him while on the other hand the many sounds of the street had covered his own entrance and movements  if the person were sarah he might on the spot therefore be served to his taste  he might lead her by a move or two up to the remedy for his vain tension as to which should he get nothing else from it he would at least have the relief of pulling down the roof on their heads  there was fortunately no one at hand to observein respect to his valourthat even on this completed reasoning he still hung fire  he had been waiting for mrs pocock and the sound of the oracle but he had to gird himself afreshwhich he did in the embrasure of the window neither advancing nor retreatingbefore provoking the revelation  it was apparently for sarah to come more into view he was in that case there at her service she did however as meanwhile happened come more into view only she luckily came at the last minute as a contradiction of sarah  the occupant of the balcony was after all quite another person a person presented on a second look by a charming back and a slight shift of her position as beautiful brilliant unconscious mamiemamie alone at home mamie passing her time in her own innocent way mamie in short rather shabbily used but mamie absorbed interested and interesting with her arms on the balustrade and her attention dropped to the street she allowed strether to watch her to consider several things without her turning round  but the oddity was that when he had so watched and considered he simply stepped back into the room without following up his advantage  he revolved there again for several minutes quite as with something new to think of and as if the bearings of the possibility of sarah had been superseded  for frankly yes it had bearings thus to find the girl in solitary possession  there was something in it that touched him to a point not to have been reckoned beforehand something that softly but quite pressingly spoke to him and that spoke the more each time he paused again at the edge of the balcony and saw her still unaware  her companions were plainly scattered sarah would be off somewhere with waymarsh and chad off somewhere with jim  strether didnt at all mentally impute to chad that he was with his good friend he gave him the benefit of supposing him involved in appearances that had he had to describe themfor instance to mariahe would have conveniently qualified as more subtle  it came to him indeed the next thing that there was perhaps almost an excess of refinement in having left mamie in such weather up there alone however she might in fact have extemporised under the charm of the rue de rivoli a little makeshift paris of wonder arid fancy  our friend in any case now recognisedand it was as if at the recognition mrs newsomes fixed intensity had suddenly with a deep audible gasp grown thin and vaguethat day after day he had been conscious in respect to his young lady of something odd and ambiguous yet something into which he could at last read a meaning  it had been at the most this mystery an obsessionoh an obsession agreeable and it had just now fallen into its place as at the touch of a spring  it had represented the possibility between them of some communication baffled by accident and delaythe possibility even of some relation as yet unacknowledged  there was always their old relation the fruit of the woollett years but thatand it was what was strangesthad nothing whatever in common with what was now in the air  as a child as a bud and then again as a flower of expansion mamie had bloomed for him freely in the almost incessantly open doorways of home where he remembered her as first very forward as then very backwardfor he had carried on at one period in mrs newsomes parlours oh mrs newsomes phases and his own a course of english literature reenforced by exams and teasand once more finally as very much in advance  but he had kept no great sense of points of contact it not being in the nature of things at woollett that the freshest of the buds should find herself in the same basket with the most withered of the winter apples  the child had given sharpness above all to his sense of the flight of time it was but the day before yesterday that he had tripped up on her hoop yet his experience of remarkable womendestined it would seem remarkably to growfelt itself ready this afternoon quite braced itself to include her  she had in fine more to say to him than he had ever dreamed the pretty girl of the moment could have and the proof of the circumstance was that visibly unmistakeably she had been able to say it to no one else  it was something she could mention neither to her brother to her sisterinlaw nor to chad though he could just imagine that had she still been at home she might have brought it out as a supreme tribute to age authority and attitude for mrs newsome  it was moreover something in which they all took an interest the strength of their interest was in truth just the reason of her prudence  all this then for five minutes was vivid to strether and it put before him that poor child she had now but her prudence to amuse her  that for a pretty girl in paris struck him with a rush as a sorry state so that under the impression he went out to her with a step as hypocritically alert he was well aware as if he had just come into the room  she turned with a start at his voice preoccupied with him though she might be she was just a scrap disappointed oh i thought you were mr bilham  the remark had been at first surprising and our friends private thought under the influence of it temporarily blighted yet we are able to add that he presently recovered his inward tone and that many a fresh flower of fancy was to bloom in the same air little bilhamsince little bilham was somewhat incongruously expectedappeared behindhand a circumstance by which strether was to profit  they came back into the room together after a little the couple on the balcony and amid its crimsonandgold elegance with the others still absent strether passed forty minutes that he appraised even at the time as far in the whole queer connexion from his idlest yes indeed since he had the other day so agreed with maria about the inspiration of the lurid here was something for his problem that surely didnt make it shrink and that was floated in upon him as part of a sudden flood  he was doubtless not to know till afterwards on turning them over in thought of how many elements his impression was composed but he none the less felt as he sat with the charming girl the signal growth of a confidence  for she was charming when all was saidand none the less so for the visible habit and practice of freedom and fluency she was charming he was aware in spite of the fact that if he hadnt found her so he would have found her something he should have been in peril of expressing as funny yes she was funny wonderful mamie and without dreaming it she was bland she was bridalwith never that he could make out as yet a bridegroom to support it she was handsome and portly and easy and chatty soft and sweet and almost disconcertingly reassuring  she was dressed if we might so far discriminate less as a young lady than as an old onehad an old one been supposable to strether as so committed to vanity the complexities of her hair missed moreover also the looseness of youth and she had a mature manner of bending a little as to encourage and reward while she held neatly together in front of her a pair of strikingly polished hands  the combination of all of which kept up about her the glamour of her receiving placed her again perpetually between the windows and within sound of the icecream plates suggested the enumeration of all the names all the mr brookses and mr snookses gregarious specimens of a single type she was happy to meet but if all this was where she was funny and if what was funnier than the rest was the contrast between her beautiful benevolent patronagesuch a hint of the polysyllabic as might make her something of a bore toward middle ageand her rather flat little voice the voice naturally unaffectedly yet of a girl of fifteen so strether none the less at the end of ten minutes felt in her a quiet dignity that pulled things bravely together  if quiet dignity almost more than matronly with voluminous too voluminous clothes was the effect she proposed to produce that was an ideal one could like in her when once one had got into relation  the great thing now for her visitor was that this was exactly what he had done it made so extraordinary a mixture of the brief and crowded hour  it was the mark of a relation that he had begun so quickly to find himself sure she was of all people as might have been said on the side and of the party of mrs newsomes original ambassador she was in his interest and not in sarahs and some sign of that was precisely what he had been feeling in her these last days as imminent  finally placed in paris in immediate presence of the situation and of the hero of itby whom strether was incapable of meaning any one but chadshe had accomplished and really in a manner all unexpected to herself a change of base deep still things had come to pass within her and by the time she had grown sure of them strether had become aware of the little drama  when she knew where she was in short he had made it out and he made it out at present still better though with never a direct word passing between them all the while on the subject of his own predicament  there had been at first as he sat there with her a moment during which he wondered if she meant to break ground in respect to his prime undertaking  that door stood so strangely ajar that he was halfprepared to be conscious at any juncture of her having of any ones having quite bounced in  but friendly familiar light of touch and happy of tact she exquisitely stayed out so that it was for all the world as if to show she could deal with him without being reduced towell scarcely anything  it fully came up for them then by means of their talking of everything but chad that mamie unlike sarah unlike jim knew perfectly what had become of him  it fully came up that she had taken to the last fraction of an inch the measure of the change in him and that she wanted strether to know what a secret she proposed to make of it  they talked most convenientlyas if they had had no chance yetabout woollett and that had virtually the effect of their keeping the secret more close  the hour took on for strether little by little a queer sad sweetness of quality he had such a revulsion in mamies favour and on behalf of her social value as might have come from remorse at some early injustice  she made him as under the breath of some vague western whiff homesick and freshly restless he could really for the time have fancied himself stranded with her on a far shore during an ominous calm in a quaint community of shipwreck  their little interview was like a picnic on a coral strand they passed each other with melancholy smiles and looks sufficiently allusive such cupfuls of water as they had saved  especially sharp in strether meanwhile was the conviction that his companion really knew as we have hinted where she had come out  it was at a very particular placeonly that she would never tell him it would be above all what he should have to puzzle for himself  this was what he hoped for because his interest in the girl wouldnt be complete without it  no more would the appreciation to which she was entitledso assured was he that the more he saw of her process the more he should see of her pride she saw herself everything but she knew what she didnt want and that it was that had helped her  what didnt she wantthere was a pleasure lost for her old friend in not yet knowing as there would doubtless be a thrill in getting a glimpse  gently and sociably she kept that dark to him and it was as if she soothed and beguiled him in other ways to make up for it  she came out with her impression of madame de vionnetof whom she had heard so much she came out with her impression of jeanne whom she had been dying to see  she brought it out with a blandness by which her auditor was really stirred that she had been with sarah early that very afternoon and after dreadful delays caused by all sorts of things mainly eternally by the purchase of clothesclothes that unfortunately wouldnt be themselves eternalto call in the rue de bellechasse  at the sound of these names strether almost blushed to feel that he couldnt have sounded them firstand yet couldnt either have justified his squeamishness  mamie made them easy as he couldnt have begun to do and yet it could only have cost her more than he should ever have had to spend  it was as friends of chads friends special distinguished desirable enviable that she spoke of them and she beautifully carried it off that much as she had heard of themthough she didnt say how or where which was a touch of her ownshe had found them beyond her supposition  she abounded in praise of them and after the manner of woollettwhich made the manner of woollett a loveable thing again to strether  he had never so felt the true inwardness of it as when his blooming companion pronounced the elder of the ladies of the rue de bellechasse too fascinating for words and declared of the younger that she was perfectly ideal a real little monster of charm  nothing she said of jeanne ought ever to happen to hershes so awfully right as she is  another touch will spoil herso she oughtnt to be touched  ah but things here in paris strether observed do happen to little girls and then for the jokes and the occasions sake havent you found that yourself  that things happen  oh im not a little girl  im a big battered blowsy one  i dont care mamie laughed what happens  strether had a pause while he wondered if it mightnt happen that he should give her the pleasure of learning that he found her nicer than he had really dreameda pause that ended when he had said to himself that so far as it at all mattered for her she had in fact perhaps already made this out  he risked accordingly a different questionthough conscious as soon as he had spoken that he seemed to place it in relation to her last speech  but that mademoiselle de vionnet is to be marriedi suppose youve heard of that for all he then found he need fear  dear yes the gentleman was there monsieur de montbron whom madame de vionnet presented to us  and was he nice  mamie bloomed and bridled with her best reception manner  any mans nice when hes in love  it made strether laugh  but is monsieur de montbron in lovealreadywith you  oh thats not necessaryits so much better he should be so with her which thank goodness i lost no time in discovering for myself  hes perfectly goneand i couldnt have borne it for her if he hadnt been shes just too sweet  strether hesitated  and through being in love too  on which with a smile that struck him as wonderful mamie had a wonderful answer  she doesnt know if she is or not  it made him again laugh out  oh but you do  she was willing to take it that way  oh yes i know everything and as she sat there rubbing her polished hands and making the best of itonly holding her elbows perhaps a little too much outthe momentary effect for strether was that every one else in all their affair seemed stupid  know that poor little jeanne doesnt know whats the matter with her  it was as near as they came to saying that she was probably in love with chad but it was quite near enough for what strether wanted which was to be confirmed in his certitude that whether in love or not she appealed to something large and easy in the girl before him  mamie would be fat too fat at thirty but she would always be the person who at the present sharp hour had been disinterestedly tender  if i see a little more of her as i hope i shall i think shell like me enoughfor she seemed to like me todayto want me to tell her  and shall you  perfectly  i shall tell her the matter with her is that she wants only too much to do right  to do right for her naturally said mamie is to please  her mother do you mean  her mother first  strether waited  and then  well thenmr newsome  there was something really grand for him in the serenity of this reference  and last only monsieur de montbron  last onlyshe goodhumouredly kept it up  strether considered  so that every one after all then will be suited  she had one of her few hesitations but it was a question only of a moment and it was her nearest approach to being explicit with him about what was between them  i think i can speak for myself  i shall be  it said indeed so much told such a story of her being ready to help him so committed to him that truth in short for such use as he might make of it toward those ends of his own with which patiently and trustfully she had nothing to doit so fully achieved all this that he appeared to himself simply to meet it in its own spirit by the last frankness of admiration  admiration was of itself almost accusatory but nothing less would serve to show her how nearly he understood  he put out his hand for goodbye with a splendid splendid splendid and he left her in her splendour still waiting for little bilham      book tenth     i   strether occupied beside little bilham three evenings after his interview with mamie pocock the same deep divan they had enjoyed together on the first occasion of our friends meeting madame de vionnet and her daughter in the apartment of the boulevard malesherbes where his position affirmed itself again as ministering to an easy exchange of impressions  the present evening had a different stamp if the company was much more numerous so inevitably were the ideas set in motion  it was on the other hand however now strongly marked that the talkers moved in respect to such matters round an inner a protected circle they knew at any rate what really concerned them tonight and strether had begun by keeping his companion close to it only a few of chads guests had dinedthat is fifteen or twenty a few compared with the large concourse offered to sight by eleven oclock but number and mass quantity and quality light fragrance sound the overflow of hospitality meeting the high tide of response had all from the first pressed upon strethers consciousness and he felt himself somehow part and parcel of the most festive scene as the term was in which he had ever in his life been engaged  he had perhaps seen on fourths of july and on dear old domestic commencements more people assembled but he had never seen so many in proportion to the space or had at all events never known so great a promiscuity to show so markedly as picked numerous as was the company it had still been made so by selection and what was above all rare for strether was that by no fault of his own he was in the secret of the principle that had worked  he hadnt enquired he had averted his head but chad had put him a pair of questions that themselves smoothed the ground he hadnt answered the questions he had replied that they were the young mans own affair and he had then seen perfectly that the latters direction was already settled  chad had applied for counsel only by way of intimating that he knew what to do and he had clearly never known it better than in now presenting to his sister the whole circle of his society  this was all in the sense and the spirit of the note struck by him on that ladys arrival he had taken at the station itself a line that led him without a break and that enabled him to lead the pococksthough dazed a little no doubt breathless no doubt and bewilderedto the uttermost end of the passage accepted by them perforce as pleasant  he had made it for them violently pleasant and mercilessly full the upshot of which was to strethers vision that they had come all the way without discovering it to be really no passage at all  it was a brave blind alley where to pass was impossible and where unless they stuck fast they would havewhich was always awkwardpublicly to back out  they were touching bottom assuredly tonight the whole scene represented the terminus of the culdesac  so could things go when there was a hand to keep them consistenta hand that pulled the wire with a skill at which the elder man more and more marvelled  the elder man felt responsible but he also felt successful since what had taken place was simply the issue of his own contention six weeks before that they properly should wait to see what their friends would have really to say  he had determined chad to wait he had determined him to see he was therefore not to quarrel with the time given up to the business  as much as ever accordingly now that a fortnight had elapsed the situation created for sarah and against which she had raised no protest was that of her having accommodated herself to her adventure as to a pleasureparty surrendered perhaps even somewhat in excess to bustle and to pace if her brother had been at any point the least bit open to criticism it might have been on the ground of his spicing the draught too highly and pouring the cup too full  frankly treating the whole occasion of the presence of his relatives as an opportunity for amusement he left it no doubt but scant margin as an opportunity for anything else  he suggested invented aboundedyet all the while with the loosest easiest rein strether during his own weeks had gained a sense of knowing paris but he saw it afresh and with fresh emotion in the form of the knowledge offered to his colleague  a thousand unuttered thoughts hummed for him in the air of these observations not the least frequent of which was that sarah might well of a truth not quite know whither she was drifting  she was in no position not to appear to expect that chad should treat her handsomely yet she struck our friend as privately stiffening a little each time she missed the chance of marking the great nuance the great nuance was in brief that of course her brother must treat her handsomelyshe should like to see him not but that treating her handsomely none the less wasnt all in alltreating her handsomely buttered no parsnips and that in fine there were moments when she felt the fixed eyes of their admirable absent mother fairly screw into the flat of her back strether watching after his habit and overscoring with thought positively had moments of his own in which he found himself sorry for heroccasions on which she affected him as a person seated in a runaway vehicle and turning over the question of a possible jump would she jump could she would that be a safe placedthis question at such instants sat for him in her lapse into pallor her tight lips her conscious eyes  it came back to the main point at issue would she be after all to be squared  he believed on the whole she would jump yet his alternations on this subject were the more especial stuff of his suspense  one thing remained well before hima conviction that was in fact to gain sharpness from the impressions of this evening that if she should gather in her skirts close her eyes and quit the carriage while in motion he would promptly enough become aware  she would alight from her headlong course more or less directly upon him it would be appointed to him unquestionably to receive her entire weight signs and portents of the experience thus in reserve for him had as it happened multiplied even through the dazzle of chads party it was partly under the nervous consciousness of such a prospect that leaving almost every one in the two other rooms leaving those of the guests already known to him as well as a mass of brilliant strangers of both sexes and of several varieties of speech he had desired five quiet minutes with little bilham whom he always found soothing and even a little inspiring and to whom he had actually moreover something distinct and important to say  he had felt of oldfor it already seemed long agorather humiliated at discovering he could learn in talk with a personage so much his junior the lesson of a certain moral ease but he had now got used to thatwhether or no the mixture of the fact with other humiliations had made it indistinct whether or no directly from little bilhams example the example of his being contentedly just the obscure and acute little bilham he was  it worked so for him strether seemed to see and our friend had at private hours a wan smile over the fact that he himself after so many more years was still in search of something that would work  however as we have said it worked just now for them equally to have found a corner a little apart  what particularly kept it apart was the circumstance that the music in the salon was admirable with two or three such singers as it was a privilege to hear in private  their presence gave a distinction to chads entertainment and the interest of calculating their effect on sarah was actually so sharp as to be almost painful  unmistakeably in her single person the motive of the composition and dressed in a splendour of crimson which affected strether as the sound of a fall through a skylight she would now be in the forefront of the listening circle and committed by it up to her eyes  those eyes during the wonderful dinner itself he hadnt once met having confessedlyperhaps a little pusillanimouslyarranged with chad that he should be on the same side of the table  but there was no use in having arrived now with little bilham at an unprecedented point of intimacy unless he could pitch everything into the pot  you who sat where you could see her what does she make of it all  by which i mean on what terms does she take it  oh she takes it i judge as proving that the claim of his family is more than ever justified  she isnt then pleased with what he has to show  on the contrary shes pleased with it as with his capacity to do this kind of thingmore than she has been pleased with anything for a long time  but she wants him to show it there  he has no right to waste it on the likes of us  strether wondered  she wants him to move the whole thing over  the whole thingwith an important exception  everything he has picked upand the way he knows how  she sees no difficulty in that shed run the show herself and shell make the handsome concession that woollett would be on the whole in some ways the better for it not that it wouldnt be also in some ways the better for woollett  the people there are just as good  just as good as you and these others  ah that may be  but such an occasion as this whether or no strether said isnt the people its what has made the people possible  well then his friend replied there you are i give you my impression for what its worth  mrs pocock has seen and thats tonight how she sits there  if you were to have a glimpse of her face youd understand me  she has made up her mindto the sound of expensive music  strether took it freely in  ah then i shall have news of her  i dont want to frighten you but i think that likely  however little bilham continued if im of the least use to you to hold on by  youre not of the leastand strether laid an appreciative hand on him to say it  no ones of the least with which to mark how gaily he could take it he patted his companions knee  i must meet my fate alone and i shalloh youll see  and yet he pursued the next moment you can help me too  you once said to mehe followed this furtherthat you held chad should marry i didnt see then so well as i know now that you meant he should marry miss pocock  do you still consider that he should  because if you dohe kept it upi want you immediately to change your mind  you can help me that way  help you by thinking he should not marry  not marry at all events mamie  and who then  ah strether returned that im not obliged to say  but madame de vionneti suggestwhen he can  oh said little bilham with some sharpness  oh precisely  but he neednt marry at allim at any rate not obliged to provide for it  whereas in your case i rather feel that i am  little bilham was amused  obliged to provide for my marrying  yesafter all ive done to you  the young man weighed it  have you done as much as that  well said strether thus challenged of course i must remember what youve also done to me  we may perhaps call it square  but all the same he went on i wish awfully youd marry mamie pocock yourself  little bilham laughed out  why it was only the other night in this very place that you were proposing to me a different union altogether  mademoiselle de vionnet  well strether easily confessed it that i admit was a vain image  this is practical politics i want to do something good for both of youi wish you each so well and you can see in a moment the trouble it will save me to polish you off by the same stroke  she likes you you know  you console her  and shes splendid  little bilham stared as a delicate appetite stares at an overheaped plate  what do i console her for  it just made his friend impatient  oh come you knows  and what proves for you that she likes me  why the fact that i found her three days ago stopping at home alone all the golden afternoon on the mere chance that youd come to her and hanging over her balcony on that of seeing your cab drive up  i dont know what you want more  little bilham after a moment found it  only just to know what proves to you that i like her  oh if what ive just mentioned isnt enough to make you do it youre a stonyhearted little fiend  besidesstrether encouraged his fancys flightyou showed your inclination in the way you kept her waiting kept her on purpose to see if she cared enough for you  his companion paid his ingenuity the deference of a pause  i didnt keep her waiting  i came at the hour  i wouldnt have kept her waiting for the world the young man honourably declared  better stillthen there you are  and strether charmed held him the faster  even if you didnt do her justice moreover he continued i should insist on your immediately coming round to it i want awfully to have worked it  i wantand our friend spoke now with a yearning that was really earnestat least to have done that  to have married me offwithout a penny  well i shant live long and i give you my word now and here that ill leave you every penny of my own  i havent many unfortunately but you shall have them all  and miss pocock i think has a few  i want strether went on to have been at least to that extent constructive even expiatory  ive been sacrificing so to strange gods that i feel i want to put on record somehow my fidelityfundamentally unchanged after allto our own  i feel as if my hands were embrued with the blood of monstrous alien altarsof another faith altogether  there it isits done and then he further explained  it took hold of me because the idea of getting her quite out of the way for chad helps to clear my ground  the young man at this bounced about and it brought them face to face in admitted amusement  you want me to marry as a convenience to chad  no strether debatedhe doesnt care whether you marry or not its as a convenience simply to my own plan for him  simplyand little bilhams concurrence was in itself a lively comment  thank you  but i thought he continued you had exactly no plan for him  well then call it my plan for myselfwhich may be well as you say to have none  his situation dont you see is reduced now to the bare facts one has to recognise  mamie doesnt want him and he doesnt want mamie  so much as that these days have made clear  its a thread we can wind up and tuck in  but little bilham still questioned  you cansince you seem so much to want to  but why should i  poor strether thought it over but was obliged of course to admit that his demonstration did superficially fail  seriously there is no reason  its my affairi must do it alone  ive only my fantastic need of making my dose stiff  little bilham wondered  what do you call your dose  why what i have to swallow  i want my conditions unmitigated  he had spoken in the tone of talk for talks sake and yet with an obscure truth lurking in the loose folds a circumstance presently not without its effect on his young friend  little bilhams eyes rested on him a moment with some intensity then suddenly as if everything had cleared up he gave a happy laugh  it seemed to say that if pretending or even trying or still even hoping to be able to care for mamie would be of use he was all there for the job  ill do anything in the world for you  well strether smiled anything in the world is all i want  i dont know anything that pleased me in her more he went on than the way that on my finding her up there all alone coming on her unawares and feeling greatly for her being so out of it she knocked down my tall house of cards with her instant and cheerful allusion to the next young man  it was somehow so the note i neededher staying at home to receive him  it was chad of course said little bilham who asked the next young mani like your name for meto call  so i supposedall of which thank god is in our innocent and natural manners  but do you know strether asked if chad knows  and then as this interlocutor seemed at a loss why where she has come out  little bilham at this met his face with a conscious lookit was as if more than anything yet the allusion had penetrated  do you know yourself  strether lightly shook his head  there i stop  oh odd as it may appear to you there are things i dont know  i only got the sense from her of something very sharp and yet very deep down that she was keeping all to herself  that is i had begun with the belief that she had kept it to herself but face to face with her there i soon made out that there was a person with whom she would have shared it  i had thought she possibly might with mebut i saw then that i was only half in her confidence  when turning to me to greet mefor she was on the balcony and i had come in without her knowing itshe showed me she had been expecting you and was proportionately disappointed i got hold of the tail of my conviction  half an hour later i was in possession of all the rest of it  you know what has happened he looked at his young friend hardthen he felt sure  for all you say youre up to your eyes so there you are  little bilham after an instant pulled half round  i assure you she hasnt told me anything  of course she hasnt  for what do you suggest that i suppose her to take you  but youve been with her every day youve seen her freely youve liked her greatlyi stick to thatand youve made your profit of it  you know what she has been through as well as you know that she has dined here tonightwhich must have put her by the way through a good deal more  the young man faced this blast after which he pulled round the rest of the way  i havent in the least said she hasnt been nice to me  but shes proud  and quite properly  but not too proud for that  its just her pride that has made her  chad little bilham loyally went on has really been as kind to her as possible its awkward for a man when a girls in love with him  ah but she isntnow  little bilham sat staring before him then he sprang up as if his friends penetration recurrent and insistent made him really after all too nervous  noshe isnt now  it isnt in the least he went on chads fault  hes really all right  i mean he would have been willing  but she came over with ideas  those she had got at home they had been her motive and support in joining her brother and his wife  she was to save our friend  ah like me poor thing  strether also got to his feet  exactlyshe had a bad moment  it was very soon distinct to her to pull her up to let her down that alas he was he is saved theres nothing left for her to do  not even to love him  she would have loved him better as she originally believed him  strether wondered of course one asks ones self what notion a little girl forms where a young mans in question of such a history and such a state  well this little girl saw them no doubt as obscure but she saw them practically as wrong  the wrong for her was the obscure chad turns out at any rate right and good and disconcerting while what she was all prepared for primed and girded and wound up for was to deal with him as the general opposite  yet wasnt her whole pointstrether weighed itthat he was to be that he could be made better redeemed  little bilham fixed it all a moment and then with a small headshake that diffused a tenderness  shes too late  too late for the miracle  yeshis companion saw enough  still if the worst fault of his condition is that it may be all there for her to profit by  oh she doesnt want to profit in that flat way  she doesnt want to profit by another womans workshe wants the miracle to have been her own miracle  thats what shes too late for  strether quite felt how it all fitted yet there seemed one loose piece  im bound to say you know that she strikes one on these lines as fastidiouswhat you call here difficile  little bilham tossed up his chin  of course shes difficileon any lines  what else in the world are our mamiesthe real the right ones  i see i see our friend repeated charmed by the responsive wisdom he had ended by so richly extracting  mamie is one of the real and the right  the very thing itself  and what it comes to then strether went on is that poor awful chad is simply too good for her  ah too good was what he was after all to be but it was she herself and she herself only who was to have made him so  it hung beautifully together but with still a loose end  wouldnt he do for her even if he should after all break  with his actual influence  oh little bilham had for this enquiry the sharpest of all his controls  how can he doon any terms whateverwhen hes flagrantly spoiled  strether could only meet the question with his passive his receptive pleasure  well thank goodness youre not  you remain for her to save and i come back on so beautiful and full a demonstration to my contention of just nowthat of your showing distinct signs of her having already begun  the most he could further say to himselfas his young friend turned awaywas that the charge encountered for the moment no renewed denial little bilham taking his course back to the music only shook his goodnatured ears an instant in the manner of a terrier who has got wet while strether relapsed into the sensewhich had for him in these days most of comfortthat he was free to believe in anything that from hour to hour kept him going  he had positively motions and flutters of this conscious hourtohour kind temporary surrenders to irony to fancy frequent instinctive snatches at the growing rose of observation constantly stronger for him as he felt in scent and colour and in which he could bury his nose even to wantonness  this last resource was offered him for that matter in the very form of his next clear perceptionthe vision of a prompt meeting in the doorway of the room between little bilham and brilliant miss barrace who was entering as bilham withdrew  she had apparently put him a question to which he had replied by turning to indicate his late interlocutor toward whom after an interrogation further aided by a resort to that optical machinery which seemed like her other ornaments curious and archaic the genial lady suggesting more than ever for her fellow guest the old french print the historic portrait directed herself with an intention that strether instantly met  he knew in advance the first note she would sound and took in as she approached all her need of sounding it  nothing yet had been so wonderful between them as the present occasion and it was her special sense of this quality in occasions that she was there as she was in most places to feed  that sense had already been so well fed by the situation about them that she had quitted the other room forsaken the music dropped out of the play abandoned in a word the stage itself that she might stand a minute behind the scenes with strether and so perhaps figure as one of the famous augurs replying behind the oracle to the wink of the other  seated near him presently where little bilham had sat she replied in truth to many things beginning as soon as he had said to herwhat he hoped he said without fatuityall you ladies are extraordinarily kind to me  she played her long handle which shifted her observation she saw in an instant all the absences that left them free  how can we be anything else  but isnt that exactly your plight  we ladiesoh were nice and you must be having enough of us  as one of us you know i dont pretend im crazy about us  but miss gostrey at least tonight has left you alone hasnt she  with which she again looked about as if maria might still lurk  oh yes said strether shes only sitting up for me at home and then as this elicited from his companion her gay oh oh oh he explained that he meant sitting up in suspense and prayer  we thought it on the whole better she shouldnt be present and either way of course its a terrible worry for her he abounded in the sense of his appeal to the ladies and they might take their choice of his doing so from humility or from pride  yet she inclines to believe i shall come out  oh i incline to believe too youll come outmiss barrace with her laugh was not to be behind  only the questions about where isnt it  however she happily continued if its anywhere at all it must be very far on mustnt it  to do us justice i think you know she laughed we do among us all want you rather far on  yes yes she repeated in her quick droll way we want you very very far on after which she wished to know why he had thought it better maria shouldnt be present  oh he replied it was really her own idea  i should have wished it  but she dreads responsibility  and isnt that a new thing for her  to dread it  no doubtno doubt  but her nerve has given way  miss barrace looked at him a moment  she has too much at stake then less gravely  mine luckily for me holds out  luckily for me toostrether came back to that  my own isnt so firm my appetite for responsibility isnt so sharp as that i havent felt the very principle of this occasion to be the more the merrier if we are so merry its because chad has understood so well  he has understood amazingly said miss barrace  its wonderfulstrether anticipated for her  its wonderful she to meet it intensified so that face to face over it they largely and recklessly laughed  but she presently added oh i see the principle  if one didnt one would be lost  but when once one has got hold of it  its as simple as twice two  from the moment he had to do something  a crowdshe took him straight upwas the only thing  rather rather  a rumpus of sound she laughed or nothing  mrs pococks built in or built outwhichever you call it shes packed so tight she cant move  shes in splendid isolationmiss barrace embroidered the theme  strether followed but scrupulous of justice  yet with every one in the place successively introduced to her  wonderfullybut just so that it does build her out  shes bricked up shes buried alive  strether seemed for a moment to look at it but it brought him to a sigh  oh but shes not dead  it will take more than this to kill her  his companion had a pause that might have been for pity  no i cant pretend i think shes finishedor that its for more than tonight she remained pensive as if with the same compunction its only up to her chin then again for the fun of it  she can breathe  she can breathehe echoed it in the same spirit  and do you know he went on whats really all this time happening to methrough the beauty of music the gaiety of voices the uproar in short of our revel and the felicity of your wit  the sound of mrs pococks respiration drowns for me i assure you every other its literally all i hear  she focussed him with her clink of chains  well she breathed ever so kindly  well what  she is free from her chin up she mused and that will be enough for her  it will be enough for me strether ruefully laughed  waymarsh has really he then asked brought her to see you  yesbut thats the worst of it  i could do you no good  and yet i tried hard  strether wondered  and how did you try  why i didnt speak of you  i see  that was better  then what would have been worse  for speaking or silent she lightly wailed i somehow compromise and it has never been any one but you  that showshe was magnanimousthat its something not in you but in ones self  its my fault  she was silent a little  no its mr waymarshs  its the fault of his having brought her  ah then said strether goodnaturedly why did he bring her  he couldnt afford not to  oh you were a trophyone of the spoils of conquest  but why in that case since you do compromise  dont i compromise him as well  i do compromise him as well miss barrace smiled  i compromise him as hard as i can  but for mr waymarsh it isnt fatal  itsso far as his wonderful relation with mrs pocock is concernedfavourable and then as he still seemed slightly at sea  the man who had succeeded with me dont you see for her to get him from me was such an added incentive  strether saw but as if his path was still strewn with surprises its from you then that she has got him  she was amused at his momentary muddle  you can fancy my fight she believes in her triumph  i think it has been part of her joy  oh her joy strether sceptically murmured  well she thinks she has had her own way  and whats tonight for her but a kind of apotheosis  her frocks really good  good enough to go to heaven in  for after a real apotheosis strether went on theres nothing but heaven  for sarah theres only tomorrow  and you mean that she wont find tomorrow heavenly  well i mean that i somehow feel tonighton her behalftoo good to be true  she has had her cake that is shes in the act now of having it of swallowing the largest and sweetest piece  there wont be another left for her  certainly i havent one  it can only at the best be chad he continued to make it out as for their common entertainment  he may have one as it were up his sleeve yet its borne in upon me that if he had  he wouldntshe quite understoodhave taken all this trouble i dare say not and if i may be quite free and dreadful i very much hope he wont take any more  of course i wont pretend now she added not to know what its a question of  oh every one must know now poor strether thoughtfully admitted and its strange enough and funny enough that one should feel everybody here at this very moment to be knowing and watching and waiting  yesisnt it indeed funny  miss barrace quite rose to it thats the way we are in paris she was always pleased with a new contribution to that queerness  its wonderful  but you know she declared it all depends on you  i dont want to turn the knife in your vitals but thats naturally what you just now meant by our all being on top of you  we know you as the hero of the drama and were gathered to see what youll do  strether looked at her a moment with a light perhaps slightly obscured i think that must be why the hero has taken refuge in this corner hes scared at his heroismhe shrinks from his part  ah but we nevertheless believe hell play it  thats why miss barrace kindly went on we take such an interest in you we feel youll come up to the scratch and then as he seemed perhaps not quite to take fire  dont let him do it  dont let chad go  yes keep hold of him  with all thisand she indicated the general tributehe has done enough  we love him herehes charming  its beautiful said strether the way you all can simplify when you will  but she gave it to him back  its nothing to the way you will when you must  he winced at it as at the very voice of prophecy and it kept him a moment quiet  he detained her however on her appearing about to leave him alone in the rather cold clearance their talk had made there positively isnt a sign of a hero tonight the heros dodging and shirking the heros ashamed  therefore you know i think what you must all really be occupied with is the heroine  miss barrace took a minute  the heroine  the heroine  ive treated her said strether not a bit like a hero  oh he sighed i dont do it well  she eased him off  you do it as you can  and then after another hesitation  i think shes satisfied  but he remained compunctious  i havent been near her  i havent looked at her  ah then youve lost a good deal  he showed he knew it  shes more wonderful than ever  than ever  with mr pocock  strether wondered  madame de vionnetwith jim  madame de vionnetwith jim  miss barrace was historic  and whats she doing with him  ah you must ask him  strethers face lighted again at the prospect  it will be amusing to do so  yet he continued to wonder  but she must have some idea  of course she hasshe has twenty ideas  she has in the first place said miss barrace swinging a little her tortoiseshell that of doing her part  her part is to help you  it came out as nothing had come yet links were missing and connexions unnamed but it was suddenly as if they were at the heart of their subject  yes how much more she does it strether gravely reflected than i help her  it all came over him as with the near presence of the beauty the grace the intense dissimulated spirit with which he had as he said been putting off contact  she has courage  ah she has courage miss barrace quite agreed and it was as if for a moment they saw the quantity in each others face  but indeed the whole thing was present  how much she must care  ah there it is  she does care  but it isnt is it miss barrace considerately added as if you had ever had any doubt of that  strether seemed suddenly to like to feel that he really never had why of course its the whole point  voila miss barrace smiled  its why one came out strether went on  and its why one has stayed so long  and its alsohe aboundedwhy ones going home its why its why  its why everything she concurred  its why she might be tonightfor all she looks and shows and for all your friend jim doesabout twenty years old  thats another of her ideas to be for him and to be quite easily and charmingly as young as a little girl  strether assisted at his distance  for him  for chad  for chad in a manner naturally always  but in particular tonight for mr  pocock  and then as her friend still stared yes it is of a bravery but thats what she has  her high sense of duty  it was more than sufficiently before them  when mr newsome has his hands so embarrassed with his sister  its quite the leaststrether filled it outthat she should take his sisters husband  certainlyquite the least  so she has taken him  she has taken him  it was all miss barrace had meant  still it remained enough  it must be funny  oh it is funny  that of course essentially went with it  but it brought them back  how indeed then she must care in answer to which strethers entertainer dropped a comprehensive ah expressive perhaps of some impatience for the time he took to get used to it  she herself had got used to it long before    ii   when one morning within the week he perceived the whole thing to be really at last upon him strethers immediate feeling was all relief he had known this morning that something was about to happenknown it in a moment by waymarshs manner when waymarsh appeared before him during his brief consumption of coffee and a roll in the small slippery salleamanger so associated with rich rumination  strether had taken there of late various lonely and absentminded meals he communed there even at the end of june with a suspected chill the air of old shivers mixed with old savours the air in which so many of his impressions had perversely matured the place meanwhile renewing its message to him by the very circumstance of his single state  he now sat there for the most part to sigh softly while he vaguely tilted his carafe over the vision of how much better waymarsh was occupied that was really his success by the common measureto have led this companion so on and on  he remembered how at first there had been scarce a squattingplace he could beguile him into passing the actual outcome of which at last was that there was scarce one that could arrest him in his rush  his rushas strether vividly and amusedly figured itcontinued to be all with sarah and contained perhaps moreover the word of the whole enigma whipping up in its fine fullflavoured froth the very principle for good or for ill of his own of strethers destiny  it might after all to the end only be that they had united to save him and indeed so far as waymarsh was concerned that had to be the spring of action strether was glad at all events in connexion with the case that the saving he required was not more scant so constituted a luxury was it in certain lights just to lurk there out of the full glare he had moments of quite seriously wondering whether waymarsh wouldnt in fact thanks to old friendship and a conceivable indulgence make about as good terms for him as he might make for himself they wouldnt be the same terms of course but they might have the advantage that he himself probably should be able to make none at all  he was never in the morning very late but waymarsh had already been out and after a peep into the dim refectory he presented himself with much less than usual of his large looseness  he had made sure through the expanse of glass exposed to the court that they would be alone and there was now in fact that about him that pretty well took up the room  he was dressed in the garments of summer and save that his white waistcoat was redundant and bulging these things favoured they determined his expression  he wore a straw hat such as his friend hadnt yet seen in paris and he showed a buttonhole freshly adorned with a magnificent rose strether read on the instant his storyhow astir for the previous hour the sprinkled newness of the day so pleasant at that season in paris he was fairly panting with the pulse of adventure and had been with mrs pocock unmistakeably to the marche aux fleurs strether really knew in this vision of him a joy that was akin to envy so reversed as he stood there did their old positions seem so comparatively doleful now showed by the sharp turn of the wheel the posture of the pilgrim from woollett  he wondered this pilgrim if he had originally looked to waymarsh so brave and well so remarkably launched as it was at present the latters privilege to appear  he recalled that his friend had remarked to him even at chester that his aspect belied his plea of prostration but there certainly couldnt have been for an issue an aspect less concerned than waymarshs with the menace of decay  strether had at any rate never resembled a southern planter of the great dayswhich was the image picturesquely suggested by the happy relation between the fuliginous face and the wide panama of his visitor this type it further amused him to guess had been on waymarshs part the object of sarahs care he was convinced that her taste had not been a stranger to the conception and purchase of the hat any more than her fine fingers had been guiltless of the bestowal of the rose  it came to him in the current of thought as things so oddly did come that he had never risen with the lark to attend a brilliant woman to the marche aux fleurs this could be fastened on him in connexion neither with miss gostrey nor with madame de vionnet the practice of getting up early for adventures could indeed in no manner be fastened on him  it came to him in fact that just here was his usual case  he was for ever missing things through his general genius for missing them while others were for ever picking them up through a contrary bent  and it was others who looked abstemious and he who looked greedy it was he somehow who finally paid and it was others who mainly partook  yes he should go to the scaffold yet for he wouldnt know quite whom  he almost for that matter felt on the scaffold now and really quite enjoying it  it worked out as because he was anxious thereit worked out as for this reason that waymarsh was so blooming  it was his trip for health for a change that proved the successwhich was just what strether planning and exerting himself had desired it should be that truth already sat fullblown on his companions lips benevolence breathed from them as with the warmth of active exercise and also a little as with the bustle of haste  mrs pocock whom i left a quarter of an hour ago at her hotel has asked me to mention to you that she would like to find you at home here in about another hour  she wants to see you she has something to sayor considers i believe that you may have  so that i asked her myself why she shouldnt come right round  she hasnt been round yetto see our place and i took upon myself to say that i was sure youd be glad to have her  the things therefore you see to keep right here till she comes  the announcement was sociably even though after waymarshs wont somewhat solemnly made but strether quickly felt other things in it than these light features  it was the first approach from that quarter to admitted consciousness it quickened his pulse it simply meant at last that he should have but himself to thank if he didnt know where he was  he had finished his breakfast he pushed it away and was on his feet  there were plenty of elements of surprise but only one of doubt  the things for you to keep here too  waymarsh had been slightly ambiguous  he wasnt ambiguous however after this enquiry and strethers understanding had probably never before opened so wide and effective a mouth as it was to open during the next five minutes it was no part of his friends wish as appeared to help to receive mrs pocock he quite understood the spirit in which she was to present herself but his connexion with her visit was limited to his havingwell as he might sayperhaps a little promoted it  he had thought and had let her know it that strether possibly would think she might have been round before  at any rate as turned out she had been wanting herself quite a while to come  i told her said waymarsh that it would have been a bright idea if she had only carried it out before  strether pronounced it so bright as to be almost dazzling  but why hasnt she carried it out before  she has seen me every dayshe had only to name her hour  ive been waiting and waiting  well i told her you had  and she has been waiting too  it was in the oddest way in the world on the showing of this tone a genial new pressing coaxing waymarsh a waymarsh conscious with a different consciousness from any he had yet betrayed and actually rendered by it almost insinuating  he lacked only time for full persuasion and strether was to see in a moment why  meantime however our friend perceived he was announcing a step of some magnanimity on mrs pococks part so that he could deprecate a sharp question  it was his own high purpose in fact to have smoothed sharp questions to rest  he looked his old comrade very straight in the eyes and he had never conveyed to him in so mute a manner so much kind confidence and so much good advice  everything that was between them was again in his face but matured and shelved and finally disposed of  at any rate he added shes coming now  considering how many pieces had to fit themselves it all fell in strethers brain into a close rapid order  he saw on the spot what had happened and what probably would yet and it was all funny enough it was perhaps just this freedom of appreciation that wound him up to his flare of high spirits  what is she coming forto kill me  shes coming to be very very kind to you and you must let me say that i greatly hope youll not be less so to herself  this was spoken by waymarsh with much gravity of admonition and as strether stood there he knew he had but to make a movement to take the attitude of a man gracefully receiving a present  the present was that of the opportunity dear old waymarsh had flattered himself he had divined in him the slight soreness of not having yet thoroughly enjoyed so he had brought it to him thus as on a little silver breakfasttray familiarly though delicatelywithout oppressive pomp and he was to bend and smile and acknowledge was to take and use and be grateful  he was notthat was the beauty of itto be asked to deflect too much from his dignity  no wonder the old boy bloomed in this bland air of his own distillation strether felt for a moment as if sarah were actually walking up and down outside  wasnt she hanging about the portecochere while her friend thus summarily opened a way strether would meet her but to take it and everything would be for the best in the best of possible worlds  he had never so much known what any one meant as in the light of this demonstration he knew what mrs newsome did it had reached waymarsh from sarah but it had reached sarah from her mother and there was no break in the chain by which it reached him  has anything particular happened he asked after a minuteso suddenly to determine her  has she heard anything unexpected from home  waymarsh on this it seemed to him looked at him harder than ever unexpected  he had a brief hesitation then however he was firm were leaving paris  leaving  that is sudden  waymarsh showed a different opinion  less so than it may seem the purpose of mrs pococks visit is to explain to you in fact that its not  strether didnt at all know if he had really an advantageanything that would practically count as one but he enjoyed for the momentas for the first time in his lifethe sense of so carrying it off  he wonderedit was amusingif he felt as the impudent feel  i shall take great pleasure i assure you in any explanation  i shall be delighted to receive sarah  the sombre glow just darkened in his comrades eyes but he was struck with the way it died out again  it was too mixed with another consciousnessit was too smothered as might be said in flowers  he really for the time regretted itpoor dear old sombre glow something straight and simple something heavy and empty had been eclipsed in its company something by which he had best known his friend  waymarsh wouldnt be his friend somehow without the occasional ornament of the sacred rage and the right to the sacred rageinestimably precious for strethers charityhe also seemed in a manner and at mrs pococks elbow to have forfeited strether remembered the occasion early in their stay when on that very spot he had come out with his earnest his ominous quit itand so remembering felt it hang by a hair that he didnt himself now utter the same note  waymarsh was having a good timethis was the truth that was embarrassing for him and he was having it then and there he was having it in europe he was having it under the very protection of circumstances of which he didnt in the least approve all of which placed him in a false position with no issue possiblenone at least by the grand manner  it was practically in the manner of any oneit was all but in poor strethers ownthat instead of taking anything up he merely made the most of having to be himself explanatory  im not leaving for the united states direct mr and mrs pocock and miss mamie are thinking of a little trip before their own return and weve been talking for some days past of our joining forces  weve settled it that we do join and that we sail together the end of next month but we start tomorrow for switzerland mrs pocock wants some scenery  she hasnt had much yet  he was brave in his way too keeping nothing back confessing all there was and only leaving strether to make certain connexions is what mrs newsome had cabled her daughter an injunction to break off short  the grand manner indeed at this just raised its head a little i know nothing about mrs newsomes cables  their eyes met on it with some intensityduring the few seconds of which something happened quite out of proportion to the time it happened that strether looking thus at his friend didnt take his answer for truthand that something more again occurred in consequence of that  yeswaymarsh just did know about mrs newsomes cables  to what other end than that had they dined together at bignons  strether almost felt for the instant that it was to mrs newsome herself the dinner had been given and for that matter quite felt how she must have known about it and as he might think protected and consecrated it  he had a quick blurred view of daily cables questions answers signals  clear enough was his vision of the expense that when so wound up the lady at home was prepared to incur  vivid not less was his memory of what during his long observation of her some of her attainments of that high pitch had cost her  distinctly she was at the highest now and waymarsh who imagined himself an independent performer was really forcing his fine old natural voice an overstrained accompanist  the whole reference of his errand seemed to mark her for strether as by this time consentingly familiar to him and nothing yet had so despoiled her of a special shade of consideration you dont know he asked whether sarah has been directed from home to try me on the matter of my also going to switzerland  i know said waymarsh as manfully as possible nothing whatever about her private affairs though i believe her to be acting in conformity with things that have my highest respect  it was as manful as possible but it was still the false noteas it had to be to convey so sorry a statement  he knew everything strether more and more felt that he thus disclaimed and his little punishment was just in this doom to a second fib  what falser positiongiven the mancould the most vindictive mind impose he ended by squeezing through a passage in which three months before he would certainly have stuck fast  mrs pocock will probably be ready herself to answer any enquiry you may put to her  but he continued but  he faltered on it  but what  dont put her too many  waymarsh looked large but the harm was done he couldnt do what he would help looking rosy  dont do anything youll be sorry for  it was an attenuation strether guessed of something else that had been on his lips it was a sudden drop to directness and was thereby the voice of sincerity  he had fallen to the supplicating note and that immediately for our friend made a difference and reinstated him they were in communication as they had been that first morning in sarahs salon and in her presence and madame de vionnets and the same recognition of a great good will was again after all possible  only the amount of response waymarsh had then taken for granted was doubled decupled now  this came out when he presently said  of course i neednt assure you i hope youll come with us  then it was that his implications and expectations loomed up for strether as almost pathetically gross  the latter patted his shoulder while he thanked him giving the goby to the question of joining the pococks he expressed the joy he felt at seeing him go forth again so brave and free and he in fact almost took leave of him on the spot  i shall see you again of course before you go but im meanwhile much obliged to you for arranging so conveniently for what youve told me  i shall walk up and down in the court theredear little old court which weve each bepaced so this last couple of months to the tune of our flights and our drops our hesitations and our plunges  i shall hang about there all impatience and excitement please let sarah know till she graciously presents herself  leave me with her without fear he laughed i assure you i shant hurt her  i dont think either shell hurt me  im in a situation in which damage was some time ago discounted  besides that isnt what worries youbut dont dont explain were all right as we are  which was the degree of success our adventure was pledged to for each of us  we werent it seemed all right as we were before and weve got over the ground all things considered quickly  i hope youll have a lovely time in the alps  waymarsh fairly looked up at him as from the foot of them  i dont know as i ought really to go  it was the conscience of milrose in the very voice of milrose but oh it was feeble and flat strether suddenly felt quite ashamed for him he breathed a greater boldness  let yourself on the contrary goin all agreeable directions  these are precious hoursat our age they maynt recur  dont have it to say to yourself at milrose next winter that you hadnt courage for them  and then as his comrade queerly stared  live up to mrs pocock  live up to her  youre a great help to her  waymarsh looked at it as at one of the uncomfortable things that were certainly true and that it was yet ironical to say  its more then than you are  thats exactly your own chance and advantage  besides said strether i do in my way contribute  i know what im about  waymarsh had kept on his great panama and as he now stood nearer the door his last look beneath the shade of it had turned again to darkness and warning  so do i  see here strether  i know what youre going to say  quit this  quit this  but it lacked its old intensity nothing of it remained it went out of the room with him    iii   almost the first thing strangely enough that about an hour later strether found himself doing in sarahs presence was to remark articulately on this failure in their friend of what had been superficially his great distinction  it was as ifhe alluded of course to the grand mannerthe dear man had sacrificed it to some other advantage which would be of course only for himself to measure it might be simply that he was physically so much more sound than on his first coming out this was all prosaic comparatively cheerful and vulgar  and fortunately if one came to that his improvement in health was really itself grander than any manner it could be conceived as having cost him  you yourself alone dear sarahstrether took the plungehave done him it strikes me in these three weeks as much good as all the rest of his time together  it was a plunge because somehow the range of reference was in the conditions funny and made funnier still by sarahs attitude by the turn the occasion had with her appearance so sensibly taken her appearance was really indeed funnier than anything elsethe spirit in which he felt her to be there as soon as she was there the shade of obscurity that cleared up for him as soon as he was seated with her in the small salon de lecture that had for the most part in all the weeks witnessed the wane of his early vivacity of discussion with waymarsh  it was an immense thing quite a tremendous thing for her to have come  this truth opened out to him in spite of his having already arrived for himself at a fairly vivid view of it  he had done exactly what he had given waymarsh his word forhad walked and rewalked the court while he awaited her advent acquiring in this exercise an amount of light that affected him at the time as flooding the scene  she had decided upon the step in order to give him the benefit of a doubt in order to be able to say to her mother that she had even to abjectness smoothed the way for him  the doubt had been as to whether he mightnt take her as not having smoothed itand the admonition had possibly come from waymarshs more detached spirit waymarsh had at any rate certainly thrown his weight into the scalehe had pointed to the importance of depriving their friend of a grievance  she had done justice to the plea and it was to set herself right with a high ideal that she actually sat there in her state  her calculation was sharp in the immobility with which she held her tall parasolstick upright and at arms length quite as if she had struck the place to plant her flag in the separate precautions she took not to show as nervous in the aggressive repose in which she did quite nothing but wait for him  doubt ceased to be possible from the moment he had taken in that she had arrived with no proposal whatever that her concern was simply to show what she had come to receive  she had come to receive his submission and waymarsh was to have made it plain to him that she would expect nothing less  he saw fifty things her host at this convenient stage but one of those he most saw was that their anxious friend hadnt quite had the hand required of him waymarsh had however uttered the request that she might find him mild and while hanging about the court before her arrival he had turned over with zeal the different ways in which he could be so the difficulty was that if he was mild he wasnt for her purpose conscious  if she wished him consciousas everything about her cried aloud that she didshe must accordingly be at costs to make him so conscious he was for himselfbut only of too many things so she must choose the one she required  practically however it at last got itself named and when once that had happened they were quite at the centre of their situation one thing had really done as well as another when strether had spoken of waymarshs leaving him and that had necessarily brought on a reference to mrs pococks similar intention the jump was but short to supreme lucidity  light became indeed after that so intense that strether would doubtless have but half made out in the prodigious glare by which of the two the issue had been in fact precipitated  it was in their contracted quarters as much there between them as if it had been something suddenly spilled with a crash and a splash on the floor  the form of his submission was to be an engagement to acquit himself within the twentyfour hours  hell go in a moment if you give him the wordhe assures me on his honour hell do that  this came in its order out of its order in respect to chad after the crash had occurred  it came repeatedly during the time taken by strether to feel that he was even more fixed in his rigour than he had supposedthe time he was not above adding to a little by telling her that such a way of putting it on her brothers part left him sufficiently surprised she wasnt at all funny at lastshe was really fine and he felt easily where she was strongstrong for herself  it hadnt yet so come home to him that she was nobly and appointedly officious she was acting in interests grander and clearer than that of her poor little personal poor little parisian equilibrium and all his consciousness of her mothers moral pressure profited by this proof of its sustaining force  she would be held up she would be strengthened he neednt in the least be anxious for her what would once more have been distinct to him had he tried to make it so was that as mrs newsome was essentially all moral pressure the presence of this element was almost identical with her own presence it wasnt perhaps that he felt he was dealing with her straight but it was certainly as if she had been dealing straight with him she was reaching him somehow by the lengthened arm of the spirit and he was having to that extent to take her into account but he wasnt reaching her in turn not making her take him he was only reaching sarah who appeared to take so little of him something has clearly passed between you and chad he presently said that i think i ought to know something more about  does he put it all he smiled on me  did you come out she asked to put it all on him  but he replied to this no further than after an instant by saying oh its all right  chad i means all right in having said to youwell anything he may have said  ill take it allwhat he does put on me  only i must see him before i see you again  she hesitated but she brought it out  is it absolutely necessary you should see me again  certainly if im to give you any definite word about anything  is it your idea then she returned that i shall keep on meeting you only to be exposed to fresh humiliation  he fixed her a longer time  are your instructions from mrs newsome that you shall even at the worst absolutely and irretrievably break with me  my instructions from mrs newsome are if you please my affair you know perfectly what your own were and you can judge for yourself of what it can do for you to have made what you have of them  you can perfectly see at any rate ill go so far as to say that if i wish not to expose myself i must wish still less to expose her  she had already said more than she had quite expected but though she had also pulled up the colour in her face showed him he should from one moment to the other have it all he now indeed felt the high importance of his having it  what is your conduct she broke out as if to explainwhat is your conduct but an outrage to women like us  i mean your acting as if there can be a doubtas between us and such anotherof his duty  he thought a moment  it was rather much to deal with at once not only the question itself but the sore abysses it revealed of course theyre totally different kinds of duty  and do you pretend that he has any at allto such another  do you mean to madame de vionnet  he uttered the name not to affront her but yet again to gain timetime that he needed for taking in something still other and larger than her demand of a moment before it wasnt at once that he could see all that was in her actual challenge but when he did he found himself just checking a low vague sound a sound which was perhaps the nearest approach his vocal chords had ever known to a growl  everything mrs pocock had failed to give a sign of recognising in chad as a particular part of a transformationeverything that had lent intention to this particular failureaffected him as gathered into a large loose bundle and thrown in her words into his face  the missile made him to that extent catch his breath which however he presently recovered  why when a womans at once so charming and so beneficent  you can sacrifice mothers and sisters to her without a blush and can make them cross the ocean on purpose to feel the more and take from you the straighter how you do it  yes she had taken him up as short and as sharply as that but he tried not to flounder in her grasp  i dont think theres anything ive done in any such calculated way as you describe everything has come as a sort of indistinguishable part of everything else  your coming out belonged closely to my having come before you and my having come was a result of our general state of mind  our general state of mind had proceeded on its side from our queer ignorance our queer misconceptions and confusionsfrom which since then an inexorable tide of light seems to have floated us into our perhaps still queerer knowledge dont you like your brother as he is he went on and havent you given your mother an intelligible account of all that that comes to  it put to her also doubtless his own tone too many things this at least would have been the case hadnt his final challenge directly helped her  everything at the stage they had reached directly helped her because everything betrayed in him such a basis of intention  he sawthe odd way things came outthat he would have been held less monstrous had he only been a little wilder  what exposed him was just his poor old trick of quiet inwardness what exposed him was his thinking such offence  he hadnt in the least however the desire to irritate that sarah imputed to him and he could only at last temporise for the moment with her indignant view  she was altogether more inflamed than he had expected and he would probably understand this better when he should learn what had occurred for her with chad till then her view of his particular blackness her clear surprise at his not clutching the pole she held out must pass as extravagant  i leave you to flatter yourself she returned that what you speak of is what youve beautifully done  when a thing has been already described in such a lovely way  but she caught herself up and her comment on his description rang out sufficiently loud  do you consider her even an apology for a decent woman  ah there it was at last she put the matter more crudely than for his own mixed purposes he had yet had to do but essentially it was all one matter  it was so muchso much and she treated it poor lady as so little  he grew conscious as he was now apt to do of a strange smile and the next moment he found himself talking like miss barrace she has struck me from the first as wonderful  ive been thinking too moreover that after all she would probably have represented even for yourself something rather new and rather good  he was to have given mrs pocock with this however but her best opportunity for a sound of derision  rather new  i hope so with all my heart  i mean he explained that she might have affected you by her exquisite amiabilitya real revelation it has seemed to myself her high rarity her distinction of every sort  he had been with these words consciously a little precious but he had had to behe couldnt give her the truth of the case without them and it seemed to him moreover now that he didnt care  he had at all events not served his cause for she sprang at its exposed side  a revelationto me  ive come to such a woman for a revelation  you talk to me about distinctionyou you whove had your privilegewhen the most distinguished woman we shall either of us have seen in this world sits there insulted in her loneliness by your incredible comparison  strether forbore with an effort from straying but he looked all about him  does your mother herself make the point that she sits insulted  sarahs answer came so straight so pat as might have been said that he felt on the instant its origin  she has confided to my judgement and my tenderness the expression of her personal sense of everything and the assertion of her personal dignity  they were the very words of the lady of woolletthe would have known them in a thousand her parting charge to her child  mrs pocock accordingly spoke to this extent by book and the fact immensely moved him  if she does really feel as you say its of course very very dreadful  ive given sufficient proof one would have thought he added of my deep admiration for mrs newsome  and pray what proof would one have thought youd call sufficient that of thinking this person here so far superior to her  he wondered again he waited  ah dear sarah you must leave me this person here  in his desire to avoid all vulgar retorts to show how even perversely he clung to his rag of reason he had softly almost wailed this plea  yet he knew it to be perhaps the most positive declaration he had ever made in his life and his visitors reception of it virtually gave it that importance  thats exactly what im delighted to do  god knows we dont want her you take good care not to meet she observed in a still higher key my question about their life  if you do consider it a thing one can even speak of i congratulate you on your taste  the life she alluded to was of course chads and madame de vionnets which she thus bracketed together in a way that made him wince a little there being nothing for him but to take home her full intention  it was none the less his inconsequence that while he had himself been enjoying for weeks the view of the brilliant womans specific action he just suffered from any characterisation of it by other lips  i think tremendously well of her at the same time that i seem to feel her life to be really none of my business  its my business that is only so far as chads own life is affected by it and what has happened dont you see is that chads has been affected so beautifully  the proof of the puddings in the eatinghe tried with no great success to help it out with a touch of pleasantry while she let him go on as if to sink and sink  he went on however well enough as well as he could do without fresh counsel he indeed shouldnt stand quite firm he felt till he should have reestablished his communications with chad  still he could always speak for the woman he had so definitely promised to save  this wasnt quite for her the air of salvation but as that chill fairly deepened what did it become but a reminder that one might at the worst perish with her  and it was simple enoughit was rudimentary  not not to give her away i find in her more merits than you would probably have patience with my counting over  and do you know he enquired the effect you produce on me by alluding to her in such terms  its as if you had some motive in not recognising all she has done for your brother and so shut your eyes to each side of the matter in order whichever side comes up to get rid of the other  i dont you must allow me to say see how you can with any pretence to candour get rid of the side nearest you  near methat sort of thing  and sarah gave a jerk back of her head that well might have nullified any active proximity  it kept her friend himself at his distance and he respected for a moment the interval  then with a last persuasive effort he bridged it you dont on your honour appreciate chads fortunate development  fortunate she echoed again  and indeed she was prepared i call it hideous  her departure had been for some minutes marked as imminent and she was already at the door that stood open to the court from the threshold of which she delivered herself of this judgement  it rang out so loud as to produce for the time the hush of everything else  strether quite as an effect of it breathed less bravely he could acknowledge it but simply enough  oh if you think that  then alls at an end  so much the better  i do think that  she passed out as she spoke and took her way straight across the court beyond which separated from them by the deep arch of the portecochere the low victoria that had conveyed her from her own hotel was drawn up she made for it with decision and the manner of her break the sharp shaft of her rejoinder had an intensity by which strether was at first kept in arrest  she had let fly at him as from a stretched cord and it took him a minute to recover from the sense of being pierced  it was not the penetration of surprise it was that much more of certainty his case being put for him as he had as yet only put it to himself  she was away at any rate she had distanced himwith rather a grand spring an effect of pride and ease after all she had got into her carriage before he could overtake her and the vehicle was already in motion  he stopped halfway he stood there in the court only seeing her go and noting that she gave him no other look  the way he had put it to himself was that all quite might be at an end  each of her movements in this resolute rupture reaffirmed reenforced that idea sarah passed out of sight in the sunny street while planted there in the centre of the comparatively grey court he continued merely to look before him  it probably was all at an end      book eleventh  note  in the 1909 new york edition the following two chapters were placed in the reverse of the order appearing below  since 1950 most scholars have agreed because of the internal evidence of the two chapters that an editorial error caused them to be printed in reverse order  this etext like other editions of the past four decades corrects the apparent errorrichard d hathaway preparer of this electronic text     i   he went late that evening to the boulevard malesherbes having his impression that it would be vain to go early and having also more than once in the course of the day made enquiries of the concierge chad hadnt come in and had left no intimation he had affairs apparently at this junctureas it occurred to strether he so well might havethat kept him long abroad  our friend asked once for him at the hotel in the rue de rivoli but the only contribution offered there was the fact that every one was out  it was with the idea that he would have to come home to sleep that strether went up to his rooms from which however he was still absent though from the balcony a few moments later his visitor heard eleven oclock strike  chads servant had by this time answered for his reappearance he had the visitor learned come quickly in to dress for dinner and vanish again strether spent an hour in waiting for himan hour full of strange suggestions persuasions recognitions one of those that he was to recall at the end of his adventure as the particular handful that most had counted the mellowest lamplight and the easiest chair had been placed at his disposal by baptiste subtlest of servants the novel halfuncut the novel lemoncoloured and tender with the ivory knife athwart it like the dagger in a contadinas hair had been pushed within the soft circlea circle which for some reason affected strether as softer still after the same baptiste had remarked that in the absence of a further need of anything by monsieur he would betake himself to bed the night was hot and heavy and the single lamp sufficient the great flare of the lighted city rising high spending itself afar played up from the boulevard and through the vague vista of the successive rooms brought objects into view and added to their dignity strether found himself in possession as he never yet had been he had been there alone had turned over books and prints had invoked in chads absence the spirit of the place but never at the witching hour and never with a relish quite so like a pang  he spent a long time on the balcony he hung over it as he had seen little bilham hang the day of his first approach as he had seen mamie hang over her own the day little bilham himself might have seen her from below he passed back into the rooms the three that occupied the front and that communicated by wide doors and while he circulated and rested tried to recover the impression that they had made on him three months before to catch again the voice in which they had seemed then to speak to him  that voice he had to note failed audibly to sound which he took as the proof of all the change in himself  he had heard of old only what he could then hear what he could do now was to think of three months ago as a point in the far past  all voices had grown thicker and meant more things they crowded on him as he moved aboutit was the way they sounded together that wouldnt let him be still  he felt strangely as sad as if he had come for some wrong and yet as excited as if he had come for some freedom  but the freedom was what was most in the place and the hour it was the freedom that most brought him round again to the youth of his own that he had long ago missed  he could have explained little enough today either why he had missed it or why after years and years he should care that he had the main truth of the actual appeal of everything was none the less that everything represented the substance of his loss put it within reach within touch made it to a degree it had never been an affair of the senses  that was what it became for him at this singular time the youth he had long ago misseda queer concrete presence full of mystery yet full of reality which he could handle taste smell the deep breathing of which he could positively hear  it was in the outside air as well as within it was in the long watch from the balcony in the summer night of the wide late life of paris the unceasing soft quick rumble below of the little lighted carriages that in the press always suggested the gamblers he had seen of old at monte carlo pushing up to the tables  this image was before him when he at last became aware that chad was behind  she tells me you put it all on mehe had arrived after this promptly enough at that information which expressed the case however quite as the young man appeared willing for the moment to leave it  other things with this advantage of their virtually having the night before them came up for them and had as well the odd effect of making the occasion instead of hurried and feverish one of the largest loosest and easiest to which strethers whole adventure was to have treated him  he had been pursuing chad from an early hour and had overtaken him only now but now the delay was repaired by their being so exceptionally confronted  they had foregathered enough of course in all the various times they had again and again since that first night at the theatre been face to face over their question but they had never been so alone together as they were actually alonetheir talk hadnt yet been so supremely for themselves  and if many things moreover passed before them none passed more distinctly for strether than that striking truth about chad of which he had been so often moved to take note  the truth that everything came happily back with him to his knowing how to live  it had been seated in his pleased smilea smile that pleased exactly in the right degreeas his visitor turned round on the balcony to greet his advent his visitor in fact felt on the spot that there was nothing their meeting would so much do as bear witness to that facility  he surrendered himself accordingly to so approved a gift for what was the meaning of the facility but that others did surrender themselves  he didnt want luckily to prevent chad from living but he was quite aware that even if he had he would himself have thoroughly gone to pieces  it was in truth essentially by bringing down his personal life to a function all subsidiary to the young mans own that he held together  and the great point above all the sign of how completely chad possessed the knowledge in question was that one thus became not only with a proper cheerfulness but with wild native impulses the feeder of his stream  their talk had accordingly not lasted three minutes without strethers feeling basis enough for the excitement in which he had waited  this overflow fairly deepened wastefully abounded as he observed the smallness of anything corresponding to it on the part of his friend  that was exactly this friends happy case he put out his excitement or whatever other emotion the matter involved as he put out his washing than which no arrangement could make more for domestic order  it was quite for strether himself in short to feel a personal analogy with the laundress bringing home the triumphs of the mangle  when he had reported on sarahs visit which he did very fully chad answered his question with perfect candour  i positively referred her to youtold her she must absolutely see you  this was last night and it all took place in ten minutes  it was our first free talkreally the first time she had tackled me  she knew i also knew what her line had been with yourself knew moreover how little you had been doing to make anything difficult for her so i spoke for you franklyassured her you were all at her service i assured her i was too the young man continued and i pointed out how she could perfectly at any time have got at me  her difficulty has been simply her not finding the moment she fancied  her difficulty strether returned has been simply that she finds shes afraid of you  shes not afraid of me sarah one little scrap and it was just because she has seen how i can fidget when i give my mind to it that she has felt her best chance rightly enough to be in making me as uneasy as possible  i think shes at bottom as pleased to have you put it on me as you yourself can possibly be to put it  but what in the world my dear man chad enquired in objection to this luminosity have i done to make sally afraid  youve been wonderful wonderful as we saywe poor people who watch the play from the pit and thats what has admirably made her made her all the more effectually that she could see you didnt set about it on purposei mean set about affecting her as with fear  chad cast a pleasant backward glance over his possibilities of motive ive only wanted to be kind and friendly to be decent and attentiveand i still only want to be  strether smiled at his comfortable clearness  well there can certainly be no way for it better than by my taking the onus  it reduces your personal friction and your personal offence to almost nothing  ah but chad with his completer conception of the friendly wouldnt quite have this  they had remained on the balcony where after their day of great and premature heat the midnight air was delicious and they leaned back in turn against the balustrade all in harmony with the chairs and the flowerpots the cigarettes and the starlight the onus isnt really yoursafter our agreeing so to wait together and judge together  that was all my answer to sally chad pursuedthat we have been that we are just judging together  im not afraid of the burden strether explained i havent come in the least that you should take it off me  ive come very much it seems to me to double up my fore legs in the manner of the camel when he gets down on his knees to make his back convenient but ive supposed you all this while to have been doing a lot of special and private judgingabout which i havent troubled you and ive only wished to have your conclusion first from you i dont ask more than that im quite ready to take it as it has come  chad turned up his face to the sky with a slow puff of his smoke well ive seen  strether waited a little  ive left you wholly alone havent i think i may say since the first hour or twowhen i merely preached patienceso much as breathed on you  oh youve been awfully good  weve both been good thenweve played the game  weve given them the most liberal conditions  ah said chad splendid conditions  it was open to them open to themhe seemed to make it out as he smoked with his eyes still on the stars  he might in quiet sport have been reading their horoscope strether wondered meanwhile what had been open to them and he finally let him have it  it was open to them simply to let me alone to have made up their minds on really seeing me for themselves that i could go on well enough as i was  strether assented to this proposition with full lucidity his companions plural pronoun which stood all for mrs newsome and her daughter having no ambiguity for him  there was nothing apparently to stand for mamie and jim and this added to our friends sense of chads knowing what he thought  but theyve made up their minds to the oppositethat you cant go on as you are  no chad continued in the same way they wont have it for a minute  strether on his side also reflectively smoked  it was as if their high place really represented some moral elevation from which they could look down on their recent past  there never was the smallest chance do you know that they would have it for a moment  of course notno real chance  but if they were willing to think there was  they werent willing strether had worked it all out  it wasnt for you they came out but for me  it wasnt to see for themselves what youre doing but what im doing  the first branch of their curiosity was inevitably destined under my culpable delay to give way to the second and its on the second that if i may use the expression and you dont mind my marking the invidious fact theyve been of late exclusively perched  when sarah sailed it was me in other words they were after  chad took it in both with intelligence and with indulgence  it is rather a business thenwhat ive let you in for  strether had again a brief pause which ended in a reply that seemed to dispose once for all of this element of compunction chad was to treat it at any rate so far as they were again together as having done so i was in when you found me  ah but it was you the young man laughed who found me  i only found you out  it was you who found me in  it was all in the days work for them at all events that they should come  and theyve greatly enjoyed it strether declared  well ive tried to make them said chad  his companion did himself presently the same justice  so have i i tried even this very morningwhile mrs pocock was with me  she enjoys for instance almost as much as anything else not being as ive said afraid of me and i think i gave her help in that  chad took a deeper interest  was she very very nasty  strether debated  well she was the most important thingshe was definite  she wasat lastcrystalline  and i felt no remorse i saw that they must have come  oh i wanted to see them for myself so that if it were only for that  chads own remorse was as small  this appeared almost all strether wanted  isnt your having seen them for yourself then the thing beyond all others that has come of their visit  chad looked as if he thought it nice of his old friend to put it so dont you count it as anything that youre dishedif you are dished are you my dear man dished  it sounded as if he were asking if he had caught cold or hurt his foot and strether for a minute but smoked and smoked  i want to see her again  i must see her  of course you must then chad hesitated  do you meanamother herself  oh your motherthat will depend  it was as if mrs newsome had somehow been placed by the words very far off  chad however endeavoured in spite of this to reach the place what do you mean it will depend on  strether for all answer gave him a longish look  i was speaking of sarah  i must positivelythough she quite cast me offsee her again i cant part with her that way  then she was awfully unpleasant  again strether exhaled  she was what she had to be  i mean that from the moment theyre not delighted they can only bewell what i admit she was  we gave them he went on their chance to be delighted and theyve walked up to it and looked all round it and not taken it  you can bring a horse to water chad suggested  precisely  and the tune to which this morning sarah wasnt delightedthe tune to which to adopt your metaphor she refused to drinkleaves us on that side nothing more to hope  chad had a pause and then as if consolingly  it was never of course really the least on the cards that they would be delighted  well i dont know after all strether mused  ive had to come as far round  howeverhe shook it offits doubtless my performance thats absurd  there are certainly moments said chad when you seem to me too good to be true  yet if you are true he added that seems to be all that need concern me  im true but im incredible  im fantastic and ridiculousi dont explain myself even to myself  how can they then strether asked understand me  so i dont quarrel with them  i see  they quarrel said chad rather comfortably with us strether noted once more the comfort but his young friend had already gone on  i should feel greatly ashamed all the same if i didnt put it before you again that you ought to think after all tremendously well  i mean before giving up beyond recall with which insistence as from a certain delicacy dropped  ah but strether wanted it  say it all say it all  well at your age and with whatwhen alls said and donemother might do for you and be for you  chad had said it all from his natural scruple only to that extent so that strether after an instant himself took a hand my absence of an assured future  the little i have to show toward the power to take care of myself  the way the wonderful way she would certainly take care of me  her fortune her kindness and the constant miracle of her having been disposed to go even so far of course of coursehe summed it up  there are those sharp facts  chad had meanwhile thought of another still  and dont you really care  his friend slowly turned round to him  will you go  ill go if youll say you now consider i should  you know he went on i was ready six weeks ago  ah said strether that was when you didnt know i wasnt youre ready at present because you do know it  that may be chad returned but all the same im sincere  you talk about taking the whole thing on your shoulders but in what light do you regard me that you think me capable of letting you pay  strether patted his arm as they stood together against the parapet reassuringlyseeming to wish to contend that he had the wherewithal but it was again round this question of purchase and price that the young mans sense of fairness continued to hover what it literally comes to for you if youll pardon my putting it so is that you give up money  possibly a good deal of money  oh strether laughed if it were only just enough youd still be justified in putting it so  but ive on my side to remind you too that you give up money and more than possiblyquite certainly as i should supposea good deal  true enough but ive got a certain quantity chad returned after a moment  whereas you my dear man you  i cant be at all saidstrether took him upto have a quantity certain or uncertain  very true  still i shant starve  oh you mustnt starve chad pacifically emphasised and so in the pleasant conditions they continued to talk though there was for that matter a pause in which the younger companion might have been taken as weighing again the delicacy of his then and there promising the elder some provision against the possibility just mentioned  this however he presumably thought best not to do for at the end of another minute they had moved in quite a different direction  strether had broken in by returning to the subject of chads passage with sarah and enquiring if they had arrived in the event at anything in the nature of a scene  to this chad replied that they had on the contrary kept tremendously polite adding moreover that sally was after all not the woman to have made the mistake of not being  her hands are a good deal tied you see  i got so from the first he sagaciously observed the start of her  you mean she has taken so much from you  well i couldnt of course in common decency give less  only she hadnt expected i think that id give her nearly so much  and she began to take it before she knew it  and she began to like it said strether as soon as she began to take it  yes she has liked italso more than she expected after which chad observed  but she doesnt like me  in fact she hates me  strethers interest grew  then why does she want you at home  because when you hate you want to triumph and if she should get me neatly stuck there she would triumph  strether followed afresh but looking as he went  certainlyin a manner  but it would scarce be a triumph worth having if once entangled feeling her dislike and possibly conscious in time of a certain quantity of your own you should on the spot make yourself unpleasant to her  ah said chad she can bear mecould bear me at least at home its my being there that would be her triumph  she hates me in paris  she hates in other words  yes thats itchad had quickly understood this understanding which formed on the part of each as near an approach as they had yet made to naming madame de vionnet  the limitations of their distinctness didnt however prevent its fairly lingering in the air that it was this lady mrs pocock hated  it added one more touch moreover to their established recognition of the rare intimacy of chads association with her  he had never yet more twitched away the last light veil from this phenomenon than in presenting himself as confounded and submerged in the feeling she had created at woollett and ill tell you who hates me too he immediately went on  strether knew as immediately whom he meant but with as prompt a protest  ah no  mamie doesnt hatewell he caught himself in timeanybody at all  mamies beautiful  chad shook his head  thats just why i mind it  she certainly doesnt like me  how much do you mind it  what would you do for her  well id like her if shed like me  really really chad declared  it gave his companion a moments pause  you asked me just now if i dont as you said care about a certain person  you rather tempt me therefore to put the question in my turn  dont you care about a certain other person  chad looked at him hard in the lamplight of the window  the difference is that i dont want to  strether wondered  dont want to  i try not tothat is i have tried  ive done my best  you cant be surprised the young man easily went on when you yourself set me on it  i was indeed he added already on it a little but you set me harder  it was six weeks ago that i thought i had come out  strether took it well in  but you havent come out  i dont knowits what i want to know said chad  and if i could have sufficiently wantedby myselfto go back i think i might have found out  possiblystrether considered  but all you were able to achieve was to want to want to  and even then he pursued only till our friends there came  do you want to want to still  as with a sound halfdolorous halfdroll and all vague and equivocal chad buried his face for a little in his hands rubbing it in a whimsical way that amounted to an evasion he brought it out more sharply  do you  chad kept for a time his attitude but at last he looked up and then abruptly jim is a damned dose he declared  oh i dont ask you to abuse or describe or in any way pronounce on your relatives i simply put it to you once more whether youre now ready  you say youve seen is what youve seen that you cant resist  chad gave him a strange smilethe nearest approach he had ever shown to a troubled one  cant you make me not resist  what it comes to strether went on very gravely now and as if he hadnt heard him what it comes to is that more has been done for you i think than ive ever seen doneattempted perhaps but never so successfully doneby one human being for another  oh an immense deal certainlychad did it full justice  and you yourself are adding to it  it was without heeding this either that his visitor continued and our friends there wont have it  no they simply wont  they demand you on the basis as it were of repudiation and ingratitude and what has been the matter with me strether went on is that i havent seen my way to working with you for repudiation  chad appreciated this  then as you havent seen yours you naturally havent seen mine  there it is after which he proceeded with a certain abruptness to a sharp interrogation now do you say she doesnt hate me  strether hesitated  she  yesmother  we called it sarah but it comes to the same thing  ah strether objected not to the same thing as her hating you  on whichthough as if for an instant it had hung firechad remarkably replied  well if they hate my good friend that comes to the same thing it had a note of inevitable truth that made strether take it as enough feel he wanted nothing more  the young man spoke in it for his good friend more than he had ever yet directly spoken confessed to such deep identities between them as he might play with the idea of working free from but which at a given moment could still draw him down like a whirlpool  and meanwhile he had gone on  their hating you too moreoverthat also comes to a good deal  ah said strether your mother doesnt  chad however loyally stuck to itloyally that is to strether she will if you dont look out  well i do look out  i am after all looking out  thats just why our friend explained i want to see her again  it drew from chad again the same question  to see mother  to seefor the presentsarah  ah then there you are  and what i dont for the life of me make out chad pursued with resigned perplexity is what you gain by it  oh it would have taken his companion too long to say  thats because you have i verily believe no imagination  youve other qualities but no imagination dont you see at all  i dare say  i do see it was an idea in which chad showed interest but havent you yourself rather too much  oh rather  so that after an instant under this reproach and as if it were at last a fact really to escape from strether made his move for departure    ii   one of the features of the restless afternoon passed by him after mrs pococks visit was an hour spent shortly before dinner with maria gostrey whom of late in spite of so sustained a call on his attention from other quarters he had by no means neglected  and that he was still not neglecting her will appear from the fact that he was with her again at the same hour on the very morrowwith no less fine a consciousness moreover of being able to hold her ear it continued inveterately to occur for that matter that whenever he had taken one of his greater turns he came back to where she so faithfully awaited him  none of these excursions had on the whole been livelier than the pair of incidentsthe fruit of the short interval since his previous visiton which he had now to report to her  he had seen chad newsome late the night before and he had had that morning as a sequel to this conversation a second interview with sarah  but theyre all off he said at last  it puzzled her a moment  allmr newsome with them  ah not yet  sarah and jim and mamie  but waymarsh with themfor sarah  its too beautiful strether continued i find i dont get over thatits always a fresh joy  but its a fresh joy too he added thatwell what do you think  little bilham also goes but he of course goes for mamie  miss gostrey wondered  for her  do you mean theyre already engaged  well said strether say then for me  hell do anything for me just as i will for that matteranything i canfor him  or for mamie either  shell do anything for me  miss gostrey gave a comprehensive sigh  the way you reduce people to subjection  its certainly on one side wonderful  but its quite equalled on another by the way i dont  i havent reduced sarah since yesterday though ive succeeded in seeing her again as ill presently tell you the others however are really all right mamie by that blessed law of ours absolutely must have a young man  but what must poor mr bilham have  do you mean theyll marry for you  i mean that by the same blessed law it wont matter a grain if they donti shant have in the least to worry  she saw as usual what he meant  and mr jimwho goes for him  oh strether had to admit i couldnt manage that  hes thrown as usual on the world the world which after all by his accountfor he has prodigious adventuresseems very good to him he fortunatelyover here as he saysfinds the world everywhere and his most prodigious adventure of all he went on has been of course of the last few days  miss gostrey already knowing instantly made the connexion  he has seen marie de vionnet again  he went all by himself the day after chads partydidnt i tell youto tea with her  by her invitationall alone  quite like yourself maria smiled  oh but hes more wonderful about her than i am  and then as his friend showed how she could believe it filling it out fitting it on to old memories of the wonderful woman  what i should have liked to manage would have been her going  to switzerland with the party  for jimand for symmetry  if it had been workable moreover for a fortnight shed have gone  shes readyhe followed up his renewed vision of herfor anything  miss gostrey went with him a minute  shes too perfect  she will i think he pursued go tonight to the station  to see him off  with chadmarvellouslyas part of their general attention  and she does itit kept before himwith a light light grace a free free gaiety that may well softly bewilder mr pocock  it kept her so before him that his companion had after an instant a friendly comment  as in short it has softly bewildered a saner man are you really in love with her maria threw off  its of no importance i should know he replied  it matters so littlehas nothing to do practically with either of us  all the samemaria continued to smilethey go the five as i understand you and you and madame de vionnet stay  oh and chad to which strether added  and you  ah meshe gave a small impatient wail again in which something of the unreconciled seemed suddenly to break out  i dont stay it somehow seems to me much to my advantage  in the presence of all you cause to pass before me ive a tremendous sense of privation  strether hesitated  but your privation your keeping out of everything has beenhasnt itby your own choice  oh yes it has been necessarythat is it has been better for you what i mean is only that i seem to have ceased to serve you  how can you tell that he asked  you dont know how you serve me when you cease  well she said as he dropped  well ill let you know  be quiet till then  she thought a moment  then you positively like me to stay  dont i treat you as if i did  youre certainly very kind to me  but that said maria is for myself  its getting late as you see and paris turning rather hot and dusty  people are scattering and some of them in other places want me  but if you want me here  she had spoken as resigned to his word but he had of a sudden a still sharper sense than he would have expected of desiring not to lose her i want you here  she took it as if the words were all she had wished as if they brought her gave her something that was the compensation of her case  thank you she simply answered  and then as he looked at her a little harder thank you very much she repeated  it had broken as with a slight arrest into the current of their talk and it held him a moment longer  why two months or whatever the time was ago did you so suddenly dash off  the reason you afterwards gave me for having kept away three weeks wasnt the real one  she recalled  i never supposed you believed it was  yet she continued if you didnt guess it that was just what helped you  he looked away from her on this he indulged so far as space permitted in one of his slow absences  ive often thought of it but never to feel that i could guess it  and you see the consideration with which ive treated you in never asking till now  now then why do you ask  to show you how i miss you when youre not here and what it does for me  it doesnt seem to have done she laughed all it might however she added if youve really never guessed the truth ill tell it you  ive never guessed it strether declared  never  never  well then i dashed off as you say so as not to have the confusion of being there if marie de vionnet should tell you anything to my detriment  he looked as if he considerably doubted  you even then would have had to face it on your return  oh if i had found reason to believe it something very bad id have left you altogether  so then he continued it was only on guessing she had been on the whole merciful that you ventured back  maria kept it together  i owe her thanks  whatever her temptation she didnt separate us  thats one of my reasons she went on for admiring her so  let it pass then said strether for one of mine as well  but what would have been her temptation  what are ever the temptations of women  he thoughtbut hadnt naturally to think too long  men  she would have had you with it more for herself  but she saw she could have you without it  oh have me strether a trifle ambiguously sighed  you he handsomely declared would have had me at any rate with it  oh have youshe echoed it as he had done  i do have you however she less ironically said from the moment you express a wish  he stopped before her full of the disposition  ill express fifty  which indeed begot in her with a certain inconsequence a return of her small wail  ah there you are  there if it were so he continued for the rest of the time to be and it was as if to show her how she could still serve him that coming back to the departure of the pococks he gave her the view vivid with a hundred more touches than we can reproduce of what had happened for him that morning  he had had ten minutes with sarah at her hotel ten minutes reconquered by irresistible pressure from the time over which he had already described her to miss gostrey as having at the end of their interview on his own premises passed the great sponge of the future  he had caught her by not announcing himself had found her in her sittingroom with a dressmaker and a lingere whose accounts she appeared to have been more or less ingenuously settling and who soon withdrew  then he had explained to her how he had succeeded late the night before in keeping his promise of seeing chad  i told her id take it all  youd take it  why if he doesnt go  maria waited  and who takes it if he does she enquired with a certain grimness of gaiety  well said strether i think i take in any event everything  by which i suppose you mean his companion brought out after a moment that you definitely understand you now lose everything  he stood before her again  it does come perhaps to the same thing but chad now that he has seen doesnt really want it  she could believe that but she made as always for clearness still what after all has he seen  what they want of him  and its enough  it contrasts so unfavourably with what madame de vionnet wants  it contrastsjust so all round and tremendously  therefore perhaps most of all with what you want  oh said strether what i want is a thing ive ceased to measure or even to understand  but his friend none the less went on  do you want mrs newsomeafter such a way of treating you  it was a straighter mode of dealing with this lady than they had as yetsuch was their high formpermitted themselves but it seemed not wholly for this that he delayed a moment  i dare say it has been after all the only way she could have imagined  and does that make you want her any more  ive tremendously disappointed her strether thought it worth while to mention  of course you have  thats rudimentary that was plain to us long ago  but isnt it almost as plain maria went on that youve even yet your straight remedy  really drag him away as i believe you still can and youd cease to have to count with her disappointment  ah then he laughed i should have to count with yours  but this barely struck her now  what in that case should you call counting  you havent come out where you are i think to please me  oh he insisted that too you know has been part of it i cant separateits all one and thats perhaps why as i say i dont understand but he was ready to declare again that this didnt in the least matter all the more that as he affirmed he hadnt really as yet come out she gives me after all on its coming to the pinch a last mercy another chance  they dont sail you see for five or six weeks more and they haventshe admits thatexpected chad would take part in their tour  its still open to him to join them at the last at liverpool  miss gostrey considered  how in the world is it open unless you open it  how can he join them at liverpool if he but sinks deeper into his situation here  he has given heras i explained to you that she let me know yesterdayhis word of honour to do as i say  maria stared  but if you say nothing  well he as usual walked about on it  i did say something this morning  i gave her my answerthe word i had promised her after hearing from himself what he had promised  what she demanded of me yesterday youll remember was the engagement then and there to make him take up this vow  well then miss gostrey enquired was the purpose of your visit to her only to decline  no it was to ask odd as that may seem to you for another delay  ah thats weak  precisely  she had spoken with impatience but so far as that at least he knew where he was  if i am weak i want to find it out  if i dont find it out i shall have the comfort the little glory of thinking im strong  its all the comfort i judge she returned that you will have  at any rate he said it will have been a month more  paris may grow from day to day hot and dusty as you say but there are other things that are hotter and dustier  im not afraid to stay on the summer here must be amusing in a wildif it isnt a tameway of its own the place at no time more picturesque  i think i shall like it and then he benevolently smiled for her there will be always you  oh she objected it wont be as a part of the picturesqueness that i shall stay for i shall be the plainest thing about you you may you see at any rate she pursued have nobody else madame de vionnet may very well be going off maynt sheand mr newsome by the same stroke  unless indeed youve had an assurance from them to the contrary  so that if your ideas to stay for themit was her duty to suggest ityou may be left in the lurch of course if they do stayshe kept it upthey would be part of the picturesqueness  or else indeed you might join them somewhere  strether seemed to face it as if it were a happy thought but the next moment he spoke more critically  do you mean that theyll probably go off together  she just considered  i think it will be treating you quite without ceremony if they do though after all she added it would be difficult to see now quite what degree of ceremony properly meets your case  of course strether conceded my attitude toward them is extraordinary  just so so that one may ask ones self what style of proceeding on their own part can altogether match it  the attitude of their own that wont pale in its light theyve doubtless still to work out  the really handsome thing perhaps she presently threw off would be for them to withdraw into more secluded conditions offering at the same time to share them with you he looked at her on this as if some generous irritationall in his interesthad suddenly again flickered in her and what she next said indeed halfexplained it  dont really be afraid to tell me if what now holds you is the pleasant prospect of the empty town with plenty of seats in the shade cool drinks deserted museums drives to the bois in the evening and our wonderful woman all to yourself and she kept it up still more  the handsomest thing of all when one makes it out would i dare say be that mr chad should for a while go off by himself  its a pity from that point of view she wound up that he doesnt pay his mother a visit it would at least occupy your interval the thought in fact held her a moment  why doesnt he pay his mother a visit  even a week at this good moment would do  my dear lady strether repliedand he had it even to himself surprisingly readymy dear lady his mother has paid him a visit mrs newsome has been with him this month with an intensity that im sure he has thoroughly felt he has lavishly entertained her and she has let him have her thanks  do you suggest he shall go back for more of them  well she succeeded after a little in shaking it off  i see its what you dont suggestwhat you havent suggested and you know  so would you my dear he kindly said if you had so much as seen her  as seen mrs newsome  no sarahwhich both for chad and for myself has served all the purpose  and served it in a manner she responsively mused so extraordinary  well you see he partly explained what it comes to is that shes all cold thoughtwhich sarah could serve to us cold without its really losing anything  so it is that we know what she thinks of us  maria had followed but she had an arrest  what ive never made out if you come to that is what you thinki mean you personallyof her dont you so much when alls said as care a little  that he answered with no loss of promptness is what even chad himself asked me last night  he asked me if i dont mind the losswell the loss of an opulent future  which moreover he hastened to add was a perfectly natural question  i call your attention all the same said miss gostrey to the fact that i dont ask it  what i venture to ask is whether its to mrs newsome herself that youre indifferent  i havent been sohe spoke with all assurance  ive been the very opposite  ive been from the first moment preoccupied with the impression everything might be making on herquite oppressed haunted tormented by it  ive been interested only in her seeing what ive seen  and ive been as disappointed in her refusal to see it as she has been in what has appeared to her the perversity of my insistence  do you mean that she has shocked you as youve shocked her  strether weighed it  im probably not so shockable  but on the other hand ive gone much further to meet her  she on her side hasnt budged an inch  so that youre now at lastmaria pointed the moralin the sad stage of recriminations  noits only to you i speak  ive been like a lamb to sarah ive only put my back to the wall  its to that one naturally staggers when one has been violently pushed there  she watched him a moment  thrown over  well as i feel ive landed somewhere i think i must have been thrown  she turned it over but as hoping to clarify much rather than to harmonise  the thing is that i suppose youve been disappointing  quite from the very first of my arrival  i dare say  i admit i was surprising even to myself  and then of course maria went on i had much to do with it  with my being surprising  that will do she laughed if youre too delicate to call it my being  naturally she added you came over more or less for surprises  naturallyhe valued the reminder  but they were to have been all for youshe continued to piece it outand none of them for her  once more he stopped before her as if she had touched the point thats just her difficultythat she doesnt admit surprises its a fact that i think describes and represents her and it falls in with what i tell youthat shes all as ive called it fine cold thought she had to her own mind worked the whole thing out in advance and worked it out for me as well as for herself  whenever she has done that you see theres no room left no margin as it were for any alteration  shes filled as full packed as tight as shell hold and if you wish to get anything more or different either out or in  youve got to make over altogether the woman herself  what it comes to said strether is that youve got morally and intellectually to get rid of her  which would appear maria returned to be practically what youve done  but her friend threw back his head  i havent touched her  she wont be touched  i see it now as ive never done and she hangs together with a perfection of her own he went on that does suggest a kind of wrong in any change of her composition  it was at any rate he wound up the woman herself as you call her the whole moral and intellectual being or block that sarah brought me over to take or to leave  it turned miss gostrey to deeper thought  fancy having to take at the point of the bayonet a whole moral and intellectual being or block  it was in fact said strether what at home i had done but somehow over there i didnt quite know it  one never does i suppose miss gostrey concurred realise in advance in such a case the size as you may say of the block little by little it looms up  it has been looming for you more and more till at last you see it all  i see it all he absently echoed while his eyes might have been fixing some particularly large iceberg in a cool blue northern sea its magnificent he then rather oddly exclaimed  but his friend who was used to this kind of inconsequence in him kept the thread  theres nothing so magnificentfor making others feel youas to have no imagination  it brought him straight round  ah there you are its what i said last night to chad  that he himself i mean has none  then it would appear maria suggested that he has after all something in common with his mother  he has in common that he makes one as you say feel him  and yet he added as if the question were interesting one feels others too even when they have plenty  miss gostrey continued suggestive  madame de vionnet  she has plenty  certainlyshe had quantities of old  but there are different ways of making ones self felt  yes it comes no doubt to that  you now  he was benevolently going on but she wouldnt have it oh i dont make myself felt so my quantity neednt be settled yours you know she said is monstrous  no one has ever had so much  it struck him for a moment  thats what chad also thinks  there you are thenthough it isnt for him to complain of it  oh he doesnt complain of it said strether  thats all that would be wanting but apropos of what maria went on did the question come up  well of his asking me what it is i gain  she had a pause  then as ive asked you too it settles my case oh you have she repeated treasures of imagination  but he had been for an instant thinking away from this and he came up in another place  and yet mrs newsomeits a thing to rememberhas imagined did that is imagine and apparently still does horrors about what i should have found  i was booked by her visionextraordinarily intense after allto find them and that i didnt that i couldnt that as she evidently felt i wouldntthis evidently didnt at all as they say suit her book it was more than she could bear  that was her disappointment  you mean you were to have found chad himself horrible  i was to have found the woman  horrible  found her as she imagined her  and strether paused as if for his own expression of it he could add no touch to that picture  his companion had meanwhile thought  she imagined stupidlyso it comes to the same thing  stupidly  oh said strether  but she insisted  she imagined meanly  he had it however better  it couldnt but be ignorantly  well intensity with ignorancewhat do you want worse  this question might have held him but he let it pass  sarah isnt ignorantnow she keeps up the theory of the horrible  ah but shes intenseand that by itself will do sometimes as well if it doesnt do in this case at any rate to deny that maries charming it will do at least to deny that shes good  what i claim is that shes good for chad  you dont claimshe seemed to like it clearthat shes good for you  but he continued without heeding  thats what i wanted them to come out forto see for themselves if shes bad for him  and now that theyve done so they wont admit that shes good even for anything  they do think strether presently admitted that shes on the whole about as bad for me  but theyre consistent of course inasmuch as theyve their clear view of whats good for both of us  for you to begin withmaria all responsive confined the question for the momentto eliminate from your existence and if possible even from your memory the dreadful creature that i must gruesomely shadow forth for them even more than to eliminate the distincter evilthereby a little less portentousof the person whose confederate youve suffered yourself to become  however thats comparatively simple  you can easily at the worst after all give me up  i can easily at the worst after all give you up the irony was so obvious that it needed no care  i can easily at the worst after all even forget you  call that then workable  but mr newsome has much more to forget how can he do it  ah there again we are thats just what i was to have made him do just where i was to have worked with him and helped  she took it in silence and without attenuationas if perhaps from very familiarity with the facts and her thought made a connexion without showing the links  do you remember how we used to talk at chester and in london about my seeing you through  she spoke as of faroff things and as if they had spent weeks at the places she named  its just what you are doing  ah but the worstsince youve left such a marginmay be still to come  you may yet break down  yes i may yet break down  but will you take me  he had hesitated and she waited  take you  for as long as i can bear it  she also debated mr newsome and madame de vionnet may as we were saying leave town  how long do you think you can bear it without them  strethers reply to this was at first another question  do you mean in order to get away from me  her answer had an abruptness  dont find me rude if i say i should think theyd want to  he looked at her hard againseemed even for an instant to have an intensity of thought under which his colour changed  but he smiled you mean after what theyve done to me  after what she has  at this however with a laugh he was all right again  ah but she hasnt done it yet    iii   he had taken the train a few days after this from a stationas well as to a stationselected almost at random such days whatever should happen were numbered and he had gone forth under the impulseartless enough no doubtto give the whole of one of them to that french ruralism with its cool special green into which he had hitherto looked only through the little oblong window of the pictureframe  it had been as yet for the most part but a land of fancy for himthe background of fiction the medium of art the nursery of letters practically as distant as greece but practically also wellnigh as consecrated  romance could weave itself for strethers sense out of elements mild enough and even after what he had as he felt lately been through he could thrill a little at the chance of seeing something somewhere that would remind him of a certain small lambinet that had charmed him long years before at a boston dealers and that he had quite absurdly never forgotten  it had been offered he remembered at a price he had been instructed to believe the lowest ever named for a lambinet a price he had never felt so poor as on having to recognise all the same as beyond a dream of possibility he had dreamedhad turned and twisted possibilities for an hour  it had been the only adventure of his life in connexion with the purchase of a work of art  the adventure it will be perceived was modest but the memory beyond all reason and by some accident of association was sweet  the little lambinet abode with him as the picture he would have boughtthe particular production that had made him for the moment overstep the modesty of nature  he was quite aware that if he were to see it again he should perhaps have a drop or a shock and he never found himself wishing that the wheel of time would turn it up again just as he had seen it in the marooncoloured skylighted inner shrine of tremont street it would be a different thing however to see the remembered mixture resolved back into its elementsto assist at the restoration to nature of the whole faraway hour  the dusty day in boston the background of the fitchburg depot of the marooncoloured sanctum the specialgreen vision the ridiculous price the poplars the willows the rushes the river the sunny silvery sky the shady woody horizon  he observed in respect to his train almost no condition save that it should stop a few times after getting out of the banlieue he threw himself on the general amiability of the day for the hint of where to alight  his theory of his excursion was that he could alight anywherenot nearer paris than an hours runon catching a suggestion of the particular note required  it made its sign the suggestionweather air light colour and his mood all favouringat the end of some eighty minutes the train pulled up just at the right spot and he found himself getting out as securely as if to keep an appointment  it will be felt of him that he could amuse himself at his age with very small things if it be again noted that his appointment was only with a superseded boston fashion  he hadnt gone far without the quick confidence that it would be quite sufficiently kept  the oblong gilt frame disposed its enclosing lines the poplars and willows the reeds and rivera river of which he didnt know and didnt want to know the namefell into a composition full of felicity within them the sky was silver and turquoise and varnish the village on the left was white and the church on the right was grey it was all there in shortit was what he wanted  it was tremont street it was france it was lambinet  moreover he was freely walking about in it he did this last for an hour to his hearts content making for the shady woody horizon and boring so deep into his impression and his idleness that he might fairly have got through them again and reached the marooncoloured wall  it was a wonder no doubt that the taste of idleness for him shouldnt need more time to sweeten but it had in fact taken the few previous days it had been sweetening in truth ever since the retreat of the pococks he walked and walked as if to show himself how little he had now to do he had nothing to do but turn off to some hillside where he might stretch himself and hear the poplars rustle and whencein the course of an afternoon so spent an afternoon richly suffused too with the sense of a book in his pockethe should sufficiently command the scene to be able to pick out just the right little rustic inn for an experiment in respect to dinner  there was a train back to paris at 920 and he saw himself partaking at the close of the day with the enhancements of a coarse white cloth and a sanded door of something fried and felicitous washed down with authentic wine after which he might as he liked either stroll back to his station in the gloaming or propose for the local carriole and converse with his driver a driver who naturally wouldnt fail of a stiff clean blouse of a knitted nightcap and of the genius of responsewho in fine would sit on the shafts tell him what the french people were thinking and remind him as indeed the whole episode would incidentally do of maupassant  strether heard his lips for the first time in french air as this vision assumed consistency emit sounds of expressive intention without fear of his company he had been afraid of chad and of maria and of madame de vionnet he had been most of all afraid of waymarsh in whose presence so far as they had mixed together in the light of the town he had never without somehow paying for it aired either his vocabulary or his accent  he usually paid for it by meeting immediately afterwards waymarshs eye  such were the liberties with which his fancy played after he had turned off to the hillside that did really and truly as well as most amiably await him beneath the poplars the hillside that made him feel for a murmurous couple of hours how happy had been his thought  he had the sense of success of a finer harmony in things nothing but what had turned out as yet according to his plan it most of all came home to him as he lay on his back on the grass that sarah had really gone that his tension was really relaxed the peace diffused in these ideas might be delusive but it hung about him none the less for the time it fairly for half an hour sent him to sleep he pulled his straw hat over his eyeshe had bought it the day before with a reminiscence of waymarshsand lost himself anew in lambinet  it was as if he had found out he was tiredtired not from his walk but from that inward exercise which had known on the whole for three months so little intermission  that was itwhen once they were off he had dropped this moreover was what he had dropped to and now he was touching bottom  he was kept luxuriously quiet soothed and amused by the consciousness of what he had found at the end of his descent  it was very much what he had told maria gostrey he should like to stay on for the hugelydistributed paris of summer alternately dazzling and dusky with a weight lifted for him off its columns and cornices and with shade and air in the flutter of awnings as wide as avenues  it was present to him without attenuation that reaching out the day after making the remark for some proof of his freedom he had gone that very afternoon to see madame de vionnet he had gone again the next day but one and the effect of the two visits the aftersense of the couple of hours spent with her was almost that of fulness and frequency  the brave intention of frequency so great with him from the moment of his finding himself unjustly suspected at woollett had remained rather theoretic and one of the things he could muse about under his poplars was the source of the special shyness that had still made him careful he had surely got rid of it now this special shyness what had become of it if it hadnt precisely within the week rubbed off  it struck him now in fact as sufficiently plain that if he had still been careful he had been so for a reason  he had really feared in his behaviour a lapse from good faith if there was a danger of ones liking such a woman too much ones best safety was in waiting at least till one had the right to do so  in the light of the last few days the danger was fairly vivid so that it was proportionately fortunate that the right was likewise established it seemed to our friend that he had on each occasion profited to the utmost by the latter  how could he have done so more he at all events asked himself than in having immediately let her know that if it was all the same to her he preferred not to talk about anything tiresome  he had never in his life so sacrificed an armful of high interests as in that remark he had never so prepared the way for the comparatively frivolous as in addressing it to madame de vionnets intelligence  it hadnt been till later that he quite recalled how in conjuring away everything but the pleasant he had conjured away almost all they had hitherto talked about it was not till later even that he remembered how with their new tone they hadnt so much as mentioned the name of chad himself one of the things that most lingered with him on his hillside was this delightful facility with such a woman of arriving at a new tone he thought as he lay on his back of all the tones she might make possible if one were to try her and at any rate of the probability that one could trust her to fit them to occasions  he had wanted her to feel that as he was disinterested now so she herself should be and she had showed she felt it and he had showed he was grateful and it had been for all the world as if he were calling for the first time they had had other but irrelevant meetings it was quite as if had they sooner known how much they really had in common there were quantities of comparatively dull matters they might have skipped well they were skipping them now even to graceful gratitude even to handsome dont mention itand it was amazing what could still come up without reference to what had been going on between them  it might have been on analysis nothing more than shakespeare and the musical glasses but it had served all the purpose of his appearing to have said to her dont like me if its a question of liking me for anything obvious and clumsy that ive as they call it done for you like mewell like me hang it for anything else you choose  so by the same propriety dont be for me simply the person ive come to know through my awkward connexion with chadwas ever anything by the way more awkward  be for me please with all your admirable tact and trust just whatever i may show you its a present pleasure to me to think you it had been a large indication to meet but if she hadnt met it what had she done and how had their time together slipped along so smoothly mild but not slow and melting liquefying into his happy illusion of idleness  he could recognise on the other hand that he had probably not been without reason in his prior his restricted state for keeping an eye on his liability to lapse from good faith  he really continued in the picturethat being for himself his situationall the rest of this rambling day so that the charm was still was indeed more than ever upon him when toward six oclock he found himself amicably engaged with a stout whitecapped deepvoiced woman at the door of the auberge of the biggest village a village that affected him as a thing of whiteness blueness and crookedness set in coppery green and that had the river flowing behind or before itone couldnt say which at the bottom in particular of the inngarden he had had other adventures before this had kept along the height after shaking off slumber had admired had almost coveted another small old church all steep roof and dim slatecolour without and all whitewash and paper flowers within had lost his way and had found it again had conversed with rustics who struck him perhaps a little more as men of the world than he had expected had acquired at a bound a fearless facility in french had had as the afternoon waned a watery bock all pale and parisian in the cafe of the furthest village which was not the biggest and had meanwhile not once overstepped the oblong gilt frame the frame had drawn itself out for him as much as you please but that was just his luck  he had finally come down again to the valley to keep within touch of stations and trains turning his face to the quarter from which he had started and thus it was that he had at last pulled up before the hostess of the cheval blanc who met him with a rough readiness that was like the clatter of sabots over stones on their common ground of a cotelette de veau a loseille and a subsequent lift  he had walked many miles and didnt know he was tired but he still knew he was amused and even that though he had been alone all day he had never yet so struck himself as engaged with others and in midstream of his drama  it might have passed for finished his drama with its catastrophe all but reached  it had however none the less been vivid again for him as he thus gave it its fuller chance  he had only had to be at last well out of it to feel it oddly enough still going on  for this had been all day at bottom the spell of the picturethat it was essentially more than anything else a scene and a stage that the very air of the play was in the rustle of the willows and the tone of the sky  the play and the characters had without his knowing it till now peopled all his space for him and it seemed somehow quite happy that they should offer themselves in the conditions so supplied with a kind of inevitability  it was as if the conditions made them not only inevitable but so much more nearly natural and right as that they were at least easier pleasanter to put up with  the conditions had nowhere so asserted their difference from those of woollett as they appeared to him to assert it in the little court of the cheval blanc while he arranged with his hostess for a comfortable climax  they were few and simple scant and humble but they were the thing as he would have called it even to a greater degree than madame de vionnets old high salon where the ghost of the empire walked  the thing was the thing that implied the greatest number of other things of the sort he had had to tackle and it was queer of course but so it wasthe implication here was complete  not a single one of his observations but somehow fell into a place in it not a breath of the cooler evening that wasnt somehow a syllable of the text the text was simply when condensed that in these places such things were and that if it was in them one elected to move about one had to make ones account with what one lighted on  meanwhile at all events it was enough that they did affect oneso far as the village aspect was concernedas whiteness crookedness and blueness set in coppery green there being positively for that matter an outer wall of the white horse that was painted the most improbable shade  that was part of the amusementas if to show that the fun was harmless just as it was enough further that the picture and the play seemed supremely to melt together in the good womans broad sketch of what she could do for her visitors appetite he felt in short a confidence and it was general and it was all he wanted to feel  it suffered no shock even on her mentioning that she had in fact just laid the cloth for two persons who unlike monsieur had arrived by the riverin a boat of their own who had asked her half an hour before what she could do for them and had then paddled away to look at something a little further upfrom which promenade they would presently return monsieur might meanwhile if he liked pass into the garden such as it was where she would serve him should he wish itfor there were tables and benches in plentya bitter before his repast here she would also report to him on the possibility of a conveyance to his station and here at any rate he would have the agrement of the river  it may be mentioned without delay that monsieur had the agrement of everything and in particular for the next twenty minutes of a small and primitive pavilion that at the gardens edge almost overhung the water testifying in its somewhat battered state to much fond frequentation  it consisted of little more than a platform slightly raised with a couple of benches and a table a protecting rail and a projecting roof but it raked the full greyblue stream which taking a turn a short distance above passed out of sight to reappear much higher up and it was clearly in esteemed requisition for sundays and other feasts  strether sat there and though hungry felt at peace the confidence that had so gathered for him deepened with the lap of the water the ripple of the surface the rustle of the reeds on the opposite bank the faint diffused coolness and the slight rock of a couple of small boats attached to a rough landingplace hard by  the valley on the further side was all coppergreen level and glazed pearly sky a sky hatched across with screens of trimmed trees which looked flat like espaliers and though the rest of the village straggled away in the near quarter the view had an emptiness that made one of the boats suggestive  such a river set one afloat almost before one could take up the oarsthe idle play of which would be moreover the aid to the full impression  this perception went so far as to bring him to his feet but that movement in turn made him feel afresh that he was tired and while he leaned against a post and continued to look out he saw something that gave him a sharper arrest    iv  what he saw was exactly the right thinga boat advancing round the bend and containing a man who held the paddles and a lady at the stern with a pink parasol  it was suddenly as if these figures or something like them had been wanted in the picture had been wanted more or less all day and had now drifted into sight with the slow current on purpose to fill up the measure  they came slowly floating down evidently directed to the landingplace near their spectator and presenting themselves to him not less clearly as the two persons for whom his hostess was already preparing a meal  for two very happy persons he found himself straightway taking thema young man in shirtsleeves a young woman easy and fair who had pulled pleasantly up from some other place and being acquainted with the neighbourhood had known what this particular retreat could offer them  the air quite thickened at their approach with further intimations the intimation that they were expert familiar frequentthat this wouldnt at all events be the first time  they knew how to do it he vaguely feltand it made them but the more idyllic though at the very moment of the impression as happened their boat seemed to have begun to drift wide the oarsman letting it go  it had by this time none the less come much nearernear enough for strether to dream the lady in the stern had for some reason taken account of his being there to watch them she had remarked on it sharply yet her companion hadnt turned round it was in fact almost as if our friend had felt her bid him keep still she had taken in something as a result of which their course had wavered and it continued to waver while they just stood off  this little effect was sudden and rapid so rapid that strethers sense of it was separate only for an instant from a sharp start of his own  he too had within the minute taken in something taken in that he knew the lady whose parasol shifting as if to hide her face made so fine a pink point in the shining scene  it was too prodigious a chance in a million but if he knew the lady the gentleman who still presented his back and kept off the gentleman the coatless hero of the idyll who had responded to her start was to match the marvel none other than chad  chad and madame de vionnet were then like himself taking a day in the countrythough it was as queer as fiction as farce that their country could happen to be exactly his and she had been the first at recognition the first to feel across the water the shockfor it appeared to come to thatof their wonderful accident strether became aware with this of what was taking placethat her recognition had been even stranger for the pair in the boat that her immediate impulse had been to control it and that she was quickly and intensely debating with chad the risk of betrayal he saw they would show nothing if they could feel sure he hadnt made them out so that he had before him for a few seconds his own hesitation  it was a sharp fantastic crisis that had popped up as if in a dream and it had had only to last the few seconds to make him feel it as quite horrible  they were thus on either side trying the other side and all for some reason that broke the stillness like some unprovoked harsh note  it seemed to him again within the limit that he had but one thing to doto settle their common question by some sign of surprise and joy  he hereupon gave large play to these things agitating his hat and his stick and loudly calling outa demonstration that brought him relief as soon as he had seen it answered  the boat in midstream still went a little wildwhich seemed natural however while chad turned round half springing up and his good friend after blankness and wonder began gaily to wave her parasol  chad dropped afresh to his paddles and the boat headed round amazement and pleasantry filling the air meanwhile and relief as strether continued to fancy superseding mere violence our friend went down to the water under this odd impression as of violence avertedthe violence of their having cut him out there in the eye of nature on the assumption that he wouldnt know it  he awaited them with a face from which he was conscious of not being able quite to banish this idea that they would have gone on not seeing and not knowing missing their dinner and disappointing their hostess had he himself taken a line to match that at least was what darkened his vision for the moment  afterwards after they had bumped at the landingplace and he had assisted their getting ashore everything found itself sponged over by the mere miracle of the encounter  they could so much better at last on either side treat it as a wild extravagance of hazard that the situation was made elastic by the amount of explanation called into play  why indeedapart from odditythe situation should have been really stiff was a question naturally not practical at the moment and in fact so far as we are concerned a question tackled later on and in private only by strether himself  he was to reflect later on and in private that it was mainly he who had explainedas he had had moreover comparatively little difficulty in doing  he was to have at all events meanwhile the worrying thought of their perhaps secretly suspecting him of having plotted this coincidence taking such pains as might be to give it the semblance of an accident  that possibilityas their imputationdidnt of course bear looking into for an instant yet the whole incident was so manifestly arrange it as they would an awkward one that he could scarce keep disclaimers in respect to his own presence from rising to his lips disclaimers of intention would have been as tactless as his presence was practically gross and the narrowest escape they either of them had was his lucky escape in the event from making any  nothing of the sort so far as surface and sound were involved was even in question surface and sound all made for their common ridiculous good fortune for the general invraisemblance of the occasion for the charming chance that they had the others in passing ordered some food to be ready the charming chance that he had himself not eaten the charming chance even more that their little plans their hours their train in short from labas would all match for their return together to paris  the chance that was most charming of all the chance that drew from madame de vionnet her clearest gayest comme cela se trouve was the announcement made to strether after they were seated at table the word given him by their hostess in respect to his carriage for the station on which he might now count  it settled the matter for his friends as well the conveyanceit was all too luckywould serve for them and nothing was more delightful than his being in a position to make the train so definite it might have been for themselvesto hear madame de vionnetalmost unnaturally vague a detail left to be fixed though strether indeed was afterwards to remember that chad had promptly enough intervened to forestall this appearance laughing at his companions flightiness and making the point that he had after all in spite of the bedazzlement of a day out with her known what he was about  strether was to remember afterwards further that this had had for him the effect of forming chads almost sole intervention and indeed he was to remember further still in subsequent meditation many things that as it were fitted together  another of them was for instance that the wonderful womans overflow of surprise and amusement was wholly into french which she struck him as speaking with an unprecedented command of idiomatic turns but in which she got as he might have said somewhat away from him taking all at once little brilliant jumps that he could but lamely match  the question of his own french had never come up for them it was the one thing she wouldnt have permittedit belonged for a person who had been through much to mere boredom but the present result was odd fairly veiling her identity shifting her back into a mere voluble class or race to the intense audibility of which he was by this time inured  when she spoke the charming slightly strange english he best knew her by he seemed to feel her as a creature among all the millions with a language quite to herself the real monopoly of a special shade of speech beautifully easy for her yet of a colour and a cadence that were both inimitable and matters of accident  she came back to these things after they had shaken down in the innparlour and knew as it were what was to become of them it was inevitable that loud ejaculation over the prodigy of their convergence should at last wear itself out  then it was that his impression took fuller formthe impression destined only to deepen to complete itself that they had something to put a face upon to carry off and make the best of and that it was she who admirably on the whole was doing this  it was familiar to him of course that they had something to put a face upon their friendship their connexion took any amount of explainingthat would have been made familiar by his twenty minutes with mrs pocock if it hadnt already been so  yet his theory as we know had bountifully been that the facts were specifically none of his business and were over and above so far as one had to do with them intrinsically beautiful and this might have prepared him for anything as well as rendered him proof against mystification when he reached home that night however he knew he had been at bottom neither prepared nor proof and since we have spoken of what he was after his return to recall and interpret it may as well immediately be said that his real experience of these few hours put on in that belated visionfor he scarce went to bed till morningthe aspect that is most to our purpose  he then knew more or less how he had been affectedhe but half knew at the time  there had been plenty to affect him even after as has been said they had shaken down for his consciousness though muffled had its sharpest moments during this passage a marked drop into innocent friendly bohemia  they then had put their elbows on the table deploring the premature end of their two or three dishes which they had tried to make up with another bottle while chad joked a little spasmodically perhaps even a little irrelevantly with the hostess what it all came to had been that fiction and fable were inevitably in the air and not as a simple term of comparison but as a result of things said also that they were blinking it all round and that they yet neednt so much as that have blinked itthough indeed if they hadnt strether didnt quite see what else they could have done strether didnt quite see that even at an hour or two past midnight even when he had at his hotel for a long time without a light and without undressing sat back on his bedroom sofa and stared straight before him  he was at that point of vantage in full possession to make of it all what he could  he kept making of it that there had been simply a lie in the charming affaira lie on which one could now detached and deliberate perfectly put ones finger  it was with the lie that they had eaten and drunk and talked and laughed that they had waited for their carriole rather impatiently and had then got into the vehicle and sensibly subsiding driven their three or four miles through the darkening summer night  the eating and drinking which had been a resource had had the effect of having served its turn the talk and laughter had done as much and it was during their somewhat tedious progress to the station during the waits there the further delays their submission to fatigue their silences in the dim compartment of the muchstopping train that he prepared himself for reflexions to come it had been a performance madame de vionnets manner and though it had to that degree faltered toward the end as through her ceasing to believe in it as if she had asked herself or chad had found a moment surreptitiously to ask her what after all was the use a performance it had none the less quite handsomely remained with the final fact about it that it was on the whole easier to keep up than to abandon  from the point of view of presence of mind it had been very wonderful indeed wonderful for readiness for beautiful assurance for the way her decision was taken on the spot without time to confer with chad without time for anything  their only conference could have been the brief instants in the boat before they confessed to recognising the spectator on the bank for they hadnt been alone together a moment since and must have communicated all in silence it was a part of the deep impression for strether and not the least of the deep interest that they could so communicatethat chad in particular could let her know he left it to her  he habitually left things to others as strether was so well aware and it in fact came over our friend in these meditations that there had been as yet no such vivid illustration of his famous knowing how to live it was as if he had humoured her to the extent of letting her lie without correctionalmost as if really he would be coming round in the morning to set the matter as between strether and himself right  of course he couldnt quite come it was a case in which a man was obliged to accept the womans version even when fantastic if she had with more flurry than she cared to show elected as the phrase was to represent that they had left paris that morning and with no design but of getting back within the dayif she had so sizedup in the woollett phrase their necessity she knew best her own measure  there were things all the same it was impossible to blink and which made this measure an odd onethe too evident fact for instance that she hadnt started out for the day dressed and hatted and shod and even for that matter pink parasold as she had been in the boat  from what did the drop in her assurance proceed as the tension increasedfrom what did this slightly baffled ingenuity spring but from her consciousness of not presenting as night closed in with not so much as a shawl to wrap her round an appearance that matched her story  she admitted that she was cold but only to blame her imprudence which chad suffered her to give such account of as she might  her shawl and chads overcoat and her other garments and his those they had each worn the day before were at the place best known to themselvesa quiet retreat enough no doubtat which they had been spending the twentyfour hours to which they had fully meant to return that evening from which they had so remarkably swum into strethers ken and the tacit repudiation of which had been thus the essence of her comedy strether saw how she had perceived in a flash that they couldnt quite look to going back there under his nose though honestly as he gouged deeper into the matter he was somewhat surprised as chad likewise had perhaps been at the uprising of this scruple he seemed even to divine that she had entertained it rather for chad than for herself and that as the young man had lacked the chance to enlighten her she had had to go on with it he meanwhile mistaking her motive  he was rather glad none the less that they had in point of fact not parted at the cheval blanc that he hadnt been reduced to giving them his blessing for an idyllic retreat down the river he had had in the actual case to makebelieve more than he liked but this was nothing it struck him to what the other event would have required  could he literally quite have faced the other event  would he have been capable of making the best of it with them  this was what he was trying to do now but with the advantage of his being able to give more time to it a good deal counteracted by his sense of what over and above the central fact itself he had to swallow  it was the quantity of makebelieve involved and so vividly exemplified that most disagreed with his spiritual stomach  he moved however from the consideration of that quantityto say nothing of the consciousness of that organback to the other feature of the show the deep deep truth of the intimacy revealed  that was what in his vain vigil he oftenest reverted to  intimacy at such a point was like thatand what in the world else would one have wished it to be like  it was all very well for him to feel the pity of its being so much like lying he almost blushed in the dark for the way he had dressed the possibility in vagueness as a little girl might have dressed her doll he had made themand by no fault of their ownmomentarily pull it for him the possibility out of this vagueness and must he not therefore take it now as they had had simply with whatever thin attenuations to give it to him  the very question it may be added made him feel lonely and cold  there was the element of the awkward all round but chad and madame de vionnet had at least the comfort that they could talk it over together  with whom could he talk of such thingsunless indeed always at almost any stage with maria  he foresaw that miss gostrey would come again into requisition on the morrow though it wasnt to be denied that he was already a little afraid of her what on earththats what i want to know nowhad you then supposed  he recognised at last that he had really been trying all along to suppose nothing  verily verily his labour had been lost he found himself supposing innumerable and wonderful things      book twelfth     i   strether couldnt have said he had during the previous hours definitely expected it yet when later on that morningthough no later indeed than for his coming forth at ten oclockhe saw the concierge produce on his approach a petit bleu delivered since his letters had been sent up he recognised the appearance as the first symptom of a sequel  he then knew he had been thinking of some early sign from chad as more likely after all than not and this would be precisely the early sign  he took it so for granted that he opened the petit bleu just where he had stopped in the pleasant cool draught of the portecochereonly curious to see where the young man would at such a juncture break out  his curiosity however was more than gratified the small missive whose gummed edge he had detached without attention to the address not being from the young man at all but from the person whom the case gave him on the spot as still more worth while worth while or not he went round to the nearest telegraphoffice the big one on the boulevard with a directness that almost confessed to a fear of the danger of delay  he might have been thinking that if he didnt go before he could think he wouldnt perhaps go at all  he at any rate kept in the lower sidepocket of his morning coat a very deliberate hand on his blue missive crumpling it up rather tenderly than harshly  he wrote a reply on the boulevard also in the form of a petit bleuwhich was quickly done under pressure of the place inasmuch as like madame de vionnets own communication it consisted of the fewest words  she had asked him if he could do her the very great kindness of coming to see her that evening at halfpast nine and he answered as if nothing were easier that he would present himself at the hour she named  she had added a line of postscript to the effect that she would come to him elsewhere and at his own hour if he preferred but he took no notice of this feeling that if he saw her at all half the value of it would be in seeing her where he had already seen her best  he mightnt see her at all that was one of the reflexions he made after writing and before he dropped his closed card into the box he mightnt see any one at all any more at all he might make an end as well now as ever leaving things as they were since he was doubtless not to leave them better and taking his way home so far as should appear that a home remained to him  this alternative was for a few minutes so sharp that if he at last did deposit his missive it was perhaps because the pressure of the place had an effect  there was none other however than the common and constant pressure familiar to our friend under the rubric of postes et telegraphesthe something in the air of these establishments the vibration of the vast strange life of the town the influence of the types the performers concocting their messages the little prompt paris women arranging pretexting goodness knew what driving the dreadful needlepointed public pen at the dreadful sandstrewn public table implements that symbolised for strethers too interpretative innocence something more acute in manners more sinister in morals more fierce in the national life  after he had put in his paper he had ranged himself he was really amused to think on the side of the fierce the sinister the acute  he was carrying on a correspondence across the great city quite in the key of the postes et telegraphes in general and it was fairly as if the acceptance of that fact had come from something in his state that sorted with the occupation of his neighbours  he was mixed up with the typical tale of paris and so were they poor thingshow could they all together help being they were no worse than he in short and he no worse than theyif queerly enough no better and at all events he had settled his hash so that he went out to begin from that moment his day of waiting  the great settlement was as he felt in his preference for seeing his correspondent in her own best conditions  that was part of the typical tale the part most significant in respect to himself  he liked the place she lived in the picture that each time squared itself large and high and clear around her  every occasion of seeing it was a pleasure of a different shade  yet what precisely was he doing with shades of pleasure now and why hadnt he properly and logically compelled her to commit herself to whatever of disadvantage and penalty the situation might throw up  he might have proposed as for sarah pocock the cold hospitality of his own salon de lecture in which the chill of sarahs visit seemed still to abide and shades of pleasure were dim he might have suggested a stone bench in the dusty tuileries or a penny chair at the back part of the champs elysees  these things would have been a trifle stern and sternness alone now wouldnt be sinister  an instinct in him cast about for some form of discipline in which they might meetsome awkwardness they would suffer from some danger or at least some grave inconvenience they would incur  this would give a sensewhich the spirit required rather ached and sighed in the absence ofthat somebody was paying something somewhere and somehow that they were at least not all floating together on the silver stream of impunity  just instead of that to go and see her late in the evening as if for all the worldwell as if he were as much in the swim as anybody else  this had as little as possible in common with the penal form  even when he had felt that objection melt away however the practical difference was small the long stretch of his interval took the colour it would and if he lived on thus with the sinister from hour to hour it proved an easier thing than one might have supposed in advance  he reverted in thought to his old tradition the one he had been brought up on and which even so many years of life had but little worn away the notion that the state of the wrongdoer or at least this persons happiness presented some special difficulty  what struck him now rather was the ease of itfor nothing in truth appeared easier  it was an ease he himself fairly tasted of for the rest of the day giving himself quite up not so much as trying to dress it out in any particular whatever as a difficulty not after all going to see mariawhich would have been in a manner a result of such dressing only idling lounging smoking sitting in the shade drinking lemonade and consuming ices  the day had turned to heat and eventual thunder and he now and again went back to his hotel to find that chad hadnt been there  he hadnt yet struck himself since leaving woollett so much as a loafer though there had been times when he believed himself touching bottom  this was a deeper depth than any and with no foresight scarcely with a care as to what he should bring up  he almost wondered if he didnt look demoralised and disreputable he had the fanciful vision as he sat and smoked of some accidental some motived return of the pococks who would be passing along the boulevard and would catch this view of him they would have distinctly on his appearance every ground for scandal but fate failed to administer even that sternness the pococks never passed and chad made no sign  strether meanwhile continued to hold off from miss gostrey keeping her till tomorrow so that by evening his irresponsibility his impunity his luxury had becomethere was no other word for themimmense  between nine and ten at last in the high clear picturehe was moving in these days as in a gallery from clever canvas to clever canvashe drew a long breath  it was so presented to him from the first that the spell of his luxury wouldnt be broken  he wouldnt have that is to become responsiblethis was admirably in the air she had sent for him precisely to let him feel it so that he might go on with the comfort comfort already established hadnt it been of regarding his ordeal the ordeal of the weeks of sarahs stay and of their climax as safely traversed and left behind him  didnt she just wish to assure him that she now took it all and so kept it that he was absolutely not to worry any more was only to rest on his laurels and continue generously to help her  the light in her beautiful formal room was dim though it would do as everything would always do the hot night had kept out lamps but there was a pair of clusters of candles that glimmered over the chimneypiece like the tall tapers of an altar the windows were all open their redundant hangings swaying a little and he heard once more from the empty court the small plash of the fountain  from beyond this and as from a great distancebeyond the court beyond the corps de logis forming the frontcame as if excited and exciting the vague voice of paris strether had all along been subject to sudden gusts of fancy in connexion with such matters as theseodd starts of the historic sense suppositions and divinations with no warrant but their intensity  thus and so on the eve of the great recorded dates the days and nights of revolution the sounds had come in the omens the beginnings broken out  they were the smell of revolution the smell of the public temperor perhaps simply the smell of blood  it was at present queer beyond words subtle he would have risked saying that such suggestions should keep crossing the scene but it was doubtless the effect of the thunder in the air which had hung about all day without release  his hostess was dressed as for thunderous times and it fell in with the kind of imagination we have just attributed to him that she should be in simplest coolest white of a character so oldfashioned if he were not mistaken that madame roland must on the scaffold have worn something like it  this effect was enhanced by a small black fichu or scarf of crape or gauze disposed quaintly round her bosom and now completing as by a mystic touch the pathetic the noble analogy poor strether in fact scarce knew what analogy was evoked for him as the charming woman receiving him and making him as she could do such things at once familiarly and gravely welcome moved over her great room with her image almost repeated in its polished floor which had been fully bared for summer the associations of the place all felt again the gleam here and there in the subdued light of glass and gilt and parquet with the quietness of her own note as the centrethese things were at first as delicate as if they had been ghostly and he was sure in a moment that whatever he should find he had come for it wouldnt be for an impression that had previously failed him  that conviction held him from the outset and seeming singularly to simplify certified to him that the objects about would help him would really help them both no he might never see them againthis was only too probably the last time and he should certainly see nothing in the least degree like them he should soon be going to where such things were not and it would be a small mercy for memory for fancy to have in that stress a loaf on the shelf  he knew in advance he should look back on the perception actually sharpest with him as on the view of something old old old the oldest thing he had ever personally touched and he also knew even while he took his companion in as the feature among features that memory and fancy couldnt help being enlisted for her she might intend what she would but this was beyond anything she could intend with things from far backtyrannies of history facts of type values as the painters said of expressionall working for her and giving her the supreme chance the chance of the happy the really luxurious few the chance on a great occasion to be natural and simple  she had never with him been more so or if it was the perfection of art it would neverand that came to the same thingbe proved against her  what was truly wonderful was her way of differing so from time to time without detriment to her simplicity  caprices he was sure she felt were before anything else bad manners and that judgement in her was by itself a thing making more for safety of intercourse than anything that in his various own past intercourses he had had to reckon on  if therefore her presence was now quite other than the one she had shown him the night before there was nothing of violence in the changeit was all harmony and reason  it gave him a mild deep person whereas he had had on the occasion to which their interview was a direct reference a person committed to movement and surface and abounding in them but she was in either character more remarkable for nothing than for her bridging of intervals and this now fell in with what he understood he was to leave to her  the only thing was that if he was to leave it all to her why exactly had she sent for him  he had had vaguely in advance his explanation his view of the probability of her wishing to set something right to deal in some way with the fraud so lately practised on his presumed credulity  would she attempt to carry it further or would she blot it out  would she throw over it some more or less happy colour or would she do nothing about it at all  he perceived soon enough at least that however reasonable she might be she wasnt vulgarly confused and it herewith pressed upon him that their eminent lie chads and hers was simply after all such an inevitable tribute to good taste as he couldnt have wished them not to render  away from them during his vigil he had seemed to wince at the amount of comedy involved whereas in his present posture he could only ask himself how he should enjoy any attempt from her to take the comedy back  he shouldnt enjoy it at all but once more and yet once more he could trust her  that is he could trust her to make deception right  as she presented things the uglinessgoodness knew whywent out of them none the less too that she could present them with an art of her own by not so much as touching them  she let the matter at all events lie where it waswhere the previous twentyfour hours had placed it appearing merely to circle about it respectfully tenderly almost piously while she took up another question  she knew she hadnt really thrown dust in his eyes this the previous night before they separated had practically passed between them and as she had sent for him to see what the difference thus made for him might amount to so he was conscious at the end of five minutes that he had been tried and tested  she had settled with chad after he left them that she would for her satisfaction assure herself of this quantity and chad had as usual let her have her way  chad was always letting people have their way when he felt that it would somehow turn his wheel for him it somehow always did turn his wheel  strether felt oddly enough before these facts freshly and consentingly passive they again so rubbed it into him that the couple thus fixing his attention were intimate that his intervention had absolutely aided and intensified their intimacy and that in fine he must accept the consequence of that  he had absolutely become himself with his perceptions and his mistakes his concessions and his reserves the droll mixture as it must seem to them of his braveries and his fears the general spectacle of his art and his innocence almost an added link and certainly a common priceless ground for them to meet upon  it was as if he had been hearing their very tone when she brought out a reference that was comparatively straight the last twice that youve been here you know i never asked you she said with an abrupt transitionthey had been pretending before this to talk simply of the charm of yesterday and of the interest of the country they had seen the effort was confessedly vain not for such talk had she invited him and her impatient reminder was of their having done for it all the needful on his coming to her after sarahs flight  what she hadnt asked him then was to state to her where and how he stood for her she had been resting on chads report of their midnight hour together in the boulevard malesherbes  the thing therefore she at present desired was ushered in by this recall of the two occasions on which disinterested and merciful she hadnt worried him  tonight truly she would worry him and this was her appeal to him to let her risk it  he wasnt to mind if she bored him a little she had behaved after allhadnt sheso awfully awfully well    ii   oh youre all right youre all right he almost impatiently declared his impatience being moreover not for her pressure but for her scruple  more and more distinct to him was the tune to which she would have had the matter out with chad  more and more vivid for him the idea that she had been nervous as to what he might be able to stand yes it had been a question if he had stood what the scene on the river had given him and though the young man had doubtless opined in favour of his recuperation her own last word must have been that she should feel easier in seeing for herself  that was it unmistakeably she was seeing for herself  what he could stand was thus in these moments in the balance for strether who reflected as he became fully aware of it that he must properly brace himself  he wanted fully to appear to stand all he might and there was a certain command of the situation for him in this very wish not to look too much at sea she was ready with everything but so sufficiently was he that is he was at one point the more prepared of the two inasmuch as for all her cleverness she couldnt produce on the spotand it was surprisingan account of the motive of her note  he had the advantage that his pronouncing her all right gave him for an enquiry  may i ask delighted as ive been to come if youve wished to say something special  he spoke as if she might have seen he had been waiting for itnot indeed with discomfort but with natural interest  then he saw that she was a little taken aback was even surprised herself at the detail she had neglectedthe only one ever yet having somehow assumed he would know would recognise would leave some things not to be said she looked at him however an instant as if to convey that if he wanted them all  selfish and vulgarthats what i must seem to you  youve done everything for me and here i am as if i were asking for more  but it isnt she went on because im afraidthough i am of course afraid as a woman in my position always is  i mean it isnt because one lives in terrorit isnt because of that one is selfish for im ready to give you my word tonight that i dont care dont care what still may happen and what i may lose  i dont ask you to raise your little finger for me again nor do i wish so much as to mention to you what weve talked of before either my danger or my safety or his mother or his sister or the girl he may marry or the fortune he may make or miss or the right or the wrong of any kind he may do  if after the help one has had from you one cant either take care of ones self or simply hold ones tongue one must renounce all claim to be an object of interest  its in the name of what i do care about that ive tried still to keep hold of you  how can i be indifferent she asked to how i appear to you  and as he found himself unable immediately to say  why if youre going need you after all is it impossible you should stay onso that one maynt lose you  impossible i should live with you here instead of going home  not with us if you object to that but near enough to us somewhere for us to see youwell she beautifully brought out when we feel we must  how shall we not sometimes feel it  ive wanted to see you often when i couldnt she pursued all these last weeks how shant i then miss you now with the sense of your being gone forever then as if the straightness of this appeal taking him unprepared had visibly left him wondering  where is your home moreover nowwhat has become of it  ive made a change in your life i know i have ive upset everything in your mind as well in your sense ofwhat shall i call itall the decencies and possibilities it gives me a kind of detestation she pulled up short  oh but he wanted to hear  detestation of what  of everythingof life  ah thats too much he laughedor too little  too little preciselyshe was eager  what i hate is myselfwhen i think that one has to take so much to be happy out of the lives of others and that one isnt happy even then  one does it to cheat ones self and to stop ones mouthbut thats only at the best for a little the wretched self is always there always making one somehow a fresh anxiety  what it comes to is that its not that its never a happiness any happiness at all to take the only safe thing is to give  its what plays you least false interesting touching strikingly sincere as she let these things come from her she yet puzzled and troubled himso fine was the quaver of her quietness  he felt what he had felt before with her that there was always more behind what she showed and more and more again behind that  you know so at least she added where you are  you ought to know it indeed then for isnt what youve been giving exactly what has brought us together this way  youve been making as ive so fully let you know ive felt strether said the most precious present ive ever seen made and if you cant sit down peacefully on that performance you are no doubt born to torment yourself  but you ought he wound up to be easy  and not trouble you any more no doubtnot thrust on you even the wonder and the beauty of what ive done only let you regard our business as over and well over and see you depart in a peace that matches my own  no doubt no doubt no doubt she nervously repeatedall the more that i dont really pretend i believe you couldnt for yourself not have done what you have  i dont pretend you feel yourself victimised for this evidently is the way you live and its whatwere agreedis the best way  yes as you say she continued after a moment i ought to be easy and rest on my work well then here am i doing so  i am easy  youll have it for your last impression  when is it you say you go she asked with a quick change  he took some time to replyhis last impression was more and more so mixed a one  it produced in him a vague disappointment a drop that was deeper even than the fall of his elation the previous night  the good of what he had done if he had done so much wasnt there to enliven him quite to the point that would have been ideal for a grand gay finale  women were thus endlessly absorbent and to deal with them was to walk on water  what was at bottom the matter with her embroider as she might and disclaim as she mightwhat was at bottom the matter with her was simply chad himself it was of chad she was after all renewedly afraid the strange strength of her passion was the very strength of her fear she clung to him lambert strether as to a source of safety she had tested and generous graceful truthful as she might try to be exquisite as she was she dreaded the term of his being within reach with this sharpest perception yet it was like a chill in the air to him it was almost appalling that a creature so fine could be by mysterious forces a creature so exploited  for at the end of all things they were mysterious  she had but made chad what he wasso why could she think she had made him infinite she had made him better she had made him best she had made him anything one would but it came to our friend with supreme queerness that he was none the less only chad  strether had the sense that he a little had made him too his high appreciation had as it were consecrated her work the work however admirable was nevertheless of the strict human order and in short it was marvellous that the companion of mere earthly joys of comforts aberrations however one classed them within the common experience should be so transcendently prized  it might have made strether hot or shy as such secrets of others brought home sometimes do make us but he was held there by something so hard that it was fairly grim  this was not the discomposure of last night that had quite passedsuch discomposures were a detail the real coercion was to see a man ineffably adored  there it was againit took women it took women if to deal with them was to walk on water what wonder that the water rose  and it had never surely risen higher than round this woman  he presently found himself taking a long look from her and the next thing he knew he had uttered all his thought  youre afraid for your life  it drew out her long look and he soon enough saw why  a spasm came into her face the tears she had already been unable to hide overflowed at first in silence and then as the sound suddenly comes from a child quickened to gasps to sobs  she sat and covered her face with her hands giving up all attempt at a manner its how you see me its how you see meshe caught her breath with itand its as i am and as i must take myself and of course its no matter her emotion was at first so incoherent that he could only stand there at a loss stand with his sense of having upset her though of having done it by the truth  he had to listen to her in a silence that he made no immediate effort to attenuate feeling her doubly woeful amid all her dim diffused elegance consenting to it as he had consented to the rest and even conscious of some vague inward irony in the presence of such a fine free range of bliss and bale  he couldnt say it was not no matter for he was serving her to the end he now knew anywayquite as if what he thought of her had nothing to do with it it was actually moreover as if he didnt think of her at all as if he could think of nothing but the passion mature abysmal pitiful she represented and the possibilities she betrayed she was older for him tonight visibly less exempt from the touch of time but she was as much as ever the finest and subtlest creature the happiest apparition it had been given him in all his years to meet and yet he could see her there as vulgarly troubled in very truth as a maidservant crying for her young man  the only thing was that she judged herself as the maidservant wouldnt the weakness of which wisdom too the dishonour of which judgement seemed but to sink her lower her collapse however no doubt was briefer and she had in a manner recovered herself before he intervened  of course im afraid for my life  but thats nothing  it isnt that  he was silent a little longer as if thinking what it might be theres something i have in mind that i can still do  but she threw off at last with a sharp sad headshake drying her eyes what he could still do  i dont care for that  of course as ive said youre acting in your wonderful way for yourself and whats for yourself is no more my businessthough i may reach out unholy hands so clumsily to touch itthan if it were something in timbuctoo its only that you dont snub me as youve had fifty chances to doits only your beautiful patience that makes one forget ones manners  in spite of your patience all the same she went on youd do anything rather than be with us here even if that were possible youd do everything for us but be mixed up with uswhich is a statement you can easily answer to the advantage of your own manners you can say whats the use of talking of things that at the best are impossible what is of course the use  its only my little madness youd talk if you were tormented  and i dont mean now about him  oh for him positively strangely bitterly as it seemed to strether she gave him for the moment away  you dont care what i think of you but i happen to care what you think of me  and what you might she added  what you perhaps even did  he gained time  what i did  did think before  before this  didnt you think  but he had already stopped her  i didnt think anything  i never think a step further than im obliged to  thats perfectly false i believe she returnedexcept that you may no doubt often pull up when things become too ugly or even ill say to save you a protest too beautiful  at any rate even so far as its true weve thrust on you appearances that youve had to take in and that have therefore made your obligation  ugly or beautifulit doesnt matter what we call themyou were getting on without them and thats where were detestable  we bore youthats where we are  and we may wellfor what weve cost you  all you can do now is not to think at all  and i who should have liked to seem to youwell sublime  he could only after a moment reecho miss barrace  youre wonderful  im old and abject and hideousshe went on as without hearing him abject above all  or old above all  its when ones old that its worst  i dont care what becomes of itlet what will there it is its a doomi know it you cant see it more than i do myself  things have to happen as they will with which she came back again to what face to face with him had so quite broken down  of course you wouldnt even if possible and no matter what may happen to you be near us  but think of me think of me she exhaled it into air  he took refuge in repeating something he had already said and that she had made nothing of  theres something i believe i can still do and he put his hand out for goodbye  she again made nothing of it she went on with her insistence that wont help you  theres nothing to help you  well it may help you he said  she shook her head  theres not a grain of certainty in my futurefor the only certainty is that i shall be the loser in the end  she hadnt taken his hand but she moved with him to the door thats cheerful he laughed for your benefactor  whats cheerful for me she replied is that we might you and i have been friends  thats itthats it  you see how as i say i want everything  ive wanted you too  ah but youve had me he declared at the door with an emphasis that made an end    iii   his purpose had been to see chad the next day and he had prefigured seeing him by an early call having in general never stood on ceremony in respect to visits at the boulevard malesherbes  it had been more often natural for him to go there than for chad to come to the small hotel the attractions of which were scant yet it nevertheless just now at the eleventh hour did suggest itself to strether to begin by giving the young man a chance  it struck him that in the inevitable course chad would be round as waymarsh used to saywaymarsh who already somehow seemed long ago  he hadnt come the day before because it had been arranged between them that madame de vionnet should see their friend first but now that this passage had taken place he would present himself and their friend wouldnt have long to wait strether assumed he became aware on this reasoning that the interesting parties to the arrangement would have met betimes and that the more interesting of the twoas she was after allwould have communicated to the other the issue of her appeal  chad would know without delay that his mothers messenger had been with her and though it was perhaps not quite easy to see how she could qualify what had occurred he would at least have been sufficiently advised to feel he could go on  the day however brought early or late no word from him and strether felt as a result of this that a change had practically come over their intercourse  it was perhaps a premature judgement or it only meant perhapshow could he tellthat the wonderful pair he protected had taken up again together the excursion he had accidentally checked  they might have gone back to the country and gone back but with a long breath drawn that indeed would best mark chads sense that reprobation hadnt rewarded madame de vionnets request for an interview  at the end of the twentyfour hours at the end of the fortyeight there was still no overture so that strether filled up the time as he had so often filled it before by going to see miss gostrey  he proposed amusements to her he felt expert now in proposing amusements and he had thus for several days an odd sense of leading her about paris of driving her in the bois of showing her the penny steamboatsthose from which the breeze of the seine was to be best enjoyedthat might have belonged to a kindly uncle doing the honours of the capital to an intelligent niece from the country  he found means even to take her to shops she didnt know or that she pretended she didnt while she on her side was like the country maiden all passive modest and gratefulgoing in fact so far as to emulate rusticity in occasional fatigues and bewilderments  strether described these vague proceedings to himself described them even to her as a happy interlude the sign of which was that the companions said for the time no further word about the matter they had talked of to satiety he proclaimed satiety at the outset and she quickly took the hint as docile both in this and in everything else as the intelligent obedient niece  he told her as yet nothing of his late adventurefor as an adventure it now ranked with him he pushed the whole business temporarily aside and found his interest in the fact of her beautiful assent  she left questions unaskedshe who for so long had been all questions she gave herself up to him with an understanding of which mere mute gentleness might have seemed the sufficient expression  she knew his sense of his situation had taken still another stepof that he was quite aware but she conveyed that whatever had thus happened for him it was thrown into the shade by what was happening for herself  thisthough it mightnt to a detached spirit have seemed muchwas the major interest and she met it with a new directness of response measuring it from hour to hour with her grave hush of acceptance touched as he had so often been by her before he was for his part too touched afresh all the more that though he could be duly aware of the principle of his own mood he couldnt be equally so of the principle of hers  he knew that is in a mannerknew roughly and resignedlywhat he himself was hatching whereas he had to take the chance of what he called to himself marias calculations  it was all he needed that she liked him enough for what they were doing and even should they do a good deal more would still like him enough for that the essential freshness of a relation so simple was a cool bath to the soreness produced by other relations  these others appeared to him now horribly complex they bristled with fine points points all unimaginable beforehand points that pricked and drew blood a fact that gave to an hour with his present friend on a bateaumouche or in the afternoon shade of the champs elysees something of the innocent pleasure of handling rounded ivory  his relation with chad personallyfrom the moment he had got his point of viewhad been of the simplest yet this also struck him as bristling after a third and a fourth blank day had passed  it was as if at last however his care for such indications had dropped there came a fifth blank day and he ceased to enquire or to heed  they now took on to his fancy miss gostrey and he the image of the babes in the wood they could trust the merciful elements to let them continue at peace  he had been great already as he knew at postponements but he had only to get afresh into the rhythm of one to feel its fine attraction  it amused him to say to himself that he might for all the world have been going to diedie resignedly the scene was filled for him with so deep a deathbed hush so melancholy a charm  that meant the postponement of everything elsewhich made so for the quiet lapse of life and the postponement in especial of the reckoning to comeunless indeed the reckoning to come were to be one and the same thing with extinction  it faced him the reckoning over the shoulder of much interposing experiencewhich also faced him and one would float to it doubtless duly through these caverns of kubla khan  it was really behind everything it hadnt merged in what he had done his final appreciation of what he had donehis appreciation on the spotwould provide it with its main sharpness  the spot so focussed was of course woollett and he was to see at the best what woollett would be with everything there changed for him  wouldnt that revelation practically amount to the windup of his career  well the summers end would show his suspense had meanwhile exactly the sweetness of vain delay and he had with it we should mention other pastimes than marias companyplenty of separate musings in which his luxury failed him but at one point  he was well in port the outer sea behind him and it was only a matter of getting ashore  there was a question that came and went for him however as he rested against the side of his ship and it was a little to get rid of the obsession that he prolonged his hours with miss gostrey  it was a question about himself but it could only be settled by seeing chad again it was indeed his principal reason for wanting to see chad after that it wouldnt signifyit was a ghost that certain words would easily lay to rest  only the young man must be there to take the words  once they were taken he wouldnt have a question left none that is in connexion with this particular affair  it wouldnt then matter even to himself that he might now have been guilty of speaking because of what he had forfeited  that was the refinement of his supreme scruplehe wished so to leave what he had forfeited out of account  he wished not to do anything because he had missed something else because he was sore or sorry or impoverished because he was maltreated or desperate he wished to do everything because he was lucid and quiet just the same for himself on all essential points as he had ever been  thus it was that while he virtually hung about for chad he kept mutely putting it  youve been chucked old boy but what has that to do with it it would have sickened him to feel vindictive  these tints of feeling indeed were doubtless but the iridescence of his idleness and they were presently lost in a new light from maria  she had a fresh fact for him before the week was out and she practically met him with it on his appearing one night  he hadnt on this day seen her but had planned presenting himself in due course to ask her to dine with him somewhere out of doors on one of the terraces in one of the gardens of which the paris of summer was profuse  it had then come on to rain so that disconcerted he changed his mind dining alone at home a little stuffily and stupidly and waiting on her afterwards to make up his loss  he was sure within a minute that something had happened it was so in the air of the rich little room that he had scarcely to name his thought  softly lighted the whole colour of the place with its vague values was in cool fusionan effect that made the visitor stand for a little agaze  it was as if in doing so now he had felt a recent presencehis recognition of the passage of which his hostess in turn divined  she had scarcely to say ityes she has been here and this time i received her it wasnt till a minute later that she added  there being as i understand you no reason now  none for your refusing  noif youve done what youve had to do  ive certainly so far done it strether said as that you neednt fear the effect or the appearance of coming between us  theres nothing between us now but what we ourselves have put there and not an inch of room for anything else whatever  therefore youre only beautifully with us as alwaysthough doubtless now if she has talked to you rather more with us than less  of course if she came he added it was to talk to you  it was to talk to me maria returned on which he was further sure that she was practically in possession of what he himself hadnt yet told her  he was even sure she was in possession of things he himself couldnt have told for the consciousness of them was now all in her face and accompanied there with a shade of sadness that marked in her the close of all uncertainties  it came out for him more than ever yet that she had had from the first a knowledge she believed him not to have had a knowledge the sharp acquisition of which might be destined to make a difference for him  the difference for him might not inconceivably be an arrest of his independence and a change in his attitudein other words a revulsion in favour of the principles of woollett  she had really prefigured the possibility of a shock that would send him swinging back to mrs newsome  he hadnt it was true week after week shown signs of receiving it but the possibility had been none the less in the air  what maria accordingly had had now to take in was that the shock had descended and that he hadnt all the same swung back  he had grown clear in a flash on a point long since settled for herself but no reapproximation to mrs newsome had occurred in consequence  madame de vionnet had by her visit held up the torch to these truths and what now lingered in poor marias face was the somewhat smoky light of the scene between them if the light however wasnt as we have hinted the glow of joy the reasons for this also were perhaps discernible to strether even through the blur cast over them by his natural modesty  she had held herself for months with a firm hand she hadnt interfered on any chanceand chances were specious enoughthat she might interfere to her profit  she had turned her back on the dream that mrs newsomes rupture their friends forfeiturethe engagement the relation itself broken beyond all mendingmight furnish forth her advantage and to stay her hand from promoting these things she had on private difficult but rigid lines played strictly fair  she couldnt therefore but feel that though as the end of all the facts in question had been stoutly confirmed her ground for personal for what might have been called interested elation remained rather vague  strether might easily have made out that she had been asking herself in the hours she had just sat through if there were still for her or were only not a fair shade of uncertainty  let us hasten to add however that what he at first made out on this occasion he also at first kept to himself  he only asked what in particular madame de vionnet had come for and as to this his companion was ready  she wants tidings of mr newsome whom she appears not to have seen for some days  then she hasnt been away with him again  she seemed to think maria answered that he might have gone away with you  and did you tell her i know nothing of him  she had her indulgent headshake  ive known nothing of what you know i could only tell her id ask you  then ive not seen him for a weekand of course ive wondered his wonderment showed at this moment as sharper but he presently went on still i dare say i can put my hand on him  did she strike you he asked as anxious  shes always anxious  after all ive done for her  and he had one of the last flickers of his occasional mild mirth  to think that was just what i came out to prevent  she took it up but to reply  you dont regard him then as safe  i was just going to ask you how in that respect you regard madame de vionnet  she looked at him a little  what woman was ever safe  she told me she addedand it was as if at the touch of the connexionof your extraordinary meeting in the country  after that a quoi se fier  it was as an accident in all the possible or impossible chapter strether conceded amazing enough  but still but still  but still she didnt mind  she doesnt mind anything  well then as you dont either we may all sink to rest  he appeared to agree with her but he had his reservation i do mind chads disappearance  oh youll get him back  but now you know she said why i went to mentone he had sufficiently let her see that he had by this time gathered things together but there was nature in her wish to make them clearer still  i didnt want you to put it to me  to put it to you  the question of what you were at lasta week agoto see for yourself  i didnt want to have to lie for her  i felt that to be too much for me  a man of course is always expected to do itto do it i mean for a woman but not a woman for another woman unless perhaps on the titfortat principle as an indirect way of protecting herself  i dont need protection so that i was free to funk yousimply to dodge your test  the responsibility was too much for me  i gained time and when i came back the need of a test had blown over  strether thought of it serenely  yes when you came back little bilham had shown me whats expected of a gentleman  little bilham had lied like one  and like what you believed him  well said strether it was but a technical liehe classed the attachment as virtuous  that was a view for which there was much to be saidand the virtue came out for me hugely there was of course a great deal of it  i got it full in the face and i havent you see done with it yet  what i see what i saw maria returned is that you dressed up even the virtue  you were wonderfulyou were beautiful as ive had the honour of telling you before but if you wish really to know she sadly confessed i never quite knew where you were there were moments she explained when you struck me as grandly cynical there were others when you struck me as grandly vague  her friend considered  i had phases  i had flights  yes but things must have a basis  a basis seemed to me just what her beauty supplied  her beauty of person  well her beauty of everything  the impression she makes  she has such variety and yet such harmony  she considered him with one of her deep returns of indulgencereturns out of all proportion to the irritations they flooded over youre complete  youre always too personal he goodhumouredly said but thats precisely how i wondered and wandered  if you mean she went on that she was from the first for you the most charming woman in the world nothings more simple  only that was an odd foundation  for what i reared on it  for what you didnt  well it was all not a fixed quantity  and it had for meit has stillsuch elements of strangeness  her greater age than his her different world traditions association her other opportunities liabilities standards  his friend listened with respect to his enumeration of these disparities then she disposed of them at a stroke  those things are nothing when a womans hit  its very awful  she was hit  strether on his side did justice to that plea  oh of course i saw she was hit  that she was hit was what we were busy with that she was hit was our great affair  but somehow i couldnt think of her as down in the dust  and as put there by our little chad  yet wasnt your little chad just your miracle  strether admitted it  of course i moved among miracles  it was all phantasmagoric  but the great fact was that so much of it was none of my businessas i saw my business  it isnt even now  his companion turned away on this and it might well have been yet again with the sharpness of a fear of how little his philosophy could bring her personally  i wish she could hear you  mrs newsome  nonot mrs newsome since i understand you that it doesnt matter now what mrs newsome hears  hasnt she heard everything  practicallyyes he had thought a moment but he went on  you wish madame de vionnet could hear me  madame de vionnet she had come back to him  she thinks just the contrary of what you say  that you distinctly judge her  he turned over the scene as the two women thus placed together for him seemed to give it  she might have known  might have known you dont miss gostrey asked as he let it drop she was sure of it at first she pursued as he said nothing she took it for granted at least as any woman in her position would but after that she changed her mind she believed you believed  wellhe was curious  why in her sublimity  and that belief had remained with her i make out till the accident of the other day opened your eyes  for that it did said maria open them  she cant helphe had taken it upbeing aware  no he mused i suppose she thinks of that even yet  then they were closed  there you are  however if you see her as the most charming woman in the world it comes to the same thing and if youd like me to tell her that you do still so see her miss gostrey in short offered herself for service to the end  it was an offer he could temporarily entertain but he decided she knows perfectly how i see her  not favourably enough she mentioned to me to wish ever to see her again  she told me you had taken a final leave of her  she says youve done with her  so i have  maria had a pause then she spoke as if for conscience  she wouldnt have done with you  she feels she has lost youyet that she might have been better for you  oh she has been quite good enough strether laughed  she thinks you and she might at any rate have been friends  we might certainly  thats justhe continued to laughwhy im going  it was as if maria could feel with this then at last that she had done her best for each  but she had still an idea  shall i tell her that  no  tell her nothing  very well then to which in the next breath miss gostrey added poor dear thing  her friend wondered then with raised eyebrows  me  oh no  marie de vionnet  he accepted the correction but he wondered still  are you so sorry for her as that  it made her think a momentmade her even speak with a smile  but she didnt really retract  im sorry for us all    iv  he was to delay no longer to reestablish communication with chad and we have just seen that he had spoken to miss gostrey of this intention on hearing from her of the young mans absence  it was not moreover only the assurance so given that prompted him it was the need of causing his conduct to square with another profession stillthe motive he had described to her as his sharpest for now getting away  if he was to get away because of some of the relations involved in staying the cold attitude toward them might look pedantic in the light of lingering on  he must do both things he must see chad but he must go  the more he thought of the former of these duties the more he felt himself make a subject of insistence of the latter  they were alike intensely present to him as he sat in front of a quiet little cafe into which he had dropped on quitting marias entresol  the rain that had spoiled his evening with her was over for it was still to him as if his evening had been spoiledthough it mightnt have been wholly the rain  it was late when he left the cafe yet not too late he couldnt in any case go straight to bed and he would walk round by the boulevard malesherbesrather far roundon his way home present enough always was the small circumstance that had originally pressed for him the spring of so big a differencethe accident of little bilhams appearance on the balcony of the mystic troisieme at the moment of his first visit and the effect of it on his sense of what was then before him  he recalled his watch his wait and the recognition that had proceeded from the young stranger that had played frankly into the air and had presently brought him upthings smoothing the way for his first straight step  he had since had occasion a few times to pass the house without going in but he had never passed it without again feeling how it had then spoken to him  he stopped short tonight on coming to sight of it  it was as if his last day were oddly copying his first  the windows of chads apartment were open to the balconya pair of them lighted and a figure that had come out and taken up little bilhams attitude a figure whose cigarettespark he could see leaned on the rail and looked down at him  it denoted however no reappearance of his younger friend it quickly defined itself in the tempered darkness as chads more solid shape so that chads was the attention that after he had stepped forward into the street and signalled he easily engaged chads was the voice that sounding into the night with promptness and seemingly with joy greeted him and called him up  that the young man had been visible there just in this position expressed somehow for strether that as maria gostrey had reported he had been absent and silent and our friend drew breath on each landingthe lift at that hour having ceased to workbefore the implications of the fact  he had been for a week intensely away away to a distance and alone but he was more back than ever and the attitude in which strether had surprised him was something more than a returnit was clearly a conscious surrender  he had arrived but an hour before from london from lucerne from homburg from no matter wherethough the visitors fancy on the staircase liked to fill it out and after a bath a talk with baptiste and a supper of light cold clever french things which one could see the remains of there in the circle of the lamp pretty and ultraparisian he had come into the air again for a smoke was occupied at the moment of strethers approach in what might have been called taking up his life afresh  his life his lifestrether paused anew on the last flight at this final rather breathless sense of what chads life was doing with chads mothers emissary  it was dragging him at strange hours up the staircases of the rich it was keeping him out of bed at the end of long hot days it was transforming beyond recognition the simple subtle conveniently uniform thing that had anciently passed with him for a life of his own why should it concern him that chad was to be fortified in the pleasant practice of smoking on balconies of supping on salads of feeling his special conditions agreeably reaffirm themselves of finding reassurance in comparisons and contrasts  there was no answer to such a question but that he was still practically committedhe had perhaps never yet so much known it it made him feel old and he would buy his railwayticketfeeling no doubt olderthe next day but he had meanwhile come up four flights counting the entresol at midnight and without a lift for chads life  the young man hearing him by this time and with baptiste sent to rest was already at the door so that strether had before him in full visibility the cause in which he was labouring and even with the troisieme fairly gained panting a little  chad offered him as always a welcome in which the cordial and the formalso far as the formal was the respectfulhandsomely met and after he had expressed a hope that he would let him put him up for the night strether was in full possession of the key as it might have been called to what had lately happened  if he had just thought of himself as old chad was at sight of him thinking of him as older  he wanted to put him up for the night just because he was ancient and weary  it could never be said the tenant of these quarters wasnt nice to him a tenant who if he might indeed now keep him was probably prepared to work it all still more thoroughly  our friend had in fact the impression that with the minimum of encouragement chad would propose to keep him indefinitely an impression in the lap of which one of his own possibilities seemed to sit  madame de vionnet had wished him to stayso why didnt that happily fit  he could enshrine himself for the rest of his days in his young hosts chambre dami and draw out these days at his young hosts expense  there could scarce be greater logical expression of the countenance he had been moved to give  there was literally a minuteit was strange enoughduring which he grasped the idea that as he was acting as he could only act he was inconsistent  the sign that the inward forces he had obeyed really hung together would be thatin default always of another careerhe should promote the good cause by mounting guard on it  these things during his first minutes came and went but they were after all practically disposed of as soon as he had mentioned his errand  he had come to say goodbyeyet that was only a part so that from the moment chad accepted his farewell the question of a more ideal affirmation gave way to something else he proceeded with the rest of his business youll be a brute you knowyoull be guilty of the last infamyif you ever forsake her  that uttered there at the solemn hour uttered in the place that was full of her influence was the rest of his business and when once he had heard himself say it he felt that his message had never before been spoken  it placed his present call immediately on solid ground and the effect of it was to enable him quite to play with what we have called the key  chad showed no shade of embarrassment but had none the less been troubled for him after their meeting in the country had had fears and doubts on the subject of his comfort  he was disturbed as it were only for him and had positively gone away to ease him off to let him downif it wasnt indeed rather to screw him upthe more gently seeing him now fairly jaded he had come with characteristic good humour all the way to meet him and what strether thereupon supremely made out was that he would abound for him to the end in conscientious assurances  this was what was between them while the visitor remained so far from having to go over old ground he found his entertainer keen to agree to everything  it couldnt be put too strongly for him that hed be a brute  oh ratherif i should do anything of that sort  i hope you believe i really feel it  i want it said strether to be my last word of all to you i cant say more you know and i dont see how i can do more in every way than ive done  chad took this almost artlessly as a direct allusion  youve seen her  oh yesto say goodbye  and if i had doubted the truth of what i tell you  shed have cleared up your doubt  chad understoodratheragain it even kept him briefly silent  but he made that up she must have been wonderful  she was strether candidly admittedall of which practically told as a reference to the conditions created by the accident of the previous week  they appeared for a little to be looking back at it and that came out still more in what chad next said  i dont know what youve really thought all along i never did knowfor anything with you seemed to be possible  but of courseof course  without confusion quite with nothing but indulgence he broke down he pulled up  after all you understand  i spoke to you originally only as i had to speak theres only one wayisnt thereabout such things  however he smiled with a final philosophy i see its all right  strether met his eyes with a sense of multiplying thoughts  what was it that made him at present late at night and after journeys so renewedly so substantially young  strether saw in a moment what it wasit was that he was younger again than madame de vionnet he himself said immediately none of the things that he was thinking he said something quite different  you have really been to a distance  ive been to england chad spoke cheerfully and promptly but gave no further account of it than to say  one must sometimes get off  strether wanted no more factshe only wanted to justify as it were his question  of course you do as youre free to do  but i hope this time that you didnt go for me  for very shame at bothering you really too much  my dear man chad laughed what wouldnt i do for you  strethers easy answer for this was that it was a disposition he had exactly come to profit by  even at the risk of being in your way ive waited on you know for a definite reason  chad took it in  oh yesfor us to make if possible a still better impression and he stood there happily exhaling his full general consciousness  im delighted to gather that you feel weve made it  there was a pleasant irony in the words which his guest preoccupied and keeping to the point didnt take up  if i had my sense of wanting the rest of the timethe time of their being still on this side he continued to explaini know now why i wanted it  he was as grave as distinct as a demonstrator before a blackboard and chad continued to face him like an intelligent pupil  you wanted to have been put through the whole thing  strether again for a moment said nothing he turned his eyes away and they lost themselves through the open window in the dusky outer air  i shall learn from the bank here where theyre now having their letters and my last word which i shall write in the morning and which theyre expecting as my ultimatum will so immediately reach them the light of his plural pronoun was sufficiently reflected in his companions face as he again met it and he completed his demonstration  he pursued indeed as if for himself  of course ive first to justify what i shall do  youre justifying it beautifully chad declared  its not a question of advising you not to go strether said but of absolutely preventing you if possible from so much as thinking of it let me accordingly appeal to you by all you hold sacred  chad showed a surprise  what makes you think me capable  youd not only be as i say a brute youd be his companion went on in the same way a criminal of the deepest dye  chad gave a sharper look as if to gauge a possible suspicion i dont know what should make you think im tired of her  strether didnt quite know either and such impressions for the imaginative mind were always too fine too floating to produce on the spot their warrant  there was none the less for him in the very manner of his hosts allusion to satiety as a thinkable motive a slight breath of the ominous  i feel how much more she can do for you  she hasnt done it all yet  stay with her at least till she has  and leave her then  chad had kept smiling but its effect in strether was a shade of dryness  dont leave her before  when youve got all that can be goti dont say he added a trifle grimly  that will be the proper time  but as for you from such a woman there will always be something to be got my remarks not a wrong to her chad let him go on showing every decent deference showing perhaps also a candid curiosity for this sharper accent  i remember you you know as you were  an awful ass wasnt i  the response was as prompt as if he had pressed a spring it had a ready abundance at which he even winced so that he took a moment to meet it  you certainly then wouldnt have seemed worth all youve let me in for  youve defined yourself better  your value has quintupled  well then wouldnt that be enough  chad had risked it jocosely but strether remained blank  enough  if one should wish to live on ones accumulations  after which however as his friend appeared cold to the joke the young man as easily dropped it  of course i really never forget night or day what i owe her  i owe her everything  i give you my word of honour he frankly rang out that im not a bit tired of her strether at this only gave him a stare  the way youth could express itself was again and again a wonder  he meant no harm though he might after all be capable of much yet he spoke of being tired of her almost as he might have spoken of being tired of roast mutton for dinner  she has never for a moment yet bored menever been wanting as the cleverest women sometimes are in tact she has never talked about her tactas even they too sometimes talk but she has always had it  she has never had it morehe handsomely made the pointthan just lately and he scrupulously went further she has never been anything i could call a burden  strether for a moment said nothing then he spoke gravely with his shade of dryness deepened  oh if you didnt do her justice  i should be a beast eh  strether devoted no time to saying what he would be that visibly would take them far  if there was nothing for it but to repeat however repetition was no mistake  you owe her everythingvery much more than she can ever owe you  youve in other words duties to her of the most positive sort and i dont see what other dutiesas the others are presented to youcan be held to go before them  chad looked at him with a smile  and you know of course about the others ehsince its you yourself who have done the presenting  much of ityesand to the best of my ability  but not allfrom the moment your sister took my place  she didnt chad returned  sally took a place certainly but it was never i saw from the first moment to be yours  no onewith uswill ever take yours  it wouldnt be possible  ah of course sighed strether i knew it  i believe youre right no one in the world i imagine was ever so portentously solemn  there i am he added with another sigh as if weary enough on occasion of this truth  i was made so  chad appeared for a little to consider the way he was made he might for this purpose have measured him up and down his conclusion favoured the fact  you have never needed any one to make you better  there has never been any one good enough they couldnt the young man declared  his friend hesitated  i beg your pardon  they have  chad showed not without amusement his doubt  who then  stretherthough a little dimlysmiled at him  womentoo  twochad stared and laughed  oh i dont believe for such work in any more than one  so youre proving too much  and what is beastly at all events he added is losing you  strether had set himself in motion for departure but at this he paused  are you afraid  afraid  of doing wrong  i mean away from my eye before chad could speak however he had taken himself up  i am certainly he laughed prodigious  yes you spoil us for all the stupid  this might have been on chads part in its extreme emphasis almost too freely extravagant but it was full plainly enough of the intention of comfort it carried with it a protest against doubt and a promise positively of performance  picking up a hat in the vestibule he came out with his friend came downstairs took his arm affectionately as to help and guide him treating him if not exactly as aged and infirm yet as a noble eccentric who appealed to tenderness and keeping on with him while they walked to the next corner and the next  you neednt tell me you neednt tell methis again as they proceeded he wished to make strether feel  what he neednt tell him was now at last in the geniality of separation anything at all it concerned him to know  he knew up to the hiltthat really came over chad he understood felt recorded his vow and they lingered on it as they had lingered in their walk to strethers hotel the night of their first meeting the latter took at this hour all he could get he had given all he had had to give he was as depleted as if he had spent his last sou  but there was just one thing for which before they broke off chad seemed disposed slightly to bargain  his companion neednt as he said tell him but he might himself mention that he had been getting some news of the art of advertisement  he came out quite suddenly with this announcement while strether wondered if his revived interest were what had taken him with strange inconsequence over to london  he appeared at all events to have been looking into the question and had encountered a revelation  advertising scientifically worked presented itself thus as the great new force  it really does the thing you know  they were face to face under the streetlamp as they had been the first night and strether no doubt looked blank  affects you mean the sale of the object advertised  yesbut affects it extraordinarily really beyond what one had supposed  i mean of course when its done as one makes out that in our roaring age it can be done  ive been finding out a little though it doubtless doesnt amount to much more than what you originally so awfully vividlyand all very nearly that first nightput before me its an art like another and infinite like all the arts he went on as if for the joke of italmost as if his friends face amused him in the hands naturally of a master the right man must take hold with the right man to work it cest un monde  strether had watched him quite as if there on the pavement without a pretext he had begun to dance a fancy step  is what youre thinking of that you yourself in the case you have in mind would be the right man  chad had thrown back his light coat and thrust each of his thumbs into an armhole of his waistcoat in which position his fingers played up and down  why what is he but what you yourself as i say took me for when you first came out  strether felt a little faint but he coerced his attention  oh yes and theres no doubt that with your natural parts youd have much in common with him  advertising is clearly at this time of day the secret of trade  its quite possible it will be open to yougiving the whole of your mind to itto make the whole place hum with you  your mothers appeal is to the whole of your mind and thats exactly the strength of her case  chads fingers continued to twiddle but he had something of a drop ah weve been through my mothers case  so i thought  why then do you speak of the matter  only because it was part of our original discussion  to wind up where we began my interests purely platonic  there at any rate the fact isthe fact of the possible  i mean the money in it  oh damn the money in it said strether  and then as the young mans fixed smile seemed to shine out more strange  shall you give your friend up for the money in it  chad preserved his handsome grimace as well as the rest of his attitude  youre not altogetherin your so great solemnitykind havent i been drinking you inshowing you all i feel youre worth to me  what have i done what am i doing but cleave to her to the death the only thing is he goodhumouredly explained that one cant but have it before one in the cleavingthe point where the death comes in  dont be afraid for that its pleasant to a fellows feelings he developed to sizeup the bribe he applies his foot to  oh then if all you wants a kickable surface the bribes enormous  good  then there it goes  chad administered his kick with fantastic force and sent an imaginary object flying  it was accordingly as if they were once more rid of the question and could come back to what really concerned him  of course i shall see you tomorrow  but strether scarce heeded the plan proposed for this he had still the impressionnot the slighter for the simulated kickof an irrelevant hornpipe or jig  youre restless  ah returned chad as they parted youre exciting    v   he had however within two days another separation to face he had sent maria gostrey a word early by hand to ask if he might come to breakfast in consequence of which at noon she awaited him in the cool shade of her little dutchlooking diningroom this retreat was at the back of the house with a view of a scrap of old garden that had been saved from modern ravage and though he had on more than one other occasion had his legs under its small and peculiarly polished table of hospitality the place had never before struck him as so sacred to pleasant knowledge to intimate charm to antique order to a neatness that was almost august to sit there was as he had told his hostess before to see life reflected for the time in ideally kept pewter which was somehow becoming improving to life so that ones eyes were held and comforted  strethers were comforted at all events nowand the more that it was the last timewith the charming effect on the board bare of a cloth and proud of its perfect surface of the small old crockery and old silver matched by the more substantial pieces happily disposed about the room  the specimens of vivid delf in particular had the dignity of family portraits and it was in the midst of them that our friend resignedly expressed himself he spoke even with a certain philosophic humour  theres nothing more to wait for i seem to have done a good days work  ive let them have it all round  ive seen chad who has been to london and come back  he tells me im exciting and i seem indeed pretty well to have upset every one  ive at any rate excited him  hes distinctly restless  youve excited me miss gostrey smiled  im distinctly restless  oh you were that when i found you  it seems to me ive rather got you out of it  whats this he asked as he looked about him but a haunt of ancient peace  i wish with all my heart she presently replied i could make you treat it as a haven of rest on which they fronted each other across the table as if things unuttered were in the air  strether seemed in his way when he next spoke to take some of them up  it wouldnt give methat would be the troublewhat it will no doubt still give you  im not he explained leaning back in his chair but with his eyes on a small ripe round melonin real harmony with what surrounds me  you are  i take it too hard you dont  it makesthats what it comes to in the enda fool of me then at a tangent what has he been doing in london he demanded  ah one may go to london maria laughed  you know i did  yeshe took the reminder  and you brought me back he brooded there opposite to her but without gloom  whom has chad brought hes full of ideas  and i wrote to sarah he added the first thing this morning  so im square  im ready for them  she neglected certain parts of this speech in the interest of others marie said to me the other day that she felt him to have the makings of an immense man of business  there it is  hes the son of his father  but such a father  ah just the right one from that point of view  but it isnt his father in him strether added that troubles me  what is it then  he came back to his breakfast he partook presently of the charming melon which she liberally cut for him and it was only after this that he met her question  then moreover it was but to remark that hed answer her presently  she waited she watched she served him and amused him and it was perhaps with this last idea that she soon reminded him of his having never even yet named to her the article produced at woollett  do you remember our talking of it in londonthat night at the play before he could say yes however she had put it to him for other matters  did he remember did he rememberthis and that of their first days  he remembered everything bringing up with humour even things of which she professed no recollection things she vehemently denied and falling back above all on the great interest of their early time the curiosity felt by both of them as to where he would come out they had so assumed it was to be in some wonderful placethey had thought of it as so very much out well that was doubtless what it had beensince he had come out just there  he was out in truth as far as it was possible to be and must now rather bethink himself of getting in again he found on the spot the image of his recent history he was like one of the figures of the old clock at berne  they came out on one side at their hour jigged along their little course in the public eye and went in on the other side  he too had jigged his little coursehim too a modest retreat awaited  he offered now should she really like to know to name the great product of woollett  it would be a great commentary on everything  at this she stopped him off she not only had no wish to know but she wouldnt know for the world  she had done with the products of woollettfor all the good she had got from them  she desired no further news of them and she mentioned that madame de vionnet herself had to her knowledge lived exempt from the information he was ready to supply  she had never consented to receive it though she would have taken it under stress from mrs pocock but it was a matter about which mrs pocock appeared to have had little to saynever sounding the wordand it didnt signify now  there was nothing clearly for maria gostrey that signified nowsave one sharp point that is to which she came in time i dont know whether its before you as a possibility that left to himself mr chad may after all go back  i judge that it is more or less so before you from what you just now said of him  her guest had his eyes on her kindly but attentively as if foreseeing what was to follow this  i dont think it will be for the money and then as she seemed uncertain  i mean i dont believe it will be for that hell give her up  then he will give her up  strether waited a moment rather slow and deliberate now drawing out a little this last soft stage pleading with her in various suggestive and unspoken ways for patience and understanding what were you just about to ask me  is there anything he can do that would make you patch it up  with mrs newsome  her assent as if she had had a delicacy about sounding the name was only in her face but she added with it  or is there anything he can do that would make her try it  to patch it up with me  his answer came at last in a conclusive headshake  theres nothing any one can do  its over  over for both of us  maria wondered seemed a little to doubt  are you so sure for her  oh yessure now  too much has happened  im different for her  she took it in then drawing a deeper breath  i see  so that as shes different for you  ah but he interrupted shes not  and as miss gostrey wondered again  shes the same  shes more than ever the same but i do what i didnt beforei see her  he spoke gravely and as if responsiblysince he had to pronounce and the effect of it was slightly solemn so that she simply exclaimed oh  satisfied and grateful however she showed in her own next words an acceptance of his statement  what then do you go home to  he had pushed his plate a little away occupied with another side of the matter taking refuge verily in that side and feeling so moved that he soon found himself on his feet  he was affected in advance by what he believed might come from her and he would have liked to forestall it and deal with it tenderly  yet in the presence of it he wished still more to bethough as smoothly as possibledeterrent and conclusive  he put her question by for the moment he told her more about chad  it would have been impossible to meet me more than he did last night on the question of the infamy of not sticking to her  is that what you called it for himinfamy  oh rather  i described to him in detail the base creature hed be and he quite agrees with me about it  so that its really as if you had nailed him  quite really as if  i told him i should curse him  oh she smiled you have done it and then having thought again you cant after that propose  yet she scanned his face  propose again to mrs newsome  she hesitated afresh but she brought it out  ive never believed you know that you did propose  i always believed it was really sheand so far as that goes i can understand it  what i mean is she explained that with such a spiritthe spirit of cursesyour breach is past mending  she has only to know what youve done to him never again to raise a finger  ive done said strether what i couldone cant do more he protests his devotion and his horror  but im not sure ive saved him he protests too much  he asks how one can dream of his being tired but he has all life before him  maria saw what he meant  hes formed to please  and its our friend who has formed him strether felt in it the strange irony  so its scarcely his fault  its at any rate his danger  i mean said strether its hers but she knows it  yes she knows it  and is your idea miss gostrey asked that there was some other woman in london  yes  no  that is i have no ideas  im afraid of them ive done with them and he put out his hand to her  goodbye  it brought her back to her unanswered question  to what do you go home  i dont know  there will always be something  to a great difference she said as she kept his hand  a great differenceno doubt  yet i shall see what i can make of it  shall you make anything so good  but as if remembering what mrs newsome had done it was as far as she went  he had sufficiently understood  so good as this place at this moment so good as what you make of everything you touch he took a moment to say for really and truly what stood about him there in her offerwhich was as the offer of exquisite service of lightened care for the rest of his daysmight well have tempted it built him softly round it roofed him warmly over it rested all so firm on selection and what ruled selection was beauty and knowledge  it was awkward it was almost stupid not to seem to prize such things yet none the less so far as they made his opportunity they made it only for a moment  shed moreover understandshe always understood  that indeed might be but meanwhile she was going on theres nothing you know i wouldnt do for you  oh yesi know  theres nothing she repeated in all the world  i know  i know  but all the same i must go he had got it at last to be right  to be right  she had echoed it in vague deprecation but he felt it already clear for her  that you see is my only logic not out of the whole affair to have got anything for myself  she thought  but with your wonderful impressions youll have got a great deal  a great dealhe agreed  but nothing like you  its you who would make me wrong  honest and fine she couldnt greatly pretend she didnt see it still she could pretend just a little  but why should you be so dreadfully right  thats the way thatif i must goyou yourself would be the first to want me  and i cant do anything else  so then she had to take it though still with her defeated protest it isnt so much your being rightits your horrible sharp eye for what makes you so  oh but youre just as bad yourself  you cant resist me when i point that out  she sighed it at last all comically all tragically away i cant indeed resist you  then there we are said strether
