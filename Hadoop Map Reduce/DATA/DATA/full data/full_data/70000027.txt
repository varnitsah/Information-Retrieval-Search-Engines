multitude of the sorrows which i had in my heart thy comforts    have refreshed my soulps xciv 17  each heart knows its own bitterness each soul has its own sorrow each mans life has its dark days of storm and tempest when all his joys seem blown away by some sudden blast of illfortune and the desire of his eyes is taken from him and all his hopes and plans all which he intended to do or to enjoy are hid with blinding mist so that he cannot see his way before him and knows not whither to go or whither to flee for help when faith in god seems broken up for the moment when he feels no strength no purpose and knows not what to determine what to do what to believe what to care for when the very earth seems reeling under his feet and the fountains of the abyss are broken up  when that day comes let him think of gods covenant and take heart  is the suns warmth perished out of the sky because the storm is cold with hail and bitter winds  is gods love changed because we cannot feel it in our trouble  is the suns light perished out of the sky because the world is black with cloud and mist  has god forgotten to give light to suffering souls because we cannot see our way for a few short days of perplexity  no  gods message to every sad and desolate heart on earth is that god is light and in him is no darkness at all that god is love and in him there is no cruelty at all that god is one and in him there is no change at all  and therefore we can pray boldly to him and ask him to deliver us in the time of our tribulation and misery in the hour of death whether of our own death or the death of those we love in the day of judgment whereof it is writtenit is god who justifieth us who is he that condemneth  it is christ who died yea rather who is risen again who even now maketh intercession for us  to that boundless love of god which he showed forth in the life of christ jesus to that perfect and utter will to deliver us which god showed forth in the death of christ jesus when the father spared not his own son but gave him freely for us to that boundless love we may trust ourselves our fortunes our families our bodies our souls and the bodies and souls of those we love  national sermons  to all sooner or later christ comes to baptise them with fire  but do not think that the baptism of fire comes once for all to a man in some one terrible affliction some one awful conviction of his own sinfulness and nothingness  no with manyand those perhaps the best peopleit goes on month after month year after year  by secret trials chastenings which none but they and god can understand the lord is cleansing them from their secret faults and making them to understand wisdom secretly burning out of them the chaff of selfwill and self conceit and vanity and leaving only the pure gold of righteousness  how many sweet and holy souls who look cheerful enough before the eyes of man yet have their secret sorrows  they carry their cross unseen all day long and lie down to sleep on it at night and they will carry it perhaps for years and years and to their graves and to the throne of christ before they lay it down and none but they and christ will ever know what it was what was the secret chastisement which god sent to make that soul better which seemed to us already too good for earth  so does the lord watch his people and tries them with fire as the refiner of silver sits by his furnaces watching the melted metal till he knows that it is purged from all its dross by seeing the image of his own face reflected on it  town and country sermons  by sufferings was christ made perfect and what was the best path for jesus christ is surely good enough for us even though it be a rough and thorny one  let us lie still beneath gods hand for though his hand be heavy upon us it is strong and safe beneath us too and none can pluck us out of his hand for in him we live and move and have our being  he waits for us year after year with patience which cannot tire therefore let us wait awhile for him  with him is plenteous redemption and therefore redemption enough for us and for those likewise whom we love and though we go down into hell with david with david we shall find god there ps cxxxix 8 ps xvi 10 and find that he does not leave our souls in hell nor suffer his holy ones to see corruption  yes have faith in god  nothing in thee which he has made shall see corruption for it is a thought of gods and no thought of his can perish  nothing shall be purged out of thee but thy disease nothing shall be burnt out of thee but thy dross and that in thee of which god said in the beginning let us make man in our own image shall be saved and live to all eternity  yes have faith in god and cry to him out of the deep though thou slay me yet will i love thee for thou lovedst me in jesus christ before the foundation of the world  sermonsgood news of god  oh sad hearts and suffering  anxious and weary ones  look to the cross of christ  there hung your king  the king of sorrowing souls and more the king of sorrows  ay pain and grief tyranny and desertion death and hellhe has faced them one and all and tried their strength and taught them his and conquered them right royally  and since he hung upon that torturing cross sorrow is divine godlike as joy itself  all that mans fallen nature dreads and despises god honoured on the cross and took unto himself and blest and consecrated for ever  and now blessed are the poor if they are poor in heart as well as purse for jesus was poor and theirs is the kingdom of heaven  blessed are the hungry if they hunger for righteousness as well as food for jesus hungered and they shall be filled  blessed are those who mourn if they mourn not only for their sorrows but for their sins for jesus mourned for our sins and on the cross he was made sin for us who knew no sin and they shall be comforted  blessed are those who are ashamed of themselves and hate themselves and humble themselves before god for on the cross jesus humbled himself and they shall be exalted  blessed are the forsaken and despised did not all men forsake jesus in his hour of need  and why not thee too thou poor deserted one  shall the disciple be above his master  no  every one that is perfect must be as his master  national sermons  never let us get into the common trick of calling unbelief resignation of asking and then because we have not faith to believe putting in a thy will be done at the end  let us make gods will our will and so say thy will be done  there is a false as well as a true and holy resignation  when the sorrow is come or coming or necessary apparently for others good let us say with our master in the agony not what we will but what thou wilt  but up to that point let us pray boldly  letters and memories of charles kingsley  christianity heightens as well as deepens the human as well as the divine affections  i am happy for the less hope the more faith  god knows what is best for us  i am sure we do not  continual resignation i begin to find is the secret of continual strength  daily dying as boehmen interprets it is the path of daily living  letters and memories  in all the trials of life there is still some way of escape to be found if a man goes to the right place to look for it and if not of escape still of compensation  i speak of that which i know  of my own comfort i will not speakof the path by which i attained it i will  it was simply by not struggling doing my work vigorously where god had put me and believing firmly that his promises had a real not a mere metaphorical meaning and that psalms x xxvii xxxiv xxxvii cvii cxii cxxiii cxxvi cxlvi are as practically true for us as they were for the jews of old and that it is the faithlessness of this day which prevents men from accepting gods promises in their literal sense with simple childlike faith  letters and memories  do not fear the clouds and storm and rain look at the bow in the cloud in the very rain itself  that is a sign that the sun though you cannot see it is shining stillthat up above beyond the cloud is still sunlight and warmth and cloudless blue sky  believe in gods covenant believe that the sun will conquer the clouds warmth will conquer cold calm will conquer storm fair will conquer foul light will conquer darkness joy will conquer sorrow life conquer death love conquer destruction and the devouring floods because god is light god is love god is life god is peace and joy eternal god is without change and labours to give life and joy and peace to man and beast and all created things  this was the meaning of the rainbow  it is a witness that god who made the world is the friend and preserver of man that his promises are like the everlasting sunshine which is above the clouds without spot or fading without variableness or shadow of turning  national sermons  if i did not believe in a special providence in a perpetual education of men by evil as well as good by small things as well as greatif i did not believe thati could believe nothing  letters and memories  let us be content we do not know what is good for us and god does  it is true and you will find it true though god knows it is a difficult lesson enough to learn that there should be no greater comfort to christian people than to be made like christ by suffering patiently not only the hard work of everyday life but sorrows troubles and sicknesses and all our heavenly fathers corrections whensoever by any manner of adversity it shall please his gracious goodness to visit them for christ himself went not up to joy but first he suffered pain  he entered not into his glory before he was crucified  therefore those words which we read in the visitation of the sick about this matter are not mere kind words meant to give comfort for the moment  they are truth and fact and sound philosophy  they are as true for the young lad in health and spirits as for the old folks crawling towards their graves it is true that sickness and all sorts of troubles are sent to correct and amend in us whatsoever doth offend the eye of our heavenly father  it is true and you will find it true that whom the lord loveth he chasteneth  all saints day sermons  that ye through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope says st paul and again let patience have her perfect work  but where are we to get patience  god knows it is hard in such a world as this for poor creatures to be always patient  but faith can breed patience though patience cannot breed itself and faith in whom  faith in our father in heaven even in almighty god himself  he calls himself the god of patience and consolation  pray for his holy spirit and he will make you patient pray for his holy spirit and he will console and comfort you  he has promised that spirit of histhe comforterthe spirit of love trust and patienceto as many as ask him  ask him at his holy table to make you patient ask him to change your wills into the likeness of his will  then will your eyes be opened then will you see in the scriptures a sure promise of hope and glory and redemption for yourself and all the world then you will see in the blessed sacrament of the lords body and blood a sure sign and warrant handed down from hand to hand from age to age from year to year from father to son that his promises shall be fulfilledthat patience shall have her perfect workthat hope shall become a realitythat not one of the lords words shall fail or pass away till all be fulfilled  national sermons  god means some good to you by prostrating youperhaps he means by giving you blessings almost without your asking to show you how little avails morbid sensitiveness or selftormenting struggles  synthetical minds are subject to this selftorture  such a period in your life is the time to become again a little child  i do not mean a reregeneration but a permitting of the mind to assume that tone of calm wonder and infantile trust which will allow all the innate principles withinall godbestowed graces which have been bruised and bowed by the tempest to blossom gently upwards again in the clear shining after raina breathing time in lifenot too much retrospection or selfexaminationkeep that for the healthy and vigorous hours of the mindbut a silent basking in the light of gods presencea time for faith more than for labour for general and unexpressed more than for particular or earnest prayer  letters and memories  sorrow though dreary is not barren  nothing need be barren to those who view all things in their real light as links in the great chain of progression both for themselves and for the universe  to us all time should seem so full of life every moment the grave and the father of unnumbered events and designs in heaven and earth revealing the mind of our god himselfall things moving smoothly and surely in spite of apparent checks and disappointments towards the appointed end  letters and memories  in all the chances and changes of this mortal life it is our one comfort to believe firmly and actively in the changeless kingdom and in the changeless king  this alone will give us calm patience faith and hope though the heavens and the earth be shaken around us  for so only shall we see that the kingdom of which we are citizens is a kingdom of light and not of darkness of truth and not of falsehood of freedom and not of slavery of bounty and mercy and not of wrath and fear that we live and move and have our being not in a deus quidam deceptor who grudges his children wisdom but in a father of light from whom comes every good and perfect gift who willeth that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth  in his kingdom we are and in the king whom he has set over it we can have most perfect trust  for us that king stooped from heaven to earth for us he was born for us he toiled for us he suffered for us he died for us he arose again for us he sits for ever at gods right hand  and can we not trust him  let him do what he will  let him lead us whither he will  wheresoever he leads must be the way of truth and life  whatsoever he does must be in harmony with that infinite love which he displayed for us upon the cross whatsoever he does must be in harmony with that eternal purpose by which he reveals to men god their father  therefore though the heaven and the earth be shaken around us we will trust in him for we know that he is the same yesterday today and for ever  national sermons  if we believe that god is educating men the when the where and the how are not only unimportant but considering who is the teacher unfathomable to us and it is enough to be able to believe that the lord of all things is influencing us through all things  essays  provided we attain at last to the truly heroic and divine life which is the life of virtue it will matter little to us by what strange and weary ways or through what painful and humiliating processes we have arrived thither  if god has loved us if god will receive us then let us submit loyally and humbly to his lawwhom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth  all saints day sermons  i believe that the wisest plan of bearing sorrow is sometimes not to try to bear itas long as one is not crippled for ones everyday dutiesbut to give way to sorrow utterly and freely  perhaps sorrow is sent that we may give way to it and in drinking the cup to the dregs find some medicine in it itself which we should not find if we began doctoring ourselves or letting others doctor us  if we say simply i am wretched i ought to be wretched then we shall perhaps hear a voice who made thee wretched but god  then what can he mean but thy good and if the heart answers impatiently my good  i dont want it i want my love perhaps the voice may answer then thou shalt have both in time  letters and memories  after all the problem of life is not a difficult one for it solves itselfso very soon at bestby death  do what is right the best way you can and wait to the end to know     if in spite of wars and fevers and accidents and the strokes of chance this world be green and fair what must the coming world be like let us comfort ourselves as st paul did in infinitely worse times that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed  it is not fair to quote one text about the creation groaning and travailing without the other that it will not groan and travail long  would the mother who has groaned and travailed and brought forth childrenwould she give up those children for the sake of not having had that pain  then believe that the day will come when the world and every human being in it who has really groaned and travailed would not give up its past pangs for the sake of its then present perfection but will look back on this life as the mother does on past pain with glory and joy  letters and memories  i write to you because every expression of human sympathy brings some little comfort if it be only to remind such as you that you are not alone in the world  i know nothing can make up for such a loss as yours 26  but you will still have love on earth all round you and his love is not dead  it lives still in the next world for you and perhaps with you  for why should not those who are gone if they are gone to their lord be actually nearer us not further from us in the heavenly world praying for us and it may be influencing and guiding us in a hundred ways of which we in our prisonhouse of mortality cannot dream  yes do not be afraid to believe that he whom you have loved is still near you and you near him and both of you near god who died on the cross for you  that is all i can say  but what comfort there is in it if one can give up ones heart to believe it  letters and memories      all that i can say about the text matt xxii 30 of marriage in the world to come is that it has nought to do with me and my wife  i know that if immortality is to include in my case identity of person i shall feel for her for ever what i feel now  that feeling may be developed in ways which i do not expect it may have provided for it forms of expression very different from any which are among the holiest sacraments of life  of that i take no care  the union i believe to be eternal as my own soul and i leave all in the hands of a good god  is not marriage the mere approximation to a unity that shall be perfect in heaven  and shall we not be reunited in heaven by that still deeper tie  surely if on earth christ the lord has lovedsome more than otherswhy should not we do the same in heaven and yet love all  do i thus seem to undervalue earthly bliss  no i enhance it when i make it the sacrament of a higher union  will not this thought give more exquisite delight will it not tear off the thorn from every rose and sweeten every nectar cup to perfect security of blessedness in this life to feel that there is more in store for usthat all expressions of love here are but dim shadows of a union which will be perfect if we but work here so as to work out our own salvation  letters and memories  that is an awful feeling of having the roots which connect one with the last generation seemingly torn up and having to say now i am the root i stand selfsupported with no other older stature to rest on 30  but this one must believe that god is the god of abraham and that all live to him and that we are no more isolated and selfsupported than when we were children on our mothers bosom  letters and memories  believe that those who are gone are nearer us than ever and that if as i surely believe they do sorrow over the mishaps and misdeeds of those whom they leave behind they do not sorrow in vain  their sympathy is a further education for them and a pledge too of help and i believe of final deliverance for those on whom they look down in love  letters and memories  blessed are the dead who die in the lord for they rest from their labours and their works do follow them  they rest from their labours  all their struggles disappointments failures backslidings which made them unhappy here because they could not perfectly do the will of god are past and over for ever  but their works follow them  the good which they did on earththat is not past and over  it cannot die  it lives and grows for ever following on in their path long after they are dead and bearing fruit unto everlasting life not only in them but in men whom they never saw and in generations yet unborn  good news of godsermons  a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me because i go to the father said our lord when speaking of his own death to his sorrowing disciples  and if it be so with christ then is it so with those who are christs with those whom we love  they are the partakers of his death therefore they are the partakers of his resurrection  let us believe that blessed news in all its fulness and be at peace  a little while and we see them and again a little while and we do not see them  but why  because they are gone to the fatherto the source and fount of all life and power all light and love that they may gain life from his life power from his power light from his light love from his loveand surely not for nought  surely not for nought for if they were like christ on earth and did not use their powers for themselves alone if they are to be like christ when they shall see him as he is the more surely will they not use their powers for themselves but as christ uses his for those they love  surely like christ they may come and go even now unseen  like christ they may breathe upon our restless hearts and say peace be unto you  and not in vainfor what they did for us when they were yet on earth they can do more fully now that they are in heaven  they may seem to have left us and we may weep and lament  but the day will come when the veil shall be taken from our eyes and we shall see them as they arewith christ and in christ for everand remember no more our anguish for joy that another human being has entered into that one true real and eternal world wherein is neither disease disorder change decay nor death for it is none other than the bosom of the father  all saintsday sermons  and what if earthly love seems so delicious that all change in it would seem a change for the worse shall we repine  what does reason and faith which is reason exercised on the invisible require of us but to conclude that if there is change there will be something better there  letters and memories  what is the true everlasting lifethe life of god and christbut a life of love a life of perfect active selfsacrificing goodness which is the one only true life for all rational beings whether on earth or in heavenin heaven as well as on earth  form your own notions as you will about angels and saints in heaven for every one must have some notions about them and try to picture to yourself what the souls of those whom you have loved and lost are  doing in the other world but bear this in mind that if the saints in heaven live the everlasting life they must be living a life of usefulness of love and of good works  there are those who believe what we are too apt to forget and that is that the everlasting life cannot be a selfish and idle life spent only in being happy oneself  they believe that the saints in heaven are not idlethat they are eternally helping mankind doing all sorts of good offices for those souls who need them  i cannot see why they should not be right  for if the saints delight was to do good on earth much more will it be to do good in heaven  if they helped poor sufferers if they comforted the afflicted here on earth much more will they be willing to help and comfort them now that they are in the full power the full freedom the full love and zeal of the everlasting life  if their hearts were warmed and softened by the fire of gods love here how much more there  if they lived gods life of love here how much more there before the throne of god and the face of christ  and if any one shall say that the souls of good men in heaven cannot help us who are here on earth i answerwhen did they ascend into heaven to find out that  if they had ever been there let us be sure they would have had better news to bring home than this that those whom we have honoured and loved on earth have lost the power which they used once to have of comforting us who are struggling below  no we will believewhat every one who loses a beloved friend comes sooner or later to believethat those whom we have honoured and loved though taken from our eyes are near to our spirits that they still fight for us under the banner of their master christ and still work for us by virtue of his life of love which they live in him and by him for ever  pray to them indeed we need not as if they would help us out of any selfwill of their own  they do gods will and not their own and go on gods errands and not their own  if we pray to god our father himself that is enough for us  and what shall we pray  father thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven  good news of god sermons  is not that one thought that our beloved ones sleep in christ jesus enough  they sleep in jesus and therefore in infinite tenderness sympathy care and love  they sleep in jesus and he is the life and therefore they sleep in life  they sleep in jesus and he is the light and therefore they sleep in light  they sleep in jesus and he is love and therefore they sleep in love  and what better  this is betterthat they who sleep in jesus must surely awaken  for as it is written his is a quickening awakening lifegiving spirit and so to sleep in him is to sleep in the very fount and core of life and power  if from jesus all our powers and talents come here on earth surely he will give us more and nobler when we sleep in him and wake in him to a risen and eternal life  and more it is written that them that sleep in jesus will he bring with him  at the last day we shall see face to face those we lovedand before thatoh doubt it not  oftentimes when christ draws near our spirits he comes not alone but loving souls souls whom we knew in the flesh on earth bear up his train and hover near our hearts and join their whispers to the voice and inspiration of him who loved us and who will guide us with counsel here and after that receive us into glory where we shall meet those beloved onesnot as our forefathers dreamed as meagre shadows flitting through dreary and formless chaosbut as we knew them oncethe body of the flesh alone put off but the real body the spiritual body to which flesh and blood was but a husk and shell living and loving more fully more utterly than even before because it is in christ who is the fount of life and freed in him for ever from hell and death  and if you wish for a sign that this is so come to holy communion and take the bread and wine as a sign that your bodies and theirs your souls and theirs are fed from the same fount of everlasting lifethe dead and risen and ever living body of christ jesus which he has given to be the life of the world  mss sermons  we know that afflictions do cometerrible bereavements sorrows sad and strange  there they are god help us all  but from whom do they come who is lord of life and death  who is lord of joy and sorrow  is not that the question of all questions  and is not the answer the most essential of all answers  it is the holy spirit of god the spirit who proceedeth from the father and the son the spirit of the father who so loved the world that he spared not his only begotten son the spirit of the son who so loved the world that he stooped to die for it upon the cross the spirit who is the comforter and says i have seen thy ways and will heal thee i will lead thee also and restore comforts to thee and to thy mourners  i speak peace to him that is near and to him that is afar off saith the lord and i will heal him  is not that the most blessed news that he who takes away is the very same as he who gives that he who afflicts is the very same as he who comforts  all saintsday sermons  oh blessed news that god himself is the comforter  blessed news that he who strikes will also heal that he who gives the cup of sorrow will also give the strength to drink it  blessed news that chastisement is not punishment but the education of a father  blessed news that our whole duty is the duty of a childof the son who said in his agony father not my will but thine be done  blessed news that our comforter is the spirit who comforted christ the son himself who proceeds both from the father and the son and who will tell us that in christ we are really and literally the children of god who may cry to him in our extreme need father with full understanding of all that that royal word contains  all saintsday sermons     ii  out

patience the race which is set before you along the road of life and the pathway of gods commandments wherein there is no death  good news of god sermons  what are we to do when our sins bring us as they certainly will some day bring us into trouble but to open our eyes and see that the only thing for men and women whom god has made is to obey him  how can we prosper by doing anything else  it is ill fighting against god  but some one may say i know i have sinned and i do wish and long to obey god but i am so weak and my sins have so entangled me that i cannot obey god  i long to do so  i feel and know when i look back that all my sin and shame and unhappiness come from being proud and selfwilled and determined to have my own way  but i cannot mend  do not despair poor soul  i had a thousand times sooner hear you say that you cannot mend than that you can  for those who really feel they cannot mendthose who are really weary and worn out with the burden of their sinsthose who are tired out with their own wilfulness and feel ready to lie down and die like a spent horse and say god take me away no matter to what place i am not fit to live here on earth a shame and a torment to myself day and nightthose who are in that state of mind are very nearvery nearfinding out glorious news  god knows as well as you what you have to struggle against ay a thousand times better  he knowswhat does he not know  therefore pray to him  cry to him to make your will like his own will that you may love what he loves hate what he hates and do what he wishes you to do and you will surely find it come true that those who try to mend and yet know that they cannot mend themselves god will mend them  national sermons  sin greek text is literally as it signifies the missing of a mark and that each miss brings a penalty or rather is itself the penalty is to me the best of news and gives me hope for myself and for every human being past present and future for it makes me look on them all as children under a paternal education who are being taught to become aware of and use their own powers in gods house the universe and for gods work in it and in proportion as they learn to do that they attain salvation greek text literally health and wholeness of spirit which is like the health of the body its own reward  letters and memories  if in sorrow the thought strikes you that you are punished for your sins mourn for them but not for the happiness they have prevented  rather thank god that he has stopped you in time and remember his promises of restoring us if we profit by his chastisement  letters and memories  ah how many a poor foolish creature in misery and shame with guilty conscience and sad heart tries to forget his sin to forget his sorrow but he cannot  he is sick and tired of sin  he is miserable and he hardly knows why  there is a longing and craving and hunger at his heart after something better  then he begins to remember his heavenly fathers house  old words which he learnt in childhood good old words out of his catechism and bible start up strangely in his mind  he had forgotten them laughed at them perhaps in his wild days  but now they come up he does not know where from like beautiful ghosts gliding in and he is ashamed of them  they reproach him the dear old lessons and at last he says would god that i were a little child again once more an innocent little child at my mothers knee  perhaps i have been a fool and the old sunday books were right after all  at least i am miserable  i thought i was my own master but perhaps he about whom i used to read in the old sunday books is my master after all  at least i am not my own master i am a slave  perhaps i have been fighting against him against the lord god all this time and now he has shown me that he is the stronger of the two  and when the lord has drawn a man thus far does he stop  not so  he does not leave his work half done  if the work is half done it is that we stop not that he stops  whoever comes to him however confusedly or clumsily or even lazily they may come he will in no wise cast out he may afflict them still more to cure that confusion and laziness but he is a physician who never sends a patient away or keeps him waiting for a single hour  national sermons  the blessed st augustine found he could never conquer his own sins by arguing with himself or by any other means till he got to know god and to see that god was the lord  and when his spirit was utterly broken when he saw himself to have been a fool and blind all alongthen the old words which he learned at his mothers knee came up to his mind and he knew that god had been watching guiding him letting him go wrong only to show him the folly of going wrong caring for him bearing with him pleading with his conscience alluring him back to the only true happiness as a loving father will a rebellious and selfwilled child and he became a changed man  to that blessed state may god of his great mercy bring us in his own good time  and if he does bring us to it it is little matter whether he brings us to it through joy or through sorrow through honour or through shame through the garden of eden or through the valley of the shadow of death  for what matter how bitter the medicine is if it does but save our lives  national sermons      your sense of sin is not fanaticism it is i suppose simple consciousness of fact  as for helping you to christ i do not believe i can one inch  i can see no hope but in prayer in going to him yourself and saying lord if thou art there if thou art at all if this be not all a lie fulfil thy reputed promises and give me peace and the sense of forgiveness and the feeling that bad as i may be thou lovest me still seeing all understanding all and therefore making allowance for all  i have had to do that in past days to challenge him through outer darkness and the silence of night till i almost expected that he would vindicate his own honour by appearing visibly as he did to st paul and st john but he answered in the still small voice only yet that was enough  letters and memories      dear friend the secret of life for you and for me is to lay our purposes and our characters continually before him who made them and cry do thou purge me and so alone shall i be clean  thou requirest truth in the inward parts  thou wilt make me to understand wisdom secretly  what more rational belief  for surely if there be any god and he made us at first he who makes can also mend his own work if it gets out of gear  what more miraculous in the doctrines of regeneration and renewal than in the mere fact of creation  letters and memories  as for the sins of youth what says the 130th psalm  if thou lord were extreme to mark what is done amiss who could abide it  but there is mercy with him therefore shall he be feared  and how to fear god i know not better than by working on at the special work which he has given us trusting to him to make it of use to his creatures if he needs us therefore fret not nor be of doubtful mind but just do the duty which lies nearest  letters and memories  yes this is our comfort this is our hope christ the great healer the great physician can deliver us and will deliver us from the remains of our old sins the consequences of our own follies  not indeed at once or by miracles but by slow education  better indeed for us perhaps that he should not cure us at once lest we should fancy that sin was a light thing which we could throw off whenever we chose and not that it is an inward disease corroding and corrupting the wages whereof are death  and so it is that because christ loves us he hates our sins and cannot abide or endure them but will punish them and is merciful and loving in punishing as long as a tincture or remnant of sin is left in us  therefore let us put ourselves into the hands of christ the great physician and ask him to heal our wounded souls and purge our corrupted souls and leave to him the choice of how he will do it  let us be content to be punished and chastised  let him deal with us if he sees fit as he dealt with david of old when he forgave the sin and yet punished it by the death of his child  let him do what he will by us provided he doeswhat he will domake us good men  all saintsday sermons  my belief is that god will punish has he not punished already somewhat every wrong thing i ever did unless i repentthat is change my behaviour therein and that his lightest blow is hard enough to break bone and marrow  but as for saying of any human being whom i ever saw on earth that there is no hope for them that if ever under the bitter smart of just punishment they opened their eyes to their folly and altered their mind even then god would not forgive them as for saying that i will not for all the world and the rulers thereof  i never saw a man in whom there was not some good and i believe that god sees that good far more clearly and loves it far more deeply than i can because he himself put it there and therefore it is reasonable to believe that he will educate and strengthen that good and chastise the holder of it till he obeys it and loves it and gives himself up to it and that the said holder will find such chastisement terrible enough if he is unruly and stubborn i doubt not and so much the better for him  beyond this i cannot say  letters and memories  if a man really believed himself to be a son under a fathers education he would believe everything which happened to be a part of that education  and such a man i believe so praying and so working keeping before him as his lodestarour father hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven and asking even for his daily bread for that purpose and no other would find selfishness and selfseeking die out of him and active benevolence grow up in him  he would find past sorrows and falls turned unexpectedly to practical use for his own and others good and discover to his delight that his father had been educating him while he fancied he was educating himself and he would neither have leisure nor need to torment himself about the motives of his actions but simply whatever his hand found to do do it with all his might  letters and memories  let us forward  god leads us though blind shall we be afraid to follow  i do not see my way i do not care to but i know that he sees his way and that i see him and i cannot believe that in spite of all ones sins he will forget his gracious promises  they had an eye unto him and were lightened  they that put their trust in him shall not be ashamed  i know the miserable peevish lazy conceited faithless prayerless wretch that i am but i know this too that one is guiding me and driving me when i would not be guided who will make me and has made me go his way and do his work by fair means or by foul  letters and memories  be of good cheer  when the wicked man turneth from his wickedness then there and then he shall save his soul aliveand all his sin and wickedness shall not be mentioned unto him  what your measure of guilt if there can be a measure of the incommensurable spiritual may be i know not  but this i know that as long as you keep the sense of guilt alive in your own mind you will remain justified in gods mind as long as you set your sins before your face he will set them behind his back  letters and memories  this is the gospel the good news for fallen men that there is a man in the midst of the throne of god to whom all power is given in heaven and earth that the fate of the world and all that is therein the fate of sun and stars the fate of kings and nations the fate of every publican and harlot heathen and outcast the fate of all who are in death and hell depend alike upon the sacred heart of jesus the heart which grieved at the tomb of lazarus his friend the heart which wept over jerusalem the heart which said to the blessed magdalene the woman that was a sinner go in peace thy sins are forgiven thee the heart that yearns over every sinful and wandering soul all over the earth of god crying to all why will ye die  have i any pleasure in the death of him that dieth saith the lord and not rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live  come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest  national sermons  this is the message of the blessed sacrament of the body and blood of christ which tells you that in spite of all your daily sins and failings you can still look up to god as your father to the lord jesus as your life to the holy spirit as your guide and your inspirer that though you be a prodigal son your fathers house is still open to you your fathers eternal love ready to meet you afar off the moment that you cry from your heartfather i have sinned and am no more worthy to be called thy child and that you must be converted and turn back to god your father not merely once for all but weekly daily hourly as often as you forget and disobey him  this is the message of the blessed sacramentthat though you cannot come to it trusting in your own righteousness you can come trusting in his manifold and great mercies that though you are not worthy to gather up the crumbs under his table yet he is the same lord whose property is ever to have mercy and he will grant that your souls shall be washed in christs most precious blood that you may dwell in him and he in you for ever  national sermons  members of christ children of god heirs of the kingdom of heaven heirs of a hope undying pure that will never fade away you have a right given you by the promise and oath of almighty god himself to hope for yourselves for your neighbours for this poor distracted world for ever and ever a right to believe that there is an everlasting day of justice and peace and happiness in store for the whole world and that you if you will may have your share in that glorious sunrise which shall never set again  go to the scriptures and there read the promises of god the grounds of your just hope for all heaven and earth  behold the lamb of god who takes away

his spirithow dare we doubt that he will take away the sins of the world  ay step by step nation by nation year by year the lord shall conquer for he must reign till he has put all enemies under his

go beyond themas far beyond them as heaven is beyond hell as far above them as a free son is above a miserable crouching slave they will do you more harm than good  this spirit of bondage this slavish terror instead of bringing us nearer to god only drives us farther from him  it does not make us hate what is wrong it only makes us dread the punishment of it  how then shall we escape the terror and misery of an evil conscience and rise out of our sins  believe the warrant of your baptism  your baptism says to yougod is your father he does not hate you though you be the greatest sinner on earth  he loves you for you are his child and he willeth not the death of a sinner but that all should come and be saved he hateth nothing that he has made  this is the message of your baptismthat you are gods child and that gods will and wish is that you should grow up to become his son to serve him lovingly trustingly manfully and that he can and will give you the power to do so ay he has given you the power already if you will but claim and use it  but you must claim and use it because you are meant not merely to be gods wilful ignorant selfish child obeying him from fear of the rod but to be his willing loving loyal son  national sermons  god is not a tyrant who must be appeased with gifts or a taskmaster who must be satisfied with the labour of his slaves  he is a father who loves his children who gives and loveth to give who gives to all freely and upbraideth not  he truly willeth not the death of a sinner but rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live  his will is a good will and howsoever much mens sin and folly may resist it and seem for a time to mar it yet he is too great and good to owe any man even the worst the smallest spite or grudge  patiently nobly magnanimously god waitswaits for the man who is a fool to find out his folly waits for the heart which has tried to find pleasure in everything else to find out that everything else disappoints and to come back to him that fountain of all wholesome pleasure that wellspring of all life fit for a man to live  when the fool finds out his folly when the wilful man gives up his wilfulness when the rebel submits himself to law when the son comes back to his fathers housethere is no sternness no upbraiding no revenge but the everlasting and boundless love of god wells forth again as ever  the creator has condescended to wait for his creature because what he wanted was not his creatures fear but his creatures love not his lipobedience but his heart because he wanted him not to come back as a trembling slave to his master but as a son who has found out at last what a father he has left him when all beside has played him false  let him come back thus to find all is forgiven and to hear the father say this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found  discipline and other sermons  when the tempest comes when affliction fear anxiety shame come then the cross of christ begins to mean something to us  for then in our misery and confusion we look up to heaven and ask is there any one in heaven who understands all this  does god understand my trouble  does god feel for my trouble  does god care for my trouble  does god know what trouble means  or must i fight the battle of life alone without sympathy or help from god who made me and has put me here  then does the cross of christ bring a message to our heart such as no other thing or being on earth can bring  for it says to us god does understand thee utterly for christ understands thee  christ feels for thee christ feels with thee christ has suffered for thee and suffered with thee thou canst go through nothing which christ has not gone through  he the son of god endured poverty fear shame agony death for thee that he might be touched with the feeling of thine infirmity and help thee to endure and bring thee safe through all to victory and peace  westminster sermons  though we happily no longer believe in the terror by night which of old was thought to come from witches ghosts demons yet there is a terror by night in which we must believe for it comes to us from god and should be listened to as the voice of god even that terror about our own sinfulness folly weakness which comes to us in dreams and sleepless nights  we may learn from these night fancies and night thoughts for they are often gods message to us calling us to repentance and amendment of life  they are often gods book of judgment wherein our sins are written which god is setting before us and showing us the things we have done  god sends dreams to men which enable them to look back and recollect things past which they had forgot only too easily and these humble and penitential dreams are gods warning that as the article says the infection of nature doth remain even in those who are regenerate and that nothing but the continual help of gods spirit will keep us from falling back or falling away  discipline and other sermons  the religion of terror is the most superficial of all religions  gods arbitrary will and almighty power may seem dark by themselves though deep as they do to the calvinists because they do not involve his moral character  join them with the fact that he is a god of mercy as well as justice remember that his essence is love and the thunder cloud will blaze with dewy gold full of soft rain and pure light  all the deep things of god are bright for god is light  letters and memories  i am not and will not please god to help me as he has hitherto be anxious about anything  why should we weary out the little life we have left in us when he has promised to care for us and make us renew our youth and heap us with everything that is good for us  and as for our difficulties  has it not been fulfilled in themas thy day so shall thy strength be  have they not been gods sending  gods way of preventing the cup of bliss being over sweet and consider have they not been blessed lessons  have we not had in all things with the temptation a way to escape  so out of evil god brings good or rather out of necessity he brings strength  the highest spiritual training is contained in the most paltry physical accidents and the meanest actual want may be the means of calling into actual life the possible but sleeping embryo of the very noblest faculties  this is a great mystery but we are animals in time and space and by time and space and our animal natures are we educated  therefore let us be only patient patient and let god our father teach his own lesson his own way  let us try to learn it well and learn it quickly but do not let us fancy that he will ring the school bell and send us to play before our lesson is learnt  letters and memories  in all the events of life pray pray take what god does not send as not good for us and trust him to send us what is good  remember all these things are right and come with a reason and a purpose and a meaning and he who grumbles at them believeth not for the time being at least in the living god  ah do not fancy that i am not often perplexedcast down yet not in despair  no christ reigns as luther used to sayand therefore i will not

misfortunes and ask continually what if this happened or if that  how should i be able to get through such and such a trouble  far far from it  let us not waste the strength which god has given us for today in vain fears or vain dreams about tomorrow  to day is quite full enough of anxiety and care  sufficient for the day is the evil thereof and sufficient for the day is the good thereof  today and tomorrow too may end very differently from what we hope  yes but they may end very differently from what we fear  look not too far ahead lest you see what is coming before you are ready for the sight  if we foresaw the troubles that are coming perhaps it would break our hearts and if we foresaw the happiness which is coming perhaps it would turn our heads  let us not meddle with the future but refrain our souls and keep them low like little children content with the days food and the days schooling and the days playhours sure that the divine master knows all that is right and how to train us and whither to lead us though we know not and need not know save this that the path by which he is leading each of usif we will but obey and follow step by stepleads up to everlasting life  all

than man to whom i can flee  no one higher than man who cares for my soul and for the souls of those who are dearer to me than my own soul  no friend  no helper  no deliverer  no counsellor  even no

surely i would speak unto the almighty i desire to reason with god  oh my friends a man i believe can gain courage and wisdom to say that only by the inspiration of the spirit of god  but when once he has said that from his heart he begins to be justified by faith for he has had faith in god  he has trusted godand morehe has justified god  he has confessed that god is not a mere force or law of

that the spirit which proceeds alike from both of them is the spirit of humanity and love which cannot help going forth to seek and to save thee simply because thou art lost  look i say unto christ and be sure that what the good samaritan did to the wounded traveller that same will he do to thee because he is the son of man human and humane  art thou robbed wounded deserted left to die worsted in the battle of life and fallen in its rugged road with no counsel no strength no hope no purpose left  then remember that there is one walking to and fro in this world unseen but ever present whose form is as the form of the son of man  and he has time as he has will to turn aside and minister to such as thee  no human being so mean no human sorrow so petty but that he has the time and the will and the power to have mercy on it because he is the son of man  therefore he will turn aside even to thee whoever thou art who art weary and heavy laden and can find no rest for thy soul at the very

answers that comforter am i the god of heaven and earth  there are comforters on earth who can help thee with wise words and noble counsels can be strong as man and tender as woman  but god can be

the divine thirst for the higher life who are discontented with themselves ashamed of themselves who are tormented by longings which they cannot satisfy instincts which they cannot analyse powers

quiet thoughts and bright visions but a life of fighting against evil earnest awful prayers and struggles within continual labour of body and mind without insult and danger and confusion and violent exertion and bitter sorrow this was christs lifethis is the life of almost every good and great man i ever heard of  this was christs cup which his disciples were to drink of as well as he this was the baptism of fire with which they were to be baptised of as well as he this was to be their fight of faith this was the tribulation through which they and all other great saints were to enter into the kingdom of heaven  for it is certain that the harder a man fights against evil the harder evil will fight against him in return but it is certain too that the harder a man fights against evil the

or mohammed dante or bernard shakespeare or baconeach and all of them have this one fact in commonthat once in their lives at least they have gone down into the bottomless pit and there out of the utter darkness have asked the question of all questionsis there a god and if there be what is he doing with me  what refuge thenwhen a man feels himself powerless in the gripe of some unseen and inevitable power and knows not whether it be chance or necessity or a devouring fiendto wrap himself sternly in himself and cry i will endure though all the universe be against me  how fine it sounds  but who has done it  no there is but one escape one chink through which we may see light one rock on which our feet may find standingplace even in the abyss and that is the belief intuitive inspired due neither to reasoning nor to study that the billows are gods billows and that though we go down into hell he is there also the belief that not we but he is educating us that these seemingly incoherent miseries storm following earthquake and earthquake fire as if the caprice of all the demons were let loose against us have in his mind a spiritual coherence an organic unity and purpose though we see it not that these sorrows do not come singly only because he is making short work with our spirits and because the more effect he sees produced by one blow the more swiftly he follows it up by another till in one great and varied crisis seemingly long to us but short compared with immortality our spirits may be     heated hot with burning fears    and bathed in baths of hissing tears    and battered with the strokes of doom    to shape and use  two years ago  there is no darker temptation than that which comes over a man when the devil whispers to him such thoughts as these god does not care for megod hates me  luck and everything else is against me  there seems some curse upon me  why should i change  let god first change to me and then will i change towards him  but god will not change he has determined to have no mercy on me  i can see that for everything goes wrong with me  then what is the use of my repenting  i will go my own wayand what must be must  have you ever had such thoughts  then hear the word of the lord to you when whensoever wheresoever the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness which he has committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul alive  have i any pleasure in the death of him that dieth saith the lord and not rather that he should be converted and live  never believe the devil when he tells you that god hates you  never believe him when he tells you that god has been too hard upon you and placed you in such circumstances of temptation ignorance poverty or anything else that you cannot mend what does the promise of your baptism say  be you poor tempted ignorant stupid be you what you will you are gods childyour fathers love is over you his mercy ready for you  you feel too weak to change  ask gods spirit to give you a strength of will you never felt before  you feel too proud to change  ask gods spirit to humble your proud heart to soften your hard heart and you will find to your surprise that when your pride is gone when you are utterly ashamed of yourself and see your sins in their true blackness and feel unworthy to look up to god that then will come a nobler holier manlier feelingselfrespect and a clear conscience and the thought that weak and simple as you are you are in the right way that god and the angels of god are smiling on you that you are in tune again with all earth and heaven because you are what god wills you to be  not his proud peevish selfwilled child fancying yourself strong enough to go alone when you are really the slave of your own passions and appetites and the playthings of the devil but his loving loyal son through the strength of god and able to do what you will because what you will god wills also  national sermons  to escape atheism and despair let us remember that the creator and ordainer of the circumstances of life is not chance or nature but the father of our lord jesus christ and of us  when you feel you are in the deepest and gloomiest doubt pray the prayer of desperation cry out lord if thou dost exist let me know that thou dost exist  guide my mind by a way that i know not into thy truth and god will deliver you  letters and memories  sad as your letter was it gave me pleasure for it is always a pleasure to see life springing out of death health returning after disease though as doctors know the recovery from asphyxia or drowning is always as painful as the temporary death itself was painless  faith is born of doubt  it is not life but death where nothing stirs  take all these doubts and struggles of yours as simply so many signs that your father in heaven is treating you as a father that he has not forsaken you is not offended with you but is teaching you in the way best suited to your own idiosyncracy the great lesson of lessons empty thyself and god will fill thee  take your sorrows to your father in heaven  if that name father mean anything it must mean that he will not turn away from his wandering child in a way that you would he ashamed to turn away from yours  if there be pity lasting affection patience in man they must have come from god  they above all things must be his likeness  believe that he possesses them a million times more fully than any human being  st paul knew well at least the state of mind in which you are  he said that he had found a panacea for it  and his words to judge from the way in which they have taken root and spread and conquered must have some depth and life in them  why not try them  just read the first nine chapters of st pauls epistle to the romans taking for granted that they mean the simplest and most obvious sense which can be put upon them  letters and memories  when the hour of temptation comes go back go back if you would escape to what you were taught at your mothers knee concerning the grace of god for that alone will keep you safe or angel or archangel or any created being safe in this life and in all lives to come  sermons on david  what does it all mean  i cry  night and day the heavens have been black to me  you may think it sinful to have such thoughts  my experience is that when they come one must do battle with them one must face them do battle with them deliberately be patient if they worst one for a while by all such things men live in these is the life of the spirit  only by going down into hell can one rise the third day  i have been in hell many times in my life therefore perhaps i have had some small power of influencing human hearts  but i never have looked hell so close in the face as i have been doing of late  wherefore i hope thereby to get fresh power to rise and to lift others heavenward  i can only cryo lord in thee have i trusted let me never be confounded  wherefore should the wicked saywhere is now his god  but while i fret most there comes to me an inner voice sayingwhat matter if thou art confounded  god is not  only believe firmly that god is as good as thou with thy finite reason canst conceive and he will make thee at last able to conceive how good he is and thou shalt have the perfect blessing of seeing god  you will say i am inconsistent  so i am and so if read honestly are davids psalms  yet that very inconsistency is what brings them home to every human heart for ever  the words of a man in real doubt and real darkness crying for light and not crying in vain as i trust i shall not      i only know that i know nothing but hope that christ who is the son of man will tell me piecemeal if i be patient and watchful what i am and what man is  letters and memories  some things i see clearly and hold with desperate clutcha father in heaven for all a son of god incarnate for all that incarnation is the one fact which is to me worth all because it makes all others possible and rational and without it i should go mad and a spirit of the father and the son the fountain of all good on earthwho works to will and to do of his own good pleasurein whom  in every human being in whom there is one spark of active good the least desire to do right or to be of use  beyond that i see little save that right is divine and allconqueringwrong utterly infernal and yet weak foolish a mere bullying phantom which will flee at each brave blow had we courage to strike at it in gods name  letters and memories  there is not a sorrow which man can taste which jesus christ has not fulfilled  he filled the cup of misery to the brim and drained it to the dregs  he tasted death for every man and went down into the lowest depths of terror and shame and agony and death and worst of all into the feeling that god had forsaken him that there was no help or hope for him in heaven as well as earth in a word he went down into hell even into that lowest darkness where for one moment a man feels that god is nothing to him and he is nothing to god  even into that depth jesus condescended to go down for us  that worst of all temptations of which david only tasted a drop when he cried out my god my god why hast thou forsaken mejesus drained to the very dregs for us  he went down into hell for us and conquered hell and death and the darkness of the unknown world and rose again glorious from them that he might teach us not to fear death and hell that he might know how to comfort us in the hour of death and in the day of judgment when on our sickbed or in some bitter shame and trouble the lying devil is telling us that we are damned and lost and forsaken by god and every sin we ever did rises up and stares us in the face  national sermons  whatever may be the mysteries of life and death there is one mystery which the cross of christ reveals to us and that is the infinite and absolute goodness of god  let all the rest remain a mystery so long as the mystery of the cross of christ gives us faith for all the rest faith i say  the mystery of evil of terror of death the gospel does not pretend to solve but it tells us that the mystery is proved to be soluble for god himself has taken upon himself the task of solving it and christ has proved by his own act that if there be evil in the world it is none of his for he hates it fights against it and he fought against it to the death  the cross says have faith in god  ask no more of him why hast thou made me thus  ask no more why do the wicked prosper on the earth  ask no more whence pain and death war and famine earthquake and tempest and all the ills to which flesh is heir all fruitless questioning all peevish repinings are precluded henceforth by the death and passion of christ  dost thou suffer  thou canst not suffer more than the son of god  dost thou sympathise with thy fellowsufferers  thou canst not sympathise more than the son of god  dost thou long to right them to deliver them even at the price of thine own blood  thou canst not long more ardently than the son of god who carried his longing into act and died for them and thee  what if the end be not yet  what if evil still endure  what if the medicine have not yet conquered the disease  have patience have faith have hope as thou standest at the foot of christs cross and holdest fast to it as the anchor of thy soul and reason as well as of thy heart  for however ill the world may go or seem to go the cross is the everlasting token that god so loved the world that he spared not his only begotten son but freely gave him for it  whatsoever else is doubtful this at least is sure that god must conquer because god is good that evil must perish because god hates evil even to the death  westminster sermons  how shall the bottomless pit if we fall into it be a pathway to the everlasting rock  david tells us out of the deep have i cried unto thee o god  he cried to godnot to himself his own learning prudence talentsto pull him out of that pit  not to doctrines books churchgoingsnot to the dearest earthly friendnot to his own experiences faiths assurances frames and feelings  the matter was too terrible to be plastered over in that way or in any way  he was face to face with god alone and in utter weakness in utter nakedness of soul he cried to god himself  there was the lesson  god took away from him all things that he might have no one to cry to but to god  and it shall be with every soul of man who being in the deep cries out of the deep to god as it was with moses when he went up alone into the mount of god and fasted forty days and forty nights amid the earthquake and the thunderstorm and the rocks which melted before the lord  and behold when it was past he talked face to face with god as a man talketh with his friend and his countenance shone with heavenly light when he came down triumphant out of the mount of god  good news of godsermons  on the torturing cross christ prayed for his murderers father forgive them for they know not what they do  and this is the character many a man may get in the dark deep  to feel for all to feel with all to rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep to understand peoples trials and make allowances for their temptations to put oneself in their place till we see with their eyes and feel with their hearts till we judge no man and have hope for all to be fair and patient and tender with everyone we meet to despise no one despair of no one because christ despises none and despairs of none to look on every one we meet with love almost with pity because they too may have been down into the deep of horror or may go down into it any day to see our own sins in the sins of others to feel that we might do what they do and feel as they feel at any moment did god desert us to give and forgive live and let live even as christ gives to us and forgives us and lives for us and lets us live in spite of all our sins  good news of god  rejoice that there is a fire of god the father whose name is love burning for ever unquenchably to destroy out of every mans heart and out of the hearts of all nations and of the physical and moral world all which offends and makes a lie and that into that fire the son will surely cast all shams lies hypocrisies tyrannies false doctrines  is it not good news that that fire is unquenchable that that worm will not die  the fire may be kindled for usthe worm may seize our hearts god grant that in that day we may have courage to let the fire and the worm do their workto say to christ these too are thine and out of thine infinite love they have come  thou requirest truth in the inward parts and i will thank thee for any means however bitter which thou usest to make me true  i want to be an honest man and a right man  and o joy  thou wantest me to be so also  o joy that though i long cowardly to quench thy fire i cannot do it  purge me therefore o lord though it be with fire  burn up the chaff of vanity and selfindulgence of hasty prejudices secondhand dogmashusks which do not feed my soul with which i cannot be content of which i feel ashamed dailyand if there be any grains of wheat in me any word or thought or power of action which may be of use as seed for my nation after me gather it o lord into thy garner  amen  letters and memories  the fire of god hardens a man and softens him at the same time  he comes out of it hardened to that hardness of which it is written do thou endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ and again i have fought a good fight i have kept the faith i have finished my courseyet softened to that softness of which it is written be ye tenderhearted compassionate forgiving one another even as god for christs sake has forgiven you and again we have a high priest who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities seeing that he has been tempted in all things like as we are  happy thrice happy are they who have thus walked through the valley of the shadow of death and found it a path that leads to everlasting life happy are they who have writhed awhile in the fierce fire of god and have had burned out of them the chaff and the dross and all which offends and makes them vain and light yet makes them dull and drags them down at the same time till only the pure gold of gods righteousness is left seven times tried in the fire incorruptible precious in the sight of god and man  such need not regret will not regret all that they have gone through  it has made them brave sober patient  it has given them     the reason firm the temperate will    endurance foresight strength and skill  and so shaped them into the likeness of christ who was made perfect by suffering and though he were a son yet in the days of his flesh made strong supplication and crying with tears to his father and was heard in that he feared and so though he died on the cross and descended into hell yet triumphed over death and hell by dying and descending and conquered them by submitting to them  good news of godsermons     vi  out of the deep of death      my heart is disquieted within me

the next world be like what is heaven like  shall i be able to enjoy it  shall i be a man there or only a ghost a spirit without a body  to this st paul answers that christ the son of god after that he was manifested in the flesh was received up into glory  he does not tell us what heaven is like for though he had been caught up into the third heaven yet what he saw there was unspeakable  neither does he tell us what the next life will be like all he says is the man christ jesus who walked this earth like other men was received up into glory and he did not leave his mans mind his mans heart even his mans body behind him  he carried up into heaven with him his whole manhood spirit soul and body even to the print of the nails in his hands and in his most holy feet and the wound of the spear in his most holy side  that is enough for us because the man christ jesus is in heaven we as men may ascend to heaven  where he is we shall be  and what he is in as far as he is man we shall be  and this we do know that we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is  national sermons  men are afraid of dying principally i believe because they fear the unknown  it is not that they are afraid of the pain of dying  it is not that they are afraid of going to hell  neither is it that they are afraid of not going to heaven  but when they think of actually dying they feel as if to go into the next world was to be turned out into the dark night into an unknown land away from house and home and all they have known and loved and so they shrink from death  all saintsday sermons  when you are in terror trouble and affliction ay and in the black jaws of death and know not where to turn that blessed thought christ is risen from the dead will be a shield and a strength to you which no other thought can give  the lord is risena man with his mans body and his mans spirit his human love and tenderness he has taken them all up to heaven with him  he is a man still though he is very god of very god he rose from the dead as a man and therefore he can understand me and feel for me stillnowhere in england in the nineteenth century just as much as he could when he was walking upon earth in judea of old  when this world is vanishing from our eyes and we are going we know not whither leaving behind us all we know and love and understand then the thought of all thoughtschrist is risen from the dead is the only one which will save us from sad dark thoughts from fear and despair or from stupid carelessness and the death of a brute beast such as too many die  christ is risen and i shall rise  christ has conquered death for himself and he will conquer it for me  christ took his mans body and soul with him from the tomb to gods right hand and he will raise my body and soul at the last day that i may be with him for ever and see him where he is  in life and in death this is the only thing which will save us from sin from terror from the dread of the hereafter  national sermons  why did he die we ask  there must be a final cause a purpose for each death of every son of man or the fact would be altogether hideousa scribble without a meaninga skeleton without a soul  why did he die i became dumb i opened not my mouth for it was thy doing  so says the burial psalm  so let us say likewise  i became dumb not with rage not with despair but because it was thy doing and therefore it was done well  it was the deed not of chance nor of necessity  not so  for it was the deed of the father without whom a sparrow falls not to the ground of the son who died upon the cross in the utterness of his desire to save of the holy ghost who is the lord and giver of life to all created things  it was the deed of one who delights in life and not in death in bliss and not in woe in light and not in darkness in order and not in anarchy in good and not in evil  it had a final cause a meaning a purpose and that purpose is very good  what it is we know not and we need not know  to guess at it would be indeed to meddle with matters too high for us  so let us be dumb  dumb not from despair but from faith dumb not like a wretch weary with calling for help which does not come but dumb like a child sitting at its mothers feet and looking up into her face and watching her doings understanding none of them as yet but certain that they are all done in love  westminster sermons  christ is risen  what a thought was that for the blessed martyrs for poor creatures in the agony of fear and shame expecting presently to be torn to pieces or burnt alive  death this horrible death cannot conquer me weak and fearful as i am for my lord and master for whom i am going to suffer has conquered death and he will not let it conquer me  he is stronger than hell and death and he will not suffer me in my last hour for any pains of death to fall from him  he is king of heaven and earth and he will care for his own  what comfort to be able to say ay i am torn from wife and child and all which i love on earth but not for ever not for ever for christ rose from the dead and i who belong to christ shall rise as he did  this poor flesh of mine may be burnt in flames devoured by ravenous beasts  what matter  christ the king of men has risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept  that same spirit which brought back his body from the grave and hell will bring my body also from the grave and hell to a nobler happier life with him in joy unspeakable where christ now sits on gods right hand defending me pitying me and blessing me holding out to me a crown of glory which shall never fade away  national sermons  these things are most bitter 147 and the only comfort that i can see in them is that they are bringing us all face to face with the realities of human life as it has been in all ages and giving us sterner and yet more loving more human and more divine thoughts about ourselves and our business here and the fate of those who are gone and awakening us out of the luxurious frivolous unreal dream full nevertheless of hard judgments in which we have been living so long to trust in a living father who is really and practically governing this world and all worlds and who willeth that none should perish and therefore has not forgotten or suddenly begun to hate and torment one single poor soul which is past out of this life into some other  all are in our fathers hands and oh blessed thought though they go down into hell thou art there also  letters and memories  jesus is the saviour the deliverer the great physician the healer of soul and body  not a pang is felt or a tear shed on earth but he sorrows over it  not a human being on earth dies young but he as i believe sorrows over it  what is it which prevents him healing every sickness soothing every sorrow wiping away every tear now we cannot tell  but this we can tell that it is his will that none should perish  this we can tell that he is willing as ever to heal the sick to cleanse the leper to cast out devils to teach the ignorant to bind up the brokenhearted  this we can tell that he will go on doing so more and more year by year and age by age  this we can tell from scripture that christ is stronger than the devil  this we can tell that christ and all good men the spirits of just men made perfect the wise and the great in gods sight who have left us their books their sayings their writings as precious healthgiving heirlooms have been fighting and are fighting and will fight to the end against the devil and sin and oppression and misery and disease and everything which spoils and darkens the face of gods good earth  and this we can tell that they will conquer at the last because christ is stronger than the devil good is stronger than evil light is stronger than darkness gods spirit the giver of life and health and order is stronger than all the evil customs and carelessness and cruelty and superstition which make miserable the lives and as far as we can see destroy the souls of thousands  yes i say christs kingdom is a kingdom of health and deliverance for body and soul and it will conquer and it will spread and it will grow till the nations of the world have become the kingdoms of god and of his christ  christ reigns and will reign till he has put all enemies under his feet and the last of his enemies which shall be destroyed is death  death is his enemy which he has conquered by rising from the dead and the day will come when death will be no morewhen sickness and sorrow shall be unknown and god shall wipe tears from all eyes  i say it againnever forget itchrist is king and his kingdom is a kingdom of health of life and deliverance from all evil  it always has been so from the first time our lord cured the leper in galilee it will be so to the end of the world  national sermons  what did the spiritual glory of christs countenance at his transfiguration show his disciples but that he was a spiritual king whose strength lay in the spirit of power and wisdom and beauty and love which god had given him without measure and that there was such a thing as a spiritual bodysuch a body as each of us some day shall have if we be found in christ at the resurrection of the justa body which shall not hide a mans spirit as it does here when it becomes subject to the wear and tear of life and disease and decay but a spiritual bodya body which shall be filled with our spirits which shall be perfectly obedient to our spiritsa body through which the glory of our spirits shall shine out as the glory of christs spirit shone out through his in the transfiguration  brethren we know not what we shall be but this we do know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is  village sermons  i believe says the creed in the resurrection of the flesh  the bible teaches us to believe that we each of us as human beings men and women shall have our share in that glorious day not merely as ghosts disembodied spirits of which the bible thanks be to god says little or nothing but as real live human beings with new bodies of our own on a new earth under a new heaven  therefore says david my flesh shall rest in hope not merely my soul my ghost but my flesh  for the lord who not only died but rose again with his body shall raise our bodies according to the mighty working by which he subdues all things to himself and then the whole manhood of each of us body soul and spirit shall have our perfect consummation and bliss in his eternal and everlasting glory  that is our hope  national sermons  those who die in the fear of god and in the faith of christ do not really taste of death to them there is no death but only a change of place a change of state they pass at once into some new life with all their powers all their feelings unchanged still the same living thinking active beings which they were here on earth     rest they mayrest they will if they need rest  but what is their rest  not idleness but peace of mind  to rest from sin from sorrow from fear from doubt from care this is true rest  above all to rest from the worst weariness of allknowing ones duty and not being able to do it  that is true restthe rest of god who works for ever and is at rest for ever as the stars over our heads move for ever thousands of miles a day and yet are at perfect rest because they move orderly harmoniously fulfilling the law which god has given them  perfect rest in perfect work that surely is the rest of blessed spirits till the final consummation of all things when christ shall have made up the number of his elect  and if it be so what comfort for us who must die what comfort for us who have seen others die if death be but a new birth into some higher life if all that it changes in us is our bodythe mere husk and shell of ussuch a change as comes over the snake when he casts his old skin and comes out fresh and gay or even the crawling caterpillar which breaks its prison and spreads its wings to the sun as a fair butterfly  where is the sting of death then if death can sting and poison and corrupt nothing of us for which our friends love us nothing of us with which we could do service to men or god  where is the victory of the grave if so far from the grave holding us down it frees us from the very thing which does hold us downthe mortal body  water of

dead  yes not without a divine providenceyea a divine inspirationhas the blessed eastertide been fixed by the church of all ages as the season when the earth shakes off her winters sleep when the birds come back and the flowers begin to bloom when every seed which falls into the ground and dies and rises again with a new body is a witness to us of the resurrection of christ and a witness too that we shall rise again that in us as in it life shall conquer death when every bird that comes back to sing and build among us every flower that blows is a witness to us of the resurrection of the lord and of our resurrection     they obey the call of the lord the giver of life when they return to life as a type and a token to us of christ their maker who was dead and is alive again who was lost in hell on easter eve and was found again in heaven for evermore  and so the resurrection of the earth from her winters sleep commemorates to us as each blessed eastertide comes round the resurrection of our lord jesus christ and is a witness to us that some day life shall conquer death light conquer darkness righteousness conquer sin joy conquer grief when the whole creation which groaneth and travaileth in pain until now shall have brought forth that of which it travaileth in laboureven the new heavens and the new earth wherein shall be neither sighing nor sorrow but god shall

from darkness into light from weakness into strength from sinfulness into holiness  death is not death if it brings us nearer to christ who is the fount of life  death is not death if it perfects our faith by sight and lets us behold him in whom we have believed  death is not death if it gives us to those whom we have loved and lost for whom we have lived for whom we long to live again  death is not death if it joins the child to the mother who was gone before  death is not death if it takes away from that mother for ever all a mothers anxieties a mothers fears and lets her see in the gracious countenance of her saviour a sure and certain pledge that those whom she has left behind are safe safe with christ and in christ through all the chances and dangers of this mortal life  death is not death if it rids us of doubt and fear of chance and change of space and time and all which space and time bring forth and then destroy  death is not death for christ has conquered death for

father in heaven that question can only be answered by our lord jesus christ truly he said no one cometh unto the father but by me  the only begotten son who is in the bosom of the father he hath revealed him and therefore we can find boundless comfort in the words such as the father is such is the son and such the holy ghost  for now we know that there is a man in the midst of the throne who is the brightness of gods glory and the express image of his persona high priest who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities seeing he was tempted in all things like as we are  to him we can cry with human passion and in human words because we know that his human heart will respond to our human hearts and that his human heart again will respond to his divine spirit and that his divine spirit is the same as the divine spirit of his father for their wills and minds are one and their will and their mind is boundless love to sinful men  yes we can look up in our extreme need by faith into the sacred face of christ and by faith take refuge within his sacred heart saying if it be good for me he will give what i ask and if he gives it not it is because that too is good for me and for others beside me  in all the chances and changes of this mortal life we can say to him as he said in that supreme hourif it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done sure that he will present that prayer to his father and to our father and to his god and our god and that whatsoever be the answer vouchsafed by him whose ways are not as our ways nor his thoughts as our thoughts the prayer will not have gone up to christ in vain  westminster sermons  i have been praying long and earnestly and have no fears now whatsoever ye shall ask in my name believing ye shall receive lord i believe help thou my unbelief  those two texts were my stronghold when the night of misery was most utterly dark and in the strength of them we shall prevail  fret not then neither be anxious what god intends he will do  letters and memories  the longer i live the more i see that the lords prayer is the pattern of all prayers and whether it be consistent with that to ask that god should alter the course of the universe in the same breath that we say thy will be done on earthjudge you  i do not object to praying for special things  god forbid  i do it myself  i cannot help doing it any more than a child in the dark can help calling for its mother  only it seems to me that when we pray grant this day that we run into no kind of danger we ought to lay our stress on the run rather than on the danger and ask god not to take away the danger by altering the course of nature but to give us light and guidance whereby to avoid it  letters and memories  pray night and day very quietly like a little weary child for everything you want in body as well as in soulthe least thing as well as the greatestnothing is too much to ask god fornothing too great for him to grantand try to thank him for everything  glory be to thee o god  letters and memories  when you are in the deepwhatever that depth becry to god to god himself and none but god  if you can go to the pure fountainhead why drink of the stream which must have gathered something of defilement as it flows  if you can go to god himself why go to any of gods creatures however holy pure and loving  go to god who is light of light life of life  from him all goodness flows  go then to him himself  out of the deep however deep cry unto god unto god himself  if david the jew of old could do so much more we who are baptized into christ much more can we who have access by one spirit unto the father much more can we who if we know who we are and where we are should come boldly to the throne of grace to find mercy and grace to help us in the time of need  hath he promised and shall he not do it  to every one of youhowever weak however ignorant aye however sinful if you desire to be delivered from those sinsthis grace is given liberty to cry out of the depth to god himself who made sun and stars all heaven and earth liberty to stand face to face with the father of the spirits of all flesh and cling to the one being who can never fail nor change even to the one immortal eternal god  westminster sermons  the seed which we sowthe seed of repentance the seed of humility the seed of sorrowful prayers for helpshall take root and grow and bring forth fruit we know not how in the good time of god who cannot change we may be sadwe may be weary our eyes may wait and watch for the lord more than they who watch for the morning but it must be as those who watch for the morning for the morning which must and will come for the sun will surely rise and the day will surely dawn and the saviour will surely deliver those who cry unto him  westminster sermons  for the poor soul who is abased who is down and in the depth who feels his own weakness folly ignorance sinfulness and out of the deep cries unto god as a lost child crying after its fathereven as a lost lamb bleating after the eweof that poor soul be his prayers never so confused stupid and ill expressedof him it is written the lord helpeth them that fall he is nigh unto all that call upon him he will fulfil the desire of those that fear him he also will hear their cry and will help them  westminster sermons

thyself weak for the love of us  oh write that love upon our hearts so deeply that neither pleasure nor sorrow life nor death may wipe it away  thou hast sacrificed thyself for us oh give us hearts to sacrifice ourselves for thee  thou art the vine we are the branches let thy priceless blood shed for us on the cross flow like lifegiving sap through all our hearts and minds and fill us with thy righteousness that we may be sacrifices fit for thee  stir us up to offer to thee o lord our bodies our souls our spirits and in all we love and all we learn in all we plan and all we do to offer

sacrament to offer to thee our repentance our prayers our praises living reasonable and spiritual sacrificesthine from our birthhourthine now and thine for ever  amen    confession of sin   father i have sinned against thee and am not worthy to be called thy child but i come to thee  father i hate myself but thou lovest me  i do not understand myself but thou dost and thou wilt be merciful to the work of thine own hands  i cannot guide and help myself but thou canst help me and thou wilt too because thou art my father and nothing can part me from thy love or from the love of thy son my king  i come and claim my share in thee just because i have nothing and can bring thee nothing but lie at thy gate as a beggar full of sores desiring to be fed with the crumbs from thy table  and if i would help the wretched how much more wilt thou help me  thy name is love and thy glory is the likeness of thy son jesus christ who said come to me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest if ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your heavenly father give his holy spirit to them that ask him  amen    confession of weakness   o god my father i am thine save me for i have sought thy commandments i am thinenot merely thy creature o godthe very birds and bees and flowers are that and do their duty far better than igod forgive medo mine  i am thinenot merely thy childbut i am thy school child  o lord jesus christ i claim thy help as my schoolmaster as well as my lord and saviour  i am the least of thy school children and it may be the most ignorant and stupid  i do not pretend to be a scholar a divine a philosopher a saint  i am a very weak insufficient scholar sitting on the lowest form in thy great schoolhouse which is the whole world and trying to spell out the mere letters of thy alphabet in hope that hereafter i may be able to make out whole words and whole sentences of thy commandments and having learnt them to do them  if thou wilt but teach me thy statutes o lord then i will try to keep them to the end for i long to be on thy side and about thy work  i long to help be it ever so little in making myself better and my neighbour better  i long to be useful and not useless a fruitbearing tree and not a noxious weed in thy garden and therefore i pray that thou wilt not cut me down or root me up nor let foul creatures trample me under foot  have mercy upon me o lord in my trouble for the sake of the truth which i long to learn and for the good which i long to do  poor weak plant though i may be i am still a plant of thy planting which is struggling to grow and flower and bear fruit to eternal life and thou wilt not despise the work of thine own hands o lord who died that i might live thou wilt not let me perish  i have stuck unto thy testimonies  o lord confound me not  amen    confession of one in confusion of spirit   o god thou knowest and thou alone how far i am right and how far wrong  i leave myself in thy hand certain that thou wilt deal fairly justly lovingly with me as a father with his son  i do not pretend to be better than i am neither will i pretend to be worse than i am  truly i know nothing about it  i ignorant human being that i am can never fully know how far i am right and how far wrong  i find light and darkness fighting together in my heart and i cannot divide between them but thou lord canst  thou knowest  thou hast made me thou lovest me thou hast sent thy son into the world to make me what i ought to be  thou wiliest not that i should perish but come to the knowledge of the truth and therefore i believe that i shall not perish but come to the knowledge of the truth about thee about my own character my own duty about everything which it is needful for me to know  therefore o lord i will go boldly on doing my duty as well as i can though not perfectly day by day and asking thee day by day to feed my soul with daily bread  thou feedest my body with daily bread  how much more wilt thou feed my mind and my heart more precious by far than my body  lord i will trust thee for soul and body alike and if i need correcting for my sins i know this at least that the worst thing that can happen to me or to any man is to do wrong and not to be corrected and the best thing is to be set right even by hard blows as often as i stray out of the way  therefore o lord i will take my punishment quietly and manfully and try to thank thee for it as i ought for i know that thou wilt not punish me beyond what i deserve but far below what i deserve  i know thou wilt punish me only to bring me to myself and to correct me and purge me and strengthen me  i believe o lord on the warrant of thine own word i believe itundeserved as the honour is that thou art my father and lovest me thou dost not afflict any man willingly or grieve the children of men out of passion or out of spite  thou wiliest not that i or any man should perish but thou wiliest have all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth for jesus christ his sake  amen    confession of a tormented soul   o lord i am in miserymy soul is sore troubledfor i have sinned and i confess that i only receive the due reward of my deeds  i have earned my shame i have earned my sorrow lord i have deserved it all  i look back on wasted time and wasted powers  i look round on ruined health ruined fortune ruined hopes i confess that i deserve it all  but thou hast endured more than this for me and thou hast done nothing amiss  for me thou didst suffer for me thou hast been crucified and me thou hast been trying to save all through the years of my vanity  perhaps i have not wearied out thy love perhaps i have not conquered thy patience  i will take the blessed chance  i will still cast myself upon thy love  o lord i have deserved all my misery  yet lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom  amen  father not our will but thine be done  all things come from thy hand and therefore all things come from thy love  we have received good from thy hand and shall we not receive evil  though thou slay us yet will we trust in thee  for thou art gracious and merciful longsuffering and of great goodness  thou art loving to every man and thy mercy is over all thy works  thou art righteous in all thy ways and holy in all thy doings  thou art nigh unto them that call upon thee  thou wilt hear their cry and wilt help them for all thou desirest when thou sendest trouble on us is to make us wiser and better  and that thou canst only make us by teaching us the knowledge of thyself  glory be to thee o god  amen  the end  26  death of a husband  30  death of a parent  147  deaths on the battlefield
