47517833	the bellringer of angels   by bret harte     contents   the bellringer of angels  johnnyboy  young robin gray  the sheriff of siskyou  a rose of glenbogie  the mystery of the hacienda  chu chu  my first book     the bellringer of angels     chapter i   where the north fork of the stanislaus river begins to lose its youthful grace vigor and agility and broadens more maturely into the plain there is a little promontory which at certain high stages of water lies like a small island in the stream to the stronglymarked heroics of sierran landscape it contrasts a singular pastoral calm white and gray mosses from the overhanging rocks and feathery alders trail their filaments in its slow current and between the woodland openings there are glimpses of vivid velvet sward even at times when the wild oats and wiregrasses of the plains are already yellowing the placid river unstained at this point by mining sluices or mill drift runs clear under its contemplative shadows originally the campingground of a digger chief it passed from his tenancy with the american rifle bullet that terminated his career the pioneer who thus succeeded to its attractive calm gave way in turn to a welldirected shot from the revolver of a quartzprospector equally impressed with the charm of its restful tranquillity how long he might have enjoyed its riparian seclusion is not known a sudden rise of the river one march night quietly removed him together with the overhanging post oak beneath which he was profoundly but unconsciously meditating the demijohn of whiskey was picked up further down but no other suggestion of these successive evictions was ever visible in the reposeful serenity of the spot  it was later occupied and a cabin built upon the spot by one alexander mcgee better known as the bellringer of angels this euphonious title which might have suggested a consistently peaceful occupation however referred to his accuracy of aim at a mechanical target where the piercing of the bulls eye was celebrated by the stroke of a bell it is probable that this singular proficiency kept his investment of that gentle seclusion unchallenged at all events it was uninvaded he shared it only with the birds perhaps some suggestion of nest building may have been in his mind for one pleasant spring morning he brought hither a wife it was his own and in this way he may be said to have introduced that morality which is supposed to be the accompaniment and reflection of pastoral life mrs mcgees red petticoat was sometimes seen through the treesa cheerful bit of color mrs mcgees red cheeks plump little figure beribboned hat and brown stillgirlish braids were often seen at sunset on the river bank in company with her husband who seemed to be pleased with the discreet and distant admiration that followed them strolling under the bland shadows of the cottonwoods by the fading gold of the river he doubtless felt that peace which the mere world cannot give and which fades not away before the clear accurate eye of the perfect marksman  their nearest neighbors were the two brothers wayne who took up a claim and built themselves a cabin on the river bank near the promontory quiet simple men suspected somewhat of psalmsinging and undue retirement on sundays they attracted but little attention but when through some original conception or painstaking deliberation they turned the current of the river so as to restrict the overflow between the promontory and the river bank disclosing an auriferous bar of inconceivable richness and establishing their theory that it was really the former channel of the river choked and diverted though ages of alluvial drift they may be said to have changed also the fortunes of the little settlement popular feeling and the new prosperity which dawned upon the miners recognized the two brothers by giving the name of waynes bar to the infant settlement and its postoffice the peaceful promontory although made easier of access still preserved its calm seclusion and pretty mrs mcgee could contemplate through the leaves of her bower the work going on at its base herself unseen nevertheless this arcadian retreat was being slowly and surely invested more than that the character of its surroundings was altered and the complexion of the river had changed the wayne engines on the point above had turned the drift and debris into the current that now thickened and ran yellow around the wooded shore the fringes of this eden were already tainted with the color of gold  it is doubtful however if mrs mcgee was much affected by this sentimental reflection and her husband in a manner lent himself to the desecration of his exclusive domain by accepting a claim along the shoretendered by the conscientious waynes in compensation for restricting the approach to the promontoryand thus participated in the fortunes of the bar mrs mcgee amused herself by watching from her eyrie with a presumably childish interest the operations of the redshirted brothers on the bar her husband however always accompanying her when she crossed the bar to the bank some two or three other womenwives of minershad joined the camp but it was evident that mcgee was as little inclined to intrust his wife to their companionship as to that of their husbands an opinion obtained that mcgee being an old resident with alleged high connections in angels was inclined to be aristocratic and exclusive  meantime the two brothers who had founded the fortunes of the bar were accorded an equally high position with an equal amount of reserve their ways were decidedly not those of the other miners and were as efficacious in keeping them from familiar advances as the reputation of mr mcgee was in isolating his wife madison wayne the elder was tall wellknit and spare reticent in speech and slow in deduction his brother arthur was of rounder outline but smaller and of a more delicate and perhaps a more impressible nature it was believed by some that it was within the range of possibility that arthur would yet be seen taking his cocktail like a white man or dropping his scads at draw poker at present however they seemed content to spend their evenings in their own cabin and their sundays at a grim presbyterian tabernacle in the next town to which they walked ten miles where it was currently believed hell fire was ladled out free and infants damned for nothing when they did not go to meeting it was also believed that the minister came to them until it was ascertained that the sound of sacred recitation overheard in their cabin was simply madison wayne reading the bible to his younger brother mcgee is said to have stopped on one of these occasionsunaccompanied by his wifebefore their cabin moving away afterwards with more than his usual placid contentment  it was about eleven oclock one morning and madison wayne was at work alone on the bar clad in a dark gray jersey and white duck trousers rolled up over high indiarubber boots he looked not unlike a peaceful fisherman digging stakes for his nets as he labored in the ooze and gravel of the still halfreclaimed river bed he was far out on the bar within a stones throw of the promontory suddenly his quick ear caught an unfamiliar cry and splash looking up hastily he saw mrs mcgees red petticoat in the water under the singularly agitated boughs of an overhanging tree madison wayne ran to the bank threw off his heavy boots and sprang into the stream a few strokes brought him to mrs mcgees petticoat which as he had wisely surmised contained mrs mcgee who was still clinging to a branch of the tree grasping her waist with one hand and the branch with the other he obtained a foothold on the bank and dragged her ashore a moment later they both stood erect and dripping at the foot of the tree  well said the lady  wayne glanced around their seclusion with his habitual caution slightly knit his brows perplexedly and said you fell in  i didnt do nothin of the sort i jumped in  wayne again looked around him as if expecting her companion and squeezed the water out of his thick hair jumped in he repeated slowly what for  to make you come over here mad wayne she said with a quick laugh putting her arms akimbo  they stood looking at each other dripping like two river gods like them also wayne had apparently ignored the fact that his trousers were rolled up above his bare knees and mrs mcgee that her red petticoat clung closely to her rather pretty figure but he quickly recovered himself you had better go in and change your clothes he said with grave concern youll take cold  she only shook herself disdainfully im all right she said but you mad wayne what do you mean by not speaking to menot knowing me you cant say that ive changed like that she passed her hand down her long dripping braids as if to press the water from them and yet with a halfcoquettish suggestion in the act  something struggled up into the mans face which was not there before there was a new light in his grave eyes you look the same he said slowly but you are marriedyou have a husband  you think that changes a girl she said with a laugh thats where all you men slip up youre afraid of his riflethats the change that bothers you mad  you know i care little for carnal weapons he said quietly she did know it but it is the privilege of the sex to invent its facts and then to graciously abandon them as if they were only arguments then why do you keep off from me why do you look the other way when i pass she said quickly  because you are married he said slowly  she again shook the water from her like a newfoundland dog thats it youre mad because i got married youre mad because i wouldnt marry you and your church over on the cross roads and sing hymns with you and become sister wayne you wanted me to give up dancing and buggy ridin sundaysand youre just mad because i didnt yes madjust mean baby mad mr maddy wayne for all your christian resignation thats whats the matter with you yet she looked very pretty and piquant in her small spitefulness which was still so general and superficial that she seemed to shake it out of her wet petticoats in a vicious flap that disclosed her neat ankles  you preferred mcgee to me he said grimly i didnt blame you  who said i preferred him she retorted quickly much you know then with swift feminine abandonment of her position she added with a little laugh its all the same whether youre guarded with a rifle or a church presbytery only  only what said madison earnestly  theres men whod risk being shot for a girl that couldnt stand psalmsingin palaver  the quick expression of pain that passed over his hard dark face seemed only to heighten her pretty mischievousness but he simply glanced again around the solitude passed his hand over his wet sleeve and said i must go now your husband wouldnt like me being here  hes workin in the claimthe claim you gave him said mrs mcgee with cheerful malice wonder what hed say if he knew it was given to him by the man who used to spark his wife only two years ago how does that suit your christian conscience mad  i should have told him had i not believed that everything was over between us or that it was possible that you and me should ever meet again he returned in a tone so measured that the girl seemed to hear the ring of the conventicle in it  should you brother wayne she said imitating him well let me tell you that you are the one man on the bar that sandy has taken a fancy to  madisons sallow cheek colored a little but he did not speak  well continued mrs mcgee impatiently i dont believe hed object to your comin here to see meif you cared  but i wouldnt care to come unless he first knew that i had been once engaged to you said madison gravely  perhaps he might not think as much of that as you do retorted the woman pertly every one isnt as straitlaced as you and every girl has had one or two engagements but do as you likestay at home if you want to and sing psalms and read the scriptures to that younger brother of yours all the same im thinkin hed rather be out with the boys  my brother is godfearing and conscientious said madison quickly you do not know him you have never seen him  no said mrs mcgee shortly she then gave a little shiver that was however half simulated in her wet garments and added one saint was enough for me i couldnt stand the whole church mad  you are catching cold he said quickly his whole face brightening with a sudden tenderness that seemed to transfigure the dark features i am keeping you here when you should be changing your clothes go i beg you at once  she stood still provokingly with an affectation of wiping her arms and shoulders and sopping her wet dress with clusters of moss  go please dosafie please  ahshe drew a quick triumphant breath then youll come again to see me mad  yes he said slowly and even more gravely than before  but you must let me show you the way outround under those treeswhere no one can see you come she held out her hand  ill go the way i came he said quietly swinging himself silently from the nearest bough into the stream and before she could utter a protest he was striking out as silently hand over hand across the current     chapter ii   a week later madison wayne was seated alone in his cabin his supper table had just been cleared by his chinese coolie as it was getting late and the setting sun which for half an hour had been persistently making a vivid beacon of his windows for the benefit of wayfarers along the river bank had at last sunk behind the cottonwoods his head was resting on his hand the book he had been reading when the light faded was lying open on the table before him in this attitude he became aware of a hesitating step on the gravel outside his open door he had been so absorbed that the approach of any figure along the only highwaythe river bankhad escaped his observation looking up he discovered that mr alexander mcgee was standing in the doorway his hand resting lightly on the jamb a sudden color suffused waynes cheek his hand reached for his book which he drew towards him hurriedly yet half automatically as he might have grasped some defensive weapon  the bellringer of angels noticed the act but not the blush and nodded approvingly dont let me disturb ye i was only meanderin by and reckoned id say how do in passin he leaned gently back against the doorpost to do which comfortably he was first obliged to shift the revolver on his hip the sight of the weapon brought a slight contraction to the brows of wayne but he gravely said wont you come in  it aint your prayin time said mcgee politely  no  nor you aint gettin up lessons outer the book he continued thoughtfully  no  cos it dont seem so to speak you see the square thing to be botherin a man when he might be doin suthin else dont you see you understand what i mean  it was his known peculiarity that he always seemed to be suffering from an inability to lucid expression and the fear of being misunderstood in regard to the most patent or equally the most unimportant details of his speech all of which however was in very remarkable contrast to his perfectly clear and penetrating eyes  wayne gravely assured him that he was not interrupting him in any way  i often thoughtthat is i had an idea you understand what i meanof stoppin in passing you and me you see are sorter alike we dont seem to jibe in with the ginral gait o the camp you understand what i mean we aint in the game eh you see what im after  madison wayne glanced half mechanically at mcgees revolver mcgees clear eyes at once took in the glance  thats it you understand you with them books of yours and me with my shootin ironwere sort o different from the rest and ought to be kinder like partners you understand what i mean we keep this camp in check we hold a full hand and dont stand no bluffing  if you mean there is some effect in christian example and the life of a godfearing manbegan madison gravely  thats it godfearin or revolverfearin it amounts to the same when you come down to the hard pan and bedrock interrupted mcgee i aint expectin you to think much of my style but i go a heap on yours even if i cant play your game and i sez to my wife safieher that trots around with me sometimesi sez safie i oughter know that man and shall and i want you to know him hol on he added quickly as madison rose with a flushed face and a perturbed gesture ye dont understand i see wots in your minddont you see when i married my wife and brought her down here knowin this yer camp i sez no flirtin no foolin no philanderin here my dear youre young and dont know the ways o men the first man i see you talking with i shoot you neednt fear

sorter understand what i mean sez iso dont ye noticed how my wife is respected mr wayne queen victoria sittin on her throne aint in it with my safie but when i see you not herdin with that cattle never liftin your eyes to me or safie as we pass never hangin round the saloons and jokin nor winkin nor slingin muddy stories about women but prayin and readin scripter stories here along with your brother i sez to myself i sez sandy ye kin take off your revolver and hang up your shot gun when hes around for twixt him and your wife aint no revolver but the fear of god and hell and damnation and the world to come you understand what i mean dont ye ye sorter follow my lead eh ye can see what im shootin round dont ye so i want you to come up neighborly like and drop in to see my wife  madison waynes face became set and hard again but he advanced towards mcgee with the book against his breast and his finger between the leaves i already know your wife mr mcgee i saw her before you ever met her i was engaged to her i loved her andas far as man may love the wife of another and keep the commands of this booki love her still  to his surprise mcgee whose calm eyes had never dimmed or blenched after regarding him curiously took the volume from him laid it on the table opened it turned its leaves critically said earnestly thats the law here is it and then held out his hand  shake  madison wayne hesitatedand then grasped his hand  ef i had known this continued mcgee i reckon i wouldnt have been so hard on safie and so partikler shes better than i took her forhavin had you for a beau you understand what i mean you follow medont ye i allus kinder wondered why she took me but sens youve told me that you used to spark her in your godfearin way i reckon it kinder prepared her for me you understand now you come up wont ye  i will call some evening with my brother said wayne embarrassedly  with which demanded mcgee  my brother arthur we usually spend the evenings together  mcgee paused leaned against the doorpost and fixing his clear eyes on wayne said ef its all the same to you id rather you did not bring him you understand what i mean you follow me no other man but you and me i aint sayin anything agin your brother but you see how it is dont you just me and you  very well i will come said wayne gloomily but as mcgee backed out of the door he followed him hesitatingly then with an effort he seemed to recover himself and said almost harshly i ought to tell you another thingthat i have seen and spoken to mrs mcgee since she came to the bar she fell into the water last week and i swam out and dragged her ashore we talked and spoke of the past  she fell in echoed mcgee  wayne hesitated then a murky blush came into his face as he slowly repeated she fell in  mcgees eyes only brightened i have been too hard on her she might have drowned ef you hadnt took risks you see you understand what i mean and she never let out anything about itand never boasted o you helpin her out all rightyoull come along and see her agin he turned and walked cheerfully away  wayne reentered the cabin he sat for a long time by the window until the stars came out above the river and another star with which he had been long familiar took its place apparently in the heart of the wooded crest of the little promontory then the fringing woods on the opposite shore became a dark level line across the landscape and the color seemed to fade out of the moist shining gravel before his cabin presently the silhouette of his dark face disappeared from the window and mr mcgee might have been gratified to know that he had slipped to his knees before the chair whereon he had been sitting and that his head was bowed before it on his clasped hands in a little while he rose again and dragging a battened old portmanteau from the corner took out a number of letters tied up in a package with which from time to time he slowly fed the flame that flickered on his hearth in this way the windows of the cabin at times sprang into light making a somewhat confusing beacon for the somewhat confused arthur wayne who was returning from a visit to angels and who had fallen into that slightly morose and irritated state which follows excessive hilarity and is also apt to indicate moral misgivings  but the last letter was burnt and the cabin quite dark when he entered his brother was sitting by the slowly dying fire and he trusted that in that uncertain light any observation of his expression or mannerof which he himself was uneasily consciouswould pass unheeded  you are late said madison gravely  at which his brother rashly assumed the aggressive he was no later than the others and if the rogers boys were good enough to walk with him for company he couldnt run ahead of them just because his brother was waiting he didnt want any supper he had something at the cross roads with the others yes whiskey if he wanted to know people couldnt keep coffee and temperance drinks just to please him and his brother and he wasnt goin to insult the others by standing aloof anyhow he had never taken the pledge and as long as he hadnt he couldnt see why he should refuse a single glass as it was everybody said he was a milksop and a tenderfoot and he was just sick of it  madison rose and lit a candle and held it up before his brothers face it was a handsome youthful face that looked into his flushed with the excitement of novel experiences and perhaps a more material stimulation the little silken moustache was ostentatiously curled the brown curls were redolent of bears grease yet there was a certain boyish timidity and nervousness in the defiance of his blue eyes that momentarily touched the elder brother  ive been too hand with him he said to himself half consciously recalling what mcgee had said of safie he put the candle down laid his hand gently on arthurs shoulder and said with a certain cautious tenderness come arty sit down and tell me all about it  whereupon the mercurial arthur not only relieved of his nervousness but of his previous ethical doubts and remorse became gay and voluble he had finished his purchases at angels and the storekeeper had introduced him to colonel starbottle of kentucky as one of the waynes who had made waynes bar famous colonel starbottle had said in his pompous fashionyet he was not such a bad fellow after allthat the waynes ought to be represented in the councils of the state and that he starbottle would be proud to nominate madison for the next legislature and run him too and you know really mad if you mixed a little more with folks and they werentwell sorter afraid of youyou could do it why ive made a heap o friends over there just by goin round a little and one of old selvedges girlsthe storekeeper you knowsaid from what shed heard of us she always thought i was about fifty and turned up the whites of my eyes instead of the ends of my moustache shes mighty smart then the postmaster has got his wife and three daughters out from the states and theyve asked me to come over to their church festival next week it isnt our church of course but i suppose its all right  this and much more with the volubility of relieved feelings when he stopped out of breath madison said i have had a visitor since you leftmr mcgee  and his wife asked arthur quickly madison flushed slightly no but he asked me to go and see her  thats her doin then returned arthur with a laugh shes always lookin round the corners of her eyes at me when she passes why john rogers was joking me about her only yesterday and said mcgee would blow a hole through me some of these days if i didnt look out of course he added affectedly curling his moustache thats nonsense but you know how they talk and shes too pretty for that fellow mcgee  she has found a careful helpmeet in her husband said madison sternly and its neither seemly nor christian in you arthur to repeat the idle profane gossip of the bar i knew her before her marriage and if she was not a professing christian she was and is a pure good woman let us have no more of this  whether impressed by the tone of his brothers voice or only affected by his own mercurial nature arthur changed the subject to further voluble reminiscences of his trip to angels yet he did not seem embarrassed nor disconcerted when his brother in the midst of his speech placed the candle and the bible on the table with two chairs before it he listened to madisons monotonous reading of the evening exercise with equally monotonous respect then they both arose without looking at each other but with equally set and stolid faces and knelt down before their respective chairs clasping the back with both hands and occasionally drawing the hard wooden frames against their breasts convulsively as if it were a penitential act it was the elder brother who that night prayed aloud it was his voice that rose higher by degrees above the low roof and encompassing walls the level river camp lights that trembled through the window the dark belt of riverside trees and the light on the promontorys crestup to the tranquil passionless stars themselves  with those confidences to his maker this chronicle does not lieobtrusive and ostentatious though they were in tone and attitude enough that they were a general arraignment of humanity the bar himself and his brother and indeed much that the same maker had created and permitted that through this hopeless denunciation still lingered some human feeling and tenderness might have been shown by the fact that at its close his hands trembled and his face was bedewed by tears and his brother was so deeply affected that he resolved hereafter to avoid all evening prayers     chapter iii   it was a week later that madison wayne and mr mcgee were seen to the astonishment of the bar leisurely walking together in the direction of the promontory here they disappeared entering a damp fringe of willows and laurels that seemed to mark its limits and gradually ascending some thicklywooded trail until they reached its crest which to madisons surprise was cleared and open and showed an acre or two of rude cultivation here too stood the mcgees conjugal homea small fourroomed house but so peculiar and foreign in aspect that it at once challenged even madisons abstracted attention it was a tiny swiss chalet built in sections and originally packed in cases one of the early importations from europe to california after the gold discovery when the country was supposed to be a woodless wilderness mr mcgee explained with his usual laborious care how he had bought it at marysville not only for its picturesqueness but because in its unsuggestive packingcases it offered no indication to the curious miners and could be put up by himself and a single uncommunicative chinaman without any one else being aware of its existence there was indeed something quaint in this fragment of old world handicraft with its smoothjointed paneling in two colors its little lozenge fretwork its lapped roof overhanging eaves and miniature gallery inartistic as madison waslike most men of rigidly rectangular mind and principleand accustomed to the bleak and economic sufficiency of the californian miners cabin he was touched strangely by its novel grace and freshness it reminded him of her he had a new respect for this rough sinful man who had thus idealized his wife in her dwelling already a few madeira vines and a cherokee rose clambered up the gallery and here mrs mcgee was sitting  in the face that she turned upon the two men madison could see that she was not expecting them and even in the slight curiosity with which she glanced at her husband that evidently he had said nothing of his previous visit or invitation and this conviction became certainty at mr mcgees first words  ive brought you an ole friend safie he used to spark ye once at angels afore my timehe told me so he picked ye outer the water herehe told me that too ye mind that i said afore that he was the only man i wanted ter know i reckon now it seems the square thing that he should be the one man you wanted ter know too you understand what i meanyou follow me dont you  whether or not mrs mcgee did follow him she exhibited neither concern solicitude nor the least embarrassment an experienced lover might have augured ill from this total absence of selfconsciousness but madison was not an experienced lover he accepted her amused smile as a recognition of his feelings trembled at the touch of her cool hands as if it had been a warm pressure and scarcely dared to meet her maliciously laughing eyes when he had followed mr mcgee to the little gallery the previous occupation of mrs mcgee when they arrived was explained from that slight elevation there was a perfect view over the whole landscape and river below the bar stretched out as a map at her feet in that clear transparent air she could see every movement and gesture of waynes brother all unconscious of that surveillance at work on the bar for an instant madisons sallow cheek reddened he knew not why a remorseful feeling that he ought to be there with arthur came over him mrs mcgees voice seemed to answer his thought you can see everything thats going on down there without being seen yourself its good fun for me sometimes the other day i saw that young carpenter hanging round mrs rogerss cabin in the bush when old rogers was away and i saw her creep out and join him never thinking any one could see her  she laughed seeking madisons averted eyes yet scarcely noticing his suddenly contracted brows mr mcgee alone responded  thats why he said explanatorily to madison i dont allow to have my safie go round with those women not as i ever see anything o that sort goin on or keer to look but on ginral principles you understand what i mean  thats your brother over there isnt it said mrs mcgee turning to madison and calmly ignoring her husbands explanation as she indicated the distant arthur why didnt you bring him along with you  madison hesitated and looked at mcgee he wasnt asked said that gentleman cheerfully ones company twos none you dont know him my dear and this yer aint a ginral invitation to the bar you follow me  to this mrs mcgee made no comment but proceeded to show madison over the little cottage yet in a narrow passage she managed to touch his hand lingered to let her husband precede them from one room to another and once or twice looked meaningly into his eyes over mcgees shoulder disconcerted and embarrassed he tried to utter a few commonplaces but so constrainedly that even mcgee presently noticed it and the result was still more embarrassing  look yer he said suddenly turning to them both i reckon as how you two wanter talk over old times and ill just meander over to the claim and do a spell o work dont mind me and if heindicating madison with his fingergets on ter religion dont you mind him it wont hurt you safieno more nor my revolverbut its powful persuadin and you understand me you follow me well so long  he turned away quickly and was presently lost among the trees for an instant the embarrassed madison thought of following him but he was confronted by mrs mcgees wicked eyes and smiling face between him and the door composing herself however with a simulation of perfect gravity she pointed to a chair  sit down brother wayne if youre going to convert me it may take some time you know and you might as well make yourself comfortable as for me ill take the anxious bench she laughed with a certain girlishness which he well remembered and leaped to a sitting posture on the table with her hands on her knees swinging her smart shoes backwards and forwards below it  madison looked at her in hopeless silence with a pale disturbed face and shining eyes  or if you want to talk as we used to talk mad when we sat on the front steps at angels and pa and ma went inside to give us a show ye can hop up alongside o me she made a feint of gathering her skirts beside her  safie broke out the unfortunate man in a tone that seemed to increase in formal solemnity with his manifest agitation this is impossible the laws of god that have joined you and this man  oh its the prayermeeting is it said safie settling her skirts again with affected resignation go on  listen safie said madison turning despairingly towards her let us for his sake let us for the sake of our dear blessed past talk together earnestly and prayerfully let us take this time to root out of our feeble hearts all yearnings that are not prompted by himyearnings that your union with this man makes impossible and sinful let us for the sake of the past take counsel of each other even as brother and sister  sister mcgee she interrupted mockingly it wasnt as brother and sister you made love to me at angels  no i loved you then and would have made you my wife  and you dont love me any more she said audaciously darting a wicked look into his eyes only because i didnt marry you and you think that christian  you know i love you as i have loved you always he said passionately  hush she said mockingly suppose he should hear you  he knows it said madison bitterly i told him all  she stared at him fixedly  you havetoldhimthatyou still love me she repeated slowly  yes or i wouldnt be here now it was due to himto my own conscience  and what did he say  he insisted upon my coming and as god is my judge and witnesshe seemed satisfied and content  she drew her pretty lips together with a long whistle and then leaped from the table her face was hard and her eyes were bright as she went to the window and looked out he followed her timidly  dont touch me she said sharply striking away his proffered hand he turned with a flushed cheek and walked slowly towards the door her laugh stopped him  come i reckon that squeezin hands aint no part of your contract with sandy she said glancing down at her own well so youre goin  i only wished to talk seriously and prayerfully with you for a few moments safie and thento see you no more  and how would that suit him she said dryly if he wants your company here then just because you cant convert me and bring me to your ways of thinkin in one visit i suppose you think it is christianlike to run away like this or do you suppose that if you turn tail now he wont believe that your christian strength and christian resignation is all humbug  madison dropped into the chair put his elbows on the table and buried his face in his hands she came a little nearer and laid her hand lightly on his arm he made a movement as if to take it but she withdrew it impatiently  come she said brusquely now youre in for it you must play the game out he trusts you if he sees you cant trust yourself hell shoot you on sight that dont frighten you well perhaps this will then hell say your religion is a sham and you a hypocriteand everybody will believe him how do you like that brother wayne how will that help the church come youre a pair of cranks together but hes got the whiphand of you this time all you can do is to keep up to his idea of you put a bold face on it and come here as often as you canthe oftener the better the sooner youll both get sick of each otherand of me thats what youre both after aint it well i can tell you now you neednt either of you be the least afraid of me  she walked away to the window again not angrily but smoothing down the folds of her bright print dress as if she were wiping her hands of her husband and his guest something like a very material and manlike sense of shame struggled up through his crust of religion he stammered you dont understand me safie  then talk of something i do understand she said pertly tell me some news of angels your brother was over there the other day he made himself quite popular with the young ladiesso i hear from mrs selvedge you can tell me as we walk along the bank towards sandys claim its just as well that you should move on now as its your first call and next time you can stop longer she went to the corner of the room removed her smart slippers and put on a pair of walkingshoes tying them with her foot on a chair in a quiet disregard of her visitors presence took a brown holland sunbonnet from the wall clapped it over her browner hair and hanging braids and tied it under her chin with apparently no sense of coquetry in the actbecoming though it wasand without glancing at him alas for madisons ethics the torment of her worldly speech and youthful contempt was nothing to this tacit ignoring of the manhood of her loverthis silent acceptance of him as something even lower than her husband he followed her with a burning cheek and a curious revolting of his whole nature that it is to be feared were scarcely christian the willows opened to let them pass and closed behind them  an hour later mrs mcgee returned to her leafy bower alone she took off her sunbonnet hung it on its nail on the wall shook down her braids took off her shoes stained with the mud of her husbands claim and put on her slippers then she ascended to her eyrie in the little gallery and gazed smilingly across the sunlit bar the two gaunt shadows of her husband and lover linked like twins were slowly passing along the river bank on their way to the eclipsing obscurity of the cottonwoods below heralmost at her very feetthe unconscious arthur wayne was pushing his work on the river bed far out to the promontory the sunlight fell upon his vivid scarlet shirt his bared throat and head clustering with perspiring curls the same sunlight fell upon mrs mcgees brown head too and apparently put a wicked fancy inside it she ran to her bedroom and returned with a mirror from its wall and after some trials in getting the right angle sent a searching reflection upon the spot where arthur was at work  for an instant a diamond flash played around him then he lifted his head and turned it curiously towards the crest above him but the next moment he clapped his hands over his dazzled but now smiling eyes as mrs mcgee secure in her leafy obscurity fell back and laughed to herself like a very schoolgirl  it was three weeks later and madison wayne was again sitting alone in his cabin this solitude had become of more frequent occurrence lately since arthur had revolted and openly absented himself from his religious devotions for lighter diversions of the bar keenly as madison felt his defection he was too much preoccupied with other things to lay much stress upon it and the sting of arthurs relapse to worldliness and folly lay in his own consciousness that it was partly his fault he could not chide his brother when he felt that his own heart was absorbed in his neighbors wife and although he had rigidly adhered to his own crude ideas of selfeffacement and loyalty to mcgee he had been again and again a visitor at his house it was true that mrs mcgee had made this easier by tacitly accepting his conditions of their acquaintanceship by seeming more natural by exhibiting a gayety and at times even a certain gentleness and thoughtfulness of conduct that delighted her husband and astonished her lover whether this wonderful change had really been effected by the latters gloomy theology and still more hopeless ethics he could not say she certainly showed no disposition to imitate their formalities nor seemed to be impressed by them on the rare occasions when he now offered them yet she appeared to link the two men togethereven physicallyas on these occasions when taking an arm of each she walked affectionately between them along the river bank promenade to the great marveling and admiration of the bar it was said however that mr jack hamlin a gambler at that moment professionally visiting waynes bar and a great connoisseur of feminine charms and weaknesses had glanced at them under his handsome lashes and asked a single question evidently so amusing to the younger members of the bar that madison wayne knit his brow and arthur wayne blushed mr hamlin took no heed of the elder brothers frown but paid some slight attention to the color of the younger brother and even more to a slightly coquettish glance from the pretty mrs mcgee whether or notas has been ingeniously alleged by some moraliststhe light and trifling of either sex are prone to recognize each other by some mysterious instinct is not a necessary consideration of this chronicle enough that the fact is recorded  and yet madison wayne should have been satisfied with his work his sacrifice was accepted his happy issue from a dangerous situation and his happy triumph over a more dangerous temptation was complete and perfect and even achieved according to his own gloomy theories of redemption and regeneration yet he was not happy the human heart is at times strangely unappeasable and as he sat that evening in the gathering shadows the book which should have yielded him balm and comfort lay unopened in his lap  a step upon the gravel outside had become too familiar to startle him it was mr mcgee lounging into the cabin like a gaunt shadow it must be admitted that the friendship of these strangely contrasted men however sincere and sympathetic was not cheerful a belief in the thorough wickedness of humanity kept under only through fear of extreme penalty and punishment material and spiritual was not conducive to light and amusing conversation their talk was mainly a gloomy chronicle of life at the bar which was in itself half an indictment tonight mr mcgee spoke of the advent of mr jack hamlin and together they deplored the diversion of the hardearned gains and valuable time of the bar through the efforts of that ingenious gentleman not added mcgee cautiously but what he can shoot straight enough and ive heard tell that he dont lie that mout and it moutnt be good for your brother who goes around with him considerable theres different ways of lookin at that you understand what i mean you follow me for all that the conversation seemed to languish this evening partly through some abstraction on the part of wayne and partly some hesitation in mcgee who appeared to have a greater fear than usual of not expressing himself plainly it was quite dark in the cabin when at last detaching himself from his usual lounging place the doorpost he walked to the window and leaned more shadowy than ever over waynes chair i want to tell you suthin he said slowly that i dont want you to misunderstandyou follow me and that aint no ways carpin or criticisin nor reflectin on youyou understand what i mean ever sens you and me had that talk here about you and safie and ever sens i got the hang of your ways and your style o thinkin ive been as sure of you and her as if id been myself trottin round with you and a revolver and im as sure of you nowyou sabe what i mean you understand youve done me and her a heap o good shes almost another woman sens you took hold of her and ef you ever want me to stand up and testify as you call it in church sandy mcgee is ready what im tryin to say to ye is this tho i understand you and your work and your waystheres other folks ez moutntyou follow you understand what i mean and its just that im coming to now las night when you and safie was meanderin along the lower path by the water and i kem across you  but interrupted madison quickly youre mistaken i wasnt  hol on said mcgee quietly i know you got out o the way without you seein me or me you because you didnt know it was me dont you see dont you follow and thats just it it mout have bin some one from the bar as seed you instead o me see thats why you lit out before i could recognize you and thats why poor safie was so mighty flustered at first and was for runnin away until she kem to herself agin when of course she laughed and agreed you must have mistook me  but gasped madison quickly i wasnt there at all last night  what  the two men had risen simultaneously and were facing each other mcgee with a goodnatured halfcritical expression laid his hand on waynes shoulder and slightly turned him towards the window that he might see his face it seemed to him white and dazed  youwasnt therelast night he repeated with a slow tolerance  scarcely a moment elapsed but the agony of an hour may have thrilled through waynes consciousness before he spoke then all the blood of his body rushed to his face with his first lie as he stammered no yes of course i have made a mistakeit was i  i seeyou thought i was riled said mcgee quietly  no i was thinking it was night before last of course it was last night i must be getting silly he essayed a laughrare at any time with himand so forced now that it affected mcgee more than his embarrassment he looked at wayne thoughtfully and then said slowly i reckon i did come upon you a little too sudden last night but you see i was thinkin of suthin else and disremembered you might be there but i wasnt madno no and i only spoke about it now that you might be more keerful before folks you follow me you understand what i mean  he turned and walked to the door when he halted you follow me dont you it aint no cussedness o mine or want o trustin dont you see mebbe i oughtened have spoken i oughter remembered that times this sort o thing must be rather rough on you and her you follow me you understand what i mean goodnight  he walked slowly down the path towards the river had madison wayne been watching him he would have noticed that his head was bent and his step less free but madison wayne was at that moment sitting rigidly in his chair nursing with all the gloomy concentration of a monastic nature a single terrible suspicion     chapter iv   howbeit the sun shone cheerfully over the bar the next morning and the next the breath of life and activity was in the air the settlement never had been more prosperous and the yield from the opened placers on the drained riverbed that week was enormous the brothers wayne were said to be rolling in gold it was thought to be consistent with madison waynes nature that there was no trace of good fortune in his face or mannerrather that he had become more nervous restless and gloomy this was attributed to the joylessness of avarice as contrasted with the spendthrift gayety of the more liberal arthur and he was feared and respected as a miser his long solitary walks around the promontory his incessant watchfulness his reticence when questioned were all recognized as the indications of a man whose soul was absorbed in moneygetting the reverence they failed to yield to his religious isolation they were willing to freely accord to his financial abstraction but mr mcgee was not so deceived overtaking him one day under the fringe of willows he characteristically chided him with absenting himself from mrs mcgee and her house since their last interview  i reckon you did not harbor malice in your christianity he said but it looks mighty like ez if ye was throwing off on safie and me on account of what i said  in vain madison gloomily and almost sternly protested  mcgee looked him all over with his clear measuring eye and for some minutes was singularly silent at last he said slowly ive been thinkin suthin o goin down to frisco and id be a heap easier in my mind ef youd promise to look arter safie now and then  you surely are not going to leave her here alone said wayne roughly  why not  for an instant wayne hesitated then he burst out for a hundred reasons if she ever wanted your protection before she surely does now do you suppose the bar is any less heathen or more regenerated than it was when you thought it necessary to guard her with your revolver man it is a hundred times worse than then the new claims have filled it with spying adventurerswith wolves like hamlin and his friendsidolaters who would set up baal and ashteroth hereand fill your tents with the curses of sodom  perhaps it was owing to the scriptural phrasing perhaps it was from some unusual authority of the mans manner but a look of approving relief and admiration came into mcgees clear eyes  and youre just the man to tackle em he said clapping his hand on waynes shoulder thats your gaitkeep it up but he added in a lower voice me and my revolver are played out there was a strangeness in the tone that arrested waynes attention yes continued mcgee stroking his beard slowly men like me has their day and revolvers has theirs the world turns round and the bar fills up and this yer river changes its courseand its all in the days work you understand what i meanyou follow me and if anything should happen to menot that its like to but its in the way o meni want you to look arter safie it aint every woman ez has two men ez like and unlike to guard her you follow meyou understand what i mean dont you with these words he parted somewhat abruptly from wayne turning into the steep path to the promontory crest and leaving his companion lost in gloomy abstraction the next day alexander mcgee had departed on a business trip to san francisco  in his present frame of mind with his new responsibility and the carrying out of a plan which he had vaguely conceived might remove the terrible idea that had taken possession of him madison wayne was even relieved when his brother also announced his intention of going to angels for a few days  for since his memorable interview with mcgee he had been convinced that safie had been clandestinely visited by some one whether it was the thoughtless and momentary indiscretion of a willful woman or the sequel to some deliberately planned intrigue did not concern him so much as the falsity of his own position and the conniving lie by which he had saved her and her lover that at this crucial moment he had failed to testify to guilt and wickedness that he firmly believedsuch is the inordinate vanity of the religious zealotthat he had denied him in his effort to shield her and that he had broken faith with the husband who had entrusted to him the custody of his wifes honor seemed to him more terrible than her faithlessness in his first horror he had dreaded to see her lest her very confessionhe knew her reckless frankness towards himselfshould reveal to him the extent of his complicity but since then and during her husbands absence he had convinced himself that it was his duty to wrestle and strive with her weak spirit to implore her to reveal her new intrigue to her husband and then he would help her to sue for his forgiveness it was a part of the inconsistency of his religious convictions in his human passion he was perfectly unselfish and had already forgiven her the offense against himself he would see her at once  but it happened to be a quiet intense night with the tremulous opulence of a full moon that threw quivering shafts of light like summer lightning over the blue river and laid a wonderful carpet of intricate lace along the path that wound through the willows to the crest there was the dry stimulating dust and spice of heated pines from below the languorous odors of syringa the faint feminine smell of southernwood and the infinite mystery of silence this silence was at times softly broken with the tender inarticulate whisper of falling leaves broken sighs from the treetops and the languid stretching of wakened and unclasping boughs madison wayne had not alas taken into account this subtle conspiracy of night and nature and as he climbed higher his steps began to falter with new and strange sensations the rigidity of purpose which had guided the hard religious convictions that always sustained him began to relax a tender sympathy stole over him a loving mercy to himself as well as others stole into his heart he thought of her as she had nestled at his side hand in hand upon the moonlit veranda of her fathers house before his hard convictions had chilled and affrighted her he thought of her fresh simplicity and what had seemed to him her wonderful girlish beauty and lo in a quick turn of the path he stood breathless and tremulous before the house the moonbeams lay tenderly upon the peaceful eaves the long blossoms of the madeira vine seemed sleeping also the pink flush of the cherokee rose in the unreal light had become chastely white  but he was evidently too late for an interview the windows were blank in the white light only oneher bedroomshowed a light behind the lowered muslin blind her draped shadow once or twice passed across it he was turning away with soft steps and even bated breath when suddenly he stopped the exaggerated but unmistakable shadow of a man stood beside her on the blind  with a fierce leap as of a maniac he was at the door pounding rattling and uttering hoarse and furious outcries even through his fury he heard quickened footstepsher light reckless halfhysterical laugha bound upon the staircasethe hurried unbolting and opening of distant doors as the lighter one with which he was struggling at last yielded to his blind rage and threw him crashing into the sittingroom the back door was wide open he could hear the rustling and crackling of twigs and branches in different directions down the hillside where the fugitives had separated as they escaped and yet he stood there for an instant dazed and wondering what next  his eyes fell upon mcgees rifle standing upright in the corner it was a clean beautiful precise weapon even to the unprofessional eye its long laminated hexagonal barrel taking a tenderer blue in the moonlight he snatched it up it was capped and loaded without a pause he dashed down the hill  only one thought was in his mind nowthe crudest simplest duty he was there in mcgees place he should do what mcgee would do god had abandoned him but mcgees rifle remained  in a few minutes downward plunging he had reached the river bank the tranquil silver surface quivered and glittered before him he saw what he knew he would see the black target of a mans head above it making for the bar he took deliberate aim and fired there was no echo to that sharp detonation a distant dog barked there was a slight whisper in the trees beside him that was all but the head of the man was no longer visible and the liquid silver filmed over again without a speck or stain  he shouldered the rifle and with the automatic action of men in great crises returned slowly and deliberately to the house and carefully replaced the rifle in its old position he had no concern for the miserable woman who had fled had she appeared before him at the moment he would not have noticed her yet a strange instinctit seemed to him the vaguest curiositymade him ascend the stairs and enter her chamber the candle was still burning on the table with that awful unconsciousness and simplicity of detail which makes the scene of real tragedy so terrible beside it lay a belt and leather pouch madison wayne suddenly dashed forward and seized it with a wild inarticulate cry staggered fell over the chair rose to his feet blindly groped his way down the staircase burst into the road and hugging the pouch to his bosom fled like a madman down the hill    the body of arthur wayne was picked up two days later a dozen miles down the river nothing could be more evident and prosaic than the manner in which he had met his fate his body was only partly clothed and the money pouch and belt which had been securely locked next his skin after the fashion of all miners was gone he was known to have left the bar with a considerable sum of money he was undoubtedly dogged robbed and murdered during his journey on the river bank by the desperadoes who were beginning to infest the vicinity the grief and agony of his only brother sole survivor of that fraternal and religious partnership so well known to the camp although shown only by a grim and speechless melancholybroken by unintelligible outbursts of religious ravingwas so real that it affected even the callous camp but scarcely had it regained its feverish distraction before it was thrilled by another sensation alexander mcgee had fallen from the deck of a sacramento steamboat in the straits of carquinez and his body had been swept out to sea the news had apparently been first to reach the ears of his devoted wife for when the campat this lapse of the old prohibitionclimbed to her bower with their rude consolations the house was found locked and deserted the fateful influence of the promontory had again prevailed the grim record of its seclusion was once more unbroken  for with it too drooped and faded the fortunes of the bar madison wayne sold out his claim endowed the church at the cross roads with the proceeds and the pulpit with his grim hopeless denunciatory presence the first rains brought a freshet to the bar the river leaped the light barriers that had taken the place of waynes peaceful engines and regained the old channel the curse that the rev madison wayne had launched on this riverside sodom seemed to have been fulfilled but even this brought no satisfaction to the gloomy prophet for it was presently known that he had abandoned his terrorstricken flock to take the circuit as revivalist preacher and campmeeting exhorter in the rudest and most lawless of gatherings desperate ruffians writhed at his feet in impotent terror or more impotent rage murderers and thieves listened to him with blanched faces and set teeth restrained only by a more awful fear over and over again he took his life with his bible into his own hands when he rose above the excited multitude he was shot at he was railridden he was deported but never silenced and so sweeping over the country carrying fear and frenzy with him scouting life and mercy and crushing alike the guilty and innocent he came one sabbath to a rocky crest of the sierrasthe last tattered and frayed and soiled fringe of civilization on the opened tract of a great highway and here he was to testify as was his wont  but not as he expected for as he stood up on a boulder above the thirty or forty men sitting or lying upon other rocks and boulders around him on the craggy mountain shelf where they had gathered a man also rose elbowed past them and with a hurried impulse tried to descend the declivity but a cry was suddenly heard from others quick and clamoring which called the whole assembly to its feet and it was seen that the fugitive had in some blundering way fallen from the precipice  he was brought up cruelly maimed and mangled his ribs crushed and one lung perforated but still breathing and conscious he had asked to see the preacher death impending and even then struggling with his breath made this request imperative madison wayne stopped the service and stalked grimly and inflexibly to where the dying man lay but there he started  mcgee he said breathlessly  send these men away said mcgee faintly ive got suthin to tell you  the men drew back without a word you thought i was dead said mcgee with eyes still undimmed and marvelously clear i orter bin but it dont need no doctor to say it aint far off now i left the bar to get killed i tried to in a row but the fellows were skeert to close with me thinkin id shoot my reputation was agin me there you follow me you understand what i mean  kneeling beside him now and grasping both his hands the changed and horrorstricken wayne gasped but  hold on i jumped off the sacramento boati was goin down the third timethey thought on the boat i was gonethey think so now but a passin fisherman dived for me i grappled himhe was clear grit and would have gone down with me but i couldnt let him die toohavin so to speak no cause you follow meyou understand me i let him save me but it was all the same for when i got to frisco i read as how i was drowned and then i reckoned it was all right and i wandered here where i wasnt knownuntil i saw you  but why should you want to die said wayne almost fiercely what right have you to die while othersdoubledyed and bloodstained are condemned to live testify and suffer  the dying man feebly waved a deprecation with his maimed hand and even smiled faintly i knew youd say that i knew what youd think about it but its all the same now i did it for you and safie i knew i was in the way i knew you was the man she orter had i knew you was the man who had dragged her outer the mire and clay where i was leavin her as you did when she fell in the water i knew that every day i lived i was makin you suffer and breakin her heartfor all she tried to be gentle and gay  great god in heaven will you stop said wayne springing to his feet in agony a frightened lookthe first that any one had ever seen in the clear eyes of the bellringer of angelspassed over them and he murmured tremulously all rightim stoppin  so too was his heart for the wonderful eyes were now slowly glazing yet he rallied once morecoming up again the third time as it seemed to wayneand his lips moved slowly the preacher threw himself despairingly on the ground beside him  speak brother for gods sake speak  it was his last whisperso faint it might have been the first of his freed soul but he only said  yourefollowinme youunderstandwhatimean     johnnyboy   the vast diningroom of the crustacean hotel at greyport u s was empty and desolate it was so early in the morning that there was a bedroom deshabille in the tuckedup skirts and bare legs of the little oval breakfasttables as they had just been left by the dusting servants the most stirring of travelers was yet abed the most enterprising of firsttrain catchers had not yet come down there was a breath of midsummer sleep still in the air through the halfopened windows that seemed to be yawning the pinkish blue atlantic beyond heaved gently and slumberously and drowsy early bathers crept into it as to bed yet as i entered the room i saw that one of the little tables in the corner was in reality occupied by a very small and very extraordinary child seated in a high chair attended by a dreamily abstracted nurse on one side an utterly perfunctory negro waiter on the other and an incongruous assortment of disregarded viands before him he was takingor rather declininghis solitary breakfast he appeared to be a pale frail but rather pretty boy with a singularly pathetic combination of infant delicacy of outline and maturity of expression his heavily fringed eyes expressed an already weary and discontented intelligence and his willful resolute little mouth was i fancied marked with lines of pain at either corner he struck me as not only being physically dyspeptic but as morally loathing his attendants and surroundings  my entrance did not disturb the waiter with whom i had no financial relations he simply concealed an exaggerated yawn professionally behind his napkin until my own servitor should appear the nurse slightly awoke from her abstraction shoved the child mechanicallyas if starting up some clogged machinerysaid eat your breakfast johnnyboy and subsided into her dream i think the child had at first some faint hope of me and when my waiter appeared with my breakfast he betrayed some interest in my selection with a view of possible later appropriation but as my repast was simple that hope died out of his infant mind then there was a silence broken at last by the languid voice of the nurse  try some milk thennice milk  no no mik mik makes me sickmik does  in spite of the hurried infantine accent the protest was so emphatic and above all fraught with such pentup reproach and disgust that i turned about sympathetically but johnnyboy had already thrown down his spoon slipped from his high chair and was marching out of the room as fast as his little sandals would carry him with indignation bristling in every line of the crisp bows of his sash  i however gathered from mr johnson my waiter that the unfortunate child owned a fashionable father and mother one or two blocks of houses in new york and a villa at greyport which he consistently and intelligently despised that he had imperiously brought his parents here on account of his health and had demanded that he should breakfast alone in the big diningroom that however he was not happy nuffin peahs to agree wid him sah but he doan cry and he speaks his mind sah he speaks his mind  unfortunately i did not keep johnnyboys secret but related the scene i had witnessed to some of the lighterhearted crustaceans of either sex with the result that his alliterative protest became a sort of catchword among them and that for the next few mornings he had a large audience of early breakfasters who fondly hoped for a repetition of his performance i think that johnnyboy for the time enjoyed this companionship yet without the least affectation or selfconsciousnessso long as it was unobtrusive it so chanced however that the rev mr belcher a gentleman with bovine lightness of touch and a singular misunderstanding of childhood chose to presume upon his paternal functions approaching the high chair in which johnnyboy was dyspeptically reflecting with a ponderous wink at the other guests and a fat thumb and forefinger on johnnyboys table he leaned over him and with slow elephantine playfulness said  and so my dear young friend i understand that mik makes you sickmik does  anything approaching to the absolute likeness of this imitation of johnnyboys accents it is impossible to conceive possibly johnnyboy felt it but he simply lifted his lovely lashes and said with great distinctness  mik dontyou devil  after this closely as it had knitted us together johnnyboys morning presence was mysteriously withdrawn it was later pointed out to us by mr belcher upon the veranda that although wealth had its privileges it was held in trust for the welfare of mankind and that the children of the rich could not too early learn the advantages of selfrestraint and the vanity of a mere gratification of the senses early and frequent morning ablutions brisk morning toweling half of a graham biscuit in a teacup of milk exercise with the dumbbells and a little roughandtumble play in a straw hat check apron and overalls would eventually improve that stamina necessary for his future position and repress a dangerous cerebral activity and tendency to give way tohe suddenly stopped coughed and absolutely looked embarrassed johnnyboy a moving cloud of white pique silk and embroidery had just turned the corner of the veranda he did not speak but as he passed raised his blueveined lids to the orator the look of ineffable scorn and superiority in those beautiful eyes surpassed anything i had ever seen at the next veranda column he paused and with his baby thumbs inserted in his silk sash again regarded him under his halfdropped lashes as if he were some curious animal and then passed on but belcher was silenced for the second time  i think i have said enough to show that johnnyboy was hopelessly worshiped by an impressible and illogical sex i say hopelessly for he slipped equally from the proudest silken lap and the humblest one of calico and carried his eyelashes and small aches elsewhere i think that a secret fear of his alarming frankness and his steady rejection of the various tempting cates they offered him had much to do with their passion it wont hurt you dear said miss circe and its so awfully nice see she continued putting one of the delicacies in her own pretty mouth with every assumption of delight its so good johnnyboy rested his elbows on her knees and watched her with a grieved and commiserating superiority bimeby youll have pains in youse tommick and youll be tookt to bed he said sadly and then youllhave to dit up andbut as it was found necessary here to repress further details he escaped other temptation  two hours later as miss circe was seated in the drawingroom with her usual circle of enthusiastic admirers around her johnnyboywho was issued from his room for circulation two or three times a day as a genteel advertisement of his parentsfloated into the apartment in a new dress and a serious demeanor sidling up to miss circe he laid a phialevidently his own pet medicineon her lap said for youse tommikake tonight and vanished yet i have reason to believe that this slight evidence of unusual remembrance on johnnyboys part more than compensated for its publicity and for a few days miss circe was quite set up by it  it was through some sympathy of this kind that i first gained johnnyboys good graces i had been presented with a small pocket case of homoeopathic medicines and one day on the beach i took out one of the tiny phials and dropping two or three of the still tinier pellets in my hand swallowed them to my embarrassment a small hand presently grasped my trouserleg i looked down it was johnnyboy in a new and ravishing smuggler suit with his questioning eyes fixed on mine  howjer do dat  eh  wajer do dat for  thatoh thats medicine ive got a headache  he searched the inmost depths of my soul with his wonderful eyes then after a pause he held out his baby palm  you kin give johnny some  but you havent got headachehave you  me alluz has  not always  he nodded his head rapidly then added slowly and with great elaboration et monins et affernoons et nights nd monins adain n et becker i e breakfast  there was no doubt it was the truth those eyes did not seem to be in the habit of lying after all the medicine could not hurt him his nurse was at a little distance gazing absently at the sea i sat down on a bench and dropped a few of the pellets into his palm he ate them seriously and then turned around and backedafter the wellknown appealing fashion of childhoodagainst my knees i understood the movementalthough it was unlike my idea of johnnyboy however i raised him to my lapwith the sensation of lifting a dozen laceedged handkerchiefs and with very little more effortwhere he sat silently for a moment with his sandals crossed pensively before him  wouldnt you like to go and play with those children i asked pointing to a group of noisy sand levelers not far away  no after a pause you wouldnt neither  why  hediks  but i said perhaps if you went and played with them and ran up and down as they do you wouldnt have headache  johnnyboy did not answer for a moment then there was a perceptible gentle movement of his small frame i confess i felt brutally like belcher he was getting down  once down he faced me lifted his frank eyes said do way and play den smoothed down his smuggler frock and rejoined his nurse  but although johnnyboy afterwards forgave my moral defection he did not seem to have forgotten my practical medical ministration and our brief interview had a surprising result from that moment he confounded his parents and doctors by resolutely and positively refusing to take any more of their pills tonics or drops whether from a sense of loyalty to me or whether he was not yet convinced of the efficacy of homoeopathy he did not suggest a substitute declare his preferences or even give his reasons but firmly and peremptorily declined his present treatment and to everybodys astonishment he did not seem a bit the worse for it  still he was not strong and his continual aversion to childish sports and youthful exercise provoked the easy criticism of that large part of humanity who are ready to confound cause and effect and such brief moments as the sluysdaels could spare him from their fashionable duties were made miserable to them by gratuitous suggestions and plans for their childs improvement it was noticeable however that few of them were ever offered to johnnyboy personally he had a singularly direct way of dealing with them and a precision of statement that was embarrassing  one afternoon jack bracy drove up to the veranda of the crustacean with a smart buggy and spirited thoroughbred for miss circes especial driving and his own saddlehorse on which he was to accompany her jack had dismounted a groom held his saddlehorse until the young lady should appear and he himself stood at the head of the thoroughbred as johnnyboy leaning against the railing was regarding the turnout with illconcealed disdain jack in the pride of his triumph over his rivals goodhumoredly offered to put him in the buggy and allow him to take the reins johnnyboy did not reply  come along continued jack it will do you a heap of good its better than lazing there like a girl rouse up old man  me dont like that geegee said johnnyboy calmly hes a silly fool  youre afraid said jack  johnnyboy lifted his proud lashes and toddled to the steps jack received him in his arms swung him into the seat and placed the slim yellow reins in his baby hands  now you feel like a man and not like a girl said jack eh what oh i beg your pardon  for miss circe had appearedhad absolutely been obliged to wait a whole halfminute unobservedand now stood there a dazzling but pouting apparition in eagerly turning to receive her jacks foot slipped on the step and he fell the thoroughbred started gave a sickening plunge forward and was off but so too was jack the next moment on his own horse and before miss circes screams had died away  for two blocks on ocean avenue passersby that afternoon saw a strange vision a galloping horse careering before a light buggy in which a small child seated upright was grasping the tightened reins but so erect and composed was the little face and figurealbeit as white as its own frockthat for an instant they did not grasp its awful significance those further along however read the whole awful story in the drawn face and blazing eyes of jack bracy as he at last swung into the avenue for jack had the brains as well as the nerve of your true hero and knowing the dangerous stimulus of a stern chase to a frightened horse had kept a side road until it branched into the avenue so furious had been his pace and so correct his calculation that he ranged alongside of the runaway even as it passed grasped the reins and in half a block pulled up on even wheels  i never saw such pluck in a mite like that he whispered afterwards to his anxious auditory he never dropped those ribbons by g until i got alongside and then he just hopped down and said as short and cool as you please dank you  me didnt uttered a small voice reproachfully  didnt you dear what did you say then darling exclaimed a sympathizing chorus  me said damn you me dont like silly fool geegees silly fool geegees make me sicksilly fool geegees do  nevertheless in spite of this incident the attempts at johnnyboys physical reformation still went on more than that it was argued by some complacent casuists that the pluck displayed by the child was the actual result of this somewhat heroic method of taking exercise and not an inherent manliness distinct from his physical tastes so he was made to run when he didnt want toto dance when he frankly loathed his partnersto play at games that he despised his books and pictures were taken away he was hurried past hoardings and theatrical posters that engaged his fancy the public was warned against telling him fairy tales except those constructed on strictly hygienic principles his fastidious cleanliness was rebuked and his best frocks taken awayalbeit at a terrible sacrifice of his parents vanityto suit the theories of his critics how long this might have continued is not knownfor the theory and practice were suddenly arrested by another sensation  one morning a childrens picnic party was given on a rocky point only accessible at certain states of the tide whither they were taken in a small boat under the charge of a few hotel servants and possibly as part of his heroic treatment johnnyboy who was included in the party was not allowed to be attended by his regular nurse  whether this circumstance added to his general disgust of the whole affair and his unwillingness to go i cannot say but it is to be regretted since the omission deprived johnnyboy of any impartial witness to what subsequently occurred that he was somewhat roughly handled by several of the larger children appeared to be beyond doubt although there was conflicting evidence as to the sequel enough that at noon screams were heard in the direction of certain detached rocks on the point and the whole party proceeding thither found three of the larger boys on the rocks alone and cut off by the tide having been left there as they alleged by johnnyboy who had run away with the boat they subsequently admitted that they had first taken the boat and brought johnnyboy with them just to frighten him but they adhered to the rest and certainly johnnyboy and the boat were nowhere to be found the shore was communicated with the alarm was given the telegraph up and down the coast trilled with excitement other boats were mannedconsternation prevailed  but that afternoon the captain of the saucy jane mackerel fisher lying off the point perceived a derelict whitehall boat drifting lazily towards the gulf stream on boarding it he was chagrined to find the expected flotsam already in the possession of a very small child who received him with a scornful reticence as regarded himself and his intentions and some objurgation of a person or persons unknown it was johnnyboy but whether he had attempted the destruction of the three other boys by marooning them upon the rocksas their parents firmly believedor whether he had himself withdrawn from their company simply because he did not like them was never known any further attempt to improve his education by the roughing gregarious process was however abandoned the very critics who had counseled it now clamored for restraint and perfect isolation it was ably pointed out by the rev mr belcher that the autocratic habits begotten by wealth and pampering should be restricted and all intercourse with their possessor promptly withheld  but the season presently passed with much of this and other criticism and the sluysdaels passed too carrying johnnyboy and his small aches and long eyelashes beyond these crustacean voices where it was to be hoped there was peace i did not hear of him again for five years and then oddly enough from the lips of mr belcher on the deck of a transatlantic steamer as he was being wafted to europe for his recreation by the prayers and purses of a grateful and enduring flock master john jacob astor sluysdael said mr belcher speaking slowly with great precision of retrospect was taken from his private governessi may say by my adviceand sent to an admirable school in new york fashioned upon the english system of eton and harrow and conducted by english masters from oxford and cambridge herei may also say at my suggestionhe was subjected to the wholesome discipline equally of his schoolmates and his masters in fact sir as you are probably aware the most perfect democracy that we have yet known in which the mere accidents of wealth position luxury effeminacy physical degeneration and overcivilized stimulation are not recognized he was put into compulsory cricket football and rounders as an undersized boy he was subjected to that ingenious preparation for future mastership by the pupillary state of servitude known i think as fagging his physical inertia was stimulated and quickened and his intellectual precocity repressed from time to time by the exuberant playfulness of his fellowstudents which occasionally took the form of forced ablutions and corporal discomfort and was called i am told hazing it is but fair to state that our young friend had some singular mental endowments which however were promptly checked to repress the vanity and presumption that would follow the rev mr belcher paused closed his eyes resignedly and added of course you know the rest  indeed i do not i said anxiously  a most deplorable affairindeed a most shocking incident it was hushed up i believe on account of the position of his parents he glanced furtively around and in a lower and more impressive voice said i am not myself a believer in heredity and i am not personally aware that there was a murderer among the sluysdael ancestry but it seems that this monstrous child in some clandestine way possessed himself of a huge bowieknife sir and on one of those occasions actually rushed furiously at the larger boyshis innocent playfellowsand absolutely forced them to flee in fear of their lives more than that sir a loaded revolver was found in his desk and he boldly and shamelessly avowed his intention to eviscerate orto use his own revolting languageto cut the heart out of the first one who again laid a finger on him he paused again and joining his two hands together with the fingers pointing to the deck breathed hard and said his instantaneous withdrawal from the school was a matter of public necessity he was afterwards taken in the charge of a private tutor to europe where i trust we shall not meet  i could not resist saying cheerfully that at least johnnyboy had for a short time made it lively for the big boys  the rev mr belcher rose slowly but painfully said with a deeply grieved expression i dont think that i entirely follow you and moved gently away  the changes of youth are apt to be more bewildering than those of age and a decade scarcely perceptible in an old civilization often means utter revolution to the new it did not seem strange to me therefore on meeting jack bracy twelve years after to find that he had forgotten miss circe or that she had married and was living unhappily with a middleaged adventurer by the name of jason who was reputed to have had domestic relations elsewhere but although subjugated and exorcised she at least was reminiscent to my inquiries about the sluysdaels she answered with a slight return of her old vivacity  ah yes dear fellow he was one of my greatest admirers  he was about four years old when you knew him wasnt he suggested jason meanly yes they usually were young but so kind of you to recollect them young sluysdael he continued turning to me isbut of course you know that disgraceful story  i felt that i could stand this no longer yes i said indignantly i know all about the school and i dont call his conduct disgraceful either  jason stared i dont know what you mean about the school he returned i am speaking of his stepfather  his stepfather  yes his father van buren sluysdael died you knowa year after they left greyport the widow was left all the money in trust for johnny except about twentyfive hundred a year which he was in receipt of as a separate income even as a boy well a glibtongued parson a fellow by the name of belcher got round the widowshe was a desperate fooland by jove made her marry him he made ducks and drakes of not only her money but johnnys too and had to skip to spain to avoid the trustees and johnnyfor the sluysdaels are all fools or lunaticsmade over his whole separate income to that wretched fashionable fool of a mother and went into a stockbrokers office as a clerk  and walks to business before eight every morning and they say even takes down the shutters and sweeps out broke in circe impulsively works like a slave all day wears out his old clothes has given up his clubs and amusements and shuns society  but how about his health i asked is he better and stronger  i dont know said circe but he looks as beautiful as endymion    at his bank in wall street bracy that afternoon confirmed all that jason had told me of young sluysdael but his temper i asked you remember his tempersurely  hes as sweet as a lamb never quarrels never whines never alludes to his lost fortune and is never put out for a youngster hes the most popular man in the street shall we nip round and see him  by all means  come it isnt far  a few steps down the crowded street we dived into a den of plateglass windows of scraps of paper of rattling ticking machines more voluble and excited than the careworn abstracted men who leaned over them but johnnyboyi started at the familiar name againwas not there he was at luncheon  let us join him i said as we gained the street again and turned mechanically into delmonicos  not there said bracy with a laugh you forget thats not johnnyboys gait just now come here he was descending a few steps that led to a humble cakeshop as we entered i noticed a young fellow standing before the plain wooden counter with a cake of gingerbread in one hand and a glass of milk in the other his profile was before me i at once recognized the long lashes but the happy boyish careless laugh that greeted bracy as he presented me was a revelation  yet he was pleased to remember me and thenit may have been embarrassment that led me to such tactlessness but as i glanced at him and the glass of milk he was holding i could not help reminding him of the first words i had ever heard him utter  he tossed off the glass colored slightly as i thought and said with a light laugh  i suppose i have changed a good deal since then sir  i looked at his demure and resolute mouth and wondered if he had     young robin gray   the good american barque skyscraper was swinging at her moorings in the clyde off bannock ready for sea but that good american barquealthough owned in baltimorehad not a plank of american timber in her hulk nor a native american in her crew and even her nautical goodness had been called into serious question by divers of that crew during her voyage and answered more or less inconclusively with belayingpins marlinspikes and ropes ends at the hands of an irishamerican captain and a dutch and danish mate so much so that the mysterious powers of the american consul at st kentigern had been evoked to punish mutiny on the one hand and battery and starvation on the other both equally attested by manifestly false witness and subornation on each side in the exercise of his functions the consul had opened and shut some jail doors and otherwise effected the usual sullen and deceitful compromise and his flag was now flying on a final visit from the stern sheets of a smart boat alongside it was with a feeling of relief at the end of the interview that he at last lifted his head above an atmosphere of perjury and bilgewater and came on deck the sun and wind were ruffling and glinting on the broadening river beyond the measured mile a few gulls were wavering and dipping near the lee scuppers and the sound of sabbath bells mellowed by a distance that secured immunity of conscience came peacefully to his ear  now that jobs over yell be takin a partin dhrink suggested the captain  the consul thought not certain incidents of the job were fresh in his memory and he proposed to limit himself to his strict duty  you have some passengers i see he said pointing to a group of two men and a young girl who had apparently just come aboard  only wan an engineer going out to rio thems just his friends seein him off im thinkin returned the captain surveying them somewhat contemptuously  the consul was a little disturbed he wondered if the passenger knew anything of the quality and reputation of the ship to which he was entrusting his fortunes but he was only a passenger and the consuls functionslike those of the aloftsitting cherub of nautical songwere restricted exclusively to looking after poor jack however he asked a few further questions eliciting the fact that the stranger had already visited the ship with letters from the eminently respectable consignees at st kentigern and contented himself with lingering near them the young girl was accompanied by her father a respectably rigidlooking middleclass tradesman who however seemed to be more interested in the novelty of his surroundings than in the movements of his daughter and their departing friend so it chanced that the consul reentered the cabinostensibly in search of a missing glove but really with the intention of seeing how the passenger was bestowedjust behind them but to his great embarrassment he at once perceived that owing to the obscurity of the apartment they had not noticed him and before he could withdraw the man had passed his arm around the young girls half stiffened yet half yielding figure  only one ailsa he pleaded in a slow serious voice pathetic from the very absence of any youthful passion in it just one now itll be gey lang before we meet again yell not refuse me now  the young girls lips seemed to murmur some protest that however was lost in the beginning of a long and silent kiss  the consul slipped out softly his smile had died away that unlookedfor touch of human weakness seemed to purify the stuffy and evilreeking cabin and the recollection of its brutal past to drop with a deckload of iniquity behind him to the bottom of the clyde it is to be feared that in his unofficial moments he was inclined to be sentimental and it seemed to him that the good ship skyscraper henceforward carried an innocent freight not mentioned in her manifest and that a gentle eversmiling figure not entered on her books had invisibly taken a place at her wheel  but he was recalled to himself by a slight altercation on deck the young girl and the passenger had just returned from the cabin the consul after a discreetly careless pause had lifted his eyes to the young girls face and saw that it was singularly pretty in color and outline but perfectly selfcomposed and serenely unconscious and he was a little troubled to observe that the passenger was a middleaged man whose hard features were already considerably worn with trial and experience  both he and the girl were listening with sympathizing but cautious interest to her fathers contention with the boatman who had brought them from shore and who was now inclined to demand an extra fee for returning with them the boatman alleged that he had been detained beyond kirk time and that this imperiling of his salvation could only be compensated by another shilling to the consuls surprise this extraordinary argument was recognized by the father who however contented himself by simply contending that it had not been stipulated in the bargain the issue was therefore limited and the discussion progressed slowly and deliberately with a certain calm dignity and argumentative satisfaction on both sides that exalted the subject though it irritated the captain  if ye accept the premisses that ive just laid down that its a contractbegan the boatman  dry up and haul off said the captain  one moment interposed the consul with a rapid glance at the slight trouble in the young girls face turning to the father he went on will you allow me to offer you and your daughter a seat in my boat  it was an unlookedfor and tempting proposal the boatman was lazily lying on his oars secure in selfrighteousness and the conscious possession of the only available boat to shore on the other hand the smart gig of the consul with its four oars was not only a providential escape from a difficulty but even to some extent a quasiofficial endorsement of his contention yet he hesitated  itll be costin ye no more he said interrogatively glancing at the consuls boat crew or yell be askin me a fair proportion  it will be the gentlemans own boat said the girl with a certain shy assurance and hell be paying his boatmen by the day  the consul hastened to explain that their passage would involve no additional expense to anybody and added tactfully that he was glad to enable them to oppose extortion  ay but its a preencipel said the father proudly and im pleased sir to see ye recognize it  he proceeded to help his daughter into the boat without any further leavetaking of the passenger to the consuls great surprise and with only a parting nod from the young girl it was as if this momentous incident were a sufficient reason for the absence of any further trivial sentiment  unfortunately the father chose to add an exordium for the benefit of the astonished boatsman still lying on his oars  let this be a lesson to ye ma frien when yere ower sure yell neer say a herrin is dry until it be reestit an reekit  ay said the boatman with a lazy significant glance at the consul it wull be a lesson to me not to trust to a lassies gangin jo when thairs anither yin comin  give way said the consul sharply  yet his was the only irritated face in the boat as the men bent over their oars the young girl and her father looked placidly at the receding ship and waved their hands to the grave resigned face over the taffrail the consul examined them more attentively the fathers face showed intelligence and a certain probity in its otherwise commonplace features the young girl had more distinction with perhaps more delicacy of outline than of texture her hair was dark with a burnished copper tint at its roots and eyes that had the same burnished metallic lustre in their brown pupils both sat respectfully erect as if anxious to record the fact that the boat was not their own to take their ease in and both were silently reserved answering briefly to the consuls remarks as if to indicate the formality of their presence there but a distant railway whistle startled them into emotion  weve lost the train father said the young girl  the consul followed the direction of her anxious eyes the train was just quitting the station at bannock  if ye had not lingered below with jamie wed have been away in time ay and in our own boat said the father with marked severity  the consul glanced quickly at the girl but her face betrayed no consciousness except of their present disappointment  theres an excursion boat coming round the point he said pointing to the black smoke trail of a steamer at the entrance of a loch and it will be returning to st kentigern shortly if you like well pull over and put you aboard  eh but its the sabbathbreaker said the old man harshly  the consul suddenly remembered that that was the name which the righteous st kentigerners had given to the solitary bold bad pleasureboat that defied their sabbatical observances  perhaps you wont find very pleasant company on board said the consul smiling but then youre not seeking that and as you would be only using the boat to get back to your home and not for sunday recreation i dont think your conscience should trouble you  ay thats a fine argument mr consul but im thinkin its none the less sopheestry for a that said the father grimly no if yell just land us yonder at bannock pier well be ay thankin ye the same  but what will you do there theres no other train today  ay well walk on a bit  the consul was silent after a pause the young girl lifted her clear eyes and with a half pathetic half childish politeness said well be doing very wellmy father and me youre far too kind  nothing further was said as they began to thread their way between a few large ships and an ocean steamer at anchor from whose decks a few sundayclothed mariners gazed down admiringly on the smart gig and the pretty girl in a tam o shanter in its stern sheets but here a new idea struck the consul a cables length ahead lay a yacht owned by an american friend and at her stern a steam launch swung to its painter without intimating his intention to his passengers he steered for it bowway enough he called out as the boat glided under the yachts counter and grasping the companionladder ropes he leaped aboard in a few hurried words he explained the situation to mr robert gray her owner and suggested that he should send the belated passengers to st kentigern by the launch gray assented with the easy goodnature of youth wealth and indolence and lounged from his cabin to the side the consul followed looking down upon the boat he could not help observing that his fair young passenger sitting in her demure stillness at her fathers side made a very pretty picture it was possible that bob gray had made the same observation for he presently swung himself over the gangway into the gig hat in hand the launch could easily take them in fact he added unblushingly it was even then getting up steam to go to st kentigern would they kindly come on board until it was ready at an added word or two of explanation from the consul the father accepted preserving the same formal pride and stiffness and the transfer was made the consul looking back as his gig swept round again towards bannock pier received their parting salutations and the first smile he had seen on the face of his grave little passenger he thought it very sweet and sad  he did not return to the consulate at st kentigern until the next day but he was somewhat surprised to find mr robert gray awaiting him and upon some business which the young millionaire could have easily deputed to his captain or steward as he still lingered the consul pleasantly referred to his generosity on the previous day and hoped the passengers had given him no trouble  no said gray with a slight simulation of carelessness in fact i came up with them myself i had nothing to do it was sunday you know  the consul lifted his eyebrows slightly  yes i saw them home continued gray lightly in one of those bystreets not far from here neatlooking house outside inside corkscrew stone staircase like a lighthouse fourth floor no lift but she circled up like a swallow flatsittingroom two bedrooms and a kitchenmighty snug and shipshape and pretty as a pink they own it toofancy owning part of a house seems to be a way they have here in st kentigern he paused and then added stayed there to a kind of high tea  indeed said the consul  why not the old man wanted to return my hospitality and square the account he wasnt going to lie under any obligation to a stranger and by jove he made it a special point of honor a spanish grandee couldnt have been more punctilious and with an accent jerusalem like a northeaster off the banks but the feed was in good taste and he only a mathematical instrument maker on about twelve hundred dollars a year  you seem to know all about him said the consul smilingly  not so much as he does about me returned gray with a half perplexed face for he saw enough to admonish me about my extravagance and even to intimate that that rascal saunderson my steward was imposing on me she took me to task too for not laying the yacht up on sunday that the men could go to kirk and for swearing at a bargeman who ran across our bows its their perfect simplicity and sincerity in all this that gets me youd have thought that the old man was my guardian and the daughter my aunt after a pause he uttered a reminiscent laugh she thought we ate and drank too much on the yacht and wondered what we could find to do all day all this you know in the gentlest caressing sort of voice as if she was really concerned like ones own sister well not exactly like minehe interrupted himself grimlybut hang it all you know what i mean you know that our girls over there havent got that trick of voice too much selfassertion i reckon things made too easy for them by us men habit of race i dare say he laughed a little why i mislaid my glove when i was coming away and it was as good as a play to hear her commiserating and sympathizing and hunting for it as if it were a lost baby  but youve seen scotch girls before this said the consul there were lady glairns daughters whom you took on a cruise  yes but the swell scotch all imitate the english as everybody else does for the matter of that our girls included and theyre all alike society makes em fit in together like tongued and grooved planks that will take any amount of holystoning and polish its like dropping into a dead calm with every rope and spar that you know already reflected back from the smooth water upon you its mighty pretty but it isnt getting on you know after a pause he added i asked them to take a little holiday cruise with me  and they declined interrupted the consul  gray glanced at him quickly  well yes thats all right enough they dont know me you see but they do know you and the fact is i was thinking that as youre our consul here dont you see and sort of responsible for me you might say that it was all right you know quite the customary thing with us over there and you might say generally who i am  i see said the consul deliberately tell them youre bob gray with more money and time than you know what to do with that you have a fine taste for yachting and shooting and racing and amusing yourself generally that you find that they amuse you and you would like your luxury and your dollars to stand as an equivalent to their independence and originality that being a good republican yourself and recognizing no distinction of class you dont care what this may mean to them who are brought up differently that after their cruise with you you dont care what life what friends or what jealousies they return to that you know no ties no responsibilities beyond the present and that you are not a marrying man  look here i say arent you making a little too much of this said gray stiffly  the consul laughed i should be glad to know that i am  gray rose well be dropping down the river tomorrow he said with a return of his usual lightness and i reckon ill be toddling down to the wharf goodbye if i dont see you again  he passed out as the consul glanced from the window he observed however that mr gray was toddling in quite another direction than the wharf for an instant he half regretted that he had not suggested in some discreet way the conclusion he had arrived at after witnessing the girls parting with the middleaged passenger the day before but he reflected that this was something he had only accidentally overseen and was the girls own secret   ii   when the summer had so waxed in its fullness that the smoke of factory chimneys drifted high permitting glimpses of fairly blue sky when the grass in st kentigerns proudest park took on a less sober green in the comfortable sun and even in the thickest shade there was no chilliness the good st kentigerners recognized that the season had arrived to go down the river and that it was time for them to betake themselves with rugs mackintoshes and umbrellas to the breezy lochs and misty hillsides for which the neighborhood of st kentigern is justly famous so when it came to pass that the blinds were down in the highest places and the most exclusive pavements of st kentigern were echoless and desolate the consul heroically tore himself from the weak delight of basking in the sunshine and followed the others  he soon found himself settled at the furthest end of a long narrow loch made longer and narrower by the steep hillside of rock and heather which flanked its chilly surface on either side and whose inequalities were lost in the firs and larches that filled ravine and chasm the fragrant road which ran sinuously through their shadowy depths was invisible from the loch no protuberance broke the seemingly sheer declivity the even skyline was indented in two placesone where it was cracked into a fanciful resemblance to a human profile the other where it was curved like a bowl need it be said that one was distinctly recognized as the silhouette of a prehistoric giant and that the other was his drinkingcup need it be added that neither lent the slightest human suggestion to the solitude a toylike pier extending into the loch midway from the barren shore only heightened the desolation and when the little steamboat that occasionally entered the loch took away a solitary passenger from the pierhead the simplest parting was invested with a dreary loneliness that might have brought tears to the most hardened eye  still when the shadow of either hillside was not reaching across the loch the meridian sun chancing upon this coy mirror made the most of it then it was that seen from above it flashed like a falchion lying between the hills then its reflected glory striking up transfigured the two acclivities tipped the cold heather with fire gladdened the funereal pines and warmed the ascetic rocks and it was in one of those rare passionate intervals that the consul riding along the wooded track and turning his eyes from their splendors came upon a little house  it had once been a sturdy cottage with a grim endurance and inflexibility which even some later and lighter additions had softened rather than changed on either side of the door against the bleak whitewashed wall two tall fuchsias relieved the rigid blankness with a show of color the windows were prettily draped with curtains caught up with gay ribbons in a stony poundlike enclosure there was some attempt at floral cultivation but all quite recent so too were a wicker garden seat a bright japanese umbrella and a tropical hammock suspended between two arcticlooking bushes which the rude and rigid forefathers of the hamlet would have probably resented  he had just passed the house when a charming figure slipped across the road before him to his surprise it was the young girl he had met a few months before on the skyscraper but the tam o shanter was replaced by a little straw hat and a light dress summery in color and texture but more in keeping with her rustic surroundings seemed as grateful and rare as the sunshine without knowing why he had an impression that it was of her own makinga gentle plagiarism of the style of her more fortunate sisters but with a demure restraint all her own as she recognized him a faint color came to her cheek partly from surprise partly from some association to his delighted greeting she responded by informing him that her father had taken the cottage he had just passed where they were spending a three weeks vacation from his business it was not so far from st kentigern but that he could run up for a day to look after the shop did the consul not think it was wise  quite ready to assent to any sagacity in those clear brown eyes the consul thought it was but was it not like wisdom sometimes lonely  ah no there was the loch and the hills and the heather there were her flowers did he not think they were growing well and at the head of the loch there was the old tomb of the mchulishes and some of the coffins were still to be seen  perhaps emboldened by the consuls smile she added with a more serious precision which was however lost in the sympathizing caress of her voice and would you not be getting off and coming in and resting a wee bit before you go further it would be so good of you and father would think it so kind and he will be there now if youre looking  the consul looked the old man was standing in the doorway of the cottage as respectably uncompromising as ever with the slight concession to his rural surroundings of wearing a tam o shanter and easy slippers the consul dismounted and entered the interior was simply but tastefully furnished it struck him that the scotch prudence and economy which practically excluded display and meretricious glitter had reached the simplicity of the truest art and the most refined wealth he felt he could understand grays enthusiasm and by an odd association of ideas he found himself thinking of the resigned face of the lonely passenger on the skyscraper  have you heard any news of your friend who went to rio he asked pleasantly but without addressing himself particularly to either  there was a perceptible pause doubtless of deference to her father on the part of the young girl and of the usual native conscientious caution on the part of the father but neither betrayed any embarrassment or emotion no he would not be writing yet she at length said simply he would be waiting until he was settled to his business jamie would be waiting until he could say how he was doing father she appealed interrogatively to the old man  ay james gow would not fash himself to write compliments and gossip till he knew his position and work corroborated the old man hell not be going two thousand miles to send us what we can read in the st kentigern herald but he added suddenly with a recall of cautiousness perhaps you will be hearing of the ship  the consul will not be remembering what he hears of all the ships interposed the young girl with the same gentle affectation of superior worldly knowledge which had before amused him well be wearying him father and the subject dropped  the consul glancing around the room again but always returning to the sweet and patient seriousness of the young girls face and the grave decorum of her father would have liked to ask another question but it was presently anticipated for when he had exhausted the current topics in which both father and daughter displayed a quiet sagacity and he had gathered a sufficient knowledge of their character to seem to justify grays enthusiasm and was rising to take his leave the young girl said timidly  would ye not let bessie take your horse to the grass field over yonder and yourself stay with us to dinner it would be most kind and you would meet a great friend of yours who will be here  mr gray suggested the consul audaciously yet he was greatly surprised when the young girl said quietly ay  hell be coming in the loch with his yacht said the old man its not so expensive lying here as at bannock im thinking and the men cannot gang ashore for drink eh but its an awful waste o pounds shillings and pence keeping these gowks in idleness with no feeshin nor carrying of passengers  ay but its better mr gray should pay them for being decent and wellbehaved on board his ship than that they should be out of work and rioting in taverns and lodginghouses and you yourself father remember the herrin fishers that come ashore at ardie and the deck hands of the excursion boat and the language theyll be using  have you had a cruise in the yacht asked the consul quickly  ay said the father we have been up and down the loch and around the far point but not for boardin or lodgin the night nor otherwise conteenuing or parteecipating i have explained to mr gray that we must return to our own home and our own porridge at evening and he has agreed and even come with us hes a decent enough lad and not above instructin but extraordinar extravagant  ye know father interposed the young girl he talks of fitting up the yacht for the fishing and taking some of his most decent men on shares he says he was very fond of fishing off the massachusetts coast in america it will be im thinking she said suddenly turning to the consul with an almost pathetic appeal in her voice a great occupation for the rich young men over there  the consul desperately struggling with a fanciful picture of mr robert gray as a herring fisher thought gravely that it might be but he thought still more gravely though silently of this singular companion ship and was somewhat anxious to confront his friend with his new acquaintances he had not long to wait the sun was just dipping behind the hill when the yacht glided into the lonely loch a boat was put off and in a few moments robert gray was climbing the little path from the loch  had the consul expected any embarrassment or loverlike consciousness on the face of mr gray at their unexpected meeting he would have been disappointed nor was the young mans greeting of father and daughter whom he addressed as mr and miss callender marked by any tenderness or hesitation on the contrary a certain seriousness and quiet reticence unlike gray which might have been borrowed from his new friends characterized his speech and demeanor beyond this freemasonry of sad repression there was no significance of look or word passed between these two young people the girls voice retained its even pathos grays grave politeness was equally divided between her and her father he corroborated what callender had said of his previous visits without affectation or demonstration he spoke of the possibilities of his fitting up the yacht for the fishing season with a practical detail and economy that left the consuls raillery ineffective even when after dinner the consul purposely walked out in the garden with the father gray and ailsa presently followed them without lingering or undue precipitation and with no change of voice or manner the consul was perplexed had the girl already told gray of her lover across the sea and was this singular restraint their joint acceptance of their fate or was he mistaken in supposing that their relations were anything more than the simple friendship of patron and protegee gray was rich enough to indulge in such a fancy and the father and daughter were too proud to ever allow it to influence their own independence in any event the consuls right to divulge the secret he was accidentally possessed of seemed more questionable than ever nor did there appear to be any opportunity for a confidential talk with gray since it was proposed that the whole party should return to the yacht for supper after which the consul should be dropped at the pierhead distant only a few minutes from his hotel and his horse sent to him the next day  a faint moon was shimmering along the surface of loch dour in icy little ripples when they pulled out from the shadows of the hillside by the accident of position gray who was steering sat beside ailsa in the stern while the consul and mr callender were further forward although within hearing the faces of the young people were turned towards each other yet in the cold moonlight the consul fancied they looked as impassive and unemotional as statues the few distant farspaced lights that trembled on the fading shore the lonely glitter of the water the blackness of the pineclad ravines seemed to be a part of this repression until the vast melancholy of the lake appeared to meet and overflow them like an advancing tide added to this there came from time to time the faint sound and smell of the distant desolate sea  the consul struggling manfully to keep up a spasmodic discussion on scotch diminutives in names found himself mechanically saying  and james you call jamie  ay but ye would say to be pure scotch hamish said mr callender precisely the girl however had not spoken but gray turned to her with something of his old gayety  and i suppose you would call me robbie  ah no  what then  robin  her voice was low yet distinct but she had thrown into the two syllables such infinite tenderness that the consul was for an instant struck with an embarrassment akin to that he had felt in the cabin of the skyscraper and half expected the father to utter a shocked protest and to save what he thought would be an appalling silence he said with a quiet laugh  thats the fellow who made the assembly shine in the song isnt it  that was robin adair said gray quietly unfortunately i would only be robin gray and thats quite another song  auld robin gray sir deestinctly auld in the song interrupted mr callender with stern precision and im thinking he was not so very unfortunate either  the discussion of scotch diminutives halting here the boat sped on silently to the yacht but although robert gray as host recovered some of his usual lightheartedness the consul failed to discover anything in his manner to indicate the lover nor did miss ailsa after her single lapse of tender accent exhibit the least consciousness it was true that their occasional frank allusions to previous conversations seemed to show that their opportunities had not been restricted but nothing more he began again to think he was mistaken  as he wished to return early and yet not hasten the callenders he prevailed upon gray to send him to the pierhead first and not disturb the party as he stepped into the boat something in the appearance of the coxswain awoke an old association in his mind the man at first seemed to avoid his scrutiny but when they were well away from the yacht he said hesitatingly  i see you remember me sir but if its all the same to you ive got a good berth here and would like to keep it  the consul had a flash of memory it was the boatswain of the skyscraper one of the least objectionable of the crew but what are you doing here you shipped for the voyage he said sharply  yes but i got away at key west when i knew what was coming i wasnt on her when she was abandoned  abandoned repeated the consul what the dl do you mean to say she was wrecked  well yesyou know what i mean sir it was an understood thing she was overinsured and scuttled in the bahamas it was a putup job and i reckoned i was well out of it  but there was a passenger what of him demanded the consul anxiously  dnnno but i reckon he got away there wasnt any of the crew lost that i know of lets see he was an engineer wasnt he i reckon he had to take a hand at the pumps and his chances with the rest  does mr gray know of this asked the consul after a pause  the man stared  not from me sir you see it was nothin to him and i didnt care talking much about the skyscraper it was hushed up in the papers you wont go back on me sir  you dont know what became of the passenger  no but he was a scotchman and theyre bound to fall on their feet somehow   iii   the december fog that overhung st kentigern had thinned sufficiently to permit the passage of a few large snowflakes soiled in their descent until in color and consistency they spotted the steps of the consulate and the umbrellas of the passersby like sprinklings of gray mortar nevertheless the consul thought the streets preferable to the persistent gloom of his office and sallied out youthful mercantile st kentigern strode sturdily past him in the lightest covert coats collegiate st kentigern fluttered by in the scantiest of red gowns shaming the furs that defended his more exotic blood and the bare red feet of a few factory girls albeit their heads and shoulders were draped and hooded in thick shawls filled him with a keen sense of his effeminacy everything of earth air and sky and even the faces of those he looked upon seemed to be set in the hard patient endurance of the race everywhere on that dismal day he fancied he could see this energy without restlessness this earnestness without geniality all grimly set against the hard environment of circumstance and weather  the consul turned into one of the main arteries of st kentigern a wide street that however began and ended inconsequently and with half a dozen social phases in as many blocks here the snow ceased the fog thickened suddenly with the waning day and the consul found himself isolated and cut off on a block which he did not remember with the clatter of an invisible tramway in his ears it was a block of small houses with smaller shopfronts the one immediately before him seemed to be an opticians but the dimly lighted windows also displayed the pathetic reinforcement of a few watches cheap jewelry on cards and several cairngorm brooches and pins set in silver it occurred to him that he wanted a new watch crystal and that he would procure it here and inquire his way opening the door he perceived that there was no one in the shop but from behind the counter another open door disclosed a neat sittingroom so close to the street that it gave the casual customer the sensation of having intruded upon domestic privacy the consuls entrance tinkled a small bell which brought a figure to the door it was ailsa callender  the consul was startled he had not seen her since he had brought to their cottage the news of the shipwreck with a precaution and delicacy that their calm selfcontrol and patient resignation however seemed to make almost an impertinence but this was no longer the handsome shop in the chief thoroughfare with its two shopmen which he previously knew as callenders and ailsa here what misfortune had befallen them  whatever it was there was no shadow of it in her clear eyes and frank yet timid recognition of him falling in with her stoical and reticent acceptance of it he nevertheless gathered that the callenders had lost money in some invention which james gow had taken with him to rio but which was sunk in the ship with this revelation of a business interest in what he had believed was only a sentimental relation the consul ventured to continue his inquiries mr gow had escaped with his life and had reached honduras where he expected to try his fortunes anew it might be a year or two longer before there were any results did the consul know anything of honduras there was coffee thereso she and her father understood all this with little hopefulness no irritation but a divine patience in her eyes the consul who found that his watch required extensive repairing and had suddenly developed an inordinate passion for cairngorms watched her as she opened the showcase with no affectation of unfamiliarity with her occupation but with all her old serious concern surely she would have made as thorough a shopgirl as she wouldhis halfformulated thought took the shape of a question  have you seen mr gray since his return from the mediterranean  ah one of the brooches had slipped from her fingers to the bottom of the case there was an interval or two of pathetic murmuring with her fair head under the glass before she could find it then she lifted her eyes to the consul they were still slightly suffused with her sympathetic concern the stone which was set in a thistlethe national emblemdid he not know ithad dropped out but she could put it in it was pretty and not expensive it was marked twelve shillings on the card but he could have it for ten shillings no she had not seen mr gray since they had lost their fortune it struck the consul as none the less pathetic that she seemed really to believe in their former opulence they could not be seeing him there in a small shop and they could not see him elsewhere it was far better as it was yet she paused a moment when she had wrapped up the brooch youd be seeing him yourself some time she added gently  perhaps  then youll not mind saying how my father and myself are sometimes thinking of his goodness and kindness she went on in a voice whose tenderness seemed to increase with the formal precision of her speech  certainly  and youll say were not forgetting him  i promise  as she handed him the parcel her lips softly parted in what might have been equally a smile or a sigh  he was able to keep his promise sooner than he had imagined it was only a few weeks later that arriving in london he found grays hatbox and bag in the vestibule of his club and that gentleman himself in the smokingroom he looked tanned and older  i only came from southampton an hour ago where i left the yacht and shaking the consuls hand cordially hows everything and everybody up at old st kentigern  the consul thought fit to include his news of the callenders in reference to that query and with his eyes fixed on gray dwelt at some length on their change of fortune gray took his cigar from his mouth but did not lift his eyes from the fire presently he said i suppose thats why callender declined to take the shares i offered him in the fishing scheme you know i meant it and would have done it  perhaps he had other reasons  what do you mean said gray facing the consul suddenly  look here gray said the consul did miss callender or her father ever tell you she was engaged  yes but whats that to do with it  a good deal engagements you know are sometimes forced unsuitable or unequal and are broken by circumstances callender is proud  gray turned upon the consul the same look of gravity that he had worn on the yachtthe same look that the consul even fancied he had seen in ailsas eyes thats exactly where youre mistaken in her he said slowly a girl like that gives her word and keeps it she waits hopes accepts what may comebreaks her heart if you will but not her word come lets talk of something else how did hethat man gowlose callenders money  the consul did not see the callenders again on his return and perhaps did not think it necessary to report the meeting but one morning he was delighted to find an official document from new york upon his desk asking him to communicate with david callender of st kentigern and on proof of his identity giving him authority to draw the sum of five thousand dollars damages awarded for the loss of certain property on the skyscraper at the request of james gow yet it was with mixed sensations that the consul sought the little shop of the optician with this convincing proof of gows faithfulness and the indissolubility of ailsas engagement that there was some sad understanding between the girl and gray he did not doubt and perhaps it was not strange that he felt a slight partisanship for his friend whose nature had so strangely changed miss ailsa was not there her father explained that her health had required a change and she was visiting some friends on the river  im thinkin that the atmosphere is not so pure here it is deficient in ozone i noticed it myself in the early morning no it was not the confinement of the shop for she never cared to go out  he received the announcement of his good fortune with unshaken calm and great practical consideration of detail he would guarantee his identity to the consul as for james gow it was no more than fair and what he had expected of him as to its being an equivalent of his loss he could not tell until the facts were before him  miss ailsa suggested the consul venturously will be pleased to hear again from her old friend and know that he is succeeding  im not so sure that ye could call it succeeding returned the old man carefully wiping the glasses of a pair of spectacles that he held critically to the light when ye consider that saying nothing of the waste of valuable time it only puts james gow back where he was when he went away  but any man who has had the pleasure of knowing mr and miss callender would be glad to be on that footing said the consul with polite significance  im not agreeing with you there said mr callender quietly and im observing in ye of late a tendency to combine business wi compleement but it was kind of ye to call and ill be sending ye the authorization  which he did but the consul passing through the locality a few weeks later was somewhat concerned to find the shop closed with others on the same block behind a hoarding that indicated rebuilding and improvement further inquiry elicited the fact that the small leases had been bought up by some capitalist and that mr callender with the others had benefited thereby but there was no trace nor clew to his present locality he and his daughter seemed to have again vanished with this second change in their fortunes  it was a late march morning when the streets were dumb with snow and the air was filled with flying granulations that tinkled against the windows of the consulate like fairy sleighbells when there was the stamping of snowclogged feet in the outer hall and the door was opened to mr and miss callender for an instant the consul was startled the old man appeared as usualerect and as frigidly respectable as one of the icicles that fringed the window but miss ailsa was to his astonishment brilliant with a newfound color and sparkling with health and only halfrepressed animation the snowflakes scarcely melting on the brown head of this true daughter of the north still crowned her hood and as she threw back her brown cloak and disclosed a plump little scarlet jacket and brown skirt the consul could not resist her suggested likeness to some brighteyed robin redbreast to whom the inclement weather had given a charming audacity and shy and demure as she still was it was evident that some change had been wrought in her other than that evoked by the stimulus of her native sky and air  to his eager questioning the old man replied briefly that he had bought the old cottage at loch dour where they were living and where he had erected a small manufactory and laboratory for the making of his inventions which had become profitable the consul reiterated his delight at meeting them again  im not so sure of that sir when you know the business on which i come said mr callender dropping rigidly into a chair and clasping his hands over the crutch of a shepherdlike staff ye mind perhaps that ye conveyed to me osteensibly at the request of james gow a certain sum of money for which i gave ye a good and sufficient guarantee i thought at the time that it was a most feckless and unbusinesslike proceeding on the part of james as it was without corroboration or advice by letter but i took the money  do you mean to say that he made no allusion to it in his other letters interrupted the consul glancing at ailsa  there were no other letters at the time said callender dryly but about a month afterwards we did receive a letter from him enclosing a draft and a full return of the profits of the invention which he had sold in honduras yell observe the deescrepancy i then wrote to the bank on which i had drawn as you authorized me and i found that they knew nothing of any damages awarded but that the sum i had drawn had been placed to my credit by mr robert gray  in a flash the consul recalled the one or two questions that gray had asked him and saw it all for an instant he felt the whole bitterness of grays misplaced generosityits exposure and defeat he glanced again hopelessly at ailsa in the eye of that fresh glowing yet demure young goddess unhallowed as the thought might be there was certainly a distinctly tremulous wink  the consul took heart i believe i need not say mr callender he began with some stiffness that this is as great a surprise to me as to you i had no reason to believe the transaction other than bona fide and acted accordingly if my friend deeply sympathizing with your previous misfortune has hit upon a delicate but unbusinesslike way of assisting you temporarilyi say temporarily because it must have been as patent to him as to you that you would eventually find out his generous deceityou surely can forgive him for the sake of his kind intention nay more may i point out to you that you have no right to assume that this benefaction was intended exclusively for you if mr gray in his broader sympathy with you and your daughter has in this way chosen to assist and strengthen the position of a gentleman so closely connected with you but still struggling with hard fortune  id have ye know sir interrupted the old man rising to his feet that ma frien mr james gow is as independent of yours as he is of me and mine he has married sir a mrs hernandez the rich widow of a coffeeplanter and now is the owner of the whole estate minus the encumbrance of three children and now sir youll take thishe drew from his pocket an envelope its a draft for five thousand dollars with the ruling rate of interest computed from the day i received it till this day and yell give it to your frien when ye see him and yell just say to him from me  but miss ailsa with a spirit and independence that challenged her fathers here suddenly fluttered between them with sparkling eyes and outstretched hands  and yell say to him from me that a more honorable noble and generous man and a kinder truer and better friend than he cannot be found anywhere and that the foolishest and most extravagant thing he ever did is better than the wisest and most prudent thing that anybody else ever did could or would do and if he was a bit overproudit was only because those about him were overproud and foolish and youll tell him that were wearying for him and when you give him that daft letter from father youll give him this bit line from me she went on rapidly as she laid a tiny note in his hand and with wicked dancing eyes that seemed to snap the last bond of repression yell give him that too and say i sent it  there was a stir in the official apartment the portraits of lincoln and washington rattled uneasily in their frames but it was no doubt only a discreet blast of the north wind that drowned the echo of a kiss  ailsa gasped the shocked mr callender  ah but father if it had not been for him we would not have known robin    it was the last that the consul saw of ailsa callender for the next summer when he called at loch dour she was mrs gray     the sheriff of siskyou   i   on the fifteenth of august 1854 what seemed to be the entire population of wynyards bar was collected upon a little bluff which overlooked the rude wagon road that was the only approach to the settlement in general appearance the men differed but little from ordinary miners although the foreign element shown in certain spanish peculiarities of dress and color predominated and some of the men were further distinguished by the delicacy of education and sedentary pursuits yet wynyards bar was a city of refuge comprised among its inhabitants a number who were wanted by the state authorities and its actual attitude at that moment was one of open rebellion against the legal power and of particular resistance to the apprehension by warrant of one of its prominent members this gentleman major overstone then astride of a gray mustang and directing the movements of the crowd had a few days before killed the sheriff of siskyou county who had attempted to arrest him for the double offense of misappropriating certain corporate funds of the state and the shooting of the editor who had imprudently exposed him the lesser crime of homicide might have been overlooked by the authorities but its repetition upon the body of their own overzealous and misguided official could not pass unchallenged if they expected to arrest overstone for the more serious offense against property so it was known that a new sheriff had been appointed and was coming to wynyards bar with an armed posse but it was also understood that this invasion would be resisted by the bar to its last man  all eyes were turned upon a fringe of laurel and butternut that encroached upon the road half a mile away where it seemed that such of the inhabitants who were missing from the bluff were hidden to give warning or retard the approach of the posse a gray haze slowly rising between the fringe and the distant hillside was recognized as the dust of a cavalcade passing along the invisible highway in the hush of expectancy that followed the irregular clatter of hoofs the sharp crack of a rifle and a sudden halt were faintly audible the men scattered in groups on the bluff exchanged a smile of grim satisfaction  not so their leader a quick start and an oath attracted attention to him to their surprise he was looking in another direction but as they looked too they saw and understood the cause a file of horsemen hitherto undetected were slowly passing along the little ridge on their right their compact accoutrements and the yellow braid on their blue jackets distinctly seen at that distance showed them to be a detachment of united states cavalry  before the assemblage could realize this new invasion a nearer clatter of hoofs was heard along the high road and one of the ambuscading party dashed up from the fringe of woods below his face was flushed but triumphant  a reglar skunkby the living hokey he panted pointing to the faint haze that was again slowly rising above the invisible road they backed down as soon as they saw our hand and got a hole through their new sheriffs hat but what are you lookin at whats up  the leader impatiently pointed with a darkening face to the distant file  reglars by gum ejaculated the other but uncle sam aint in this game wot right have they  dry up said the leader  the detachment was now moving at right angles with the camp but suddenly halted almost doubling upon itself in some evident commotion a dismounted figure was seen momentarily flying down the hillside dodging from bush to bush until lost in the underbrush a dozen shots were fired over its head and then the whole detachment wheeled and came clattering down the trail in the direction of the camp a single riderless horse evidently that of the fugitive followed  spread yourselves along the ridge every man of you and cover them as they enter the gulch shouted the leader but not a shot until i give the word scatter  the assemblage dispersed like a startled village of prairie dogs squatting behind every available bush and rock along the line of bluff the leader alone trotted quietly to the head of the gulch  the nine cavalrymen came smartly up in twos a young officer leading the single figure of major overstone opposed them with a command to halt looking up the young officer drew rein said a word to his file leader and the four files closed in a compact square motionless on the road the young officers unsworded hand hung quietly at his thigh the mens unslung carbines rested easily on their saddles yet at that moment every man of them knew that they were covered by a hundred rifles and shot guns leveled from every bush and that they were caught helplessly in a trap  since when said major overstone with an affectation of tone and manner different from that in which he had addressed his previous companions have the ninth united states cavalry helped to serve a state courts pettifogging process  we are hunting a desertera halfbreed agentwho has just escaped us returned the officer his voice was boyishso too was his figure in its slim cadetlike smartness of belted tunicbut very quiet and level although his face was still flushed with the shock and shame of his surprise  the relaxation of relief went through the wrought and waiting camp the soldiers were not seeking them ready as these desperate men had been to do their leaders bidding they were well aware that a momentary victory over the troopers would not pass unpunished and meant the ultimate dispersion of the camp and quiet as these innocent invaders seemed to be they would no doubt sell their lives dearly the embattled desperadoes glanced anxiously at their leader the soldiers on the contrary looked straight before them  process or no process said major overstone with a sneer youve come to the last place to recover your deserter we dont give up men in wynyards bar and they didnt teach you at the academy sir to stop to take prisoners when you were outflanked and outnumbered  bedad they didnt teach you captain overstone to engage a battery at cerro gordo with a half company but you did it more shame to you now sorr commandin the thayves and ruffians you do  silence said the young officer  the sleeve of the sergeant who had spokenwith the chevrons of long service upon itwent up to a salute and dropped again over his carbine as he stared stolidly before him but his shot had told a flush of mingled pride and shame passed over overstones face  oh its you murphy he said with an affected laugh and you havent improved with your stripes  the young officer turned his head slightly  attention  one moment more said overstone coming forward i have told you that we dont give up any man who seeks our protection but he added with a halfcareless halfcontemptuous wave of his hand and a significant glance at his followers we dont prevent you from seeking him the road is clear the camp is before you  the young officer continued without looking at him forwardin two filesopen order maarch  the little troop moved forward passed major overstone at the head of the gully and spread out on the hillside the assembled camp still armed lounging out of ambush here and there ironically made way for them to pass a few moments of this farcical quest and a glance at the impenetrably wooded heights around apparently satisfied the young officer and he turned his files again into the gully major overstone was still lingering there  i hope you are satisfied he said grimly he then paused and in a changed and more hesitating voice added i am an older soldier than you sir but i am always glad to make the acquaintance of west point he paused and held out his hand  west point still red and rigid glanced at him with bright clear eyes under light lashes and the peak of a smartly cocked cap looked coolly at the proffered hand raised his own to a stiff salute said good afternoon sir and rode away  major overstone wheeled angrily but in doing so came sharply upon his coadjutorthe leader of the ambushed party  well dawson he said impatiently who was it  only one of them dd halfbreed injin agents hes just over there in the brush with simpson lying low till the soldiers clear out  did you talk to him  not much returned dawson scornfully he aint my style  fetch him up to my cabin he may be of some use to us  dawson looked skeptical i reckon he aint no more gain here than he was over there he said and turned away   ii   the cabin of major overstone differed outwardly but little from those of his companions it was the usual structure of logs laid lengthwise and rudely plastered at each point of contact with adobe the material from which the chimney which entirely occupied one gable was built it was pierced with two windows and a door roofed with smaller logs and thatched with long half cylinders of spruce bark but the interior gave certain indications of the distinction as well as the peculiar experiences of its occupant in place of the usual bunk or berth built against the wall stood a small folding camp bedstead and upon a rude deal table that held a tin washbasin and pail lay two ivoryhandled brushes combs and other elegant toilet articles evidently the contents of the majors dressingbag a handsome leather trunk occupied one corner with a richly caparisoned silvermounted mexican saddle a mahogany case of dueling pistols a leather hatbox locked and strapped and a gorgeous gold and quartz handled ebony presentation walking stick there was a certain dramatic suggestion in this revelation of the sudden and hurried transition from a life of ostentatious luxury to one of hidden toil and privation and a further significance in the slow and gradual distribution and degradation of these elegant souvenirs a pair of silver boothooks had been used for raking the hearth and lifting the coffee kettle the ivory of the brushes was stained with coffee the cutglass bottles had lost their stoppers and had been utilized for vinegar and salt a silverframed hand mirror hung against the blackened wall for the majors occupancy was the sequel of a hurried flight from his luxurious hotel at sacramentoa transfer that he believed was only temporary until the affair blew over and he could return in safety to browbeat his accusers as was his wont but this had not been so easy as he had imagined his prosecutors were bitter and his enforced seclusion had been prolonged week by week until the fracas which ended in the shooting of the sheriff had apparently closed the door upon his return to civilization forever only here was his life and person secure for wynyards bar had quickly succumbed to the domination of his reckless courage and the eminence of his double crime had made him respected among spendthrifts gamblers and gentlemen whose performances had never risen above a stagecoach robbery or a single assassination even criticism of his faded luxuries had been delicately withheld  he was leaning over his open trunkwhich the camp popularly supposed to contain state bonds and securities of fabulous amountand had taken some letters from it when a figure darkened the doorway he looked up laying his papers carelessly aside within wynyards bar property was sacred  it was the late fugitive although some hours had already elapsed since his arrival in camp and he had presumably refreshed himself inwardly his outward appearance was still disheveled and dusty brier and milkweed clung to his frayed blouse and trousers what could be seen of the skin of his face and hands under its stains and begriming was of a dull yellow his light eyes had all the brightness without the restlessness of the mongrel race they leisurely took in the whole cabin the still open trunk before the major and then rested deliberately on the major himself  well said major overstone abruptly what brought you here  same as brought you i reckon responded the man almost as abruptly  the major knew something of the halfbreed temper and neither the retort nor its tone affected him  you didnt come here just because you deserted said the major coolly youve been up to something else  i have said the man with equal coolness  i thought so now you understand you cant try anything of that kind here if you do up you go on the first tree thats rule 1  i see you aint pertickler about waiting for the sheriff here you fellers  the major glanced at him quickly he seemed to be quite unconscious of any irony in his remark and continued grimly and whats rule 2  i reckon you neednt trouble yourself beyond no 1 returned the major with dry significance nevertheless he opened a rude cupboard in the corner and brought out a rich silvermounted cutglass drinkingflask which he handed to the stranger  i say said the halfbreed admiringly yours  certainly  certainly now but before eh  rule no 2 may have indicated that references to the past held no dishonor the major although accustomed to these pleasantries laughed a little harshly  mine always he said but you dont drink  the halfbreeds face darkened under its grime  wot youre givin us ive been filled chock up by simpson over thar i reckon i know when ive got a load on  were you ever in sacramento  yes  when  last week  did you hear anything about me  the halfbreed glanced through his tangled hair at the major in some wonder not only at the question but at the almost childish eagerness with which it was asked  i didnt hear much of anything else he answered grimly  andwhat did they say  said youd got to be took anyhow they allowed the new sheriff would do it too  the major laughed well you heard how the new sheriff did itskunked away with his whole posse before oneeighth of my men you saw how the rest of this camp held up your nine troopers and that sapheaded cub of a lieutenantdidnt you you wouldnt have been standing here if you hadnt no there isnt the civil process nor the civil power in all california that can take me out of this camp  but neither his previous curiosity nor present bravado seemed to impress the ragged stranger with much favor he glanced sulkily around the cabin and began to shuffle towards the door  stop where are you going to sit down i want to talk to you  the fugitive hesitated for a moment and then dropped ungraciously on the edge of a campstool near the door the major looked at him  i may have to remind you that i run this camp and the boys hereabouts do pretty much as i say whats your name  tom  tom well look here tom dn it all cant you see that when a man is stuck here alone as i am he wants to know whats going on outside and hear a little fresh talk  the singular weakness of this blended command and appeal apparently struck the fugitive curiously he fixed his lowering eyes on the major as if in gloomy doubt if he were really the reckless desperado he had been represented that this mantwice an assassin and the ruler of outlaws as reckless as himselfshould approach him in this halfconfidential way evidently puzzled him  wot you wanter know he asked gruffly  well whats my party saying or doing about me said the major impatiently whats the express saying about me  i reckon theyre throwing off on you all round they allow you never represented the party but worked for yourself said the man shortly  here the major lashed out a set of traitors and hirelings he had bought and paid for them all he had sunk two thousand dollars in the express and saved the editor from being horsewhipped and jailed for libel half the cursed bonds that they were making such a blanked fuss about were handled by these hypocritesblank them they were a lowlived crew of thieves and deserters it is presumed that the major had forgotten himself in this infelicitous selection of epithets but the strangers face only relaxed into a grim smile more than that the major had apparently forgotten his desire to hear his guest talk for he himself at once launched into an elaborate exposition of his own affairs and a specious and equally elaborate defense and justification of himself and denunciation of his accusers for nearly half an hour he reviewed step by step and detail by detail the charges against himwith plausible explanation and sophistical argument but always with a singular prolixity and reiteration that spoke of incessant selfconsciousness and selfabstraction of that dashing selfsufficiency which had dazzled his friends and awed his enemies there was no trace at last even the set smile of the degraded recipient of these confidences darkened with a dull bewildered disgust then to his relief a step was heard without the majors manner instantly changed  well he demanded impatiently as dawson entered  i came to know what you want done with him said dawson indicating the fugitive with a contemptuous finger  take him to your cabin  my cabin him ejaculated dawson turning sharply on his chief  the majors light eyes contracted and his thin lips became a straight line i dont think you understand me dawson and another time youd better wait until im done i want you to take him to your cabinand then clear out of it yourself you understand i want him near me and alone   iii   dawson was not astonished the next morning to see major overstone and the halfbreed walking together down the gully road for he had already come to the conclusion that the major was planning some extraordinary reprisals against the invaders that would ensure the perpetual security of the camp that he should use so insignificant and unimportant a tool now appeared to him to be quite natural particularly as the service was probably one in which the man would be sacrificed the major he suggested to his companions aint going to risk a white mans skin when he can get an injuns hide handy  the reluctant hesitating step of the halfbreed as they walked along seemed to give some color to this hypothesis he listened sullenly to the major as he pointed out the strategic position of the bar that wagon road is the only approach to wynyards and a dozen men along the rocks could hold it against a hundred the trail that you came by over the ridge drops straight into this gully and you saw what that would mean to any blanked fools who might try it of course we could be shelled from that ridge if the sheriff had a howitzer or the men who knew how to work one but even then we could occupy the ridge before them he paused a moment and then added i used to be in the army tom i saw service in mexico before that cub you got away from had his first trousers i was brought up as a gentlemanblank it alland here i am  the man slouched on by his side casting his surly furtive glances from left to right as if seeking to escape from these confidences nevertheless the major kept on through the gully until reaching the wagon road they crossed it and began to ascend the opposite slope half hidden by the underbrush and larches here the major paused again and faced about the cabins of the settlement were already behind the bluff the little stream which indicated the baron which some perfunctory mining was still continuednow and then rang out quite clearly at their feet although the bar itself had disappeared the sounds of occupation and labor had at last died away in the distance they were quite alone the major sat down on a boulder and pointed to another the man however remained sullenly standing where he was as if to accent as strongly as possible the enforced companionship either the major was too selfabsorbed to notice it or accepted it as a satisfactory characteristic of the halfbreeds race he continued confidently  now look here tom i want to leave this cursed hole and get clear out of the state anywhere over the oregon line into british columbia or to the coast where i can get a coasting vessel down to mexico it will cost money but ive got it it will cost a lot of risks but ill take them i want somebody to help me some one to share risks with me and some one to share my luck if i succeed help to put me on the other side of the border line by sea or land and ill give you a thousand dollars down before we start and a thousand dollars when im safe  the halfbreed had changed his slouching attitude it seemed more indolent on account of the loosely hanging strap that had once held his haversack which was still worn in a slovenly fashion over his shoulder as a kind of lazy sling for his shiftless hand  well tom is it a go you can trust me for youll have the thousand in your pocket before you start i can trust you for ill kill you quicker than lightning if you say a word of this to any one before i go or play a single trick on me afterwards  suddenly the two men were rolling over and over in the underbrush the halfbreed had thrown himself upon the major bearing him down to the ground the haversack strap for an instant whirled like the loop of a lasso in the air and descended over the majors shoulders pinioning his arms to his side then the halfbreed tearing open his ragged blouse stripped off his waistbelt and as dexterously slipped it over the ankles of the struggling man  it was all over in a moment neither had spoken a word only their rapid panting broke the profound silence each probably knew that no outcry would be overheard  for the first time the halfbreed sat down but there was no trace of triumph or satisfaction in his face which wore the same lowering look of disgust as he gazed upon the prostrate man  i want to tell you first he said slowly wiping his face that i didnt kalkilate upon doin this in this yer kind o way i expected more of a stan up fight from youmore risk in gettin you out o that holeand a different kind of a man to tackle i never expected you to play into my hand like thisand it goes against me to hev to take advantage of it  who are you said the major pantingly  im the new sheriff of siskyou  he drew from beneath his begrimed shirt a paper wrapping from which he gingerly extracted with the ends of his dirty fingers a clean legallooking folded paper  thats my warrant ive kept it fresh for you i reckon you dont care to read ityouve seen it afore its just the same as tother sheriff hadwhat you shot  then this was a plant of yours and that whelps troopers said the major  neither him nor the sojers knows any more about it than you returned the sheriff slowly i enlisted as injin guide or scout ten days ago i deserted just as reglar and natral like when we passed that ridge yesterday i could be took tomorrow by the sojers if they caught sight o me and courtmartialedits as reglar as that but i timed to have my posse under a deputy draw you off by an attack just as the escort reached the ridge and here i am  and youre no halfbreed  theres nothin injin about me that water wont wash off i kalkilated you wouldnt suspect anything so insignificant as an injin when i fixed myself up you saw dawson didnt hanker after me much but i didnt reckon on your tumbling to me so quick thats what gets me you must hev been pretty low down for kempany when you took a man like me inter your confidence i dont see it yet  he looked inquiringly at his captivewith the same wondering surliness nor could he understand another thing which was evident after the first shock of resistance the major had exhibited none of the indignation of a betrayed man but actually seemed to accept the situation with a calmness that his captor lacked his voice was quite unemotional as he said  and how are you going to get me away from here  thats my look out and neednt trouble you major but seein as how confidential youve been to me i dont mind tellin you last night that posse of mine that you skunked you know halted at the cross roads till them sojers went by they has only to see them to know that i had got away theyll hang round the cross roads till they see my signal on top of the ridge and then theyll make another show against that pass your men will have their hands full i reckon without huntin for you or noticin the three men o mine that will come along this ridge where the sojers come yesterdayto help me get you down in the same way you see major your little trap in that gully aint in this fightwere the other side of it i aint much of a sojer but i reckon ive got you there and its all owing to you i aint he added gloomily takin much pride in it myself  i shouldnt think you would said the major and look here ill double that offer i made you just now set me down just as i am on the deck of some coasting vessel and ill pay you four thousand dollars you may have all the glory of having captured me here and of making your word good before your posse but you can arrange afterwards on the way to let me give you the slip somewhere near sacramento  the sheriffs face actually brightened thanks for that major i was gettin a little sick of my share in this job but by god youve put some sand in me well then there aint gold enough in all californy to make me let you go you hear me so drop that ive took you and took yell remain until i land you in sacramento jail i dont want to kill you though your lifes forfeit a dozen times over and i reckon you dont care for it either way but if you try any tricks on me i may have to maim ye to make you come along comfable and easy i aint hankerin arter that either but come you shall  give your signal and have an end of this said the major curtly  the sheriff looked at him again curiously i never had my hands in another mans pockets before major but i reckon ill have to take your derringers from yours he slipped his hand into the majors waistcoat and secured the weapons ill have to trouble you for your sash too he said unwinding the knitted silken girdle from the captives waist you wont want it for you aint walking and itll come in handy to me just now  he bent over and passing it across the majors breast with more gentleness and solicitude than he had yet shown secured him in an easy sitting posture against the tree then after carefully trying the knots and straps that held his prisoner he turned and lightly bounded up the hill  he was absent scarcely ten minutes yet when he returned the majors eyes were half closed but not his lips if you expect to hold me until your posse comes you had better take me to some less exposed position he said dryly theres a man just crossed the gully coming into the brush below in the wood  none of your tricks major  look for yourself  the sheriff glanced quickly below him a man with an axe on his shoulder could be seen plainly making his way through the underbrush not a hundred yards away the sheriff instantly clapped his hand upon his captives mouth but at a look from his eyes took it away again  i see he said grimly you dont want to lure that man within reach of my revolver by calling to him  i could have called him while you were away returned the major quietly  the sheriff with a darkened face loosened the sash that bound his prisoner to the tree and then lifting him in his arms began to ascend the hill cautiously dipping into the heavier shadows but the ascent was difficult the load a heavy one and the sheriff was agile rather than muscular after a few minutes climbing he was forced to pause and rest his burden at the foot of a tree but the valley and the man in the underbrush were no longer in view  come said the major quietly unstrap my ankles and ill walk up well never get there at this rate  the sheriff paused wiped his grimy face with his grimier blouse and stood looking at his prisoner then he said slowly  look yer wots your little game blessed if i kin follow suit  for the first time the major burst into a rage blast it all dont you see that if im discovered here in this way theres not a man on the bar who would believe that i walked into your trap not a man by god who wouldnt think it was a trick of yours and mine together  or interrupted the sheriff slowly fixing his eyes on his prisoner not a man who would ever trust major overstone for a leader again  perhaps said the major unmovedly again i dont think either of us would ever get a chance of being trusted again by any one  the sheriff still kept his eyes fixed on his prisoner his gloomy face growing darker under its grime that aint the reason major life and death dont mean much more to you than they do to me in this yer game i know that youd kill me quicker nor lightning if you got the chance you know that im takin you to the gallows  the reason is that i want to leave wynyards bar said the major coolly and even this way out of it will suit me  the sheriff took his revolver from his pocket and deliberately cocked it then leaning down he unbuckled the strap from the majors ankles a wild hope that his incomprehensible captive might seize that moment to develop his real intentthat he might fly fight or in some way act up to his reckless reputationsustained him for a moment but in the next proved futile the major only said thank you tom and stretched his cramped legs  get up and go on said the sheriff roughly  the major began to slowly ascend the hill the sheriff close on his heels alert tingling and watchful of every movement for a few moments this strain upon his faculties seemed to invigorate him and his gloom relaxed but presently it became too evident that the prisoners pinioned arms made it impossible for him to balance or help himself on that steep trail and once or twice he stumbled and reeled dangerously to one side with an oath the sheriff caught him and tore from his arms the only remaining bonds that fettered him there he said savagely go on were equal  without replying the major continued his ascent it became steeper as they neared the crest and at last they were both obliged to drag themselves up by clutching the vines and underbrush suddenly the major stopped with a listening gesture a strange roaringas of wind or waterwas distinctly audible  how did you signal asked the major abruptly  made a smoke said the sheriff as abruptly  i thought sowell youve set the woods on fire  they both plunged upwards again now quite abreast vying with each other to reach the summit as if with the one thought only already the sting and smart of acrid fumes were in their eyes and nostrils when they at last stood on level ground again it was hidden by a thin film of grayish blue haze that seemed to be creeping along it but above was the clear sky seen through the interlacing boughs and to their surprisethey who had just come from the breathless stagnant hillsidea fierce wind was blowing but the roaring was louder than before  unless your three men are already here your game is up said the major calmly the wind blows dead along the ridge where they should come and they cant get through the smoke and fire  it was indeed true in the scarce twenty minutes that had elapsed since the sheriffs return the dry and brittle underbrush for half a mile on either side had been converted into a sheet of flame which at times rose to a furnace blast through the tall chimneylike conductors of tree shafts from whose shriveled sides bark was crackling and lighted dead limbs falling in all directions the whole valley the gully the bar the very hillside they had just left were blotted out by a creeping stifling smokefog that scarcely rose breast high but was beaten down or cut off cleanly by the violent wind that swept the higher level of the forest at times this gale became a sirocco in temperature concentrating its heat in withering blasts which they could not face or focusing its intensity upon some mass of foliage that seemed to shrink at its touch and open a scathed and quivering aisle to its approach the enormous skeleton of a dead and rotten redwood not a hundred yards to their right broke suddenly like a gigantic firework into sparks and flame  the sheriff had grasped the full meaning of their situation in spite of his first errorthe very carelessness of familiarityhis knowledge of woodcraft was greater than his companions and he saw their danger come he said quickly we must make for an opening or we shall be caught  the major smiled in misapprehension  who could catch us here  the sheriff pointed to the blazing tree  that he said in five minutes it will have a posse that will wipe us both out  he caught the major by the arm and rushed him into the smoke apparently in the direction of the greatest mass of flame the heat was suffocating but it struck the major that the more they approached the actual scene of conflagration the heat and smoke became less until he saw that the fire was retreating before them and the following wind in a few moments their haven of safetythe expanse already burnt overcame in sight here and there seen dimly through the drifting smoke the scattered embers that still strewed the forest floor glowed in weird nebulous spots like willothewisps for an instant the major hesitated the sheriff cast a significant glance behind them  go on its our only chance he said imperatively  they darted on skimming the blackened or smouldering surface which at times struck out sparks and flame from their heavier footprints as they passed their boots crackled and scorched beneath them their shreds of clothing were on fire their breathing became more difficult until providentially they fell upon an abrupt fissurelike depression of the soil which the fire had leaped and into which they blindly plunged and rolled together a moment of relief and coolness followed as they crept along the fissure filled with damp and rotting leaves  why not stay here said the exhausted prisoner  and be roasted like sweet potatoes when these trees catch returned the sheriff grimly no even as he spoke a dropping rain of fire spattered through the leaves from a splintered redwood before overlooked that was now blazing fiercely in the upper wind a vague and indefinable terror was in the air the conflagration no longer seemed to obey any rule of direction the incendiary torch had passed invisibly everywhere they scrambled out of the hollow and again dashed desperately forward  beaten bruised blackened and smokegrimedlooking less human than the animals who had long since deserted the crestthey at last limped into a wind opening in the woods that the fire had skirted the major sank exhaustedly to the ground the sheriff threw himself beside him their strange relations to each other seemed to have been forgotten they looked and acted as if they no longer thought of anything beyond the present and when the sheriff finally arose and disappearing for several minutes brought his hat full of water for his prisoner from a distant spring that they had passed in their flight he found him where he had left himunchanged and unmoved  he took the water gratefully and after a pause fixed his eyes earnestly upon his captor i want you to do a favor to me he said slowly im not going to offer you a bribe to do it either nor ask you anything that isnt in a line with your duty i think i understand you now if i didnt before do you know briggss restaurant in sacramento  the sheriff nodded  well over the restaurant are my private rooms the finest in sacramento nobody knows it but briggs and he has never told theyve been locked ever since i left ive got the key still in my pocket now when we get to sacramento instead of taking me straight to jail i want you to hold me there as your prisoner for a day and a night i dont want to get away you can take what precautions you likesurround the house with policemen and sleep yourself in the anteroom i dont want to destroy any papers or evidence you can go through the rooms and examine everything before and after i only want to stay there a day and a night i want to be in my old rooms have my meals from the restaurant as i used to and sleep in my own bed once more i want to live for one day like a gentleman as i used to live before i came here thats all it isnt much tom you can do it and say you require to do it to get evidence against me or that you want to search the rooms  the expression of wonder which had come into the sheriffs face at the beginning of this speech deepened into his old look of surly dissatisfaction and thats all ye want he said gloomily ye dont want no friendsno lawyer for i tell you straight out major there aint no hope for ye when the law once gets hold of ye in sacramento  thats all will you do it  the sheriffs face grew still darker after a pause he said i dont say no and i dont say yes but he added grimly it strikes me wed better wait till we get clear o these woods afore you think o your sacramento lodgings  the major did not reply the day had worn on but the fire now completely encircling them opposed any passage in or out of that fateful barrier the smoke of the burning underbrush hung low around them in a bank equally impenetrable to vision they were as alone as shipwrecked sailors on an island girded by a horizon of clouds  im going to try to sleep said the major if your men come you can waken me  and if your men come said the sheriff dryly  shoot me  he lay down closed his eyes and to the sheriffs astonishment presently fell asleep the sheriff with his chin in his grimy hands sat and watched him as the day slowly darkened around them and the distant fires came out in more lurid intensity the face of the captive and outlawed murderer was singularly peaceful that of the captor and man of duty was haggard wild and perplexed  but even this changed soon the sleeping man stirred restlessly and uneasily his face began to work his lips to move tom he gasped suddenly tom  the sheriff bent over him eagerly the sleeping mans eyes were still closed beads of sweat stood upon his forehead he was dreaming  tom he whispered take me out of this placetake me out from these dogs and pimps and beggars listen tomtheyre sydney ducks ticketofleave men short card sharps and sneak thieves there isnt a gentleman among em there isnt one i dont loathe and hateand would grind under my heel elsewhere im a gentleman tomyes by godan officer and a gentleman ive served my country in the 9th cavalry that cub of west point knows it and despises me seeing me here in such company that sergeant knows iti recommended him for his first stripes for all he taunts medn him  come wake up said the sheriff harshly  the prisoner did not heed him the sheriff shook him roughly so roughly that the majors waistcoat and shirt dragged open disclosing his fine silk undershirt delicately worked and embroidered with golden thread at the sight of this abased and faded magnificence the sheriffs hand was stayed his eye wandered over the sleeping form before him yes the hair was dyed too near the roots it was quite white and grizzled the pomatum was coming off the pointed moustache and imperial the face in the light was very haggard the lines from the angles of the nostril and mouth were like deep halfhealed gashes the major was without doubt prematurely worn and played out  the sheriffs persistent eyes however seemed to effect what his ruder hand could not the sleeping man stirred awoke to full consciousness and sat up  are they here im ready he said calmly  no said the sheriff deliberately i only woke ye to say that ive been thinkin over what ye asked me and if we get to sacramento all right why ill do it and give ye that day and night at your old lodgings  thank you  the major reached out his hand the sheriff hesitated and then extended his own the hands of the two men clasped for the first and it would seem the last time  for the cub of west point was like most cubs irritable when thwarted and having been balked of his prey the deserter and possibly chaffed by his comrades for his profitless invasion of wynyards bar he had persuaded his commanding officer to give him permission to effect a recapture thus it came about that at dawn filing along the ridge on the outskirts of the fire his heart was gladdened by the sight of the halfbreedwith his hanging haversack belt and tattered army tunicevidently still a fugitive not a hundred yards away on the other side of the belt of fire running down the hill with another ragged figure at his side the command to halt was enforced by a single rifle shot over the fugitives headsbut they still kept on their flight then the boyofficer snatched a carbine from one of his men a volley rang out from the little troopthe shots of the privates mercifully high those of the officer and sergeant leveled with wounded pride and full of deliberate purpose the halfbreed fell so did his companion and rolling over together both lay still  but between the hunters and their fallen quarry reared a cheval de frise of flame and fallen timber impossible to cross the young officer hesitated shrugged his shoulders wheeled his men about and left the fire to correct any irregularity in his action  it did not however change contemporaneous history for a week later when wynyards bar discovered major overstone lying beside the man now recognized by them as the disguised sheriff of siskyou they rejoiced at this unfailing evidence of their lost leaders unequaled prowess that he had again killed a sheriff and fought a whole posse yielding only with his life was never once doubted and kept his memory green in sierran chronicles long after wynyards bar had itself become a memory     a rose of glenbogie   the american consul at st kentigern stepped gloomily from the train at whistlecrankie station for the last twenty minutes his spirits had been slowly sinking before the drifting procession past the carriage windows of dull gray and brown hillsmammiform in shape but so cold and sterile in expression that the swathes of yellow mist which lay in their hollows like soiled guipure seemed a gratuitous affectation of modesty and when the train moved away mingling its escaping steam with the slower mists of the mountain he found himself alone on the platformthe only passenger and apparently the sole occupant of the station he was gazing disconsolately at his trunk which had taken upon itself a human loneliness in the emptiness of the place when a railway porter stepped out of the solitary signalbox where he had evidently been performing a double function and lounged with exasperating deliberation towards him he was a hardfeatured man with a thin fringe of yellowgray whiskers that met under his chin like dirty strings to tie his cap on with  yell be goin to glenbogie house im thinkin he said moodily  the consul said that he was  i kenned it yell no be gettin any machine to tak ye there theyll be sending a carriage for yeif yere expected he glanced half doubtfully at the consul as if he was not quite so sure of it  but the consul believed he was expected and felt relieved at the certain prospect of a conveyance the porter meanwhile surveyed him moodily  yell be seein mistress macspadden there  the consul was surprised into a little overconsciousness mrs macspadden was a vivacious acquaintance at st kentigern whom he certainlyand not without some satisfactionexpected to meet at glenbogie house he raised his eyes inquiringly to the porters  yell no be rememberin me i had a machine in st kentigern and drove ye to macspaddens ferry often far far too often shes a strange flagrantitious creature her husbands but a puir fule im thinkin and ye did yersel nae guid gaunin there  it was a besetting weakness of the consuls that his sense of the ludicrous was too often reached before his more serious perceptions the absurd combination of the bleak inhospitable desolation before him and the sepulchral complacency of his selfelected monitor quite upset his gravity  ay yell be laughin the noo returned the porter with gloomy significance  the consul wiped his eyes still he said demurely i trust you wont object to my giving you sixpence to carry my box to the carriage when it comes and let the morality of this transaction devolve entirely upon me unless he continued even more gravely as a spick and span brougham drawn by two thoroughbreds dashed out of the mist up to the platform unless you prefer to state the case to those two gentlemenpointing to the smart coachman and footman on the boxand take their opinion as to the propriety of my proceeding any further it seems to me that their consciences ought to be consulted as well as yours im only a stranger here and am willing to do anything to conform to the local custom  its a saxpence yell be payin anyway said the porter grimly shouldering the trunk but ill be no takin any other mons opinion on matters of my am dooty and conscience  ah said the consul gravely then youll perhaps be allowing me the same privilege  the porters face relaxed and a gleam of approvalpurely intellectual howevercame into his eyes  ye were always a smooth deevel wi your tongue mr consul he said shouldering the box and walking off to the carriage  nevertheless as soon as he was fairly seated and rattling away from the station the consul had a flashing conviction that he had not only been grievously insulted but also that he had allowed the wife of an acquaintance to be spoken of disrespectfully in his presence and he had done nothing yesit was like himhe had laughed at the absurdity of the impertinence without resenting it another man would have slapped the porters face for an instant he hung out of the carriage window intent upon ordering the coachman to drive back to the station but the reflectionagain a ludicrous onethat he would now be only bringing witnesses to a scene which might provoke a scandal more invidious to his acquaintance checked him in time but his spirits momentarily diverted by the porters effrontery sunk to a lower ebb than before  the clattering of his horses hoofs echoed back from the rocky walls that occasionally hemmed in the road was not enlivening but was less depressing than the recurring monotony of the open the scenery did not suggest wildness to his alien eyes so much as it affected him with a vague sense of scorbutic impoverishment it was not the loneliness of unfrequented nature for there was a wellkept carriage road traversing its dreariness and even when the hillside was clothed with scanty verdure there were outcrops of smooth glistening weatherworn rocks showing like bare brown knees under the all too imperfectly kilted slopes and at a little distance lifting above a black drift of firs were the square rigid sky lines of glenbogie house standing starkly against the cold lingering northern twilight as the vehicle turned and rolled between two square stone gateposts the long avenue before him though as well kept as the road was but a slight improvement upon the outer sterility and the dark irongray rectangular mansion beyond guiltless of external decoration even to the outlines of its small lustreless windows opposed the grim inhospitable prospect with an equally grim inhospitable front there were a few moments more of rapid driving a swift swishing over soft gravel the opening of a heavy door into a narrow vestibule and thena sudden sense of exquisitely diffused light and warmth from an arched and galleried central hall the sounds of light laughter and subdued voices half lost in the airy space between the lofty pictured walls the luxury of color in trophies armor and hangings one or two careless groups before the recessed hearth or at the centre table and the halted figure of a pretty woman on the broad slow staircase the contrast was sharp ironical and bewildering  so much so that the consul when he had followed the servant to his room was impelled to draw aside the heavy windowcurtains and look out again upon the bleak prospect it had half obliterated the wing in which he was placed overhung a dark ravine or gully choked with shrubs and brambles that grew in a new luxuriance as he gazed a large black bird floated upwards slowly from its depths circled around the house with a few quick strokes of its wing and then sped awaya black boltin one straight undeviating line towards the paling north he still gazed into the abysshalf expecting another even fancying he heard the occasional stir and flutter of obscure life below and the melancholy call of nightfowl a longforgotten fragment of old english verse began to haunt him       hark the raven flaps hys wing         in the briered dell belowe      hark the dethe owl loude doth synge         to the night maers as thaie goe  now what put that stuff in my head he said as he turned impatiently from the window and why does this house with all its interior luxury hypocritically oppose such a forbidding front to its neighbors then it occurred to him that perhaps the architect instinctively felt that a more opulent and elaborate exterior would only bring the poverty of surrounding nature into greater relief but he was not in the habit of troubling himself with abstruse problems a nearer recollection of the pretty frock he had seen on the staircasein whose wearer he had just recognized his vivacious friendturned his thoughts to her he remembered how at their first meeting he had been interested in her bright audacity unconventionality and high spirits which did not however amuse him as greatly as his later suspicion that she was playing a selfelected role often with difficulty opposition and feverishness rather than spontaneity he remembered how he had watched her in the obtrusive assumption of a new fashion in some reckless departure from an old one or in some ostentatious disregard of certain hard and set rules of st kentigern but that it never seemed to him that she was the happier for it he even fancied that her mirth at such times had an undue nervousness that her pluckwhich was undoubtedhad something of the defiance of despair and that her persistence often had the grimness of duty rather than the thoughtlessness of pure amusement what was she trying to dowhat was she trying to undo or forget her married life was apparently happy and even congenial her young husband was clever complaisant yet honestly devoted to her even to the extension of a certain camaraderie to her admirers and a chivalrous protection by halfparticipation in her maddest freaks nor could he honestly say that her attitude towards his own sexalthough marked by a freedom that often reached the verge of indiscretionconveyed the least suggestion of passion or sentiment the consul more perceptive than analytical found her a puzzlewho was perhaps the least mystifying to others who were content to sum up her eccentricities under the single vague epithet fast most women disliked her she had a few associates among them but no confidante and even these were so unlike her again as to puzzle him still more and yet he believed himself strictly impartial  he walked to the window again and looked down upon the ravine from which the darkness now seemed to be slowly welling up and obliterating the landscape and then taking a book from his valise settled himself in the easychair by the fire he was in no hurry to join the party below whom he had duly recognized and greeted as he passed through they or their prototypes were familiar friends there was the recently created baronet whose bloody hand had apparently wiped out the stains of his earlier radicalism and whose former provincial selfrighteousness had been supplanted by an equally provincial skepticism there was his wife who through all the difficulties of her changed position had kept the stalwart virtues of the scotch bourgeoisie and wasdecent there were the two native lairds that reminded him of parts of speech one being distinctly alluded to as a definite article and the other being of something and apparently governed always by that possessive case there were two or three workersmen of power and ability in their several vocations indeed there was the general overproportion of intellect characteristic of such scotch gatherings and often in excess of minor social qualities there was the usual foreigner with latin quickness eagerness and misapprehending adaptability and there was the solitary englishmanperhaps less generously equipped than the otherswhom everybody differed from ridiculed and then looked up to and imitated there were the halfdozen smartly frocked women who far from being the females of the foregoing species were quite indistinctive with the single exception of an american wife who was infinitely more scotch than her scotch husband  suddenly he became aware of a faint rustling at his door and what seemed to be a slight tap on the panel he rose and opened itthe long passage was dark and apparently empty but he fancied he could detect the quick swish of a skirt in the distance as he reentered his room his eye fell for the first time on a rose whose stalk was thrust through the keyhole of his door the consul smiled at this amiable solution of a mystery it was undoubtedly the playful mischievousness of the vivacious macspadden he placed it in waterintending to wear it in his coat at dinner as a gentle recognition of the fair donors courtesy  night had thickened suddenly as from a passing cloud he lit the two candles on his dressingtable gave a glance into the now scarcely distinguishable abyss below his window as he drew the curtains and by the more diffused light for the first time surveyed his room critically it was a larger apartment than that usually set aside for bachelors the heavy fourposter had a conjugal reserve about it and a tall cheval glass and certain minor details of the furniture suggested that it had been used for a married couple he knew that the guestrooms in country houses as in hotels carried no suggestion or flavor of the last tenant and therefore lacked color and originality and he was consequently surprised to find himself impressed with some distinctly novel atmosphere he was puzzling himself to discover what it might be when he again became aware of cautious footsteps apparently halting outside his door this time he was prepared with a half smile he stepped softly to the door and opened it suddenly to his intense surprise he was face to face with a man  but his discomfiture was as nothing compared to that of the strangerwhom he at once recognized as one of his fellowgueststhe youthful laird of whistlecrankie the young fellows healthy color at once paled then flushed a deep crimson and a forced smile stiffened his mouth  ibeg your parrrdon he said with a nervous brusqueness that brought out his accent i couldna find ma room itll be changed and i  perhaps i have got it interrupted the consul smilingly ive only just come and theyve put me in here  nae nae said the young man hurriedly its no thiss that is its no mine noo  wont you come in suggested the consul politely holding open the door  the young man entered the room with the quick strides but the mechanical purposelessness of embarrassment then he stiffened and stood erect yet in spite of all this he was strikingly picturesque and unconventional in his highland dress worn with the freedom of long custom and a certain lithe barbaric grace as the consul continued to gaze at him encouragingly the quick resentful pride of a shy man suddenly mantled his high cheekbones and with an abrupt ill not deesturb ye longer he strode out of the room  the consul watched the easy swing of his figure down the passage and then closed the door delightful creature he said musingly and not so very unlike an apache chief either but what was he doing outside my door and was it he who left that rosenot as a delicate highland attention to an utter stranger butthe consuls mouth suddenly expandedto some fair previous occupant or was it really his roomhe looked as if he were lyingandhere the consuls mouth expanded even more wickedlyand mrs macspadden had put the flower there for him this implied snub to his vanity was however more than compensated by his wicked anticipation of the pretty perplexity of his fair friend when he should appear at dinner with the flower in his own buttonhole it would serve her right the arrant flirt but here he was interrupted by the entrance of a tall housemaid with his hot water  i am afraid ive dispossessed mrmrkilcraithie rather prematurely said the consul lightly  to his infinite surprise the girl answered with grim decision nane too soon  the consul stared i mean he explained that i found him hesitating here in the passage looking for his room  ay hes always hoaverin and glowerin in the passagesbut its no for his room and its a deesgrace to decent christian folk his carryin on wi married weemenmebbee theyre nae better than he  that will do said the consul curtly he had no desire to encourage a repetition of the railway porters freedom  yell no fash yoursel aboot him continued the girl without heeding the rebuff its no the meestreess wish that hes keepit here in the wing reserved for married folk and shes no sorry for the excuse to pit ye in his place yell be married yoursel im hearin but i ken yes nae mair to be lippened tae for that  this was too much for the consuls gravity im afraid he said with diplomatic gayety that although i am married as i havent my wife with me ive no right to this superior accommodation and comfort but you can assure your mistress that ill try to deserve them  ay said the girl but with no great confidence in her voice as she grimly quitted the room  when our foots upon our native heath whether our names macgregor or kilcraithie it would seem that we must tread warily mused the consul as he began to dress but im glad she didnt see that rose or my reputation would have been ruined here another knock at the door arrested him he opened it impatiently to a tall gillie who instantly strode into the room there was such another suggestion of kilcraithie in the man and his manner that the consul instantly divined that he was kilcraithies servant  ill be takin some bit things that yon whistlecrankie left said the gillie gravely with a stolid glance around the room  certainly said the consul help yourself he continued his dressing as the man began to rummage in the empty drawers the consul had his back towards him but looking in the glass of the dressingtable he saw that the gillie was stealthily watching him suddenly he passed before the mantelpiece and quickly slipped the rose from its glass into his hand  ill trouble you to put that back said the consul quietly without turning round the gillie slid a quick glance towards the door but the consul was before him i dont think that was left by your master he said in an ostentatiously calm voice for he was conscious of an absurd and inexplicable tumult in his blood and perhaps youd better put it back  the man looked at the flower with an attention that might have been merely ostentatious and replaced it in the glass  a thocht it was hiss  and i think it isnt said the consul opening the door  yet when the man had passed out he was by no means certain that the flower was not kilcraithies he was even conscious that if the young laird had approached him with a reasonable explanation or appeal he would have yielded it up yet here he waslooking angrily pale in the glass his eyes darker than they should be and with an unmistakable instinct to do battle for this idiotic gage was there some morbid disturbance in the air that was affecting him as it had kilcraithie he tried to laugh but catching sight of its sardonic reflection in the glass became grave again he wondered if the gillie had been really looking for anything his master had lefthe had certainly taken nothing he opened one or two of the drawers and found only a womans tortoiseshell hairpinoverlooked by the footman when he had emptied them for the consuls clothes it had been probably forgotten by some fair and previous tenant to kilcraithie the consul looked at his watchit was time to go down he grimly pinned the fateful flower in his buttonhole and halfdefiantly descended to the drawingroom  here however he was inclined to relax when from a group of pretty women the bright gray eyes of mrs macspadden caught his were suddenly diverted to the lapel of his coat and then leaped up to his again with a sparkle of mischief but the guests were already pairing off in dinner couples and as they passed out of the room he saw that she was on the arm of kilcraithie yet as she passed him she audaciously turned her head and in a mischievous affectation of jealous reproach murmured  so soon  at dinner she was too far removed for any conversation with him although from his seat by his hostess he could plainly see her saucy profile midway up the table but to his surprise her companion kilcraithie did not seem to be responding to her gayety by turns abstracted and feverish his glances occasionally wandered towards the end of the table where the consul was sitting for a few moments he believed that the affair of the flower combined perhaps with the overhearing of mrs macspaddens mischievous sentence rankled in the lairds barbaric soul but he became presently aware that kilcraithies eyes eventually rested upon a quietlooking blonde near the hostess yet the lady not only did not seem to be aware of it but her face was more often turned towards the consul and their eyes had once or twice met he had been struck by the fact that they were halfveiled but singularly unimpassioned eyes with a certain expression of cold wonderment and criticism quite inconsistent with their veiling nor was he surprised when after a preliminary whispering over the plates his hostess presented him the lady was the young wife of the middleaged dignitary who seated further down the table opposite mrs macspadden was apparently enjoying that ladys wildest levities the consul bowed the lady leaned a little forward  we were saying what a lovely rose you had  the consuls inward response was hang that flower his outward expression was the modest query  is it so peculiar  no but its very pretty would you allow me to see it  disengaging the flower from his buttonhole he handed it to her oddly enough it seemed to him that half the table was watching and listening to them suddenly the lady uttered a little cry dear me its full of thorns of course you picked and arranged it yourself for any lady would have wrapped something around the stalk  but here there was a burlesque outcry and a goodhumored protest from the gentlemen around her against this manifestly leading question its no fair yell not answer herfor the dignity of our sex yet in the midst of it it suddenly occurred to the consul that there had been a slip of paper wrapped around it which had come off and remained in the keyhole the blue eyes of the lady were meanwhile sounding his but he only smiled and said  then it seems it is peculiar  when the conversation became more general he had time to observe other features of the lady than her placid eyes her light hair was very long and grew low down the base of her neck her mouth was firm the upper lip slightly compressed in a thin red line but the lower one although equally precise at the corners became fuller in the centre and turned over like a scarlet leaf or as it struck him suddenly like the telltale drop of blood on the mouth of a vampire yet she was very composed practical and decorous and as the talk grew more animatedand in the vicinity of mrs macspadden more audaciousshe kept a smiling reserve of expressionwhich did not however prevent her from following that lively lady whom she evidently knew with a kind of encouraging attention  kate is in full fling tonight she said to the hostess lady macquoich smiled ambiguouslyso ambiguously that the consul thought it necessary to interfere for his friend she seems to say what most of us think but i am afraid very few of us could voice as innocently he smilingly suggested  she is a great friend of yours returned the lady looking at him through her halfveiled lids she has made us quite envy her  and i am afraid made it impossible for me to either sufficiently thank her or justify her taste he said quietly yet he was vexed at an unaccountable resentment which had taken possession of himwho but a few hours before had only laughed at the porters criticism  after the ladies had risen the consul with an instinct of sympathy was moving up towards jock macspadden who sat nearer the host when he was stopped midway of the table by the dignitary who had sat opposite to mrs macspadden your frien is maist amusing wi her audacious tongueay and her audacious ways he said with large official patronage and weve enjoyed her here immensely but i hae mae doots if mae leddy macquoich taks as kindly to them you and imen of the wurrld i may saywe understand them for a their worth ayma wife too with whom i observed ye speakinis maist tolerant of her but man its extraordinarhe lowered his voice slightlythat yon husband of hers does na check her freedoms with kilcraithie i wadna say anythin was wrong ye ken but is he no over confident and conceited aboot his wife  i see you dont know him said the consul smilingly and id be delighted to make you acquainted jock he continued raising his voice as he turned towards macspadden let me introduce you to sir alan deeside who dont know you although hes a great admirer of your wife and unheeding the embarrassed protestations of sir alan and the laughing assertions of jock that they were already acquainted he moved on beside his host that hospitable knight who had been airing his knowledge of london smart society to his english guest with a singular mixture of assertion and obsequiousness here stopped short ay sit down laddie it was so guid of ye to come but im thinkin at your end of the table ye lost the bit fun of mistress macspadden eh but she was unco lively tonight twas all kilcraithie could do to keep her from proposin your health with hieland honors and offerin to lead off with her ain foot on the table ay and shed ha done it and thats a braw rose shes been givin yeand ye got out of it claverly wi lady deeside  when he left the table with the others to join the ladies the same unaccountable feeling of mingled shyness and nervous irascibility still kept possession of him he felt that in his present mood he could not listen to any further criticisms of his friend without betraying some unwonted heat and as his companions filed into the drawingroom he slipped aside in the hope of recovering his equanimity by a few moments reflection in his own room he glided quickly up the staircase and entered the corridor the passage that led to his apartment was quite dark especially before his door which was in a bay that really ended the passage he was consequently surprised and somewhat alarmed at seeing a shadowy female figure hovering before it he instinctively halted the figure became more distinct from some luminous halo that seemed to encompass it it struck him that this was only the light of his fire thrown through his open door and that the figure was probably that of a servant before it who had been arranging his room he started forward again but at the sound of his advancing footsteps the figure and the luminous glow vanished and he arrived blankly face to face with his own closed door he looked around the dim bay it was absolutely vacant it was equally impossible for any one to have escaped without passing him there was only his room left a halfnervous halfsuperstitious thrill crept over him as he suddenly grasped the handle of the door and threw it open the leaping light of his fire revealed its emptiness no one was there he lit the candle and peered behind the curtains and furniture and under the bed the room was as vacant and undisturbed as when he left it  had it been a trick of his senses or a bonafide apparition he had never heard of a ghost at glenbogiethe house dated back some fifty years sir john macquoichs tardy knighthood carried no such impedimenta he looked down wonderingly on the flower in his buttonhole was there something uncanny in that innocent blossom but here he was struck by another recollection and examined the keyhole of his door with the aid of the tortoiseshell hairpin he dislodged the paper he had forgotten it was only a thin spiral strip apparently the white outer edge of some newspaper and it certainly seemed to be of little service as a protection against the thorns of the rosestalk he was holding it over the fire about to drop it into the blaze when the flame revealed some pencilmarks upon it taking it to the candle he read deeply bitten into the paper by a hard pencilpoint at halfpast one there was nothing elseno signature but the handwriting was not mrs macspaddens  then whose was it that of the mysterious figure whom he had just seen had he been selected as the medium of some spiritual communication and perhaps a ghostly visitation later on or was he the victim of some clever trick he had once witnessed such dubious attempts to relieve the monotony of a country house he again examined the room carefully but without avail well the mystery or trick would be revealed at halfpast one it was a somewhat inconvenient hour certainly he looked down at the baleful gift in his buttonhole and for a moment felt inclined to toss it in the fire but this was quickly followed by his former revulsion of resentment and defiance no he would wear it no matter what happened until its material or spiritual owner came for it he closed the door and returned to the drawingroom  midway of the staircase he heard the droning of pipes there was dancing in the drawingroom to the music of the gorgeous piper who had marshaled them to dinner he was not sorry as he had no inclination to talk and the one confidence he had anticipated with mrs macspadden was out of the question now he had no right to reveal his later discovery he lingered a few moments in the hall the buzzing of the pipers drones gave him that impression of confused and blindly aggressive intoxication which he had often before noticed in this barbaric instrument and had always seemed to him as the origin of its martial inspiration from this he was startled by voices and steps in the gallery he had just quitted but which came from the opposite direction to his room it was kilcraithie and mrs macspadden as she caught sight of him he fancied she turned slightly and aggressively pale with a certain hardening of her mischievous eyes nevertheless she descended the staircase more deliberately than her companion who brushed past him with an embarrassed selfconsciousness quite in advance of her she lingered for an instant  you are not dancing she said  no  perhaps you are more agreeably employed  at this exact moment certainly  she cast a disdainful glance at him crossed the hall and followed kilcraithie  hang me if i understand it all mused the consul by no means goodhumoredly does she think i have been spying upon her and her noble chieftain but its just as well that i didnt tell her anything  he turned to follow them in the vestibule he came upon a figure which had halted before a large pierglass he recognized m delfosse the french visitor complacently twisting the peak of his henri quatre beard he would have passed without speaking but the frenchman glanced smilingly at the consul and his buttonhole again the flower  monsieur is decore he said gallantly  the consul assented but added not so gallantly that though they were not in france he might still be unworthy of it the baleful flower had not improved his temper nor did the fact that as he entered the room he thought the people stared at himuntil he saw that their attention was directed to lady deeside who had entered almost behind him from his hostess who had offered him a seat beside her he gathered that m delfosse and kilcraithie had each temporarily occupied his room but that they had been transferred to the other wing apart from the married couples and young ladies because when they came upstairs from the billiard and card room late they sometimes disturbed the fair occupants nothere were no ghosts at glenbogie mysterious footsteps had sometimes been heard in the ladies corridor butwith peculiar significanceshe was afraid they could be easily accounted for sir alan whose room was next to the macspaddens had been disturbed by them  he was glad when it was time to escape to the billiardroom and tobacco for a while he forgot the evenings adventure but eventually found himself listening to a discussioncarried on over steaming tumblers of toddyin regard to certain predispositions of the always debatable sex  yell not always judge by appearances said sir alan yell mind the story o the meenesters wife of aiblinnoch it was thocht that she was ower free wi one o the parishionersay it was the claish o the whole kirk while none dare tell the meenester hisselfbein a bookish simple unsuspectin creeter at last one o the elders bethocht him of a bit plan of bringing it home to the wife through the gospel lips of her ain husband so he intimated to the meenester his suspicions of grievous laxity amang the female flock and of the necessity of a special sermon on the seventh command the puir man consentedalthough he dinna ken why and whereforeand preached a gran sermon ay man it was crammed wi denunciation and an emptyin o the vials o wrath the congregation sat dumb as huddled sheepwhen they were no starin and gowpin at the meenesters wife settin bolt upright in her place and then when the air was blue wi sulphur frae tae pit the meenesters wife up rises man ivry eye was spearin herivry lug was prickt towards her and she goes out in the aisle facin the meenester and  sir alan paused  and what demanded the eager auditory  she pickit up the elders wife sobbin and tearin her hair in strong hysterics  at the end of a relieved pause sir alan slowly concluded it was said that the elder removed frae aiblinnoch wi his wife but no till he had effected a change of meenesters  it was already past midnight and the party had dropped off one by one with the exception of deeside macquoich the young englishman and a scotch laird who were playing pokeran amusement which he understood they frequently protracted until three in the morning it was nearly time for him to expect his mysterious visitant before he went upstairs he thought he would take a breath of the outer evening air and throwing a mackintosh over his shoulders passed out of the garden door of the billiardroom to his surprise it gave immediately upon the fringe of laurel that hung over the chasm  it was quite dark the few farspread stars gave scarcely any light and the slight auroral glow towards the north was all that outlined the fringe of the abyss which might have proved dangerous to any unfamiliar wanderer a damp breath of sodden leaves came from its depths beside him stretched the long dark facade of the wing he inhabited his own window the only one that showed a faint light a few paces beyond a singular structure of rustic wood and glass combining the peculiarities of a sentrybox a summerhouse and a shelter was built against the blank wall of the wing he imagined the monotonous prospect from its windows of the tufted chasm the coldly profiled northern hills beyondand shivered a little further on sunk in the wall like a postern was a small door that evidently gave easy egress to seekers of this stern retreat in the still air a faint grating sound like the passage of a foot across gravel came to him as from the distance he paused thinking he had been followed by one of the cardplayers but saw no one and the sound was not repeated  it was past one he reentered the billiardroom passed the unchanged group of cardplayers and taking a candlestick from the hall ascended the dark and silent staircase into the corridor the light of his candle cast a flickering halo around himbut did not penetrate the gloomy distance he at last halted before his door gave a scrutinizing glance around the embayed recess and opened the door half expectantly but the room was empty as he had left it  it was a quarter past one he threw himself on the bed without undressing and fixed his eyes alternately on the door and his watch perhaps the unwonted seriousness of his attitude struck him but a sudden sense of the preposterousness of the whole situation of his solemnly ridiculous acceptance of a series of mere coincidences as a foregone conclusion overcame him and he laughed but in the same breath he stopped  there were footsteps approachingcautious footstepsbut not at his door they were in the roomno in the wall just behind him they were descending some staircase at the back of his bedhe could hear the regular tap of a light slipper from step to step and the rustle of a skirt seemingly in his very ear they were becoming less and less distinctthey were gone he sprang to his feet but almost at the same instant he was conscious of a sudden chillthat seemed to him as physical as it was mental the room was slowly suffused with a cool sodden breath and the dank odor of rotten leaves he looked at the candleits flame was actually deflecting in this mysterious blast it seemed to come from a recess for hanging clothes topped by a heavy cornice and curtain he had examined it before but he drew the curtain once more aside the cold current certainly seemed to be more perceptible there he felt the redclothed backing of the interior and his hand suddenly grasped a doorknob it turned and the whole structurecornice and curtainsswung inwards towards him with the door on which it was hung behind it was a dark staircase leading from the floor above to some outer door below whose opening had given ingress to the chill humid current from the ravine this was the staircase where he had just heard the footstepsand this was no doubt the door through which the mysterious figure had vanished from his room a few hours before  taking his candle he cautiously ascended the stairs until he found himself on the landing of the suites of the married couples and directly opposite to the rooms of the macspaddens and deesides he was about to descend again when he heard a faroff shout a scuffling sound on the outer gravel and the frenzied shaking of the handle of the lower door he had hardly time to blow out his candle and flatten himself against the wall when the door was flung open and a woman frantically flew up the staircase his own door was still open from within its depths the light of his fire projected a flickering beam across the steps as she rushed past it the light revealed her face it needed not the peculiar perfume of her garments as she swept by his concealed figure to make him recognizelady deeside  amazed and confounded he was about to descend when he heard the lower door again open but here a sudden instinct bade him pause turn and reascend to the upper landing there he calmly relit his candle and made his way down to the corridor that overlooked the central hall the sound of suppressed voicesspeaking with the exhausted pauses that come from spent excitementmade him cautious again and he halted it was the card party slowly passing from the billiardroom to the hall  ye owe it yourselto your wifenot to pit up with it a day longer said the subdued voice of sir alan man ye war in an ace o havin a braw scandal  could ye no get your wife to speak till her responded macquoich to gie her a hint that shes better awa out of this lady deeside has some influence wi her  the consul ostentatiously dropped the extinguisher from his candlestick the party looked up quickly their faces were still flushed and agitated but a new restraint seemed to come upon them on seeing him  i thought i heard a row outside said the consul explanatorily  they each looked at their host without speaking  oh ay said macquoich with simulated heartiness a bit fuss between the kilcraithie and yon frenchman but theyre baith goin in the mornin  i thought i heard macspaddens voice said the consul quietly  there was a dead silence then macquoich said hurriedly  is he no in his roomin bedasleepman  i really dont know i didnt inquire said the consul with a slight yawn good night  he turned not without hearing them eagerly whispering again and entered the passage leading to his own room as he opened the door he was startled to find the subject of his inquiryjock macspaddenquietly seated in his armchair by his fire  jock  dont be alarmed old man i came up by that staircase and saw the door open and guessed youd be returning soon but it seemed you went round by the corridor he said glancing curiously at the consuls face did you meet the crowd  yes jock what does it all mean  macspadden laughed it means that i was just in time to keep kilbraithie from chucking delfosse down that ravine but they both scooted when they saw me by jove i dont know which was the most frightened  but said the consul slowly what was it all about jock  some gallantry of that dd frenchman whos trying to do some womanstalking up here and jealousy of kilcraithies whos just got enough of his forbears blood in him to think nothing of sticking three inches of his dirk in the wame of the man that crosses him but i say continued jock leaning easily back in his chair you ought to know something of all this this room old man was used as a sort of rendezvous having two outlets dont you see when they couldnt get at the summerhouse below by jove they both had it in turnskilcraithie and the frenchmanuntil lady macquoich got wind of something swept them out and put you in it  the consul rose and approached his friend with a grave face jock i do know something about itmore about it than any one thinks you and i are old friends shall i tell you what i know  jocks handsome face became a trifle paler but his frank clear eyes rested steadily on the consuls  go on he said  i know that this flower which i am wearing was the signal for the rendezvous this evening said the consul slowly and this paper taking it from his pocket contained the time of the meeting written in the ladys own hand i know who she was for i saw her face as plainly as i see yours now by the light of the same fire it was as pale but not as frank as yours old man that is what i know but i know also what people think they know and for that reason i put that paper in your hand it is yoursyour vindicationyour revenge if you choose do with it what you like  jock with unchanged features and undimmed eyes took the paper from the consuls hand without looking at it  i may do with it what i like he repeated  yes  he was about to drop it into the fire but the consul stayed his hand  are you not going to look at the handwriting first  there was a moment of silence jock raised his eyes with a sudden flash of pride in them and said no  the friends stood side by side grasping each others hands as the burning paper leaped up the chimney in a vanishing flame  do you think you have done quite right jock in view of any scandal you may hear  quite you see old man i know my wifebut i dont think that deeside knows his     the mystery of the hacienda   dick bracy gazed again at the hacienda de los osos and hesitated there it layits low whitewashed walls looking like a quartz outcrop of the long lazy hillsideunmistakably hot treeless and staring broadly in the uninterrupted californian sunlight yet he knew that behind those blistering walls was a reposeful patio surrounded by lowpitched verandas that the casa was full of roomy corridors nooks and recesses in which lurked the shadows of a century and that hidden by the further wall was a lonely old garden hoary with gnarled peartrees and smothered in the spice and dropping leaves of its baking roses he knew that although the unwinking sun might glitter on its red tiles and the unresting trade winds whistle around its angles it always kept one unvarying temperature and untroubled calm as if the dignity of years had triumphed over the changes of ephemeral seasons but would others see it with his eyes would his practical housekeeping aunt and his pretty modern cousin  well what do you say speak the word and you can go into it with your folks tomorrow and i reckon you wont want to take anything either for youll find everything therejust as the old don left it i dont want it the land is good enough for me i shall have my vaqueros and rancheros to look after the crops and the cattle and they wont trouble you for their sheds and barns will be two miles away you can stay there as long as you like and go when you choose you might like to try it for a spell its all the same to me but i should think it the sort of thing a man like you would fancy and it seems the right thing to have you there wellwhat shall it be is it a go  dick knew that the speaker was sincere it was an offer perfectly characteristic of his friend the western millionaire who had halted by his side and he knew also that the slow lifting of his bridlerein preparatory to starting forward again was the businesslike gesture of a man who wasted no time even over his acts of impulsive liberality in another moment he would dismiss the unaccepted offer from his mindwithout concern and without resentment  thank youit is a go said dick gratefully  nevertheless when he reached his own little home in the outskirts of san francisco that night he was a trifle nervous in confiding to the lady who was at once his aunt and housekeeper the fact that he was now the possessor of a huge mansion in whose patio alone the little eightroomed villa where they had lived contentedly might be casually dropped you see aunt viney he hurriedly explained it would have been so ungrateful to have refused himand it really was an offer as spontaneous as it was liberal and then you see we need occupy only a part of the casa  and who will look after the other part said aunt viney grimly that will have to be kept tidy too and the servants for such a house where in heaven are they to come from or do they go with it  no said dick quickly the servants left with their old master when ringstone bought the property but well find servants enough in the neighborhoodmexican peons and indians you know  aunt viney sniffed and youll have to entertainif its a big house there are all your spanish neighbors theyll be gallivanting in and out all the time  they wont trouble us he returned with some hesitation you see theyre furious at the old don for disposing of his lands to an american and they wont be likely to look upon the strangers in the new place as anything but interlopers  oh that is it is it ejaculated aunt viney with a slight puckering of her lips i thought there was something  my dear aunt said dick with a sudden illogical heat which he tried to suppress i dont know what you mean by it and something ringstones offer was perfectly unselfish he certainly did not suppose that i would be affected any more than he would he by the childish sentimentality of these people over a legitimate everyday business affair the old don made a good bargain and simply sold the land he could no longer make profitable with his obsolete method of farming his gang of idle retainers and his noahs ark machinery to a man who knew how to use steam reapers and hired sensible men to work on shares nevertheless he was angry with himself for making any explanation and still more disturbed that he was conscious of a certain feeling that it was necessary  i was thinking said aunt viney quietly that if we invited anybody to stay with uslike cecily for exampleit might be rather dull for her if we had no neighbors to introduce her to  dick started he had not thought of this he had been greatly influenced by the belief that his pretty cousin who was to make them a visit would like the change and would not miss excitement we can always invite some girls down there and make our own company he answered cheerfully nevertheless he was dimly conscious that he had already made an airy castle of the old hacienda in which cecily and her aunt moved alone it was to cecily that he would introduce the old garden it was cecily whom he would accompany through the dark corridors and with whom he would lounge under the awnings of the veranda all this innocently and without prejudice or ulterior thought he was not yet in love with the pretty cousin whom he had seen but once or twice during the past few years but it was a possibility not unpleasant to occasionally contemplate yet it was equally possible that she might yearn for lighter companionship and accustomed amusement that the passionfringed garden and shadowhaunted corridor might be profaned by hoydenish romping and laughter or by that frivolous flirtation which in others he had always regarded as commonplace and vulgar  howbeit at the end of two weeks he found himself regularly installed in the hacienda de los osos his little household reenforced by his cousin cecily and three peons picked up at los pinos bore their transplantation with a singular equanimity that seemed to him unaccountable then occurred one of those revelations of character with which nature is always ready to trip up merely human judgment aunt viney an unrelenting widow of calm but unshaken dutch prejudices high but narrow in religious belief merged without a murmur into the position of chatelaine of this unconventional halflatin household accepting the situation without exaltation or criticism placid but unresponsive amidst the youthful enthusiasm of dick and cecily over each quaint detail her influence was nevertheless felt throughout the lingering length and shadowy breadth of the strange old house the indian and mexican servants at first awed by her practical superiority succumbed to her halfhumorous toleration of their incapacity and became her devoted slaves dick was astonished and even cecily was confounded do you know she said confidentially to her cousin that when that brown conchita thought to please aunty by wearing white stockings instead of going round as usual with her cinnamoncolored bare feet in yellow slipperswhich i was afraid would be enough to send aunty into conniption fitsshe actually told her very quietly to take them off and dress according to her habits and her station and you remember that in her big square bedroom there is a prayingstool and a ghastly crucifix at least three feet long in ivory and black quite too human for anything well when i offered to put them in the corridor she said i neednt trouble that really she hadnt noticed them and they would do very well where they were youd think she had been accustomed to this sort of thing all her life its just too sweet of her any way even if shes shamming and if she is she just does it to the life too and could give those spanish women points why she rode en pillion on manuels mule behind him holding on by his sash across to the corral yesterday and you should have seen manuel absolutely scrape the ground before her with his sombrero when he let her down indeed her tall erect figure in black lustreless silk appearing in a heavily shadowed doorway or seated in a recessed window gave a new and patrician dignity to the melancholy of the hacienda it was pleasant to follow this quietly ceremonious shadow gliding along the rose garden at twilight halting at times to bend stiffly over the bushes gardenshears in hand and carrying a little basket filled with withered but still odorous petals as if she were grimly gathering the faded roses of her youth  it was also probable that the lively cecilys appreciation of her aunt might have been based upon another virtue of that ladynamely her exquisite tact in dealing with the delicate situation evolved from the always possible relations of the two cousins it was not to be supposed that the servants would fail to invest the young people with southern romance and even believe that the situation was prearranged by the aunt with a view to their eventual engagement to deal with the problem openly yet without startling the consciousness of either dick or cecily to allow them the privileges of children subject to the occasional restraints of childhood to find certain household duties for the young girl that kept them naturally apart until certain hours of general relaxation to calmly ignore the meaning of her retainers smiles and glances and yet to goodhumoredly accept their interest as a kind of feudal loyalty was part of aunt vineys deep diplomacy cecily enjoyed her freedom and companionship with dick as she enjoyed the novel experiences of the old house the quaint faded civilization that it represented and the change and diversion always acceptable to youth she did not feel the absence of other girls of her own age neither was she aware that through this omission she was spared the necessity of a confidante or a rivalboth equally revealing to her thoughtless enjoyment they took their rides together openly and without concealment relating their adventures afterwards to aunt viney with a naivete and frankness that dreamed of no suppression the citybred cecily accustomed to horse exercise solely as an ornamental and artificial recreation felt for the first time the fearful joy of a dash across a leaguelong plain with no onlookers but the scattered wild horses she might startle up to scurry before her or race at her side small wonder that mounted on her fiery little mustang untrammeled by her short gray ridinghabit free as the wind itself that blew through the folds of her flannel blouse with her brown hair halfloosed beneath her slouched felt hat she seemed to dick a more beautiful and womanly figure than the stiff buckramed simulation of mans angularity and precision he had seen in the parks perhaps one day she detected this consciousness too plainly in his persistent eyes up to that moment she had only watched the glittering stretches of yellow grain in which occasional windshorn evergreen oaks stood midleg deep like cattle in water the distant silhouette of the sierras against the steely blue or perhaps the frankly happy face of the goodlooking young fellow at her side but it seemed to her now that an intruder had entered the fielda stranger before whom she was impelled to suddenly flyhalflaughingly halfaffrightedlythe anxious dick following wonderingly at her mustangs heels until she reached the gates of the hacienda where she fell into a gravity and seriousness that made him wonder still more he did not dream that his guileless cousin had discovered with a womans instinct a mysterious invader who sought to share their guileless companionship only to absorb it entirely and that its name waslove  the next day she was so greatly preoccupied with her household duties that she could not ride with him dick felt unaccountably lost perhaps this check to their daily intercourse was no less accelerating to his feelings than the vague motive that induced cecily to withhold herself he moped in the corridor he rode out alone bullying his mustang in proportion as he missed his cousins gentle companionship and circling aimlessly but still unconsciously around the hacienda as a centre of attraction the sun at last was sinking to the accompaniment of a rising wind which seemed to blow and scatter its broad rays over the shimmering plain until every slight protuberance was burnished into startling brightness the shadows of the short green oaks grew disproportionally long and all seemed to point to the whitewalled casa suddenly he started and instantly reined up  the figure of a young girl which he had not before noticed was slowly moving down the halfshadowed lane made by the two walls of the garden and the corral cecily perhaps she had come out to meet him he spurred forward but as he came nearer he saw that the figure and its attire were surely not hers he reined up again abruptly mortified at his disappointment and a little ashamed lest he should have seemed to have been following an evident stranger he vaguely remembered too that there was a trail to the high road through a little swale clothed with myrtle and thorn bush which he had just passed and that she was probably one of his reserved and secluded neighborsindeed her dress in that uncertain light looked half spanish this was more confusing since his rashness might have been taken for an attempt to force an acquaintance he wheeled and galloped towards the front of the casa as the figure disappeared at the angle of the wall  i dont suppose you ever see any of our neighbors said dick to his aunt casually  i really cant say returned the lady with quiet equanimity there were some extraordinarylooking foreigners on the road to san gregorio yesterday manuel who was driving me may have known who they werehe is a kind of indian papist himself you knowbut i didnt they might have been relations of his for all i know  at any other time dick would have been amused at this serene relegation of the lofty estudillos and peraltas to the caste of the indian convert but he was worried to think that perhaps cecily was really being bored by the absence of neighbors after dinner when they sought the rose garden he dropped upon the little lichenscarred stone bench by her side it was still warm from the sun the hot musk of the roses filled the air the whole garden shielded from the cool evening trade winds by its high walls still kept the glowing memory of the afternoon sunshine aunt viney with her garden basket on her arm moved ghostlike among the distant bushes  i hope you are not getting bored here he said after a slight inconsequent pause  does that mean that you are she returned raising her mischievous eyes to his  no but i thought you might find it lonely without neighbors  i stayed in today she said femininely replying to the unasked question because i fancied aunt viney might think it selfish of me to leave her alone so much  but you are not lonely  certainly not the young lady was delighted with the whole place with the quaint old garden the mysterious corridors the restful quiet of everything the picture of dear aunt vineywho was just the sweetest soul in the worldmoving about like the genius of the casa it was such a change to all her ideas she would never forget it it was so thoughtful of him dick to have given them all that pleasure  and the rides continued dick with the untactful pertinacity of the average man at such momentsyou are not tired of them  no she thought them lovely such freedom and freshness in the exercise so different from riding in the city or at wateringplaces where it was onehalf show and one was always thinking of ones habit or ones self one quite forgot ones self on that lovely plainwith everything so far away and only the mountains to look at in the distance nevertheless she did not lift her eyes from the point of the little slipper which had strayed beyond her skirt  dick was relieved but not voluble he could only admiringly follow the curves of her pretty arms and hands clasped lightly in her lap down to the point of the little slipper but even that charming vanishing point was presently withdrawnpossibly through some instinctfor the young lady had apparently not raised her eyes  im so glad you like it said dick earnestly yet with a nervous hesitation that made his speech seem artificial to his own ears you see ithat isi had an idea that you might like an occasional change of company its a great pity were not on speaking terms with one of these spanish families some of the men you know are really fine fellows with an oldworld courtesy that is very charming  he was surprised to see that she had lifted her head suddenly with a quick look that however changed to an amused and half coquettish smile  i am finding no fault with my present company she said demurely dropping her head and eyelids until a faint suffusion seemed to follow the falling lashes over her cheek i dont think you ought to undervalue it  if he had only spoken then the hot scent of the roses hung suspended in the air which seemed to be hushed around them in mute expectancy the shadows which were hiding aunt viney from view were also closing round the bench where they sat he was very near her he had only to reach out his hand to clasp hers which lay idly in her lap he felt himself glowing with a strange emanation he even fancied that she was turning mechanically towards him as a flower might turn towards the fervent sunlight but he could not speak he could scarcely collect his thoughts conscious though he was of the absurdity of his silence what was he waiting for what did he expect he was not usually bashful he was no coward there was nothing in her attitude to make him hesitate to give expression to what he believed was his first real passion but he could do nothing he even fancied that his face turned towards hers was stiffening into a vacant smile  the young girl rose i think i heard aunt viney call me she said constrainedly and made a hesitating step forward the spell which had held dick seemed to be broken suddenly he stretched forth his arm to detain her but the next step appeared to carry her beyond his influence and it was even with a half movement of rejection that she quickened her pace and disappeared down the path dick fell back dejectedly into his seat yet conscious of a feeling of relief that bewildered him  but only for a moment a recollection of the chance that he had impotently and unaccountably thrown away returned to him he tried to laugh albeit with a glowing cheek over the momentary bashfulness which he thought had overtaken him and which must have made him ridiculous in her eyes he even took a few hesitating steps in the direction of the path where she had disappeared the sound of voices came to his ear and the light ring of cecilys laughter the color deepened a little on his cheek he reentered the house and went to his room  the red sunset still faintly showing through the heavily recessed windows to the opposite wall made two luminous aisles through the darkness of the long low apartment from his easychair he watched the color drop out of the sky the yellow plain grow pallid and seem to stretch itself to infinite rest then a black line began to deepen and creep towards him from the horizon edge the day was done it seemed to him a day lost he had no doubt now but that he loved his cousin and the opportunity of telling her soof profiting by her predisposition of the momenthad passed she would remember herself she would remember his weak hesitancy she would despise him he rose and walked uneasily up and down and yetand it disgusted him with himself still morehe was again conscious of the feeling of relief he had before experienced a vague formula its better as it is who knows what might have come of it he found himself repeating without reason and without resignation  ashamed even of his seclusion he rose to join the little family circle which now habitually gathered around a table on the veranda of the patio under the rays of a swinging lamp to take their chocolate to his surprise the veranda was empty and dark a light shining from the inner drawingroom showed him his aunt in her armchair reading alone a slight thrill ran over him cecily might be still in the garden he noiselessly passed the drawingroom door turned into a long corridor and slipped through a grating in the wall into the lane that separated it from the garden the gate was still open a few paces brought him into the long alley of roses their strong perfumeconfined in the high hot wallsat first made him giddy this was followed by an inexplicable languor he turned instinctively towards the stone bench and sank upon it the long rows of calla lilies against the opposite wall looked ghostlike in the darkness and seemed to have turned their white faces towards him then he fancied that one had detached itself from the rank and was moving away he looked again surely there was something gliding along the wall a quick tremor of anticipation passed over him it was cecily who had lingered in the gardenperhaps to give him one more opportunity he rose quickly and stepped towards the apparition which had now plainly resolved itself into a slight girlish figure it slipped on beneath the trees he followed quicklyhis nervous hesitancy had vanished before what now seemed to be a halfcoy halfcoquettish evasion of him he called softly cecily but she did not heed him he quickened his paceshe increased hers they were both running she reached the angle of the wall where the gate opened upon the road suddenly she stopped as if intentionally in the clear open space before it he could see her distinctly the lace mantle slipped from her head and shoulders it was not cecily  but it was a face so singularly beautiful and winsome that he was as quickly arrested it was a womans deep passionate eyes and heavy hair joined to a childish oval of cheek and chin an infantine mouth and a little nose whose faintly curved outline redeemed the lower face from weakness and brought it into charming harmony with the rest a yellow rose was pinned in the lustrous black hair above the little ear a yellow silk shawl or mantle which had looked white in the shadows was thrown over one shoulder and twisted twice or thrice around the plump but petite bust the large black velvety eyes were fixed on his in half wonderment half amusement the lovely lips were parted in half astonishment and half a smile and yet she was like a picture a dreama materialization of ones most fanciful imaginingslike anything in fact but the palpable flesh and blood she evidently was standing only a few feet before him whose hurried breath he could see even now heaving her youthful breast  his own breath appeared suspended although his heart beat rapidly as he stammered out i beg your pardoni thought he stopped at the recollection that this was the second time he had followed her  she did not speak although her parted lips still curved with their faint coy smile then she suddenly lifted her right hand which had been hanging at her side clasping some long black object like a stick without any apparent impulse from her fingers the stick slowly seemed to broaden in her little hand into the segment of an opening disk that lifting to her face and shoulders gradually eclipsed the upper part of her figure until mounting higher the beautiful eyes and the yellow rose of her hair alone remained abovea large unfurled fan then the long eyelashes drooped as if in a mute farewell and they too disappeared as the fan was lifted higher the halfhidden figure appeared to glide to the gateway lingered for an instant and vanished the astounded dick stepped quickly into the road but fan and figure were swallowed up in the darkness  amazed and bewildered he stood for a moment breathless and irresolute it was no doubt the same stranger that he had seen before but who was she and what was she doing there if she were one of their spanish neighbors drawn simply by curiosity to become a trespasser why had she lingered to invite a scrutiny that would clearly identify her it was not the escapade of that giddy girl which the lower part of her face had suggested for such a one would have giggled and instantly flown it was not the deliberate act of a grave woman of the world for its sequel was so purposeless why had she revealed herself to him alone dick felt himself glowing with a halfshamed halfsecret pleasure then he remembered cecily and his own purpose in coming into the garden he hurriedly made a tour of the walks and shrubbery ostentatiously calling her yet seeing as in a dream only the beautiful eyes of the stranger still before him and conscious of an illdefined remorse and disloyalty he had never known before but cecily was not there and again he experienced the old sensation of relief  he shut the garden gate crossed the road and found the grille just closing behind a slim white figure he started for it was cecily but even in his surprise he was conscious of wondering how he could have ever mistaken the stranger for her she appeared startled too she looked pale and abstracted could she have been a witness of his strange interview  her first sentence dispelled the idea  i suppose you were in the garden she said with a certain timidity i didnt go thereit seemed so close and stuffybut walked a little down the lane  a moment before he would have eagerly told her his adventure but in the presence of her manifest embarrassment his own increased he concluded to tell her another time he murmured vaguely that he had been looking for her in the garden yet he had a flushing sense of falsehood in his reserve and they passed silently along the corridor and entered the patio together she lit the hanging lamp mechanically she certainly was pale her slim hand trembled slightly suddenly her eyes met his a faint color came into her cheek and she smiled she put up her hand with a girlish gesture towards the back of her head  what are you looking at is my hair coming down  no hesitated dick butithoughtyou were looking just a little pale  an aggressive ray slipped into her blue eyes  strange i thought you were just now at the grille you looked as if the roses hadnt agreed with you  they both laughed a little nervously and conchita brought the chocolate when aunt viney came from the drawingroom she found the two young people together and cecily in a gale of high spirits  she had had such a wonderfully interesting walk all by herself alone on the plain it was really so queer and elfish to find ones self where one could see nothing above or around one anywhere but stars stars above one to right and left of one and some so low down they seemed as if they were picketed on the plain it was so odd to find the horizon line at ones very feet like a castaway at sea and the wind it seemed to move one this way and that way for one could not see anything and might really be floating in the air only once she thought she saw something and was quite frightened  what was it asked dick quickly  well it was a large black object butit turned out only to be a horse  she laughed although she had evidently noticed her cousins eagerness and her own eyes had a nervous brightness  and where was dick all this while asked aunt viney quietly  cecily interrupted and answered for him briskly oh he was trying to make attar of rose of himself in the garden hes still stupefied by his own sweetness  if this means said aunt viney with matteroffact precision that youve been gallivanting all alone cecily on that common plain where youre likely to meet all sorts of foreigners and tramps and savages and heaven knows what other vermin i shall set my face against a repetition of it if you must go out and dick cant go with youand i must say that even you and he going out together there at night isnt exactly the kind of american christian example to set to our neighborsyou had better get concepcion to go with you and take a lantern  but there is nobody one meets on the plainat least nobody likely to harm one protested cecily  dont tell me said aunt viney decidedly havent i seen all sorts of queer figures creeping along by the brink after nightfall between san gregorio and the next rancho arent they always skulking backwards and forwards to mass and aguardiente  and i dont know why we should set any example to our neighbors we dont see much of them or they of us  of course not returned aunt viney because all proper spanish young ladies are shut up behind their grilles at night you dont see them traipsing over the plain in the darkness with or without cavaliers why don rafael would lock one of his sisters up in a convent and consider her disgraced forever if he heard of it  dick felt his cheeks burning cecily slightly paled yet both said eagerly together why what do you know about it aunty  a great deal returned aunt viney quietly holding her tatting up to the light and examining the stitches with a critical eye ive got my eyes about me thank heaven even if my ears dont understand the language and theres a great deal my dears that you young people might learn from these papists  and do you mean to say continued dick with a glowing cheek and an uneasy smile that spanish girls dont go out alone  no young lady goes out without her duenna said aunt viney emphatically of course theres the concha variety that go out without even stockings  as the conversation flagged after this and the young people once or twice yawned nervously aunt viney thought they had better go to bed  but dick did not sleep the beautiful face beamed out again from the darkness of his room the light that glimmered through his deepset curtainless windows had an odd trick of bringing out certain hanging articles or pieces of furniture into a resemblance to a mantled figure the deep velvety eyes fringed with long brown lashes again looked into his with amused childlike curiosity he scouted the harsh criticisms of aunt viney even while he shrank from proving to her her mistake in the quality of his mysterious visitant of course she was a ladyfar superior to any of her race whom he had yet met yet how should he find who she was his pride and a certain chivalry forbade his questioning the servantsbefore whom it was the rule of the household to avoid all reference to their neighbors he would make the acquaintance of the old padreperhaps he might talk he would ride early along the trail in the direction of the nearest ranchodon jose amadorsa thing he had hitherto studiously refrained from doing it was three miles away she must have come that distance but not alone doubtless she had kept her duenna in waiting in the road perhaps it was she who had frightened cecily had cecily told all she had seen her embarrassed manner certainly suggested more than she had told he felt himself turning hot with an indefinite uneasiness then he tried to compose himself after all it was a thing of the past the fair unknown had bribed the duenna for once no doubthad satisfied her girlish curiosityshe would not come again but this thought brought with it such a sudden sense of utter desolation a deprivation so new and startling that it frightened him was his head turned by the witcheries of some blackeyed schoolgirl whom he had seen but once orhe felt his cheeks glowing in the darknesswas it really a case of love at first sight and she herself had been impelled by the same yearning that now possessed him a delicious satisfaction followed that left a smile on his lips as if it had been a kiss he knew now why he had so strangely hesitated with cecily he had never really loved herhe had never known what love was till now  he was up early the next morning skimming the plain on the back of chu chu before the hacienda was stirring he did not want any one to suspect his destination and it was even with a sense of guilt that he dashed along the swale in the direction of the amador rancho a few vaqueros an old digger squaw carrying a basket two little indian acolytes on their way to mass passed him he was surprised to find that there were no ruts of carriage wheels within three miles of the casa and evidently no track for carriages through the swale she must have come on horseback a broader highway however intersected the trail at a point where the low walls of the amador rancho came in view here he was startled by the apparition of an oldfashioned family carriage drawn by two large piebald mules but it was unfortunately closed then with a desperate audacity new to his reserved nature he ranged close beside it and even stared in the windows a heavily mantled old woman whose brown face was in high contrast to her snowwhite hair sat in the back seat beside her was a younger companion with the odd blonde hair and blue eyes sometimes seen in the higher castilian type for an instant the blue eyes caught his halfcoquettishly but the girl was not at all like his mysterious visitor and he fell discomfited behind  he had determined to explain his trespass on the grounds of his neighbor if questioned by the excuse that he was hunting a strayed mustang but his presence although watched with a cold reserve by the few peons who were lounging near the gateway provoked no challenge from them and he made a circuit of the low adobe walls with their barred windows and cinnamontiled roofs without molestationbut equally without satisfaction he felt he was a fool for imagining that he would see her in that way he turned his horse towards the little mission half a mile away there he had once met the old padre who spoke a picturesque but limited english now he was only a few yards ahead of him just turning into the church the padre was pleased to see don ricardo it was an unusual thing for the americanos he observed to be up so early for himself he had his functions of course no the ladies that the caballero had seen had not been to mass they were donna maria and her daughter going to san gregorio they comprised all the family at the ranchothere were none others unless the caballero of a possibility meant donna inez a maiden aunt of sixtyan admirable woman a saint on earth he trusted that he would find his estray there was no doubt a mark upon it otherwise the plain was illimitable there were many horsesthe world was wide  dick turned his face homewards a little less adventurously and it must be confessed with a growing sense of his folly the keen dry morning air brushed away his fancies of the preceding night the beautiful eyes that had lured him thither seemed to flicker and be blown out by its practical breath he began to think remorsefully of his cousin of his auntof his treachery to that reserve which the little alien household had maintained towards their spanish neighbors he found aunt viney and cecily at breakfastcecily he thought looking a trifle pale yet or was it only his fancy she seemed curious about his morning ride and he became more reticent  you must see a good many of our neighbors when you are out so early  why he asked shortly feeling his color rise  oh becausebecause we dont see them at any other time  i saw a very nice chapi think the best of the lot he began with assumed jocularity then seeing cecilys eyes suddenly fixed on him he added somewhat lamely the padre there were also two women in a queer coach  donna maria amador and dona felipa peraltaher daughter by her first husband said aunt viney quietly when you see the horses you think its a circus when you look inside the carriage you know its a funeral  aunt viney did not condescend to explain how she had acquired her genealogical knowledge of her neighbors family but succeeded in breaking the restraint between the young people dick proposed a ride in the afternoon which was cheerfully accepted by cecily their intercourse apparently recovered its old frankness and freedom marred only for a moment when they set out on the plain dick really to forget his preoccupation of the morning turned his horses head away from the trail to ride in another direction but cecily oddly and with an exhibition of caprice quite new to her insisted upon taking the old trail nevertheless they met nothing and soon became absorbed in the exercise dick felt something of his old tenderness return to this wholesome pretty girl at his side perhaps he betrayed it in his voice or in an unconscious lingering by her bridlerein but she accepted it with a naive reserve which he naturally attributed to the effect of his own previous preoccupation he bore it so gently however that it awakened her interest and possibly her pique her reserve relaxed and by the time they returned to the hacienda they had regained something of their former intimacy the dry incisive breath of the plains swept away the last lingering remnants of yesterdays illusions under this frankly open sky in this clear perspective of the remote sierras which admitted no fanciful deception of form or distancethere remained nothing but a strange incidentto be later explained or forgotten only he could not bring himself to talk to her about it  after dinner and a decent lingering for coffee on the veranda dick rose and leaning half caressingly half mischievously over his aunts rockingchair but with his eyes on cecily said  ive been deeply considering dear aunty what you said last evening of the necessity of our offering a good example to our neighbors now although cecily and i are cousins yet as i am head of the house lord of the manor and padron according to the spanish ideas i am her recognised guardian and protector and it seems to me it is my positive duty to accompany her if she wishes to walk out this evening  a momentary embarrassmentwhich however changed quickly into an answering smile to her cousincame over cecilys face she turned to her aunt  well dont go too far said that lady quietly  when they closed the grille behind them and stepped into the lane cecily shot a quick glance at her cousin  perhaps youd rather walk in the garden  i oh no he answered honestly buthe hesitatedwould you  yes she said faintly  he impulsively offered his arm her slim hand slipped lightly through it and rested on his sleeve they crossed the lane together and entered the garden a load appeared to be lifted from his heart the moment seemed propitioushere was a chance to recover his lost ground to regain his selfrespect and perhaps his cousins affection by a common instinct however they turned to the right and away from the stone bench and walked slowly down the broad allee  they talked naturally and confidingly of the days when they had met before of old friends they had known and changes that had crept into their young lives they spoke affectionately of the grim lonely but selfcontained old woman they had just left who had brought them thus again together cecily talked of dicks studies of the scientific work on which he was engaged that was to bring him she was sure fame and fortune they talked of the thoughtful charm of the old house of its quaint oldworld flavor they spoke of the beauty of the night the flowers and the stars in whispers as one is apt to doas fearing to disturb a supersensitiveness in nature  they had come out later than on the previous night and the moon already risen above the high walls of the garden seemed a vast silver shield caught in the interlacing tops of the old peartrees whose branches crossed its bright field like dark bends or bars as it rose higher it began to separate the lighter shrubbery and open white lanes through the olivetrees damp currents of air alternating with drier heats on what appeared to be different levels moved across the whole garden or gave way at times to a breathless lull and hush of everything in which the long rose alley seemed to be swooning in its own spices they had reached the bottom of the garden and had turned facing the upper moonlit extremity and the bare stone bench cecilys voice faltered her hand leaned more heavily on his arm as if she were overcome by the strong perfume his right hand began to steal towards hers but she had stopped she was trembling  go on she said in a half whisper leave me a moment ill join you afterwards  you are ill cecily its those infernal flowers said dick earnestly let me help you to the bench  noits nothing go on please do will you go  she spoke with imperiousness unlike herself he walked on mechanically a dozen paces and turned she had disappeared he remembered there was a smaller gate opening upon the plain near where they had stopped perhaps she had passed through that he continued on slowly towards the upper end of the garden occasionally turning to await her return in this way he gradually approached the stone bench he was facing about to continue his walk when his heart seemed to stop beating the beautiful visitor of last night was sitting alone on the bench before him  she had not been there a moment before he could have sworn it yet there was no illusion now of shade or distance she was scarcely six feet from him in the bright moonlight the whole of her exquisite little figure was visible from her lustrous hair down to the tiny black satin lowquartered slipper held as by two toes her face was fully revealed he could see even the few minute freckles like powdered allspice that heightened the pale satin sheen of her beautifully rounded cheek he could detect even the moist shining of her parted red lips the white outlines of her little teeth the length of her curved lashes and the meshes of the black lace veil that fell from the yellow rose above her ear to the black silk camisa he noted even the thick yellow satin saya or skirt heavily flounced with black lace and bugles and that it was a different dress from that worn on the preceding night a halfgala costume carried with the indescribable air of a woman looking her best and pleased to do so all this he had noted drawing nearer and nearer until near enough to forget it all and drown himself in the depths of her beautiful eyes for they were no longer childlike and wondering they were glowing with expectancy anticipationlove  he threw himself passionately on the bench beside her yet even if he had known her language he could not have spoken she leaned towards him their eyes seemed to meet caressingly as in an embrace her little hand slipped from the yellow folds of her skirt to the bench he eagerly seized it a subtle thrill ran through his whole frame there was no delusion here it was flesh and blood warm quivering and even tightening round his own he was about to carry it to his lips when she rose and stepped backwards he pressed eagerly forward another backward step brought her to the peartree where she seemed to plunge into its shadow dick bracy followedand the same shadow seemed to fold them in its embrace    he did not return to the veranda and chocolate that evening but sent word from his room that he had retired not feeling well  cecily herself a little nervously exalted corroborated the fact of his indisposition by telling aunt viney that the close odors of the rose garden had affected them both indeed she had been obliged to leave before him perhaps in waiting for her returnand she really was not well enough to go backhe was exposed to the night air too long she was very sorry  aunt viney heard this with a slight contraction of her brows and a renewed scrutiny of her knitting and having satisfied herself by a personal visit to dicks room that he was not alarmingly ill set herself to find out what was really the matter with the young people for there was no doubt that cecily was in some vague way as disturbed and preoccupied as dick he rode out again early the next morning returning to his studies in the library directly after breakfast and cecily was equally reticent except when to aunt vineys perplexity she found excuses for dicks manner on the ground of his absorption in his work and that he was probably being bored by want of society she proposed that she should ask an old schoolfellow to visit them  it would give dick a change of ideas and he would not be perpetually obliged to look so closely after me she blushed slightly under aunt vineys gaze and added hastily i mean of course he would not feel it his duty  she even induced her aunt to drive with her to the old mission church where she displayed a pretty vivacity and interest in the people they met particularly a few youthful and picturesque caballeros aunt viney smiled gravely was the poor child developing an unlookedfor coquetry or preparing to make the absentminded dick jealous well the idea was not a bad one in the evening she astonished the two cousins by offering to accompany them into the gardena suggestion accepted with eager and effusive politeness by each but carried out with great awkwardness by the distrait young people later aunt viney clearly saw that it was not her presence that was required in this way two or three days elapsed without apparently bringing the relations of dick and cecily to any more satisfactory conclusion the diplomatic aunt viney confessed herself puzzled  one night it was very warm the usual trade winds had died away before sunset leaving an unwonted hush in sky and plain there was something so portentous in this sudden withdrawal of that rude stimulus to the otherwise monotonous level that a recurrence of such phenomena was always known as earthquake weather the wild cattle moved uneasily in the distance without feeding herds of unbroken mustangs approached the confines of the hacienda in vague timorous squads the silence and stagnation of the old house was oppressive as if the life had really gone out of it at last and aunt viney after waiting impatiently for the young people to come in to chocolate rose grimly set her lips together and went out into the lane the gate of the rose garden opposite was open she walked determinedly forward and entered  in that doubly stagnant air the odor of the roses was so suffocating and overpowering that she had to stop to take breath the whole garden except a near cluster of peartrees was brightly illuminated by the moonlight no one was to be seen along the length of the broad allee strewn an inch deep with scattered red and yellow petalscolorless in the moonbeams she was turning away when dicks familiar voice but with a strange accent of entreaty in it broke the silence it seemed to her vaguely to come from within the peartree shadow  but we must understand one another my darling tell me all this suspense this mystery this brief moment of happiness and these hours of parting and torment are killing me  a slight cough broke from aunt viney she had heard enoughshe did not wish to hear more the mystery was explained dick loved cecily the coyness or hesitation was not on his part some idiotic girlish caprice quite inconsistent with what she had noticed at the mission church was keeping cecily silent reserved and exasperating to her lover she would have a talk with the young lady without revealing the fact that she had overheard them she was perhaps a little hurt that affairs should have reached this point without some show of confidence to her from the young people dick might naturally be reticentbut cecily  she did not even look towards the peartree but turned and walked stiffly out of the gate as she was crossing the lane she suddenly started back in utter dismay and consternation for cecily her niecein her own proper personwas actually just coming out of the house  aunt viney caught her wrist where have you been she asked quickly  in the house stammered cecily with a frightened face  you have not been in the garden with dick continued aunt viney sharplyyet with a hopeless sense of the impossibility of the suggestion  no i was not even going there i thought of just strolling down the lane  the girls accents were truthful more than that she absolutely looked relieved by her aunts question do you want me aunty she added quickly  yesno run away thenbut dont go far  at any other time aunt viney might have wondered at the eagerness with which cecily tripped away now she was only anxious to get rid of her she entered the casa hurriedly  send josefa to me at once she said to manuel  josefa the housekeepera fat mexican womanappeared send concha and the other maids here they appeared mutely wondering aunt viney glanced hurriedly over themthey were all therea few comely but not too attractive and all stupidly complacent have you girls any friends here this eveningor are you expecting any she demanded of a surety noas the padrona knewit was not night for church very well returned aunt viney i thought i heard your voices in the garden understand i want no gallivanting there go to bed  she was relieved dick certainly was not guilty of a low intrigue with one of the maids but who and what was she  dick was absent again from chocolate there was unfinished work to do cecily came in later just as aunt viney was beginning to be anxious had she appeared distressed or piqued by her cousins conduct aunt viney might have spoken but there was a pretty color on her cheekthe result she said of her rapid walking and the fresh air did aunt viney know that a cool breeze had just risenand her delicate lips were wreathed at times in a faint retrospective smile aunt viney stared certainly the girl was not pining what young people were made of nowadays she really couldnt conceive she shrugged her shoulders and resumed her tatting  nevertheless as dicks unfinished studies seemed to have whitened his cheek and impaired his appetite the next morning she announced her intention of driving out towards the mission alone when she returned at luncheon she further astonished the young people by casually informing them they would have spanish visitors to dinnernamely their neighbors donna maria amador and the dona felipa peralta  both faces were turned eagerly towards her both said almost in the same breath but aunt viney you dont know them however did youwhat does it all mean  my dears said aunt viney placidly mrs amador and i have always nodded to each other and i knew they were only waiting for the slightest encouragement i gave it and theyre coming  it was difficult to say whether cecilys or dicks face betrayed the greater delight and animation aunt viney looked from the one to the other it seemed as if her attempt at diversion had been successful  tell us all about it you dear clever artful aunty said cecily gayly  theres nothing whatever to tell my love it seems however that the young one dona felipa has seen dick and remembers him she shot a keen glance at dick but was obliged to admit that the rascals face remained unchanged and i wanted to bring a cavalier for you dear but don joses nephew isnt at home now yet here to her surprise cecily was faintly blushing  early in the afternoon the piebald horses and dark brown chariot of the amadors drew up before the gateway the young people were delighted with dona felipa and thought her blue eyes and tawny hair gave an added piquancy to her colorless satin skin and otherwise distinctively spanish face and figure aunt viney who entertained donna maria was nevertheless watchful of the others but failed to detect in dicks effusive greeting or the donas coquettish smile of recognition any suggestion of previous confidences it was rather to cecily that dona felipa seemed to be characteristically exuberant and childishly feminine both mother and stepdaughter spoke a musical infantine english which the daughter supplemented with her eyes her eyebrows her little brown fingers her plump shoulders a dozen charming intonations of voice and a complete vocabulary in her active and emphatic fan  the young lady went over the house with cecily curiously as if recalling some old memories ah yes i remember itbut it was long ago and i was very leetleyou comprehend and i have not arrive mooch when the old don was alone it was tootoowhat you call melankoaly and the old man have not make mooch to himself of company  then there were no young people in the house i suppose said cecily smiling  nonot since the old mans father lif then there were two it is a good number this two eh she gave a single gesture which took in with cecily the distant dick and with a whole volume of suggestion in her shoulders and twirling fan continued ah two sometime make oneis it not but not then in the old timeah no it is a sad story i shall tell it to you some time but not to him  but cecilys face betrayed no undue bashful consciousness and she only asked with a quiet smile why not toto my cousin  imbecile responded that lively young lady  after dinner the young people proposed to take dona felipa into the rose garden while aunt viney entertained donna maria on the veranda the young girl threw up her hands with an affectation of horror santa mariain the rose garden after the angelus you and him have you not heard  but here donna maria interposed ah santa maria what was all that was it not enough to talk old womans gossip and tell vaqueros tales at home without making uneasy the strangers she would have none of it vamos  nevertheless dona felipa overcame her horror of the rose garden at infelicitous hours so far as to permit herself to be conducted by the cousins into it and to be installed like a rose queen on the stone bench while dick and cecily threw themselves in submissive and imploring attitudes at her little feet the young girl looked mischievously from one to the other  it ees very pretty but all the same i am not a rose i am what you call a big gooseberry ehis it not  the cousins laughed but without any embarrassed consciousness dona felipa knows a sad story of this house said cecily but she will not tell it before you dick  dick looking up at the coquettish little figure with heaven knows what other memories in his mind implored and protested  ah but this little storyshe ees not so mooch sad of herself as she ees strrrange she gave an exaggerated little shiver under her lace shawl and closed her eyes meditatively  go on said dick smiling in spite of his interested expectation  dona felipa took her fan in both hands spanning her knees leaned forward and after a preliminary compressing of her lips and knitting of her brows said  it was a long time ago don gregorio he have his daughter rosita here and for her he will fill all thees rose garden and gif to her for she like mooch to lif with the rose she ees very pretty you shall have seen her picture here in the casa no it have hang under the crucifix in the corner room turn around to the wallwhy you shall comprehend when i have made finish thees story comes to them here one day don vincente don gregorios nephew to lif when his father die he was yong a polliosame as rosita they were mooch together they have make lofe what will youit ees always the same the don gregorio have comprehend the friends have all comprehend in a year they will make marry dona rosita she go to monterey to see his family there ees an english warship come there and rosita she ees very gay with the officers and make the flirtation very mooch then don vincente he is onhappy and he revenge himself to make lofe with another when rosita come back it is very miserable for them both but they say nossing the warship he have gone away the other girl vincente he go not to no more all the same rosita and vincente are very triste and the family will not know what to make then rosita she is sick and eat nossing and walk to herself all day in the rose garden until she is as white and fade away as the rose and vincente he eat nossing but drink mooch aguardiente then he have fever and go dead and rosita she have fainting and fits and one day they have look for her in the rose garden and she is not and they poosh and poosh in the ground for her and they find her with so mooch roseleavesso deepon top of her she has go dead it is a very sad story and when you hear it you are very very mooch dissatisfied  it is to be feared that the two americans were not as thrilled by this sad recital as the fair narrator had expected and even dick ventured to point out that those sort of things happened also to his countrymen and were not peculiar to the casa  but you said that there was a terrible sequel suggested cecily smilingly tell us that perhaps mr bracy may receive it a little more politely  an expression of superstitious gravity half real half simulated came over dona felipas face although her vivacity of gesticulation and emphasis did not relax she cast a hurried glance around her and leaned a little forward towards the cousins  when there are no more young people in the casa because they are dead she continued in a lower voice don gregorio he is very melankoaly and he have no more company for many years then there was a rodeo near the hacienda and there came five or six caballeros to stay with him for the feast

dios mees cecily you are illyou are affrighted i am a gabbling fool help her don ricardo she is falling  but it was too late cecily had tried to rise to her feet had staggered forward and fallen in a faint on the bench    dick did not remember how he helped to carry the insensible cecily to the casa nor what explanation he had given to the alarmed inmates of her sudden attack he recalled vaguely that something had been said of the overpowering perfumes of the garden at that hour that the lively felipa had become half hysterical in her remorseful apologies and that aunt viney had ended the scene by carrying cecily into her own room where she presently recovered a still trembling but reticent consciousness but the fainting of his cousin and the presence of a real emergency had diverted his imagination from the vague terror that had taken possession of it and for the moment enabled him to control himself with a desperate effort he managed to keep up a show of hospitable civility to his spanish friends until their early departure then he hurried to his own room so bewildered and horrified he had become and a prey to such superstitious terrors that he could not at that moment bring himself to the test of looking for the picture of the alleged rosita which might still be hanging in his aunts room if it were really the face of his mysterious visitantin his present terrorhe felt that his reason might not stand the shock he would look at it tomorrow when he was calmer until then he would believe that the story was some strange coincidence with what must have been his hallucination or a vulgar trick to which he had fallen a credulous victim until then he would believe that cecilys fright had been only the effect of dona felipas story acting upon a vivid imagination and not a terrible confirmation of something she had herself seen he threw himself without undressing upon his bed in a benumbing agony of doubt  the gentle opening of his door and the slight rustle of a skirt started him to his feet with a feeling of new and overpowering repulsion but it was a familiar figure that he saw in the long aisle of light which led from his recessed window whose face was white enough to have been a spirits and whose finger was laid upon its pale lips as it softly closed the door behind it  cecily  hush she said in a distracted whisper i felt i must see you tonight i could not wait until dayno not another hour i could not speak to you before them i could not go into that dreadful garden again or beyond the walls of this house dick i want toi must tell you something i would have kept it from every onefrom you most of all i know you will hate me and despise me but dick listenshe caught his hand despairingly drawing it towards herthat girls awful story was true she threw his hand away  and you have seen her said dick frantically good god  the young girls manner changed her she said half scornfully you dont suppose i believe that story no iidont blame me dicki have seen him  him  she pushed him nervously into a seat and sat down beside him in the half light of the moon despite her pallor and distraction she was still very human womanly and attractive in her disorder  listen to me dick do you remember one afternoon when we were riding together i got ahead of you and dashed off to the casa i dont know what possessed me or why i did it i only know i wanted to get home quickly and get away from you no i was not angry dick at you it did not seem to be that iwell i confess i was frightenedat something i dont know what when i wheeled round into the lane i sawa mana young gentleman standing by the gardenwall he was very picturesquelooking in his red sash velvet jacket and round silver buttons handsome but oh so pale and sad he looked at me very eagerly and then suddenly drew back and i heard you on chu chu coming at my heels you must have seen him and passed him too i thought but when you said nothing of it ii dont know why dick i said nothing of it too dont speak she added with a hurried gesture i know now why you said nothingyou had not seen him  she stopped and put back a wisp of her disordered chestnut hair  the next time was the night you were so queer dick sitting on that stone bench when i left youi thought you didnt care to have me stayi went to seek aunt viney at the bottom of the garden i was very sad but suddenly i found myself very gay talking and laughing with her in a way i could not account for all at once looking up i saw him standing by the little gate looking at me very sadly i think i would have spoken to aunt viney but he put his finger to his lipshis hand was so slim and white quite like a hand in one of those spanish picturesand moved slowly backwards into the lane as if he wished to speak with me onlyout there i know i ought to have spoken to aunty i knew it was wrong what i did but he looked so earnest so appealing so awfully sad dick that i slipped past aunty and went out of the gate just then she missed me and called he made a kind of despairing gesture raising his hand spanish fashion to his lips as if to say goodnight youll think me bold dick but i was so anxious to know what it all meant that i gave a glance behind to see if aunty was following before i should go right up to him and demand an explanation but when i faced round again he was gone i walked up and down the lane and out on the plain nearly half an hour seeking him it was strange i know but i was not a bit frightened dickthat was so queerbut i was only amazed and curious  the look of spiritual terror in dicks face here seemed to give way to a less exalted disturbance as he fixed his eyes on cecilys  you remember i met you coming in you seemed so queer then that i did not say anything to you for i thought you would laugh at me or reproach me for my boldness and i thought dick thatthatthatthis person wished to speak only to me she hesitated  go on said dick in a voice that had also undergone a singular change  the chestnut head was bent a little lower as the young girl nervously twisted her fingers in her lap  then i saw him againandagain she went on hesitatingly of course i spoke to him totofind out what he wanted but you know dick i cannot speak spanish and of course he didnt understand me and didnt reply  but his manner his appearance gave you some idea of his meaning said dick suddenly  cecilys head drooped a little lower i thoughtthat is i fancied i knew what he meant  no doubt said dick in a voice which but for the superstitious horror of the situation might have impressed a casual listener as indicating a trace of human irony  but cecily did not seem to notice it perhaps i was excited that night perhaps i was bolder because i knew you were near me but i went up to him and touched him and then dickoh dick think how awful  again dick felt the thrill of superstitious terror creep over him and he vanished he said hoarsely  nonot at once stammered cecily with her head almost buried in her lap for hehehe took me in his arms and  and kissed you said dick springing to his feet with every trace of his superstitious agony gone from his indignant face but cecily without raising her head caught at his gesticulating hand  oh dick dick do you think he really did it the horror of it dick to be kissed by aaman who has been dead a hundred years  a hundred fiddlesticks said dick furiously we have been deceived no he stammered i mean you have been deceivedinsulted  hush aunty will hear you murmured the girl despairingly  dick who had thrown away his cousins hand caught it again and dragged her along the aisle of light to the window the moon shone upon his flushed and angry face  listen he said you have been fooled trickedinfamously tricked by these people and some confederate whomwhom i shall horsewhip if i catch the whole story is a lie  but you looked as if you believed itabout the girl said cecily you acted so strangely i even thought dicksometimesyou had seen him  dick shuddered trembled but it is to be feared that the lower more natural human element in him triumphed  nonsense he stammered the girl was a foolish farrago of absurdities improbable on the face of things and impossible to prove but that infernal sneaking rascal was flesh and blood  it seemed to him to relieve the situation and establish his own sanity to combat one illusion with another cecily had already been deceivedanother lie wouldnt hurt her but strangely enough he was satisfied that cecilys visitant was real although he still had doubts about his own  then you think dick it was actually some real man she said piteously oh dick i have been so foolish  foolish she no doubt had been pretty she certainly was sitting there in her loosened hair and pathetic appealing earnestness surely the ghostly rositas glances were never so pleading as these actual honest eyes behind their curving lashes dick felt a strange newborn sympathy of suffering mingled tantalizingly with a new doubt and jealousy that was human and stimulating  oh dick what are we to do  the plural struck him as deliciously sweet and subtle had they really been singled out for this strange experience or still stranger hallucination his arm crept around her she gently withdrew from it  i must go now she murmured but i couldnt sleep until i told you all you know dick i have no one else to come to and it seemed to me that you ought to know it first i feel better for telling you you will tell me tomorrow what you think we ought to do  they reached the door opening it softly she lingered for a moment on the threshold  tell me dick she hesitated if thatthat really were a spirit and not a real manyou dont think thatthat kiss she shuddered could do me harm  he shuddered too with a strange and sympathetic consciousness that happily she did not even suspect but he quickly recovered himself and said with something of bitterness in his voice i should be more afraid if it really were a man  oh thank you dick  her lips parted in a smile of relief the color came faintly back to her cheek  a wild thought crossed his fancy that seemed an inspiration they would share the risks alike he leaned towards her their lips met in their first kiss  oh dick  dearest  i thinkwe are saved  why  it wasnt at all like that  he smiled as she flew swiftly down the corridor perhaps he thought so too    no picture of the alleged rosita was ever found dona felipa when the story was again referred to smiled discreetly but was apparently too preoccupied with the return of don joses absent nephew for further gossiping visits to the hacienda and dick and cecily as mr and mrs bracy would seem to have survivedif they never really solvedthe mystery of the hacienda de los osos yet in the month of june when the moon is high one does not sit on the stone bench in the rose garden after the last stroke of the angelus     chu chu   i do not believe that the most enthusiastic lover of that useful and noble animal the horse will claim for him the charm of geniality humor or expansive confidence any creature who will not look you squarely in the eyewhose only oblique glances are inspired by fear distrust or a view to attack who has no way of returning caresses and whose favorite expression is one of headlifting disdain may be noble or useful but can be hardly said to add to the gayety of nations indeed it may be broadly stated that with the single exception of goldfish of all animals kept for the recreation of mankind the horse is alone capable of exciting a passion that shall be absolutely hopeless i deem these general remarks necessary to prove that my unreciprocated affection for chu chu was not purely individual or singular and i may add that to these general characteristics she brought the waywardness of her capricious sex  she came to me out of the rolling dust of an emigrant wagon behind whose tailboard she was gravely trotting she was a halfbroken coltin which character she had at different times unseated everybody in the trainand although covered with dust she had a beautiful coat and the most lambent gazellelike eyes i had ever seen i think she kept these latter organs purely for ornamentapparently looking at things with her nose her sensitive ears and sometimes even a slight lifting of her slim near foreleg on our first interview i thought she favored me with a coy glance but as it was accompanied by an irrelevant look out from her owner the teamster i was not certain i only know that after some conversation a good deal of mental reservation and the disbursement of considerable coin i found myself standing in the dust of the departing emigrantwagon with one end of a fortyfoot riata in my hand and chu chu at the other  i pulled invitingly at my own end and even advanced a step or two towards her she then broke into a long disdainful pace and began to circle round me at the extreme limit of her tether i stood admiring her free action for some momentsnot always turning with her which was tiringuntil i found that she was gradually winding herself up on me her frantic astonishment when she suddenly found herself thus brought up against me was one of the most remarkable things i ever saw and nearly took me off my legs then when she had pulled against the riata until her narrow head and prettily arched neck were on a perfectly straight line with it she as suddenly slackened the tension and condescended to follow me at an angle of her own choosing sometimes it was on one side of me sometimes on the other even then the sense of my dreadful contiguity apparently would come upon her like a fresh discovery and she would become hysterical but i do not think that she really saw me she looked at the riata and sniffed it disparagingly she pawed some pebbles that were near me tentatively with her small hoof she started back with a robinson crusoelike horror of my footprints in the wet gully but my actual personal presence she ignored she would sometimes pause with her head thoughtfully between her forelegs and apparently say there is some extraordinary presence here animal vegetable or minerali cant make out whichbut its not good to eat and i loathe and detest it  when i reached my house in the suburbs before entering the fifty vara lot inclosure i deemed it prudent to leave her outside while i informed the household of my purchase and with this object i tethered her by the long riata to a solitary sycamore which stood in the centre of the road the crossing of two frequented thoroughfares it was not long however before i was interrupted by shouts and screams from that vicinity and on returning thither i found that chu chu with the assistance of her riata had securely wound up two of my neighbors to the tree where they presented the appearance of early christian martyrs when i released them it appeared that they had been attracted by chu chus graces and had offered her overtures of affection to which she had characteristically rotated with this miserable result i led her with some difficulty warily keeping clear of the riata to the inclosure from whose fence i had previously removed several bars although the space was wide enough to have admitted a troop of cavalry she affected not to notice it and managed to kick away part of another section on entering she resisted the stable for some time but after carefully examining it with her hoofs and an affectedly meek outstretching of her nose she consented to recognize some oats in the feedboxwithout looking at themand was formally installed all this while she had resolutely ignored my presence as i stood watching her she suddenly stopped eating the same reflective look came over her surely i am not mistaken but that same obnoxious creature is somewhere about here she seemed to say and shivered at the possibility  it was probably this which made me confide my unreciprocated affection to one of my neighborsa man supposed to be an authority on horses and particularly of that wild species to which chu chu belonged it was he who leaning over the edge of the stall where she was complacently and as usual obliviously munching absolutely dared to toy with a pet lock of hair which she wore over the pretty star on her forehead ye see captain he said with jaunty easiness hosses is like wimmen ye dont want ter use any standoffishness or shyness with them a stiddy but keerless sort o familiarity a kind o free but firm handlin jess like this to let her see whos master  we never clearly knew how it happened but when i picked up my neighbor from the doorway amid the broken splinters of the stall rail and a quantity of oats that mysteriously filled his hair and pockets chu chu was found to have faced around the other way and was contemplating her forelegs with her hind ones in the other stall my neighbor spoke of damages while he was in the stall and of physical coercion when he was out of it again but here chu chu in some marvelous way righted herself and my neighbor departed hurriedly with a brimless hat and an unfinished sentence  my next intermediary was enriquez saltelloa youth of my own age and the brother of consuelo saltello whom i adored as a spanish californian he was presumed on account of chu chus halfspanish origin to have superior knowledge of her character and i even vaguely believed that his language and accent would fall familiarly on her ear there was the drawback however that he always preferred to talk in a marvelous english combining castilian precision with what he fondly believed to be californian slang  to confer then as to thees horse which is notobserve mea mexican plug ah no you can your boots bet on that she is of castilian stockbelieve me and strike me dead i will myself at different times overlook and affront her in the stable examine her as to the assault and why she should do thees thing when she is of the exercise i will also accost and restrain her remain tranquil my friend when a few days shall pass much shall be changed and she will be as another trust your oncle to do thees thing comprehend me everything shall be lovely and the goose hang high  conformably with this he overlooked her the next day with a cigarette between his yellowstained fingertips which made her sneeze in a silent pantomimic way and certain spanish blandishments of speech which she received with more complacency but i dont think she ever even looked at him in vain he protested that she was the dearest and littlest of his little lovesin vain he asserted that she was his patron saint and that it was his souls delight to pray to her she accepted the compliment with her eyes fixed upon the manger when he had exhausted his whole stock of endearing diminutives adding a few playful and more audacious sallies she remained with her head down as if inclined to meditate upon them this he declared was at least an improvement on her former performances it may have been my own jealousy but i fancied she was only saying to herself gracious can there be two of them  courage and patience my friend he said as we were slowly quitting the stable thees horse is yonge and has not yet the habitude of the person tomorrow at another season i shall give to her a foundling fondling i have reason to believe was the word intended by enriquezand we shall see it shall be as easy as to fall away from a log a leetle more of this chin music which your friend enriquez possesses and some tapping of the head and neck and you are there you are ever the right side up houp la but let us not precipitate this thing the more haste we do not so much accelerate ourselves  he appeared to be suiting the action to the word as he lingered in the doorway of the stable come on i said  pardon he returned with a bow that was both elaborate and evasive but you shall yourself precede methe stable is yours  oh come along i continued impatiently to my surprise he seemed to dodge back into the stable again after an instant he reappeared  pardon but i am restrain of a truth in this instant i am grasp by the mouth of thees horse in the coattail of my dress she will that i should remain it would seemhe disappeared againthathe was out once morethe experiment is a sooccess she reciprocate she is of a truth gone on me it is lofea stronger pull from chu chu here sent him in againbuthe was out now triumphantly with half his garment torn awayi shall coquet  nothing daunted however the gallant fellow was back next day with a mexican saddle and attired in the complete outfit of a vaquero overcome though he was by heavy deerskin trousers open at the side from the knees down and fringed with bullion buttons an enormous flat sombrero and a stiff short embroidered velvet jacket i was more concerned at the ponderous saddle and equipments intended for the slim chu chu that these would hide and conceal her beautiful curves and contour as well as overweight her seemed certain that she would resist them all to the last seemed equally clear nevertheless to my surprise when she was led out and the saddle thrown deftly across her back she was passive was it possible that some drop of her old spanish blood responded to its clinging embrace she did not either look at it nor smell it but when enriquez began to tighten the cinch or girth a more singular thing occurred chu chu visibly distended her slender barrel to twice its dimensions the more he pulled the more she swelled until i was actually ashamed of her not so enriquez he smiled at us and complacently stroked his thin moustache  eet is ever so she is the child of her grandmother even when you shall make saddle thees old castilian stock it will make largeit will become a balloon eet is a trickeet is a leetle gamebelieve me for why  i had not listened as i was at that moment astonished to see the saddle slowly slide under chu chus belly and her figure resume as if by magic its former slim proportions enriquez followed my eyes lifted his shoulders shrugged them and said smilingly ah you see  when the girths were drawn in again with an extra pull or two from the indefatigable enriquez i fancied that chu chu nevertheless secretly enjoyed it as her sex is said to appreciate tightlacing she drew a deep sigh possibly of satisfaction turned her neck and apparently tried to glance at her own figureenriquez promptly withdrawing to enable her to do so easily then the dread moment arrived enriquez with his hand on her mane suddenly paused and with exaggerated courtesy lifted his hat and made an inviting gesture  you will honor me to precede  i shook my head laughingly  i see responded enriquez gravely you have to attend the obsequies of your aunt who is dead at two of the clock you have to meet your broker who has bought you feefty share of the comstock lodeat thees momentor you are loss you are excuse attend gentlemen make your bets the band has arrived to play ere we are  with a quick movement the alert young fellow had vaulted into the saddle but to the astonishment of both of us the mare remained perfectly still there was enriquez bolt upright in the stirrups completely overshadowing by his saddleflaps leggings and gigantic spurs the fine proportions of chu chu until she might have been a placid rosinante bestridden by some youthful quixote she closed her eyes she was going to sleep we were dreadfully disappointed this clearly would not do enriquez lifted the reins cautiously chu chu moved forward slowlythen stopped apparently lost in reflection  affront her on thees side  i approached her gently she shot suddenly into the air coming down again on perfectly stiff legs with a springless jolt this she instantly followed by a succession of other rocketlike propulsions utterly unlike a leap all over the inclosure the movements of the unfortunate enriquez were equally unlike any equitation i ever saw he appeared occasionally over chu chus head astride of her neck and tail or in the free air but never in the saddle his rigid legs however never lost the stirrups but came down regularly accentuating her springless hops more than that the disproportionate excess of rider saddle and accoutrements was so great that he had at times the appearance of lifting chu chu forcibly from the ground by superior strength and of actually contributing to her exercise as they came towards me a wild tossing and flying mass of hoofs and spurs it was not only difficult to distinguish them apart but to ascertain how much of the jumping was done by enriquez separately at last chu chu brought matters to a close by making for the lowstretching branches of an oaktree which stood at the corner of the lot in a few moments she emerged from itbut without enriquez  i found the gallant fellow disengaging himself from the fork of a branch in which he had been firmly wedged but still smiling and confident and his cigarette between his teeth then for the first time he removed it and seating himself easily on the branch with his legs dangling down he blandly waved aside my anxious queries with a gentle reassuring gesture  remain tranquil my friend thees does not count i have conqueryou observefor why i have never for once arrive at the ground consequent she is disappoint she will ever that i should but i have got her when the hair is not long your oncle henrywith an angelic winkis fly he is ever a bully boy with the eye of glass believe me behold i am here big injin whoop  he leaped lightly to the ground chu chu standing watchfully at a little distance was evidently astonished at his appearance she threw out her hind hoofs violently shot up into the air until the stirrups crossed each other high above the saddle and made for the stable in a succession of rabbitlike boundstaking the precaution to remove the saddle on entering by striking it against the lintel of the door you observe said enriquez blandly she would make that thing of me not having the good occasion she ees dissatisfied where are you now  two or three days afterwards he rode her again with the same resultaccepted by him with the same heroic complacency as we did not for certain reasons care to use the open road for this exercise and as it was impossible to remove the tree we were obliged to submit to the inevitable on the following day i mounted herundergoing the same experience as enriquez with the individual sensation of falling from a thirdstory window on top of a countinghouse stool and the variation of being projected over the fence when i found that chu chu had not accompanied me i saw enriquez at my side more than ever is become necessary that we should do thees things again he said gravely as he assisted me to my feet courage my noble general god and liberty once more on to the breach charge chestare charge come on don stanley ere we are  he helped me none too quickly to catch my seat again for it apparently had the effect of the turned peg on the enchanted horse in the arabian nights and chu chu instantly rose into the air but she came down this time before the open window of the kitchen and i alighted easily on the dresser the indefatigable enriquez followed me  wont this do i asked meekly  it ees betterfor you arrive not on the ground he said cheerfully but you should not once but a thousand times make trial ha go and win nevare die and say so eave ahead eave there you are  luckily this time i managed to lock the rowels of my long spurs under her girth and she could not unseat me she seemed to recognize the fact after one or two plunges when to my great surprise she suddenly sank to the ground and quietly rolled over me the action disengaged my spurs but righting herself without getting up she turned her beautiful head and absolutely looked at mestill in the saddle i felt myself blushing but the voice of enriquez was at my side  errise my friend you have conquer it is she who has arrive at the ground you are all right it is done believe me it is feenish no more shall she make thees thing from thees instant you shall ride her as the cowas the rail of thees fenceand remain tranquil for she is abroke tata regain your hats gentlemen pass in your checks it is ovar how are you now he lit a fresh cigarette put his hands in his pockets and smiled at me blandly  for all that i ventured to point out that the habit of alighting in the fork of a tree or the disengaging of ones self from the saddle on the ground was attended with inconvenience and even ostentatious display but enriquez swept the objections away with a single gesture it is the preencipalthe bottom factat which you arrive the next come of himself many horse have achieve to mount the rider by the knees and relinquish after thees same fashion my grandfather had a barb of thees kindbut she has gone dead and so have my grandfather which is sad and strange otherwise i shall make of them both an instant example  i ought to have said that although these performances were never actually witnessed by enriquezs sisterfor reasons which he and i thought sufficientthe dear girl displayed the greatest interest in them and perhaps aided by our mutually complimentary accounts of each other looked upon us both as invincible heroes it is possible also that she overestimated our success for she suddenly demanded that i should ride chu chu to her house that she might see her it was not far by going through a back lane i could avoid the trees which exercised such a fatal fascination for chu chu there was a pleading childlike entreaty in consuelos voice that i could not resist with a slight flash from her lustrous dark eyes that i did not care to encourage so i resolved to try it at all hazards  my equipment for the performance was modeled after enriquezs previous costume with the addition of a few fripperies of silver and stamped leather out of compliment to consuelo and even with a faint hope that it might appease chu chu she certainly looked beautiful in her glittering accoutrements set off by her jetblack shining coat with an air of demure abstraction she permitted me to mount her and even for a hundred yards or so indulged in a mincing maidenly amble that was not without a touch of coquetry encouraged by this i addressed a few terms of endearment to her and in the exuberance of my youthful enthusiasm i even confided to her my love for consuelo and begged her to be good and not disgrace herself and me before my dulcinea in my foolish trustfulness i was rash enough to add a caress and to pat her soft neck she stopped instantly with a hysteric shudder i knew what was passing through her mind she had suddenly become aware of my baleful existence  the saddle and bridle chu chu was becoming accustomed to but who was this living breathing object that had actually touched her presently her oblique vision was attracted by the fluttering movement of a fallen oakleaf in the road before her she had probably seen many oakleaves many times before her ancestors had no doubt been familiar with them on the trackless hills and in field and paddock but this did not alter her profound conviction that i and the leaf were identical that our baleful touch was something indissolubly connected she reared before that innocent leaf she revolved round it and then fled from it at the top of her speed  the lane passed before the rear wall of saltellos garden unfortunately at the angle of the fence stood a beautiful madronotree brilliant with its scarlet berries and endeared to me as consuelos favorite haunt under whose protecting shade i had more than once avowed my youthful passion by the irony of fate chu chu caught sight of it and with a succession of spirited bounds instantly made for it in another moment i was beneath it and chu chu shot like a rocket into the air i had barely time to withdraw my feet from the stirrups to throw up one arm to protect my glazed sombrero and grasp an overhanging branch with the other before chu chu darted off but to my consternation as i gained a secure perch on the tree and looked about me i saw herinstead of running awayquietly trot through the open gate into saltellos garden  need i say that it was to the beneficent enriquez that i again owed my salvation scarcely a moment elapsed before his bland voice rose in a concentrated whisper from the corner of the garden below me he had divined the dreadful truth  for the love of god collect to yourself many kinds of thees berry all you can your full arms round rest tranquil leave to your ole oncle to make for you a delicate exposure at the instant  he was gone again i gathered wonderingly a few of the larger clusters of particolored fruit and patiently waited presently he reappeared and with him the lovely consueloher dear eyes filled with an adorable anxiety  yes continued enriquez to his sister with a confidential lowering of tone but great distinctness of utterance it is ever so with the american he will ever make first the salutation of the flower or the fruit picked to himself by his own hand to the lady where he call it is the custom of the american hidalgo my godwhat will you i make it notit is so without doubt he is in this instant doing thees thing that is why he have let go his horse to precede him here it is always the etiquette to offer these things on the feet ah behold it is hedon francisco even now he will descend from thees tree ah you make the blush little sister archly i will retire i am discreet two is not company for the one i make tracks i am gone  how far consuelo entirely believed and trusted her ingenious brother i do not know nor even then cared to inquire for there was a pretty mantling of her olive cheek as i came forward with my offering and a certain significant shyness in her manner that were enough to throw me into a state of hopeless imbecility and i was always miserably conscious that consuelo possessed an exalted sentimentality and a predilection for the highest mediaeval romance in which i knew i was lamentably deficient even in our most confidential moments i was always aware that i weakly lagged behind this daughter of a gloomily distinguished ancestry in her frequent incursions into a vague but poetic past there was something of the dignity of the spanish chatelaine in the sweetly grave little figure that advanced to accept my specious offering i think i should have fallen on my knees to present it but for the presence of the all seeing enriquez but why did i even at that moment remember that he had early bestowed upon her the nickname of pomposa this as enriquez himself might have observed was sad and strange  i managed to stammer out something about the madrono berries being at her disposicion the tree was in her own garden and she took the branches in her little brown hand with a soft response to my unutterable glances  but here chu chu momentarily forgotten executed a happy diversion to our astonishment she gravely walked up to consuelo and stretching out her long slim neck not only sniffed curiously at the berries but even protruded a black underlip towards the young girl herself in another instant consuelos dignity melted throwing her arms around chu chus neck she embraced and kissed her young as i was i understood the divine significance of a girls vicarious effusiveness at such a moment and felt delighted but i was the more astonished that the usually sensitive horse not only submitted to these caresses but actually responded to the extent of affecting to nip my mistresss little right ear  this was enough for the impulsive consuelo she ran hastily into the house and in a few moments reappeared in a bewitching ridingskirt gathered round her jimp waist in vain enriquez and myself joined in earnest entreaty the horse was hardly broken for even a mans riding yet the saints alone could tell what the nervous creature might do with a womans skirt flapping at her side we begged for delay for reflection for at least time to change the saddlebut with no avail consuelo was determined indignant distressingly reproachful ah well if don pancho an ingenious diminutive of my christian name valued his horse so highlyif he were jealous of the evident devotion of the animal to herself he wouldbut here i succumbed and then i had the felicity of holding that little foot for one brief moment in the hollow of my hand of readjusting the skirt as she threw her knee over the saddlehorn of clasping her tightlyonly half in fearas i surrendered the reins to her grasp and to tell the truth as enriquez and i fell back although i had insisted upon still keeping hold of the end of the riata it was a picture to admire the petite figure of the young girl and the graceful folds of her skirt admirably harmonized with chu chus lithe contour and as the mare arched her slim neck and raised her slender head under the pressure of the reins it was so like the lifted velvetcapped toreador crest of consuelo herself that they seemed of one race  i would not that you should hold the riata said consuelo petulantly  i hesitatedchu chu looked certainly very amiablei let go she began to amble towards the gate not mincingly as before but with a freer and fuller stride in spite of the incongruous saddle the young girls seat was admirable as they neared the gate she cast a single mischievous glance at me jerked at the rein and chu chu sprang into the road at a rapid canter i watched them fearfully and breathlessly until at the end of the lane i saw consuelo rein in slightly wheel easily and come flying back there was no doubt about it the horse was under perfect control her second subjugation was complete and final  overjoyed and bewildered i overwhelmed them with congratulations enriquez alone retaining the usual brotherly attitude of criticism and a superior toleration of a lovers enthusiasm i ventured to hint to consuelo in what i believed was a safe whisper that chu chu only showed my own feelings towards her without doubt responded enriquez gravely she have of herself assist you to climb to the tree to pull to yourself the berry for my sister but i felt consuelos little hand return my pressure and i forgave and even pitied him  from that day forward chu chu and consuelo were not only firm friends but daily companions in my devotion i would have presented the horse to the young girl but with flattering delicacy she preferred to call it mine i shall erride it for you pancho she said i shall feel she continued with exalted although somewhat vague poetry that it is of you you lofe the beastit is therefore of a necessity you my pancho it is your soul i shall erride like the wings of the windyour lofe in this beast shall be my only cavalier for ever i would have preferred something whose vicarious qualities were less uncertain than i still felt chu chus to be but i kissed the girls hand submissively it was only when i attempted to accompany her in the flesh on another horse that i felt the full truth of my instinctive fears chu chu would not permit any one to approach her mistresss side my mounted presence revived in her all her old blind astonishment and disbelief in my existence she would start suddenly face about and back away from me in utter amazement as if i had been only recently created or with an affected modesty as if i had been just guilty of some grave indecorum towards her sex which she really could not stand the frequency of these exhibitions in the public highway were not only distressing to me as a simple escort but as it had the effect on the casual spectators of making consuelo seem to participate in chu chus objections i felt that as a lover it could not be borne any attempt to coerce chu chu ended in her running away and my frantic pursuit of her was open to equal misconstruction go it miss the little dude is gainin on you shouted by a drunken teamster to the frightened consuelo once checked me in mid career even the dear girl herself saw the uselessness of my real presence and after a while was content to ride with my soul  notwithstanding this i am not ashamed to say that it was my custom whenever she rode out to keep a slinking and distant surveillance of chu chu on another horse until she had fairly settled down to her pace a little nod of consuelos round blackandred toreador hat or a kiss tossed from her ridingwhip was reward enough  i remember a pleasant afternoon when i was thus awaiting her in the outskirts of the village the eternal smile of the californian summer had begun to waver and grow less fixed dust lay thick on leaf and blade the dry hills were clothed in russet leather the trade winds were shifting to the south with an ominous warm humidity a few days longer and the rains would be here it so chanced that this afternoon my seclusion on the roadside was accidentally invaded by a village bellea western young lady somewhat older than myself and of flirtatious reputation as she persistently andas i now have reason to believemischievously lingered i had only a passing glimpse of consuelo riding past at an unaccustomed speed which surprised me at the moment but as i reasoned later that she was only trying to avoid a merely formal meeting i thought no more about it it was not until i called at the house to fetch chu chu at the usual hour and found that consuelo had not yet returned that a recollection of chu chus furious pace again troubled me an hour passedit was getting towards sunset but there were no signs of chu chu nor her mistress i became seriously alarmed i did not care to reveal my fears to the family for i felt myself responsible for chu chu at last i desperately saddled my horse and galloped off in the direction she had taken it was the road to rosario and the hacienda of one of her relations where she sometimes halted  the road was a very unfrequented one twisting like a mountain river indeed it was the bed of an old watercourse between brown hills of wild oats and debouching at last into a broad blue lakelike expanse of alfalfa meadows in vain i strained my eyes over the monotonous level nothing appeared to rise above or move across it in the faint hope that she might have lingered at the hacienda i was spurring on again when i heard a slight splashing on my left i looked around a broad patch of freshercolored herbage and a cluster of dwarfed alders indicated a hidden spring i cautiously approached its quaggy edges when i was shocked by what appeared to be a sudden vision midleg deep in the centre of a greenish pool stood chu chu but without a strap or buckle of harness upon heras naked as when she was foaled  for a moment i could only stare at her in bewildered terror far from recognizing me she seemed to be absorbed in a nymphlike contemplation of her own graces in the pool then i called consuelo and galloped frantically around the spring but there was no response nor was there anything to be seen but the allunconscious chu chu the pool thank heaven was not deep enough to have drowned any one there were no signs of a struggle on its quaggy edges the horse might have come from a distance i galloped on still calling a few hundred yards further i detected the vivid glow of chu chus scarlet saddleblanket in the brush near the trail my heart leapedi was on the track i called again this time a faint reply in accents i knew too well came from the field beside me  consuelo was there reclining beside a manzanita bush which screened her from the road in what struck me even at that supreme moment as a judicious and picturesquely selected couch of scented indian grass and dry tussocks the velvet hat with its balls of scarlet plush was laid carefully aside her lovely blueblack hair retained its tight coils undisheveled her eyes were luminous and tender shocked as i was at her apparent helplessness i remember being impressed with the fact that it gave so little indication of violent usage or disaster  i threw myself frantically on the ground beside her  you are hurt consita for heavens sake what has happened  she pushed my hat back with her little hand and tumbled my hair gently  nothing you are here panchoeet is enofe what shall come after theeswhen i am perhaps gone among the gravemake nothing you are herei am happy for a little perhapsnot mooch  but i went on desperately was it an accident were you thrown was it chu chufor somehow in spite of her languid posture and voice i could not even in my fears believe her seriously hurt  beat not the poor beast pancho it is not from her comes thees thing she have make nothingbelieve me i have come upon your assignation with miss essmith i make but to pass youto flyto never come back i have say to chu chu fly we fly many miles sometimes together sometimes not so mooch sometimes in the saddle sometimes on the neck many things remain in the road at the end i myself remain i have say courage pancho will come then i say no he is talk with miss essmith i remember not more i have creep here on the hands eet is feenish  i looked at her distractedly she smiled tenderly and slightly smoothed down and rearranged a fold of her dress to cover her delicate little boot  but i protested you are not much hurt dearest you have broken no bones perhaps i added looking at the boot only a slight sprain let me carry you to my horse i will walk beside you home do dearest consita  she turned her lovely eyes towards me sadly you comprehend not my poor pancho it is not of the foot the ankle the arm or the head that i can say she is broke i would it were even so butshe lifted her sweet lashes slowlyi have derrange my inside it is an affair of my family my grandfather have once toomble over the bull at a rodeo he speak no more he is dead for why he has derrange his inside believe me it is of the family you comprehend the saltellos are not as the other peoples for this when i am gone you will bring to me the berry to grow upon my tomb pancho the berry you have picked for me the little flower will come too the little star will arrive but consuelo who lofe you she will come not more when you are happy and talk in the road to the essmith you will not think of me you will not see my eyes pancho thees little grassshe ran her plump little fingers through a tussockwill hide them and the small animals in the black coats that lif here will have much sorrowbut you will not it ees better so my father will not that i a catholique should marry into a campmeeting and lif in a tent and make howl like the coyote it was one of consuelos bewildering beliefs that there was only one form of dissentmethodism he will not that i should marry a man who possess not the many horses ox and cow like him but i care not you are my only religion pancho i have enofe of the horse and ox and cow when you are with me kiss me pancho perhaps it is for the last timethe feenish who knows  there were tears in her lovely eyes i felt that my own were growing dim the sun was sinking over the dreary plain to the slow rising of the wind an infinite loneliness had fallen upon us and yet i was miserably conscious of some dreadful unreality in it all a desire to laugh which i felt must be hysterical was creeping over me i dared not speak but her dear head was on my shoulder and the situation was not unpleasant  nevertheless something must be done this was the more difficult as it was by no means clear what had already been done even while i supported her drooping figure i was straining my eyes across her shoulder for succor of some kind suddenly the figure of a rapid rider appeared upon the road it seemed familiar i looked againit was the blessed enriquez a sense of deep relief came over me i loved consuelo but never before had lover ever hailed the irruption of one of his beloveds family with such complacency  you are safe dearest it is enriquez  i thought she received the information coldly suddenly she turned upon me her eyes now bright and glittering swear to me at the instant pancho that you will not again look upon miss essmith even for once  i was simple and literal miss smith was my nearest neighbor and unless i was stricken with blindness compliance was impossible i hesitatedbut swore  enofeyou have hesitatei will no more  she rose to her feet with grave deliberation for an instant with the recollection of the delicate internal organization of the saltellos on my mind i was in agony lest she should totter and fall even then yielding up her gentle spirit on the spot but when i looked again she had a hairpin between her white teeth and was carefully adjusting her toreador hat and beside us was enriquezcheerful alert voluble and undaunted  eureka i have found we are all here eet is a leetle publiceh a leetle too much of a front seat for a teteatete my yonge friends he said glancing at the remains of consuelos bower but for the accounting of taste there is none what will you the meat of the one man shall envenom the meat of the other but in a whisper to me as to thees horsethees chu chu which i have just passwhy is she undress surely you would not make an exposition of her to the traveler to suspect and if not why so  i tried to explain looking at consuelo that chu chu had run away that consuelo had met with a terrible accident had been thrown and i feared had suffered serious internal injury but to my embarrassment consuelo maintained a half scornful silence and an inconsistent freshness of healthful indifference as enriquez approached her with an engaging smile ah yes she have the headache and the molligrubs she will sit on the damp stone when the gentle dew is falling i comprehend meet me in the lane when the clock strike nine but in a lower voice of thees undress horse i comprehend nothing look youit is sad and strange  he went off to fetch chu chu leaving me and consuelo alone i do not think i ever felt so utterly abject and bewildered before in my life without knowing why i was miserably conscious of having in some way offended the girl for whom i believed i would have given my life and i had made her and myself ridiculous in the eyes of her brother i had again failed in my slower western nature to understand her high romantic spanish soul meantime she was smoothing out her ridinghabit and looking as fresh and pretty as when she first left her house  consita i said hesitatingly you are not angry with me  angry she repeated haughtily without looking at me oh no of a possibility eet is mees essmith who is angry that i have interroopt her teteatete with you and have send here my brother to make the same with me  but i said eagerly miss smith does not even know enriquez  consuelo turned on me a glance of unutterable significance ah she said darkly you tink  indeed i knew but here i believed i understood consuelo and was relieved i even ventured to say gently and you are better  she drew herself up to her full height which was not much of my health what is it a nothing yes of my soul let us not speak  nevertheless when enriquez appeared with chu chu she ran towards her with outstretched arms chu chu protruded about six inches of upper lip in responseapparently under the impression which i could quite understand that her mistress was edible and i may have been mistaken but their beautiful eyes met in an absolute and distinct glance of intelligence  during the home journey consuelo recovered her spirits and parted from me with a magnanimous and forgiving pressure of the hand i do not know what explanation of chu chus original escapade was given to enriquez and the rest of the family the inscrutable forgiveness extended to me by consuelo precluded any further inquiry on my part i was willing to leave it a secret between her and chu chu but strange to say it seemed to complete our own understanding and precipitated not only our lovemaking but the final catastrophe which culminated that romance for we had resolved to elope i do not know that this heroic remedy was absolutely necessary from the attitude of either consuelos family or my own i am inclined to think we preferred it because it involved no previous explanation or advice need i say that our confidant and firm ally was consuelos brotherthe alert the linguistic the everhappy everready enriquez it was understood that his presence would not only give a certain mature respectability to our performancebut i do not think we would have contemplated this step without it during one of our riding excursions we were to secure the services of a methodist minister in the adjoining county and later that of the mission padrewhen the secret was out i will gif her away said enriquez confidently it will on the instant propitiate the old shadbelly who shall perform the affair and withhold his jaw a little chinmusic from your oncle arry shall finish it remain tranquil and forgot not a ring one does not always in the agony and dissatisfaction of the moment a ring remember i shall bring two in the pocket of my dress  if i did not entirely participate in this roseate view it may have been because enriquez although a few years my senior was much youngerlooking and with his demure deviltry of eye and his upper lip close shaven for this occasion he suggested a depraved acolyte rather than a responsible member of a family consuelo had also confided to me that her fatherpossibly owing to some rumors of our previous escapadehad forbidden any further excursions with me alone the innocent man did not know that chu chu had forbidden it also and that even on this momentous occasion both enriquez and myself were obliged to ride in opposite fields like out flankers but we nevertheless felt the full guilt of disobedience added to our desperate enterprise meanwhile although pressed for time and subject to discovery at any moment i managed at certain points of the road to dismount and walk beside chu chu who did not seem to recognize me on foot holding consuelos hand in my own with the discreet enriquez leading my horse in the distant field i retain a very vivid picture of that walkthe ascent of a gentle slope towards a prospect as yet unknown but full of glorious possibilities the tender dropping light of an autumn sky slightly filmed with the promise of the future rains like foreshadowed tears and the half frightened half serious talk into which consuelo and i had insensibly fallen and then i dont know how it happened but as we reached the summit chu chu suddenly reared wheeled and the next moment was flying back along the road we had just traveled at the top of her speed it might have been that after her abstracted fashion she only at that moment detected my presence but so sudden and complete was her evolution that before i could regain my horse from the astonished enriquez she was already a quarter of a mile on the homeward stretch with the frantic consuelo pulling hopelessly at the bridle we started in pursuit but a horrible despair seized us to attempt to overtake her to even follow at the same rate of speed would only excite chu chu and endanger consuelos life there was absolutely no help for it nothing could be done the mare had taken her determined long continuous stride the road was a straight steady descent all the way back to the village chu chu had the bit between her teeth and there was no prospect of swerving her we could only follow hopelessly idiotically furiously until chu chu dashed triumphantly into the saltellos courtyard carrying the halffainting consuelo back to the arms of her assembled and astonished family  it was our last ride together it was the last i ever saw of consuelo before her transfer to the safe seclusion of a convent in southern california it was the last i ever saw of chu chu who in the confusion of that rencontre was overlooked in her halfloosed harness and allowed to escape though the back gate to the fields months afterwards it was said that she had been identified among a band of wild horses in the coast range as a strange and beautiful creature who had escaped the brand of the rodeo and had become a myth there was another legend that she had been seen sleek fat and gorgeously caparisoned issuing from the gateway of the rosario patio before a lumbering spanish cabriole in which a short stout matron was seatedbut i will have none of it for there are days when she still lives and i can see her plainly still climbing the gentle slope towards the summit with consuelo on her back and myself at her side pressing eagerly forward towards the illimitable prospect that opens in the distance     my first book   when i say that my first book was not my own and contained beyond the titlepage not one word of my own composition i trust that i will not be accused of trifling with paradox or tardily unbosoming myself of youthful plagiary but the fact remains that in priority of publication the first book for which i became responsible and which probably provoked more criticism than anything i have written since was a small compilation of californian poems indited by other hands  a wellknown bookseller of san francisco one day handed me a collection of certain poems which had already appeared in pacific coast magazines and newspapers with the request that i should if possible secure further additions to them and then make a selection of those which i considered the most notable and characteristic for a single volume to be issued by him i have reason to believe that this unfortunate man was actutated by a laudable desire to publish a pretty californian bookhis first essay in publicationand at the same time to foster eastern immigration by an exhibit of the californian literary product but looking back upon his venture i am inclined to think that the little volume never contained anything more poetically pathetic or touchingly imaginative than that gentle conception equally simple and trustful was his selection of myself as compiler it was based somewhat i think upon the fact that the artless helicon i boasted was youth but i imagine it was chiefly owing to the circumstance that i had from the outset with precocious foresight confided to him my intention of not putting any of my own verses in the volume publishers are appreciative and a selfabnegation so sublime to say nothing of its security was not without its effect  we settled to our work with fatuous selfcomplacency and no suspicion of the trouble in store for us or the storm that was to presently hurtle around our devoted heads i winnowed the poems and he exploited a preliminary announcement to an eager and waiting press and we moved together unwittingly to our doom i remember to have been early struck with the quantity of material coming inevidently the result of some popular misunderstanding of the announcement i found myself in daily and hourly receipt of sere and yellow fragments originally torn from some dead and gone newspaper creased and seamed from long folding in wallet or pocketbook need i say that most of them were of an emotional or didactic nature need i add any criticism of these homely souvenirs often discolored by the morning coffee the evening tobacco or heaven knows perhaps blotted by too easy tears enough that i knew now what had become of those original but never recopied verses which filled the poets corner of every country newspaper on the coast i knew now the genesis of every didactic verse that coldly furnished forth the marriage table in the announcement of weddings in the rural press i knew now who had readand possibly inditedthe dreary hic jacets of the dead in their mourning columns i knew now why certain letters of the alphabet had been more tenderly considered than others and affectionately addressed i knew the meaning of the lines to her who can best understand them and i knew that they had been understood the mornings post buried my table beneath these withered leaves of posthumous passion they lay there like the pathetic nosegays of quickly fading wild flowers gathered by school children inconsistently abandoned upon roadsides or as inconsistently treasured as limp and flabby superstitions in their desks the chill wind from the bay blowing in at the window seemed to rustle them into sad articulate appeal i remember that when one of them was whisked from the window by a stronger gust than usual and was attaining a circulation it had never known before i ran a block or two to recover it i was young then and in an exalted sense of editorial responsibility which i have since survived i think i turned pale at the thought that the reputation of some unknown genius might have thus been swept out and swallowed by the allabsorbing sea  there were other difficulties arising from this unexpected wealth of material there were dozens of poems on the same subject the golden gate mount shasta the yosemite were especially provocative a beautiful bird known as the californian canary appeared to have been shot at and winged by every poet from portland to san diego lines to the mariposa flower were as thick as the lovely blossoms themselves in the merced valley and the madrone tree was as berhymed as rosalind again by a liberal construction of the publishers announcement manuscript poems which had never known print began to coyly unfold their virgin blossoms in the mornings mail they were accompanied by a few lines stating casually that their sender had found them lying forgotten in his desk or mendaciously that they were thrown off on the spur of the moment a few hours before some of the names appended to them astonished me grave practical business men sage financiers fierce speculators and plodding traders never before suspected of poetry or even correct prose were among the contributors it seemed as if most of the ablebodied inhabitants of the pacific coast had been in the habit at some time of expressing themselves in verse some sought confidential interviews with the editor the climax was reached when in montgomery street one day i was approached by a well known and venerable judicial magnate after some serious preliminary conversation the old gentleman finally alluded to what he was pleased to call a task of great delicacy and responsibility laid upon my young shoulders in fact he went on paternally adding the weight of his judicial hand to that burden i have thought of speaking to you about it in my leisure moments on the bench i have from time to time polished and perfected a certain college poem begun years ago but which may now be said to have been finished in california and thus embraced in the scope of your proposed selection if a few extracts selected by myself to save you all trouble and responsibility be of any benefit to you my dear young friend consider them at your service  in this fashion the contributions had increased to three times the bulk of the original collection and the difficulties of selection were augmented in proportion the editor and publisher eyed each other aghast never thought there were so many of the blamed things alive said the latter with great simplicity had you the editor had not couldnt you sorter shake em up and condense em you know keep their ideasand their namesseparate so that theyd have proper credit see the editor pointed out that this would infringe the rule he had laid down i see said the publisher thoughtfully well couldnt you pare em down give the first verse entire and sorter sample the others the editor thought not there was clearly nothing to do but to make a more rigid selectiona difficult performance when the material was uniformly on a certain dead level which it is not necessary to define here among the rejections were of course the usual plagiarisms from wellknown authors imposed upon an inexperienced country press several admirable pieces detected as acrostics of patent medicines and certain veiled libels and indecencies such as mark the first publications on blank walls and fences of the average youth still the bulk remained too large and the youthful editor set to work reducing it still more with a sympathizing concern which the goodnatured but unliterary publisher failed to understand and which alas proved to be equally unappreciated by the rejected contributors  the book appeareda pretty little volume typographically and externally a credit to pioneer bookmaking copies were liberally supplied to the press and authors and publishers selfcomplacently awaited the result to the latter this should have been satisfactory the book sold readily from his wellknown counters to purchasers who seemed to be drawn by a singular curiosity unaccompanied however by any critical comment people would lounge in to the shop turn over the leaves of other volumes say carelessly got a new book of california poetry out havent you purchase it and quietly depart there were as yet no notices from the press the big dailies were silent there was something ominous in this calm  out of it the bolt fell a wellknown mining weekly which i here poetically veil under the title of the red dog jay hawk was first to swoop down upon the tuneful and unsuspecting quarry at this centuryend of fastidious and complaisant criticism it may be interesting to recall the direct style of the californian sixties the hogwash and purpstuff ladled out from the slopbucket of messrs  and co of frisco by some lopeared eastern apprentice and called a compilation of californian verse might be passed over so far as criticism goes a club in the hands of any ablebodied citizen of red dog and a steamboat ticket to the bay cheerfully contributed from this office would be allsufficient but when an imported greenhorn dares to call his flapdoodle mixture californian it is an insult to the state that has produced the gifted yellow hammer whose lofty flights have from time to time dazzled our readers in the columns of the jay hawk that this complacent editorial jackass browsing among the dock and thistles which he has served up in this volume should make no allusion to californias greatest bard is rather a confession of his idiocy than a slur upon the genius of our esteemed contributor i turned hurriedly to my pile of rejected contributionsthe nom de plume of yellow hammer did not appear among them certainly i had never heard of its existence later when a friend showed me one of that gifted bards pieces i was inwardly relieved it was so like the majority of the other verses in and out of the volume that the mysterious poet might have written under a hundred aliases but the dutch flat clarion following with no uncertain sound left me small time for consideration we doubt said that journal if a more feeble collection of drivel could have been made even if taken exclusively from the editors own verses which we note he has by an equal editorial incompetency left out of the volume when we add that by a felicity of idiotic selection this person has chosen only one and the least characteristic of the really clever poems of adoniram skaggs which have so often graced these columns we have said enough to satisfy our readers the mormon hill quartz crusher relieved this simple directness with more fancy we dont know why messrs  and co send us under the title of selections of californian poetry a quantity of slumgullion which really belongs to the sluices of a placer mining camp or the ditches of the rural districts we have sometimes been compelled to run a lot of tailings through our stamps but never of the grade of the samples offered which we should say would average about 3313 cents per ton we have however come across a single specimen of pure gold evidently overlooked by the serene ass who has compiled this volume we copy it with pleasure as it has already shone in the poets corner of the crusher as the gifted effusion of the talented manager of the excelsior mill otherwise known to our delighted readers as outcrop the green springs arcadian was no less fanciful in imagery messrs  and co send us a gaudy greenandyellow parrotcolored volume which is supposed to contain the first callow cheepings and peepings of californian songsters from the flavor of the specimens before us we should say that the nest had been disturbed prematurely there seems to be a good deal of the parrot inside as well as outside the covers and we congratulate our own sweet singer blue bird who has so often made these columns melodious that she has escaped the ignominy of being exhibited in messrs  and cos aviary i should add that this simile of the aviary and its occupants was ominous for my tuneful choir was relentlessly slaughtered the bottom of the cage was strewn with feathers the big dailies collected the criticisms and published them in their own columns with the grim irony of exaggerated headlines the book sold tremendously on account of this abuse but i am afraid that the public was disappointed the fun and interest lay in the criticisms and not in any pointedly ludicrous quality in the rather commonplace collection and i fear i cannot claim for it even that merit and it will be observed that the animus of the criticism appeared to be the omission rather than the retention of certain writers  but this brings me to the most extraordinary feature of this singular demonstration i do not think that the publishers were at all troubled by it i cannot conscientiously say that i was i have every reason to believe that the poets themselves in and out of the volume were not displeased at the notoriety they had not expected and i have long since been convinced that my most remorseless critics were not in earnest but were obeying some sudden impulse started by the first attacking journal the extravagance of the red dog jay hawk was emulated by others it was a large contagious joke passed from journal to journal in a peculiar cyclonic western fashion and there still lingers not unpleasantly in my memory the conclusion of a cheerfully scathing review of the book which may make my meaning clearer if we have said anything in this article which might cause a single pang to the poetically sensitive nature of the youthful individual calling himself mr francis bret hartebut who we believe occasionally parts his name and his hair in the middlewe will feel that we have not labored in vain and are ready to sing nunc dimittis and hand in our checks we have no doubt of the absolutely pellucid and lacteal purity of frankys intentions he means well to the pacific coast and we return the compliment but he has strayed away from his parents and guardians while he was too fresh he will not keep without a little salt  it was thirty years ago the book and its rabelaisian criticisms have been long since forgotten alas i fear that even the capacity for that gargantuan laughter which met them in those days exists no longer the names i have used are necessarily fictitious but where i have been obliged to quote the criticisms from memory i have i believe only softened their asperity i do not know that this story has any moral the criticisms here recorded never hurt a reputation nor repressed a single honest aspiration a few contributors to the volume who were of original merit have made their mark independently of it or its critics the editor who was for two months the most abused man on the pacific slope within the year became the editor of its first successful magazine even the publisher prospered and died respected
