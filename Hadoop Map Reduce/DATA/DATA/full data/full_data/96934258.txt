pgviii   preface to the fourth edition   the chief alterations since the first edition have been made in the chapter on classification pp 2 3 and the book on propositions pp 10 to 19 the chief additions have been the questions on words and phrases added to the examinationpapers at p 94 and the notes inserted at pp 164 194  in book i chapter ii i have adopted a new definition of classification which enables me to regard the whole universe as a class and thus to dispense with the very awkward phrase a set of things  in the chapter on propositions of existence i have adopted a new normal form in which the class whose existence is affirmed or denied is regarded as the predicate instead of the subject of the proposition thus evading a very subtle difficulty which besets the other form these subtle difficulties seem to lie at the root of every tree of knowledge and they are far more hopeless to grapple with than any that occur in its higher branches for example the difficulties of the fortyseventh proposition of euclid are mere childs play compared with the mental torture endured in the effort to think out the essential nature of a straight line and in the present work the difficulties of the 5 liars problem at p 192 are trifles light as air compared with the bewildering question what is a thing  in the chapter on propositions of relation i have inserted a new section containing the proof that a proposition beginning with all is a double proposition a fact that is quite independent of the arbitrary rule laid down in the next section that such a proposition is to be understood as implying the actual existence of its subject this proof was given in the earlier editions incidentally in the course of the discussion of the biliteral diagram but its proper place in this treatise is where i have now introduced it                                                                    pgix in the soritesexamples i have made a good many verbal alterations in order to evade a difficulty which i fear will have perplexed some of the readers of the first three editions some of the premisses were so worded that their terms were not specieses of the univ named in the dictionary but of a larger class of which the univ was only a portion in all such cases it was intended that the reader should perceive that what was asserted of the larger class was thereby asserted of the univ and should ignore as superfluous all that it asserted of its other portion thus in ex 15 the univ was stated to be ducks in this village and the third premiss was mrs bond has no gray ducks ie no gray ducks are ducks belonging to mrs bond here the terms are not specieses of the univ but of the larger class ducks of which the univ is only a portion and it was intended that the reader should perceive that what is here asserted of ducks is thereby asserted of ducks in this village and should treat this premiss as if it were mrs bond has no gray ducks in this village and should ignore as superfluous what it asserts as to the other portion of the class ducks viz mrs bond has no gray ducks out of this village  in the appendix i have given a new version of the problem of the five liars my object in doing so is to escape the subtle and mysterious difficulties which beset all attempts at regarding a proposition as being its own subject or a set of propositions as being subjects for one another it is certainly a most bewildering and unsatisfactory theory one cannot help feeling that there is a great lack of substance in all this shadowy hostthat as the procession of phantoms glides before us there is not one that we can pounce upon and say here is a proposition that must be either true or falsethat it is but a barmecide feast to which we have been biddenand that its prototype is to be found in that mythical island whose inhabitants earned a precarious living by taking in each others washing by simply translating telling 2 truths into taking both of 2 condiments salt and mustard telling 2 lies into taking neither of them and telling a truth and a lie order not specified into taking only one condiment it is not specified which i have escaped all those metaphysical puzzles and have produced a problem which when translated into a set of symbolized premisses furnishes the very same data as were furnished by the problem of the five liars                                                                    pgx the coined words introduced in previous editions such as eliminands and retinends perhaps hardly need any apology they were indispensable to my system but the new plural here used for the first time viz soriteses will i fear be condemned as bad english unless i say a word in its defence we have three singular nouns in english of plural form series species and sorites in all three the awkwardness of using the same word for both singular and plural must often have been felt this has been remedied in the case of series by coining the plural serieses which has already found its way into the dictionaries so i am no rash innovator but am merely following suit in using the new plural soriteses  in conclusion let me point out that even those who are obliged to study formal logic with a view to being able to answer examinationpapers in that subject will find the study of symbolic logic most helpful for this purpose in throwing light upon many of the obscurities with which formal logic abounds and in furnishing a delightfully easy method of testing the results arrived at by the cumbrous processes which formal logic enforces upon its votaries  this is i believe the very first attempt with the exception of my own little book the game of logic published in 1886 a very incomplete performance that has been made to popularise this fascinating subject it has cost me years of hard work but if it should prove as i hope it may to be of real service to the young and to be taken up in high schools and in private families as a valuable addition to their stock of healthful mental recreations such a result would more than repay ten times the labour that i have expended on it

remarks addressed to teachers will be found in the appendix at p 165   the learner who wishes to try the question fairly whether this little book does or does not supply the materials for a most interesting mental recreation is earnestly advised to adopt the following rules  1 begin at the beginning and do not allow yourself to gratify a mere idle curiosity by dipping into the book here and there this would very likely lead to your throwing it aside with the remark this is much too hard for me and thus losing the chance of adding a very large item to your stock of mental delights this rule of not dipping is very desirable with other kinds of bookssuch as novels for instance where you may easily spoil much of the enjoyment you would otherwise get from the story by dipping into it further on so that what the author meant to be a pleasant surprise comes to you as a matter of course some people i know make a practice of looking into vol iii first just to see how the story ends and perhaps it is as well just to know that all ends happilythat the muchpersecuted lovers do marry after all that he is proved to be quite innocent of the murder that the wicked cousin is completely foiled in his plot and gets the punishment he deserves and that the rich uncle in india qu why in india ans because somehow uncles never can get rich anywhere else dies at exactly the right momentbefore taking the trouble to read vol i this i say is just permissible with a novel where vol iii has a meaning even for those who have not read the earlier part of the story but with a scientific book it is sheer insanity you will find the latter part hopelessly unintelligible if you read it before reaching it in regular course                                                                    pgxii 2 dont begin any fresh chapter or section until you are certain that you thoroughly understand the whole book up to that point and that you have worked correctly most if not all of the examples which have been set so long as you are conscious that all the land you have passed through is absolutely conquered and that you are leaving no unsolved difficulties behind you which will be sure to turn up again later on your triumphal progress will be easy and delightful otherwise you will find your state of puzzlement get worse and worse as you proceed till you give up the whole thing in utter disgust  3 when you come to any passage you dont understand read it again if you still dont understand it read it again if you fail even after three readings very likely your brain is getting a little tired in that case put the book away and take to other occupations and next day when you come to it fresh you will very likely find that it is quite easy  4 if possible find some genial friend who will read the book along with you and will talk over the difficulties with you talking is a wonderful smootherover of difficulties when i come upon anythingin logic or in any other hard subjectthat entirely puzzles me i find it a capital plan to talk it over aloud even when i am all alone one can explain things so clearly to ones self and then you know one is so patient with ones self one never gets irritated at ones own stupidity  if dear reader you will faithfully observe these rules and so give my little book a really fair trial i promise you most confidently that you will find symbolic logic to be one of the most if not the most fascinating of mental recreations in this first part i have carefully avoided all difficulties which seemed to me to be beyond the grasp of an intelligent child of say twelve or fourteen years of age i have myself taught most of its contents vivâ voce to many children and have found them take a real intelligent interest in the subject for those who succeed in mastering part i and who begin like oliver asking for more i hope to provide in part ii some tolerably hard nuts to cracknuts that will require all the nutcrackers they happen to possess                                                                    pgxiii mental recreation is a thing that we all of us need for our mental health and you may get much healthy enjoyment no doubt from games such as backgammon chess and the new game halma but after all when you have made yourself a firstrate player at any one of these games you have nothing real to show for it as a result you enjoyed the game and the victory no doubt at the time but you have no result that you can treasure up and get real good out of and all the while you have been leaving unexplored a perfect mine of wealth once master the machinery of symbolic logic and you have a mental occupation always at hand of absorbing interest and one that will be of real use to you in any subject you may take up it will give you clearness of thoughtthe ability to see your way through a puzzlethe habit of arranging your ideas in an orderly and getatable formand more valuable than all the power to detect fallacies and to tear to pieces the flimsy illogical arguments which you will so continually encounter in books in newspapers in speeches and even in sermons and which so easily delude those who have never taken the trouble to master this fascinating art try it that is all i ask of you                                                                  l c  29 bedford street strand     february 21 1896

         pg001   book i  things and their attributes    chapter i  introductory   the universe contains things      for example i london roses redness old english     books the letter which i received yesterday  things have attributes      for example large red old which i received     yesterday  one thing may have many attributes and one attribute may belong to many things      thus the thing a rose may have the attributes red     scented fullblown c and the attribute red may belong     to the things a rose a brick a ribbon c  any attribute or any set of attributes may be called an adjunct      this word is introduced in order to avoid the constant     repetition of the phrase attribute or set of attributes      thus we may say that a rose has the attribute red or the     adjunct red whichever we prefer or we may say that it has     the adjunct red scented and fullblown                                                                     pg001½  chapter ii  classification   classification or the formation of classes is a mental process in which we imagine that we have put together in a group certain things such a group is called a class  this process may be performed in three different ways as follows  1 we may imagine that we have put together all things the class so formed ie the class things contains the whole universe  2 we may think of the class things and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the things which possess a certain adjunct not possessed by the whole class this adjunct is said to be peculiar to the class so formed in this case the class things is called a genus with regard to the class so formed the class so formed is called a species of the class things and its peculiar adjunct is called its differentia                                                                    pg002 as this process is entirely mental we can perform it whether there is or is not an existing thing which possesses that adjunct if there is the class is said to be real if not it is said to be unreal or imaginary      for example we may imagine that we have picked out from the     class things all the things which possess the adjunct     material artificial consisting of houses and streets and we     may thus form the real class towns here we may regard     things as a genus towns as a species of things and     material artificial consisting of houses and streets as its     differentia      again we may imagine that we have picked out all the things     which possess the adjunct weighing a ton easily lifted by a     baby and we may thus form the imaginary class things that     weigh a ton and are easily lifted by a baby  3 we may think of a certain class not the class things and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the members of it which possess a certain adjunct not possessed by the whole class this adjunct is said to be peculiar to the smaller class so formed in this case the class thought of is called a genus with regard to the smaller class picked out from it the smaller class is called a species of the larger and its peculiar adjunct is called its differentia      for example we may think of the class towns and imagine     that we have picked out from it all the towns which possess the     attribute lit with gas and we may thus form the real class     towns lit with gas here we may regard towns as a genus     towns lit with gas as a species of towns and lit with gas     as its differentia      if in the above example we were to alter lit with gas into     paved with gold we should get the imaginary class towns     paved with gold  a class containing only one member is called an individual      for example the class towns having four million inhabitants     which class contains only one member viz london                                                                    pg002½ hence any single thing which we can name so as to distinguish it from all other things may be regarded as a onemember class      thus london may be regarded as the onemember class picked     out from the class towns which has as its differentia     having four million inhabitants  a class containing two or more members is sometimes regarded as one single thing when so regarded it may possess an adjunct which is not possessed by any member of it taken separately      thus the class the soldiers of the tenth regiment when     regarded as one single thing may possess the attribute     formed in square which is not possessed by any member of it     taken separately                                                                     pg003  chapter iii  division   § 1  introductory  division is a mental process in which we think of a certain class of things and imagine that we have divided it into two or more smaller classes      thus we might think of the class books and imagine that we     had divided it into the two smaller classes bound books and     unbound books or into the three classes books priced at     less than a shilling shillingbooks books priced at more     than a shilling or into the twentysix classes books whose     names begin with a books whose names begin with b c  a class that has been obtained by a certain division is said to be codivisional with every class obtained by that division      thus the class bound books is codivisional with each of the     two classes bound books and unbound books      similarly the battle of waterloo may be said to have been     contemporary with every event that happened in 1815  hence a class obtained by division is codivisional with itself      thus the class bound books is codivisional with itself      similarly the battle of waterloo may be said to have been     contemporary with itself                                                                     pg003½ § 2  dichotomy  if we think of a certain class and imagine that we have picked out from it a certain smaller class it is evident that the remainder of the large class does not possess the differentia of that smaller class hence it may be regarded as another smaller class whose differentia may be formed from that of the class first picked out by prefixing the word not and we may imagine that we have divided the class first thought of into two smaller classes whose differentiæ are contradictory this kind of division is called dichotomy      for example we may divide books into the two classes whose     differentiæ are old and notold  in performing this process we may sometimes find that the attributes we have chosen are used so loosely in ordinary conversation that it is not easy to decide which of the things belong to the one class and which to the other in such a case it would be necessary to lay down some arbitrary rule as to where the one class should end and the other begin      thus in dividing books into old and notold we may say     let all books printed before ad 1801 be regarded as old     and all others as notold  henceforwards let it be understood that if a class of things be divided into two classes whose differentiæ have contrary meanings each differentia is to be regarded as equivalent to the other with the word not prefixed      thus if books be divided into old and new the attribute     old is to be regarded as equivalent to notnew and the     attribute new as equivalent to notold                                                                    pg004 after dividing a class by the process of dichotomy into two smaller classes we may subdivide each of these into two still smaller classes and this process may be repeated over and over again the number of classes being doubled at each repetition      for example we may divide books into old and new ie     notold we may then subdivide each of these into     english and foreign ie notenglish thus getting     four classes viz          1 old english         2 old foreign         3 new english         4 new foreign      if we had begun by dividing into english and foreign and     had then subdivided into old and new the four classes     would have been          1 english old         2 english new         3 foreign old         4 foreign new      the reader will easily see that these are the very same four     classes which we had before                                                                     pg004½  chapter iv  names   the word thing which conveys the idea of a thing without any idea of an adjunct represents any single thing any other word or phrase which conveys the idea of a thing with the idea of an adjunct represents any thing which possesses that adjunct ie it represents any member of the class to which that adjunct is peculiar  such a word or phrase is called a name and if there be an existing thing which it represents it is said to be a name of that thing      for example the words thing treasure town and the     phrases valuable thing material artificial thing consisting     of houses and streets town lit with gas town paved with     gold old english book  just as a class is said to be real or unreal according as there is or is not an existing thing in it so also a name is said to be real or unreal according as there is or is not an existing thing represented by it      thus town lit with gas is a real name town paved with     gold is an unreal name  every name is either a substantive only or else a phrase consisting of a substantive and one or more adjectives or phrases used as adjectives  every name except thing may usually be expressed in three different forms      a the substantive thing and one or more     adjectives or phrases used as adjectives conveying     the ideas of the attributes                                                                    pg005     b a substantive conveying the idea of a thing with     the ideas of some of the attributes and one or more     adjectives or phrases used as adjectives conveying     the ideas of the other attributes      c a substantive conveying the idea of a thing with     the ideas of all the attributes      thus the phrase material living thing belonging to the     animal kingdom having two hands and two feet is a name     expressed in form a      if we choose to roll up together the substantive thing and the     adjectives material living belonging to the animal kingdom     so as to make the new substantive animal we get the phrase     animal having two hands and two feet which is a name     representing the same thing as before expressed in form b      and if we choose to roll up the whole phrase into one word so     as to make the new substantive man we get a name still     representing the very same thing expressed in form c  a name whose substantive is in the plural number may be used to represent either      1 members of a class regarded as separate things     or 2 a whole class regarded as one single thing      thus when i say some soldiers of the tenth regiment are     tall or the soldiers of the tenth regiment are brave i am     using the name soldiers of the tenth regiment in the first     sense and it is just the same as if i were to point to each of     them separately and to say this soldier of the tenth     regiment is tall that soldier of the tenth regiment is     tall and so on      but when i say the soldiers of the tenth regiment are formed     in square i am using the phrase in the second sense and it     is just the same as if i were to say the tenth regiment is     formed in square                                                                     pg006  chapter v  definitions   it is evident that every member of a species is also a member of the genus out of which that species has been picked and that it possesses the differentia of that species hence it may be represented by a name consisting of two parts one being a name representing any member of the genus and the other being the differentia of that species such a name is called a definition of any member of that species and to give it such a name is to define it      thus we may define a treasure as a valuable thing in this     case we regard things as the genus and valuable as the     differentia  the following examples of this process may be taken as models for working others      note that in each definition the substantive representing a     member or members of the genus is printed in capitals  1 define a treasure  ans a valuable thing  2 define treasures  ans valuable things  3 define a town  ans a material artificial thing consisting of houses and streets                                                                    pg007 4 define men  ans material living things belonging to the animal kingdom having two hands and two feet  or else  animals having two hands and two feet  5 define london  ans the material artificial thing which consists of houses and streets and has four million inhabitants  or else  the town which has four million inhabitants      note that we here use the article the instead of a because     we happen to know that there is only one such thing      the reader can set himself any number of examples of this     process by simply choosing the name of any common thing such     as house tree knife making a definition for it and     then testing his answer by referring to any english dictionary                                                                     pg008   book ii  propositions    chapter i  propositions generally   § 1  introductory  note that the word some is to be regarded henceforward as meaning one or more  the word proposition as used in ordinary conversation may be applied to any word or phrase which conveys any information whatever      thus the words yes and no are propositions in the ordinary     sense of the word and so are the phrases you owe me five     farthings and i dont      such words as oh or never and such phrases as fetch me     that book which book do you mean do not seem at first     sight to convey any information but they can easily be     turned into equivalent forms which do so viz i am surprised     i will never consent to it i order you to fetch me that     book i want to know which book you mean  but a proposition as used in this first part of symbolic logic has a peculiar form which may be called its normal form and if any proposition which we wish to use in an argument is not in normal form we must reduce it to such a form before we can use it                                                                    pg009 a proposition when in normal form asserts as to certain two classes which are called its subject and predicate either      1 that some members of its subject are members     of its predicate      or 2 that no members of its subject are members     of its predicate      or 3 that all members of its subject are members     of its predicate  the subject and the predicate of a proposition are called its terms  two propositions which convey the same information are said to be equivalent      thus the two propositions i see john and john is seen by     me are equivalent   § 2  normal form of a proposition  a proposition in normal form consists of four parts viz      1 the word some or no or all this word     which tells us how many members of the subject     are also members of the predicate is called the     sign of quantity      2 name of subject      3 the verb are or is this is called the     copula      4 name of predicate                                                                     pg010 § 3  various kinds of propositions  a proposition that begins with some is said to be particular it is also called a proposition in i      note that it is called particular because it refers to a     part only of the subject  a proposition that begins with no is said to be universal negative it is also called a proposition in e  a proposition that begins with all is said to be universal affirmative it is also called a proposition in a      note that they are called universal because they refer to     the whole of the subject  a proposition whose subject is an individual is to be regarded as universal      let us take as an example the proposition john is not well     this of course implies that there is an individual to whom     the speaker refers when he mentions john and whom the     listener knows to be referred to hence the class men     referred to by the speaker when he mentions john is a     onemember class and the proposition is equivalent to all     the men who are referred to by the speaker when he mentions     john are not well  propositions are of two kinds propositions of existence and propositions of relation  these shall be discussed separately                                                                     pg011  chapter ii  propositions of existence   a proposition of existence when in normal form has for its subject the class existing things  its sign of quantity is some or no      note that though its sign of quantity tells us how many     existing things are members of its predicate it does not tell     us the exact number in fact it only deals with two     numbers which are in ascending order 0 and 1 or more  it is called a proposition of existence because its effect is to assert the reality ie the real existence or else the imaginariness of its predicate      thus the proposition some existing things are honest men     asserts that the class honest men is real      this is the normal form but it may also be expressed in any     one of the following forms          1 honest men exist         2 some honest men exist         3 the class honest men exists         4 there are honest men         5 there are some honest men      similarly the proposition no existing things are men fifty     feet high asserts that the class men 50 feet high is     imaginary      this is the normal form but it may also be expressed in any     one of the following forms          1 men 50 feet high do not exist         2 no men 50 feet high exist         3 the class men 50 feet high does not exist         4 there are not any men 50 feet high         5 there are no men 50 feet high                                                                     pg012  chapter iii  propositions of relation   § 1  introductory  a proposition of relation of the kind to be here discussed has for its terms two specieses of the same genus such that each of the two names conveys the idea of some attribute not conveyed by the other      thus the proposition some merchants are misers is of the     right kind since merchants and misers are specieses of the     same genus men and since the name merchants conveys the     idea of the attribute mercantile and the name misers the     idea of the attribute miserly each of which ideas is not     conveyed by the other name      but the proposition some dogs are setters is not of the     right kind since although it is true that dogs and setters     are specieses of the same genus animals it is not true that     the name dogs conveys the idea of any attribute not conveyed     by the name setters such propositions will be discussed in     part ii  the genus of which the two terms are specieses is called the universe of discourse or more briefly the univ  the sign of quantity is some or no or all      note that though its sign of quantity tells us how many     members of its subject are also members of its predicate it     does not tell us the exact number in fact it only deals with     three numbers which are in ascending order 0 1 or     more the total number of members of the subject  it is called a proposition of relation because its effect is to assert that a certain relationship exists between its terms                                                                     pg013 § 2  reduction of a proposition of relation to normal form  the rules for doing this are as follows  1 ascertain what is the subject ie ascertain what class we are talking about  2 if the verb governed by the subject is not the verb are or is substitute for it a phrase beginning with are or is  3 ascertain what is the predicate ie ascertain what class it is which is asserted to contain some or none or all of the members of the subject  4 if the name of each term is completely expressed ie if it contains a substantive there is no need to determine the univ but if either name is incompletely expressed and contains attributes only it is then necessary to determine a univ in order to insert its name as the substantive  5 ascertain the sign of quantity  6 arrange in the following order      sign of quantity     subject     copula

substantive is     expressed and we have not yet settled what the univ is to be     we are forced to leave a blank      4 let univ be fruit      5 the sign of quantity is some      6 the proposition now becomes          some  apples  are  notripe fruit                                                                     pg014     2      none of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent      1 the subject is my speculations      2 the verb is have brought for which we substitute the     phrase are    that have brought      3 the predicate is    that have brought c      4 let univ be transactions      5 the sign of quantity is none of      6 the proposition now becomes          none of  my speculations  are  transactions         that have brought me as much as 5 per cent       3      none but the brave deserve the fair      to begin with we note that the phrase none but the brave is     equivalent to no notbrave      1 the subject has for its attribute notbrave but no     substantive is supplied so we express the subject as     notbrave         2 the verb is deserve for which we substitute the phrase     are deserving of      3 the predicate is    deserving of the fair      4 let univ be persons      5 the sign of quantity is no      6 the proposition now becomes          no  notbrave persons  are  persons deserving         of the fair       4      a lame puppy would not say thank you if you offered to lend     it a skippingrope      1 the subject is evidently lame puppies and all the rest of     the sentence must somehow be packed into the predicate      2 the verb is would not say c for which we may     substitute the phrase are not grateful for      3 the predicate may be expressed as    not grateful for     the loan of a skippingrope      4 let univ be puppies      5 the sign of quantity is all      6 the proposition now becomes          all  lame puppies  are  puppies not grateful         for the loan of a skippingrope

means no person      2 the verb is takes in for which we may substitute the     phrase are persons taking in      3 the predicate is persons taking in the times      4 let univ be persons      5 the sign of quantity is no      6 the proposition now becomes          no  persons who are not welleducated  are          persons taking in the times       6      my carriage will meet you at the station      1 the subject is my carriage this being an individual     is equivalent to the class my carriages note that this class     contains only one member      2 the verb is will meet for which we may substitute the     phrase are    that will meet      3 the predicate is    that will meet you at the station      4 let univ be things      5 the sign of quantity is all      6 the proposition now becomes          all  my carriages  are  things that will meet          you at the station       7      happy is the man who does not know what toothache means      1 the subject is evidently the man c note that in this     sentence the predicate comes first at first sight the     subject seems to be an individual but on further     consideration we see that the article the does not imply     that there is only one such man hence the phrase the man     who is equivalent to all men who      2 the verb is are      3 the predicate is happy         4 let univ be men      5 the sign of quantity is all      6 the proposition now becomes          all  men who do not know what toothache         means  are  happy men                                                                     pg016     8      some farmers always grumble at the weather whatever it may     be      1 the subject is farmers      2 the verb is grumble for which we substitute the phrase     are    who grumble      3 the predicate is    who always grumble c      4 let univ be persons      5 the sign of quantity is some      6 the proposition now becomes          some  farmers  are  persons who always         grumble

animals      5 the sign of quantity is no      6 the proposition now becomes          no  lambs  are  animals accustomed to smoke         cigars       10      i cant understand examples that are not arranged in regular     order like those i am used to      1 the subject is examples that c      2 the verb is i cant understand which we must alter so     as to have examples instead of i as the nominative case     it may be expressed as are not understood by me      3 the predicate is    not understood by me      4 let univ be examples      5 the sign of quantity is all      6 the proposition now becomes          all  examples that are not arranged in regular         order like those i am used to  are  examples not         understood by me                                                                     pg017 § 3  a proposition of relation beginning with all is a double proposition  a proposition of relation beginning with all asserts as we already know that all members of the subject are members of the predicate this evidently contains as a part of what it tells us the smaller proposition some members of the subject are members of the predicate      thus the proposition all bankers are rich men evidently     contains the smaller proposition some bankers are rich men  the question now arises what is the rest of the information which this proposition gives us  in order to answer this question let us begin with the smaller proposition some members of the subject are members of the predicate and suppose that this is all we have been told and let us proceed to inquire what else we need to be told in order to know that all members of the subject are members of the predicate      thus we may suppose that the proposition some bankers are     rich men is all the information we possess and we may proceed     to inquire what other proposition needs to be added to it in     order to make up the entire proposition all bankers are rich     men  let us also suppose that the univ ie the genus of which both the subject and the predicate are specieses has been divided by the process of dichotomy into two smaller classes viz      1 the predicate      2 the class whose differentia is contradictory to that of     the predicate      thus we may suppose that the genus men of which both     bankers and rich men are specieses has been divided into     the two smaller classes rich men poor men                                                                    pg018 now we know that every member of the subject is as shown at p 6 a member of the univ hence every member of the subject is either in class 1 or else in class 2      thus we know that every banker is a member of the genus     men hence every banker is either in the class rich men     or else in the class poor men  also we have been told that in the case we are discussing some members of the subject are in class 1 what else do we need to be told in order to know that all of them are there evidently we need to be told that none of them are in class 2 ie that none of them are members of the class whose differentia is contradictory to that of the predicate      thus we may suppose we have been told that some bankers are     in the class rich men what else do we need to be told in     order to know that all of them are there evidently we need to     be told that none of them are in the class poor men  hence a proposition of relation beginning with all is a double proposition and is equivalent to ie gives the same information as the two propositions      1 some members of the subject are members of the     predicate      2 no members of the subject are members of the     class whose differentia is contradictory to that of     the predicate      thus the proposition all bankers are rich men is a     double proposition and is equivalent to the two     propositions          1 some bankers are rich men          2 no bankers are poor men                                                                     pg019 § 4  what is implied in a proposition of relation as to the reality of its terms  note that the rules here laid down are arbitrary and only apply to part i of my symbolic logic  a proposition of relation beginning with some is henceforward to be understood as asserting that there are some existing things which being members of the subject are also members of the predicate ie that some existing things are members of both terms at once hence it is to be understood as implying that each term taken by itself is real      thus the proposition some rich men are invalids is to be     understood as asserting that some existing things are rich     invalids hence it implies that each of the two classes     rich men and invalids taken by itself is real  a proposition of relation beginning with no is henceforward to be understood as asserting that there are no existing things which being members of the subject are also members of the predicate ie that no existing things are members of both terms at once but this implies nothing as to the reality of either term taken by itself      thus the proposition no mermaids are milliners is to be     understood as asserting that no existing things are     mermaidmilliners but this implies nothing as to the     reality or the unreality of either of the two classes     mermaids and milliners taken by itself in this case as it     happens the subject is imaginary and the predicate real  a proposition of relation beginning with all contains see § 3 a similar proposition beginning with some hence it is to be understood as implying that each term taken by itself is real      thus the proposition all hyænas are savage animals contains     the proposition some hyænas are savage animals hence it     implies that each of the two classes hyænas and savage     animals taken by itself is real                                                                     pg020 § 5  translation of a proposition of relation into one or more propositions of existence  we have seen that a proposition of relation beginning with some asserts that some existing things being members of its subject are also members of its predicate hence it asserts that some existing things are members of both ie it asserts that some existing things are members of the class of things which have all the attributes of the subject and the predicate  hence to translate it into a proposition of existence we take existing things as the new subject and things which have all the attributes of the subject and the predicate as the new predicate  similarly for a proposition of relation beginning with no  a proposition of relation beginning with all is as shown in § 3 equivalent to two propositions one beginning with some and the other with no each of which we now know how to translate      let us work a few examples to illustrate these rules      1          some apples are not ripe      here we arrange thus          some                     sign of quantity         existing things          subject         are                      copula         notripe apples          predicate      or thus          some  existing things  are  notripe apples                                                                    pg021     2          some farmers always grumble at the weather whatever         it may be      here we arrange thus          some  existing things  are  farmers who always         grumble at the weather whatever it may be      3          no lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars      here we arrange thus          no  existing things are  lambs accustomed to         smoke cigars      4          none of my speculations have brought me as much         as 5 per cent      here we arrange thus          no  existing things  are  speculations of mine         which have brought me as much as 5 per cent      5          none but the brave deserve the fair      here we note to begin with that the phrase none but the     brave is equivalent to no notbrave men we then arrange     thus          no  existing things  are  notbrave men deserving         of the fair      6          all bankers are rich men      this is equivalent to the two propositions some bankers are     rich men and no bankers are poor men      here we arrange thus          some  existing things  are  rich bankers             and         no  existing things  are  poor bankers       work examples § 1 14 p 97                                                                     pg022   book iii  the biliteral diagram      ··

certain class of things which we have selected as our universe of discourse or more briefly as our univ      for example we might say let univ be books and we might     imagine the diagram to be a large table assigned to all     books      the reader is strongly advised in reading this chapter not     to refer to the above diagram but to draw a large one for     himself without any letters and to have it by him while he     reads and keep his finger on that particular part of it     about which he is reading                                                                    pg023 secondly let us suppose that we have selected a certain adjunct which we may call x and have divided the large class to which we have assigned the whole diagram into the two smaller classes whose differentiæ are x and notx which we may call x and that we have assigned the north half of the diagram to the one which we may call the class of xthings or the xclass and the south half to the other which we may call the class of xthings or the xclass      for example we might say let x mean old so that x will     mean new and we might suppose that we had divided books into     the two classes whose differentiæ are old and new and had     assigned the north half of the table to old books and the     south half to new books  thirdly let us suppose that we have selected another adjunct which we may call y and have subdivided the xclass into the two classes whose differentiæ are y and y and that we have assigned the northwest cell to the one which we may call the xyclass and the northeast cell to the other which we may call the xyclass      for example we might say let y mean english so that y     will mean foreign and we might suppose that we had     subdivided old books into the two classes whose differentiæ     are english and foreign and had assigned the northwest     cell to old english books and the northeast cell to old     foreign books  fourthly let us suppose that we have subdivided the xclass in the same manner and have assigned the southwest cell to the xyclass and the southeast cell to the xyclass      for example we might suppose that we had subdivided new     books into the two classes new english books and new     foreign books and had assigned the southwest cell to the     one and the southeast cell to the other  it is evident that if we had begun by dividing for y and y and had then subdivided for x and x we should have got the same four classes hence we see that we have assigned the west half to the yclass and the east half to the yclass                                                                    pg024     thus in the above example we should find that we had assigned     the west half of the table to english books and the east     half to foreign books          ··            old      old             english  foreign            books    books                       new      new             english  foreign            books    books           ··      we have in fact assigned the four quarters of the table to     four different classes of books as here shown  the reader should carefully remember that in such a phrase as the xthings the word things means that particular kind of things to which the whole diagram has been assigned      thus if we say let univ be books we mean that we have     assigned the whole diagram to books in that case if we took     x to mean old the phrase the xthings would mean the old     books  the reader should not go on to the next chapter until he is quite familiar with the blank diagram i have advised him to draw  he ought to be able to name instantly the adjunct assigned to any compartment named in the righthand column of the following table  also he ought to be able to name instantly the compartment assigned to any adjunct named in the lefthand column  to make sure of this he had better put the book into the hands of some genial friend while he himself has nothing but the blank diagram and get that genial friend to question him on this table dodging about as much as possible the questions and answers should be something like this

at least one of these two cells is occupied possibly both are  our ingenious american cousins have invented a phrase to describe the condition of a man who has not yet made up his mind which of two political parties he will join such a man is said to be sitting on the fence this phrase exactly describes the condition of the red counter  let us also agree that a grey counter placed within a cell shall mean this cell is empty ie there is nothing in it      the reader had better provide himself with 4 red counters and 5     grey ones                                                                     pg027  chapter iii  representation of propositions   § 1  introductory  henceforwards in stating such propositions as some xthings exist or no xthings are ythings i shall omit the word things which the reader can supply for himself and shall write them as some x exist or no x are y      note that the word things is here used with a special     meaning as explained at p 23  a proposition containing only one of the letters used as symbols for attributes is said to be uniliteral      for example some x exist no y exist c  a proposition containing two letters is said to be biliteral      for example some xy exist no x are y c  a proposition is said to be in terms of the letters it contains whether with or without accents      thus some xy exist no x are y c are said to be in     terms of x and y                                                                     pg028 § 2  representation of propositions of existence  let us take first the proposition some x exist      note that this proposition is as explained at p 12     equivalent to some existing things are xthings  this tells us that there is at least one thing in the north half that is that the north half is occupied and this we can evidently represent by placing a red counter here represented by a dotted circle on the partition which divides the north half      ··                              ··      in the books example this proposition would be some old     books exist  similarly we may represent the three similar propositions some x exist some y exist and some y exist      the reader should make out all these for himself in the     books example these propositions would be some new books     exist c  let us take next the proposition no x exist  this tells us that there is nothing in the north half that is that the north half is empty that is that the northwest cell and the northeast cell are both of them empty and this we can represent by placing two grey counters in the north half one in each cell      ··                            ··      the reader may perhaps think that it would be enough to place a     grey counter on the partition in the north half and that     just as a red counter so placed would mean this half is     occupied so a grey one would mean this half is empty      this however would be a mistake we have seen that a red     counter so placed would mean at least one of these two     cells is occupied possibly both are hence a grey one     would merely mean at least one of these two cells is empty     possibly both are but what we have to represent is that     both cells are certainly empty and this can only be done by     placing a grey counter in each of them      in the books example this proposition would be no old books     exist                                                                    pg029 similarly we may represent the three similar propositions no x exist no y exist and no y exist      the reader should make out all these for himself in the     books example these three propositions would be no new books     exist c  let us take next the proposition some xy exist  this tells us that there is at least one thing in the northwest cell that is that the northwest cell is occupied and this we can represent by placing a red counter in it      ··                             ··      in the books example this proposition would be some old     english books exist  similarly we may represent the three similar propositions some xy exist some xy exist and some xy exist      the reader should make out all these for himself in the     books example these three propositions would be some old     foreign books exist c  let us take next the proposition no xy exist  this tells us that there is nothing in the northwest cell that is that the northwest cell is empty and this we can represent by placing a grey counter in it      ··                              ··      in the books example this proposition would be no old     english books exist  similarly we may represent the three similar propositions no xy exist no xy exist and no xy exist      the reader should make out all these for himself in the     books example these three propositions would be no old     foreign books exist c                                                                    pg030 we have seen that the proposition no x exist may be represented by placing two grey counters in the north half one in each cell      ··                            ··  we have also seen that these two grey counters taken separately represent the two propositions no xy exist and no xy exist  hence we see that the proposition no x exist is a double proposition and is equivalent to the two propositions no xy exist and no xy exist      in the books example this proposition would be no old books     exist      hence this is a double proposition and is equivalent to the     two propositions no old english books exist and no old     foreign books exist   § 3  representation of propositions of relation  let us take first the proposition some x are y  this tells us that at least one thing in the north half is also in the west half hence it must be in the space common to them that is in the northwest cell hence the northwest cell is occupied and this we can represent by placing a red counter in it      ··                             ··      note that the subject of the proposition settles which half     we are to use and that the predicate settles in which     portion of it we are to place the red counter      in the books example this proposition would be some old     books are english  similarly we may represent the three similar propositions some x are y some x are y and some x are y      the reader should make out all these for himself in the     books example these three propositions would be some old     books are foreign c                                                                    pg031 let us take next the proposition some y are x  this tells us that at least one thing in the west half is also in the north half hence it must be in the space common to them that is in the northwest cell hence the northwest cell is occupied and this we can represent by placing a red counter in it      ··                             ··      in the books example this proposition would be some english     books are old  similarly

be some english     books are new c  we see that this one diagram has now served to represent no less than three propositions viz      1 some xy exist     2  some x are y     3  some y are x      ··                             ··  hence these three propositions are equivalent      in the books example these propositions would be          1 some old english books exist         2  some old books are english         3  some english books are old  the two equivalent propositions some x are y and some y are x are said to be converse to each other and the process of changing one into the other is called converting or conversion      for example if we were told to convert the proposition      some apples are not ripe      we should first choose our univ say fruit and then     complete the proposition by supplying the substantive fruit     in the predicate so that it would be      some apples are notripe fruit      and we should then convert it by interchanging its terms so     that it would be      some notripe fruit are apples                                                                    pg032 similarly we may represent the three similar trios of equivalent propositions the whole set of four trios being as follows      1 some xy exist  some x are y  some y are x     2 some xy exist  some x are y  some y are x     3 some xy exist  some x are y  some y are x     4 some xy exist  some x are y  some y are x  let us take next the proposition no x are y  this tell us that no thing in the north half is also in the west half hence there is nothing in the space common to them

proposition would be no old books     are english  similarly we may represent the three similar propositions no x are y and no x are y and no x are y      the reader should make out all these for himself in the     books example these three propositions would be no old books     are foreign c  let us take next the proposition no y are x  this tells us that no thing in the west half is also in

english books are old  the two equivalent propositions no x are y and no y are x are said to be converse to each other      for example if we were told to convert the proposition      no porcupines are talkative      we should first choose our univ say animals and then     complete the proposition by supplying the substantive animals     in the predicate so that it would be      no porcupines

counters   the diagram is supposed to be set before us with certain counters placed upon it and the problem is to find out what proposition or propositions the counters represent  as the process is simply the reverse of that discussed in the previous chapter we can avail ourselves of the results there obtained as far as they go  first let us suppose that we find a red counter placed in the northwest cell      ··                             ··  we know that this represents each of the trio of equivalent propositions  some xy exist  some x are y  some y are x  similarly we may interpret a red counter when placed in the northeast or southwest or southeast cell  next let us suppose that we find a grey counter placed in the northwest cell      ··                              ··  we know that this represents each of the trio of equivalent propositions  no xy exist  no x are y  no y are x  similarly we may interpret a grey counter when placed in the northeast or southwest or southeast cell                                                                    pg037 next let us suppose that we find a red counter placed on the partition which divides the north half      ··                              ··  we know that this represents the proposition some x exist  similarly we may interpret a red counter when placed on the partition which divides the south or west or east half                                       next let us suppose that we find two red counters placed in the north half one in each cell      ··                          ··  we know that this represents the double proposition some x are y and some are y  similarly we may interpret two red counters when placed in the south or west or east half                                       next let us suppose that we find two grey counters placed in the north half one in each cell      ··                            ··  we know that this represents the proposition no x exist  similarly we may interpret two grey counters when placed in the south or west or east half                                       lastly let us suppose that we find a red and a grey counter placed in the north half the red in the northwest cell and the grey in the northeast cell      ··                           ··  we know that this represents the proposition all x are y      note that the half occupied by the two counters settles     what is to be the subject of the proposition and that the     cell occupied by the red counter settles what is to be its     predicate

southeast     red in southeast grey in southwest     red in northwest grey in southwest     red in southwest grey in northwest     red in northeast grey in southeast     red in southeast grey in northeast  once more the genial friend must be appealed to and requested to examine the reader on tables ii and iii and to make him not only represent propositions but also interpret diagrams when marked with counters  the questions and answers should be like this      q represent no x are y     a grey counter in se cell     q interpret red counter on e partition     a some y exist     q

lefthand diagram is the biliteral diagram that we have been using in book iii and that we change it into a triliteral diagram by drawing an inner square so as to divide each of its 4 cells into 2 portions thus making 8 cells altogether the righthand diagram shows the result      the reader is strongly advised in reading this chapter not     to refer to the above diagrams but to make a large copy of the     righthand one for himself without any letters and to have     it by him while he reads and keep his finger on that particular     part of it about which he is reading                                                                    pg040 secondly let us suppose that we have selected a certain adjunct which we may call m and have subdivided the xyclass into the two classes whose differentiæ are m and m and that we have assigned the nw inner cell to the one which we may call the class of xymthings or the xymclass and the nw outer cell to the other which we may call the class of xymthings or the xymclass      thus in the books example we might say let m mean bound     so that m will mean unbound and we might suppose that we     had subdivided the class old english books into the two     classes old english bound books and old english unbound     books and had assigned the nw inner cell to the one and     the nw outer cell to the other  thirdly let us suppose that we have subdivided the xyclass the xyclass and the xyclass in the same manner and have in each case assigned the inner cell to the class possessing the attribute m and the outer cell to the class possessing the attribute m      thus in the books example we might suppose that we had     subdivided the new english books into the two classes new     english bound books and new english unbound books and had     assigned the sw inner cell to the one and the sw outer     cell to the other  it is evident that we have now assigned the inner square to the mclass and the outer border to the mclass      thus in the books example we have assigned the inner     square to bound books and the outer border to unbound     books  when the reader has made himself familiar with this diagram he ought to be able to find in a moment the compartment assigned to a particular pair of attributes or the cell assigned to a particular trio of attributes the following rules will help him in doing this      1 arrange the attributes in the order x y m                                                                    pg041     2 take the first of them and find the compartment     assigned to it      3 then take the second and find what portion of that     compartment is assigned to it      4 treat the third if there is one in the same way      for example suppose we have to find the compartment assigned     to ym we say to ourselves y has the west half and m has the     inner portion of that west half      again suppose we have to find the cell assigned to xym we     say to ourselves x has the south half y has the west     portion of that south half ie has the southwest quarter     and m has the outer portion of that southwest quarter  the reader should now get his genial friend to

us take first the proposition some xm exist      note that the full meaning of this proposition is as     explained at p 12 some existing things are xmthings  this tells us that there is at least one thing in the inner portion of the north half that is that this compartment is occupied and this we can evidently represent by placing a red counter on the partition which divides it      ··

old bound books  similarly we may represent the seven similar propositions some xm exist some xm exist some xm exist some ym exist some ym exist some ym exist and some ym exist                                                                    pg044 let us take next the proposition no xm exist  this tells us that there is nothing in the inner portion of the north half that is that this compartment is empty and this we can represent by placing two grey counters in it one in each cell      ··                           ··                                              ··                           ··

are the only ones that we shall have to represent on this diagram   § 2  representation of propositions of relation in terms of x and m or of y and m  let us take first the pair of converse

that this is a double proposition and equivalent to the two propositions some x are m and no x are m  each of which we already know how to represent  similarly for the fifteen similar propositions in terms of x and m or of y and m  these thirtytwo propositions of relation are the only ones that we shall have to represent on this diagram  the reader should now get his genial friend to question him

of two propositions of relation one in terms of x and m and the other in terms of y and m on the same diagram   the reader had better now begin to draw little diagrams for himself and to mark them with the digits i and o instead of using the board and counters he may put a i to represent a red counter this may be interpreted to mean there is at least one thing here and a o to represent a grey counter this may be interpreted to mean there is nothing here  the pair of propositions that we shall have to represent will always be one in terms of x and m and the other in terms of y and m  when we have to represent a proposition beginning with all we break it up into the two propositions to which it is equivalent  when we have to represent on the same diagram propositions of which some begin with some and others with no we represent the negative ones first this will sometimes save us from having to put a i on a fence and afterwards having to shift it into a cell      let us work a few examples      1          no x are m          no y are m      let us first represent no x are m this gives us diagram a      then representing no y are m on the same diagram we get     diagram b

        some m are x          no m are y      if neglecting the rule we were begin with some m are x we     should get diagram a      and if we were then to take no m are y which tells us that     the inner nw cell is empty we should be obliged to take the     i off the fence as it no longer has the choice of two     cells and to put it into the inner ne cell as in diagram c      this trouble may be saved by beginning with no m are y as in     diagram b      and now when we take some m are x there is no fence to sit     on the i has to go at once into the ne cell as in     diagram c

   ··      3          no x are m          all m are y      here we begin by breaking up the second into the two     propositions to which it is equivalent thus we have three     propositions to represent viz          1 no x are m         2  some m are y         3  no m are y      these we will take in the order 1 3 2      first we take no 1 viz no x are m this gives us     diagram a

fence as there is no o to order it off     this gives us diagram c                  a                    b                    c         ··    ··    ··

viz          1 some m are x         2  no m are x         3  some y are m         4  no y are m      these we will take in the order 2 4 1 3      first we take no 2 viz no m are x this gives us diagram     a      to this we add no 4 viz no y are m and thus get diagram     b      if we were to add to this no 1 viz some m are x we     should have to put the i on a fence so let us try no 3     instead viz some y are m this gives us diagram c      and now there is no need to trouble about no 1 as it would     not add anything to our information to put a i on the fence     the diagram already tells us that some m are x              a                    b                    c     ··    ··    ··                       o               o                   ··          ··          ··

counters or digits   the problem before us is given a marked triliteral diagram to ascertain what propositions of relation in terms of x and y are represented on it  the best plan for a beginner is to draw a biliteral diagram alongside of it and to transfer from the one to the other all the information he can he can then read off from the biliteral diagram the required propositions after a little practice he will be able to dispense with the biliteral diagram and to read off the result from the triliteral diagram itself  to transfer the information observe the following rules      1 examine the nw quarter of the triliteral diagram      2 if it contains a i in either cell it is certainly     occupied and you may mark the nw quarter of the     biliteral diagram with a i      3 if it contains two os one in each cell it is     certainly empty and you may mark the nw quarter of the     biliteral diagram with a o

relation is such that      1 all their six terms are species of the same genus      2 every two of them contain between them a pair of     codivisional classes      3 the three propositions are so related that if the first     two were true the third would be true  the trio is called a syllogism the genus of which each of the six terms is a species is called its universe of discourse or more briefly its univ the first two propositions are called its premisses and the third its conclusion also the pair of codivisional terms in the premisses are called its eliminands and the other two its retinends  the conclusion of a syllogism is said to be consequent from its premisses hence it is usual to prefix to it the word therefore or the symbol                                                                     pg057     note that the eliminands are so called because they are     eliminated and do not appear in the conclusion and that the     retinends are so called because they are retained and do     appear in the conclusion      note also that the question whether the conclusion is or is not     consequent from the premisses is not affected by the actual     truth or falsity of any of the trio but depends entirely on     their relationship to each other      as a specimensyllogism let us take the trio          no xthings are mthings          no ythings are mthings              no xthings are ythings      which we may write as explained at p 26 thus          no x are m          no y are m              no x are y      here the first and second contain the pair of codivisional     classes m and m the first and third contain the pair x and x     and the second and third contain the pair y and y      also the three propositions are as we shall see hereafter so     related that if the first two were true the third would also     be true      hence the trio is a syllogism the two propositions no x are     m and no y are m are its premisses the proposition no x     are y is its conclusion the terms m and m are its     eliminands and the terms x and y are its retinends      hence we may write it thus          no x are m          no y are m           no x are y      as a second specimen let us take the trio          all cats understand french          some chickens are cats              some chickens understand french      these put into normal form are          all cats are creatures understanding french          some chickens are cats              some chickens are creatures understanding french      here all the six terms are species of the genus creatures      also the first and second propositions contain the pair of     codivisional classes cats and cats the first and third     contain the pair creatures understanding french and creatures     understanding french and the second and third contain the pair     chickens and chickens                                                                    pg058     also the three propositions are as we shall see at p 64 so     related that if the first two were true the third would be     true the first two are as it happens not strictly true in     our planet but there is nothing to hinder them from being     true in some other planet say mars or jupiterin which     case the third would also be true in that planet and its     inhabitants would probably engage chickens as     nurserygovernesses they would thus secure a singular     contingent privilege unknown in england namely that they     would be able at any time when provisions ran short to utilise     the nurserygoverness for the nurserydinner      hence the trio is a syllogism the genus creatures is its     univ the two propositions all cats understand french and     some chickens are cats are its premisses the proposition     some chickens understand french is its conclusion the terms     cats and cats are its eliminands and the terms     creatures understanding french and chickens are its     retinends      hence we may write it thus          all cats understand french          some chickens are cats           some chickens understand french                                                                     pg059  chapter ii  problems in syllogisms   § 1  introductory  when the terms of a proposition are represented by words it is said to be concrete when by letters abstract  to translate a proposition from concrete into abstract form we fix on a univ and regard each term as a species of it and we choose a letter to represent its differentia      for example suppose we wish to translate some soldiers are     brave into abstract form we may take men as univ and     regard soldiers and brave men as species of the genus     men and we may choose x to represent the peculiar attribute     say military of soldiers and y to represent brave then     the proposition may be written some military men are brave     men ie some xmen are ymen ie omitting men as     explained at p 26 some x are y      in practice we should merely say let univ be men     x  soldiers y  brave and at once translate some soldiers     are brave into some x are y  the problems we shall have to solve are of two kinds viz  1 given a pair of propositions of relation which contain between them a pair of codivisional classes and which are proposed as premisses to ascertain what conclusion if any is consequent from them  2 given a trio of propositions of relation of which every two contain a pair of codivisional classes and which are proposed as a syllogism to ascertain whether the proposed conclusion is consequent from the proposed premisses and if so whether it is complete  these problems we will discuss separately                                                                     pg060 § 2  given a pair of propositions of relation which contain between them a pair of codivisional classes and which are proposed as premisses to ascertain what conclusion if any is consequent from them  the rules for doing this are as follows  1 determine the universe of discourse  2 construct a dictionary making m and m or m and m represent the pair of codivisional classes and x or x and y or y the other two  3 translate the proposed premisses into abstract form  4 represent them together on a triliteral diagram  5 ascertain what proposition if any in terms of x and y is also represented on it  6 translate this into concrete form  it is evident that if the proposed premisses were true this other proposition would also be true hence it is a conclusion consequent from the proposed premisses      let us work some examples      1          no son of mine is dishonest          people always treat an honest man with respect      taking men as univ we may write these as follows          no sons of mine are dishonest men          all honest men are men treated with respect      we can now construct our dictionary viz m  honest x  sons     of mine y  treated with respect      note that the expression x  sons of mine is an abbreviated     form of x  the differentia of sons of mine when regarded as     a species of men      the next thing is to translate the proposed premisses into     abstract form as follows          no x are m          all m are y                                                                     pg061     next by the process described at p 50 we represent these on a     triliteral diagram thus          ··         o        o            ··                  o            i               o               ··                                   ··      next by the process described at p 53 we transfer to a     biliteral diagram all the information we can          ··            o                                 ··      the result we read as no x are y or as no y are x     whichever we prefer so we refer to our dictionary to see which     will look best and we choose          no x are y      which translated into concrete form is          no son of mine fails to be treated with respect      2          all cats understand french          some chickens are cats      taking creatures as univ we write these as follows          all cats are creatures understanding french          some chickens are cats      we can now construct our dictionary viz m  cats     x  understanding french y  chickens      the proposed premisses translated into

us agree that x1 shall mean some existing things have the attribute x ie more briefly some x exist also that xy1 shall mean some xy exist and so on such a proposition may be called an entity      note that when there are two letters in the expression it     does not in the least matter which stands first xy1 and     yx1 mean exactly the same  also that x0 shall mean no existing things have the attribute x ie more briefly no x exist also that xy0 shall mean no xy exist and so on such a proposition may be called a nullity  also that  shall mean and      thus ab1  cd0 means some ab exist and

existence some xy exist see p 31 hence it may be represented by the expression xy1  the converse proposition some y are x may of course be represented by the same expression viz xy1  similarly we may represent the three similar pairs of converse propositions viz      some x are y   some y are x     some x are y   some y are x     some x are y  some y are x  let us take next the proposition no x are y  this we know is equivalent to the proposition of existence no xy exist see p 33 hence it may be represented by the expression xy0  the converse proposition no y are x may of course be represented by the same expression viz xy0  similarly we may represent the three similar pairs of converse propositions viz      no x are y   no y are x     no x are y   no y are x     no x are y  no

and no xy exist tells us that some xthings exist but that none of them have the attribute y that is it tells us that all of them have the attribute y that is it tells us that all x are y  also it is evident that the expression x1  xy0 represents this double proposition  hence it also represents the proposition all x are y      the reader will perhaps be puzzled by the statement that the     proposition all x are y is equivalent to the double     proposition some x exist and no xy exist remembering that it     was stated at p 33 to be equivalent to the double proposition     some x are y and no x are y ie some xy exist and no xy     exist the explanation is that the proposition some xy exist     contains superfluous information some x exist is enough for     our purpose  this expression may be written in a shorter form viz x1y0 since each subscript takes effect back to the beginning of the expression  similarly we may represent the seven similar propositions all x are y all x are y all x are y all y are x all y are x all y are x and all y are x      the reader should make out all these for himself  it will be convenient to remember that in translating a proposition beginning with all from abstract form into subscript form or vice versâ the predicate changes sign that is changes from positive to negative or else from negative to positive      thus the proposition all y are x becomes y1x0     where the predicate changes from x to x      again the expression x1y0 becomes all x are y     where the predicate changes for y to y

that is done all we need besides is to write the three expressions in a row with  between the premisses and ¶ before the conclusion      thus the syllogism          no x are m          all m are y               no x are y      may be represented thus          xm0  m1y0 ¶ xy0      when a proposition has to be translated from concrete form into     subscript form the reader will find it convenient just at     first to translate it into abstract form and thence into     subscript form but after a little practice he will find it     quite easy to go straight from concrete form to subscript form                                                                     pg074 § 2  formulæ for solving problems in syllogisms  when once we have found by diagrams the conclusion to a given pair of premisses and have represented the syllogism in subscript form we have a formula by which we can at once find without having to use diagrams again the conclusion to any other pair of premisses having the same subscript forms      thus the expression          xm0  ym0 ¶ xy0      is a formula by which we can find the conclusion to any pair of     premisses whose subscript forms are          xm0  ym0      for example suppose we had the pair of propositions          no gluttons are healthy          no unhealthy men are strong      proposed as premisses taking men as our universe and     making m  healthy x  gluttons y  strong we might translate     the pair into abstract form thus          no x are m          no m are y      these in subscript form would be          xm0  my0      which are identical with those in our formula hence we at     once know the conclusion to be          xy0      that is in abstract form          no x are y      that is in concrete form          no gluttons are strong  i shall now take three different forms of pairs of premisses and work out their conclusions once for all by diagrams and thus obtain some useful formulæ i shall call them fig i fig ii and fig iii

and we should find this rule to hold good with any pair of premisses which fulfil the given conditions      the reader had better satisfy himself of this by working out     on diagrams several varieties such as          m1x0  ym0 which ¶ xy0         xm0  m1y0 which ¶ xy0         xm0  ym0 which ¶ xy0         m1x0  m1y0 which ¶ xy0  if either retinend is asserted in the premisses to exist of course it may be so asserted in the conclusion  hence we get two variants of fig i viz  a where one retinend is so asserted  b where both are so asserted      the reader had better work out on diagrams examples of these     two variants such as          m1x0  y1m0 which proves y1x0         x1m0  m1y0 which proves x1y0         x1m0  y1m0 which proves x1y0  y1x0  the formula to be remembered is      xm0  ym0 ¶ xy0  with the following two rules      1 two nullities with unlike eliminands yield a nullity     in which both retinends keep their signs

i will now work out by these formulæ as models for the reader to imitate some problems in syllogisms which have been already worked by diagrams in book v chap ii  1 see p 64      no son of mine is

which deceives us by seeming to prove what it does not really prove may be called a fallacy derived from the latin verb fallo i deceive but the particular kind to be now discussed consists of a pair of propositions which are proposed as the premisses of a syllogism but yield no conclusion  when each of the proposed premisses is a proposition in i or e or a the only kinds with which we are now concerned the fallacy may be detected by the method of diagrams by simply setting them out on a triliteral diagram and observing that they yield no information which can be transferred to the biliteral diagram  but suppose we were working by the method of subscripts and had to deal with a pair of proposed premisses which happened to be a fallacy how could we be certain that they would not yield any conclusion  our best plan is i think to deal with fallacies in the same was as we have already dealt with syllogisms that is to take certain forms of pairs of propositions and to work them out once for all on the triliteral diagram and ascertain that they yield no conclusion and then to record them for future use as formulæ for fallacies just as we have already recorded our three formulæ for syllogisms                                                                    pg082 now if we were to record the two sets of formulæ in the same shape viz by the method of subscripts there would be considerable risk of confusing the two kinds hence in order to keep them distinct i propose to record the formulæ for fallacies in words and to call them forms instead of formulæ  let us now proceed to find by the method of diagrams three forms of fallacies which we will then put on record for future use they are as follows      1 fallacy of like eliminands not asserted to exist     2 fallacy of unlike eliminands with an entitypremiss     3 fallacy of two entitypremisses  these shall be discussed separately and it will be seen that each fails to yield a conclusion  1 fallacy of like eliminands not asserted to exist  it is evident that neither of the given propositions can be an entity since that kind asserts the existence of both of its terms see p 20 hence they must both be nullities  hence the given pair may be represented by xm0  ym0 with or without x1 y1  these set out on triliteral diagrams are       xm0  ym0        x1m0  ym0     ··        ··

method of proceeding with a given pair of propositions  let us suppose that we have before us a pair of propositions of relation which contain between them a pair of codivisional classes and that we wish to ascertain what conclusion if any is consequent from them we translate them if necessary into subscriptform and then proceed as follows  1 we examine their subscripts in order to see whether they are      a a pair of nullities     or b a nullity and an entity     or c a pair of entities  2 if they are a pair of nullities we examine their eliminands in order to see whether they are unlike or like  if their eliminands are unlike it is a case of fig i we then examine their retinends to see whether one or both of them are asserted to exist if one retinend is so asserted it is a case of fig i a if both it is a case of fig i b  if their eliminands are like we examine them in order to see whether either of them is asserted to exist if so it is a case of fig iii if not it is a case of fallacy of like eliminands not asserted to exist  3 if they are a nullity and an entity we examine their eliminands in order to see whether they are like or unlike  if their eliminands are like it is a case of fig ii if unlike it is a case of fallacy of unlike eliminands with an entitypremiss  4 if they are a pair of entities it is a case of fallacy of two entitypremisses       work examples § 4

or more biliteral propositions are such that all their terms are species of the same genus and are also so related that two of them taken together yield a conclusion which taken with another of them yields another conclusion and so on until all have been taken it is evident that if the original set were true the last conclusion would also be true  such a set with the last conclusion tacked on is called a sorites the original set of propositions is called its premisses each of the intermediate conclusions is called a partial conclusion of the sorites the last conclusion is called its complete conclusion or more briefly its conclusion the genus of which all the terms are species is called its universe of discourse or more briefly its univ the terms used as eliminands in the syllogisms are called its eliminands and the two terms which are retained and therefore appear in the conclusion are called its retinends      note that each partial conclusion contains one or two     eliminands but that the complete conclusion contains     retinends only  the conclusion is said to be consequent from the premisses for which reason it is usual to prefix to it the word therefore or the symbol       note that the question whether the conclusion is or is not     consequent from the premisses is not affected by the actual     truth or falsity of any one of the propositions which make up     the sorites by depends entirely on their relationship to one     another                                                                    pg086     as a specimensorites let us take the following set of 5     propositions          1 no a are b         2  all b are c         3  all c are d         4  no e are a         5  all h are e      here the first and second taken together yield no a are c      this taken along with the third yields no a are d      this taken along with the fourth yields no d are e      and this taken along with the fifth yields all h are d      hence if the original set were true this would also be true      hence the original set with this tacked on is a sorites the     original set is its premisses the proposition all h are d     is its conclusion the terms a b c e are its eliminands     and the terms d and h are its retinends      hence we may write the whole sorites thus          no a are b          all b are c          all c are d          no e are a          all h are e               all h are d      in the above sorites the 3 partial conclusions are the     positions no a are e no a are d no d are e but if     the premisses were arranged in other ways other partial     conclusions might be obtained thus the order 41523 yields the     partial conclusions no c are b all h are b all h are     c there are altogether nine partial conclusions to this     sorites which the reader will find it an interesting task to     make out for himself                                                                     pg087  chapter ii  problems in soriteses   § 1  introductory  the problems we shall have to solve are of the following form  given three or more propositions of relation which are proposed as premisses to ascertain what conclusion if any is consequent from them  we will limit ourselves at present to problems which can be worked by the formulæ of fig i see p 75 those that require other formulæ are rather too hard for beginners  such problems may be solved by either of two methods viz      1 the method of separate syllogisms     2 the method of underscoring  these shall be discussed separately                                                                     pg088 § 2  solution by method of separate syllogisms  the rules for doing this are as follows      1 name the universe of discourse      2 construct a dictionary making a b c c represent     the terms      3 put the proposed premisses into subscript form      4 select two which containing between them a pair of     codivisional classes can be used as the premisses of a     syllogism      5 find their conclusion by formula      6 find a third premiss which along with this conclusion     can be used as the premisses of a second syllogism      7 find a second conclusion by formula      8 proceed thus until all the proposed premisses have     been used      9 put the last conclusion which is the complete     conclusion of the sorites into concrete form      as an example of this process let us take as the proposed set     of premisses          1 all the policemen on this beat sup with our cook         2  no man with long hair can fail to be a poet         3  amos judd has never been in prison         4  our cooks cousins all love cold mutton         5  none but policemen on this beat are poets         6  none but her cousins ever sup with our cook         7  men with short hair have all been in prison      univ men a  amos judd b  cousins of our cook c  having     been in prison d  longhaired e  loving cold mutton     h  poets k  policemen on this beat l  supping with our cook                                                                    pg089     we now have to put the proposed premisses into subscript form     let us begin by putting them into abstract form the result is          1 all k are l         2  no d are h         3  all a are c         4  all b are e         5  no k are h         6  no b are l         7  all d are c      and it is now easy to put them into subscript form as     follows          1 k1l0         2 dh0         3 a1c0         4 b1e0         5 kh0         6 bl0         7 d1c0      we now have to find a pair of premisses which will yield a     conclusion let us begin with no 1 and look down the list     till we come to one which we can take along with it so as to     form premisses belonging to fig i we find that no 5 will     do since we can take k as our eliminand so our first syllogism     is          1 k1l0         5 kh0              lh0  8      we must now begin again with lh0 and find a premiss to go     along with it we find that no 2 will do h being our     eliminand so our next syllogism is          8 lh0         2 dh0              ld0  9      we have now used up nos 1 5 and 2 and must search     among the others for a partner for ld0 we find that no 6     will do so we write          9 ld0         6 bl0              db0  10      now what can we take along with db0 no 4 will do         10 db0         4 b1e0              de0  11                                                                    pg090     along with this we may take no 7         11 de0         7 d1c0              ce0  12      and along with this we may take no 3         12 ce0         3 a1c0              a1e0      this complete conclusion translated into abstract form is          all a are e      and this translated into concrete form is          amos judd loves cold mutton      in actually working this problem the above explanations     would of course be omitted and all that would appear on     paper would be as follows          1 k1l0         2 dh0         3 a1c0         4 b1e0         5 kh0         6 bl0         7 d1c0           1 k1l0         5 kh0              lh0  8          8 lh0         2

a1c0              a1e0      note that in working a sorites by this process we may begin     with any premiss we choose                                                                     pg091 § 3  solution by method of underscoring  consider the pair of premisses      xm0  ym0  which yield the conclusion xy0  we see that in order to get this conclusion we must eliminate m and m and write x and y together in one expression  now if we agree to mark m and m as eliminated and to read the two expressions together as if they were written in one the two premisses will then exactly represent the conclusion and we need not write it out separately  let us agree to mark the eliminated letters by underscoring them putting a single score under the first and a double one under the second  the two premisses now become      xm0  ym0                which we read as xy0  in copying out the premisses for underscoring it will be convenient to omit all subscripts as to the 0s we may always suppose them written and as to the 1s we are not concerned to know which terms are asserted to exist except those which appear in the complete conclusion and for them it will be easy enough to refer to the original list                                                                    pg092     i will now go through the process of solving by this method     the example worked in § 2      the data are               1           2          3             4         k1l0  dh0  a1c0  b1e0              5         6           7         kh0  bl0  d1c0      the reader should take a piece of paper and write out this     solution for himself the first line will consist of the above     data the second must be composed bit by bit according to the     following directions      we begin by writing down the first premiss with its numeral     over it but omitting the subscripts      we have now to find a premiss which can be combined with this     ie a premiss containing either k or l the first we find     is no 5 and this we tack on with a       to get the conclusion from these k and k must be eliminated     and what remains must be taken as one expression so we     underscore them putting a single score under k and a     double one under k the result we read as lh      we must now find a premiss containing either l or h looking     along the row we fix on no 2 and tack it on      now these 3 nullities are really equivalent to lh  dh in     which h and h must be eliminated and what remains taken as one     expression so we underscore them the result reads as ld      we now want a premiss containing l or d no 6 will do      these 4 nullities are really equivalent to ld  bl so we     underscore l and l the result reads as db      we now want a premiss containing d or b no 4 will do      here we underscore b and b the result reads as de      we now want a premiss containing d or e no 7 will do      here we underscore d and d the result reads as ce      we now want a premiss containing c or e no 3 will doin fact     must do as it is the only one left      here we underscore c and c and as the whole thing now reads     as ea we tack on ea0 as the conclusion with a ¶      we now look along the row of data to see whether e or a has     been given as existent we find that a has been so given in     no 3 so we add this fact to the conclusion which now stands     as ¶ ea0  a1 ie ¶ a1e0 ie all a are e      if the reader has faithfully obeyed the above directions his     written solution will now stand as follows               1           2          3             4         k1l0

data only and try to work out the solution for himself     beginning with some other premiss      if he fails to bring out the conclusion a1e0 i would     advise him to take a third piece of paper and begin again  i will now work out in its briefest form a sorites of 5 premisses to serve as a model for the reader to imitate in working examples      1 i greatly value everything that john gives me     2  nothing but this bone will satisfy my dog     3  i take particular care of everything that i greatly          value     4  this bone was a present from john     5  the things of which i take

syllogism has no real validity as an argument since it involves the fallacy of petitio principii ie begging the question the essence of which is that the whole conclusion is involved in one of the premisses  this formidable objection is refuted with beautiful clearness and simplicity by these three diagrams which show us that in each of the three figures the conclusion is really involved in the two premisses taken together each contributing its share  thus in fig i the premiss xm0 empties the inner cell of the nw quarter while the premiss ym0 empties its outer cell hence it needs the two premisses to empty the whole of the nw quarter and thus to prove the conclusion xy0  again in fig ii the premiss xm0 empties the inner cell of the nw quarter the premiss ym1 merely tells us that the inner portion of the w half is occupied so that we may place a i in it somewhere but if this were the whole of our information we should not know in which cell to place it so that it would have to sit on the fence it is only when we learn from the other premiss that the upper of these two cells is empty that we feel authorised to place the i in the lower cell and thus to prove the conclusion xy1  lastly in fig iii the information that m exists merely authorises us to place a i somewhere in the inner squarebut it has large choice of fences to sit upon it needs the premiss xm0 to drive it out of the n half of that square and it needs the premiss ym0 to drive it out of the w half hence it needs the two premisses to drive it into the inner portion of the se quarter and thus to prove the conclusion xy1                                                                     pg165   appendix  addressed to teachers   § 1  introductory   there are several matters too hard to discuss with learners which nevertheless need to be explained to any teachers into whose hands this book may fall in order that they may thoroughly understand what my symbolic method is and in what respects it differs from the many other methods already published  these matters are as follows      the existential import of propositions     the use of isnot or arenot as a copula     the theory two negative premisses prove nothing     eulers method of diagrams     venns method of diagrams     my method of diagrams     the solution of a syllogism by various methods     my method of treating syllogisms and sorites     some account of parts ii iii   § 2  the existential import of propositions   the writers and editors of the logical textbooks which run in the ordinary groovesto whom i shall hereafter refer by the i hope inoffensive title the logicianstake on this subject what seems to me to be a more humble position than is at all necessary they speak of the copula of a proposition with bated breath almost as if it were a living conscious entity capable of declaring for itself what it chose to mean and that we poor human creatures had nothing to do but to ascertain what was its sovereign will and pleasure and submit to it                                                                    pg166 in opposition to this view i maintain that any writer of a book is fully authorised in attaching any meaning he likes to any word or phrase he intends to use if i find an author saying at the beginning of his book let it be understood that by the word black i shall always mean white and that by the word white i shall always mean black i meekly accept his ruling however injudicious i may think it  and so with regard to the question whether a proposition is or is not to be understood as asserting the existence of its subject i maintain that every writer may adopt his own rule provided of course that it is consistent with itself and with the accepted facts of logic  let us consider certain views that may logically be held and thus settle which of them may conveniently be held after which i shall hold myself free to declare which of them i intend to hold  the kinds of propositions to be considered are those that begin with some with no and with all these are usually called propositions in i in e and in a  first then a proposition in i may be understood as asserting or else as not asserting the existence of its subject by existence i mean of course whatever kind of existence suits its nature the two propositions dreams exist and drums exist denote two totally different kinds of existence a dream is an aggregate of ideas and exists only in the mind of a dreamer whereas a drum is an aggregate of wood and parchment and exists in the hands of a drummer  first let us suppose that i asserts ie asserts the existence of its subject  here of course we must regard a proposition in a as making the same assertion since it necessarily contains a proposition in i  we now have i and a asserting does this leave us free to make what supposition we choose as to e my answer is no we are tied down to the supposition that e does not assert this can be proved as follows  if possible let e assert then taking x y and z to represent attributes we see that if the proposition no xy are z be true some things exist with the attributes x and y ie some x are y                                                                    pg167 also we know that if the proposition some xy are z be true the same result follows  but these two propositions are contradictories so that one or other of them must be true hence this result is always true ie the proposition some x are y is always true  quod est absurdum see note a p 195  we see then that the supposition i asserts necessarily leads to a asserts but e does not and this is the first of the various views that may conceivably be held  next let us suppose that i does not assert and along with this let us take the supposition that e does assert  hence the proposition no x are y means some x exist and none of them are y ie all of them are noty which is a proposition in a we also know of course that the proposition all x are noty proves no x are y now two propositions each of which proves the other are equivalent hence every proposition in a is equivalent to one in e and therefore asserts  hence our second conceivable view is e and a assert but i does not  this view does not seen to involve any necessary contradiction with itself or with the accepted facts of logic but when we come to test it as applied to the actual facts of life we shall find i think that it fits in with them so badly that its adoption would be to say the least of it singularly inconvenient for ordinary folk  let me record a little dialogue i have just held with my friend jones who is trying to form a new club to be regulated on strictly logical principles  author well jones have you got your new club started yet  jones rubbing his hands youll be glad to hear that some of the members mind i only say some are millionaires rolling in gold my boy  author that sounds well and how many members have entered  jones staring none at all we havent got it started yet what makes you think we have  author why i thought you said that some of the members                                                                    pg168 jones contemptuously you dont seem to be aware that were working on strictly logical principles a particular proposition does not assert the existence of its subject i merely meant to say that weve made a rule not to admit any members till we have at least three candidates whose incomes are over ten thousand a year  author oh thats what you meant is it lets hear some more of your rules  jones another is that no one who has been convicted seven times of forgery is admissible  author and here again i suppose you dont mean to assert there are any such convicts in existence  jones why thats exactly what i do mean to assert dont you know that a universal negative asserts the existence of its subject of course we didnt make that rule till we had satisfied ourselves that there are several such convicts now living  the reader can now decide for himself how far this second conceivable view would fit in with the facts of life he will i think agree with me that jones view of the existential import of propositions would lead to some inconvenience  thirdly let us suppose that neither i nor e asserts  now the supposition that the two propositions some x are y and no x are noty do not assert necessarily involves the supposition that all x are y does not assert since it would be absurd to suppose that they assert when combined more than they do when taken separately  hence the third and last of the conceivable views is that neither i nor e nor a asserts  the advocates of this third view would interpret the proposition some x are y to mean if there were any x in existence some of them would be y and so with e and a  it admits of proof that this view as regards a conflicts with the accepted facts of logic  let us take the syllogism darapti which is universally accepted as valid its form is      all m are x      all m are y           some y are x                                                                    pg169 this they would interpret as follows      if there were any m in existence all of them would be x      if there were any m in existence all of them would be y           if there were any y in existence some of them                would be x  that this conclusion does not follow has been so briefly and clearly explained by mr keynes in his formal logic dated 1894 pp 356 357 that i prefer to quote his words  let no proposition imply the existence either of its subject or of its predicate  take as an example a syllogism in darapti      all m is p      all m is s            some s is p  taking s m p as the minor middle and major terms respectively the conclusion will imply that if there is an s there is some p will the premisses also imply this if so then the syllogism is valid but not otherwise  the conclusion implies that if s exists p exists but consistently with the premisses s may be existent while m and p are both nonexistent an implication is therefore contained in the conclusion which is not justified by the premisses  this seems to me entirely clear and convincing still to make sicker i may as well throw the above soidisant syllogism into a concrete form which will be within the grasp of even a nonlogical reader  let us suppose that a boys school has been set up with the following system of rules  all boys in the first the highest class are to do french greek and latin all in the second class are to do greek only all in the third class are to do latin only  suppose also that there are boys in the third class and in the second but that no boy has yet risen into the first  it is evident that there are no boys in the school doing french still we know by the rules what would happen if there were any                                                                    pg170 we are authorised then by the data to assert the following two propositions      if there were any boys doing french all of them would        be doing greek      if there were any boys doing french all of them would        be doing latin  and the conclusion according to the logicians would be      if there were any boys doing latin some of them would        be doing greek  here then we have two true premisses and a false conclusion since we know that there are boys doing latin and that none of them are doing greek hence the argument is invalid  similarly it may be shown that this nonexistential interpretation destroys the validity of disamis datisi felapton and fresison  some of the logicians will no doubt be ready to reply but we are not aldrichians why should we be responsible for the validity of the syllogisms of so antiquated an author as aldrich  very good then for the special benefit of these friends of mine with what ominous emphasis that name is sometimes used i must have a private interview with you my young friend says the bland dr birch in my library at 9 am tomorrow and you will please to be punctual for their special benefit i say i will produce another charge against this nonexistential interpretation  it actually invalidates the ordinary process of conversion as applied to proposition in i  every logician aldrichian or otherwise accepts it as an established fact that some x are y may be legitimately converted into some y are x  but is it equally clear that the proposition if there were any x some of them would be y may be legitimately converted into if there were any y some of them would be x i trow not  the example i have already usedof a boys school with a nonexistent first classwill serve admirably to illustrate this new flaw in the theory of the logicians                                                                    pg171 let us suppose that there is yet another rule in this school viz in each class at the end of the term the head boy and the second boy shall receive prizes  this rule entirely authorises us to assert in the sense in which the logicians would use the words some boys in the first class will receive prizes for this simply means according to them if there were any boys in the first class some of them would receive prizes  now the converse of this proposition is of course some boys who will receive prizes are in the first class which means according to the logicians if there were any boys about to receive prizes some of them would be in the first class which class we know to be empty  of this pair of converse propositions the first is undoubtedly true the second as undoubtedly false  it is always sad to see a batsman knock down his own wicket one pities him as a man and a brother but as a cricketer one can but pronounce him out  we see then that among all the conceivable views we have here considered there are only two which can logically be held viz      i and a assert but e does not     e and a assert but i does not  the second of these i have shown to involve great practical inconvenience  the first is the one adopted in this book see p 19  some further remarks on this subject will be found in note b at p 196   § 3  the use of isnot or arenot as a copula   is it better to say john isnot inthehouse or john is notinthehouse some of my acquaintances arenot menishouldliketobeseenwith or some of my acquaintances are menishouldnotliketobeseenwith that is the sort of question we have now to discuss                                                                    pg172 this is no question of logical right and wrong it is merely a matter of taste since the two forms mean exactly the same thing and here again the logicians seem to me to take much too humble a position when they are putting the final touches to the grouping of their proposition just before the curtain goes up and when the copulaalways a rather fussy heavy father asks them am i to have the not or will you tack it on to the predicate they are much too ready to answer like the subtle cabdriver leave it to you sir the result seems to be that the grasping copula constantly gets a not that had better have been merged in the predicate and that propositions are differentiated which had better have been recognised as precisely similar surely it is simpler to treat some men are jews and some men are gentiles as being both of them affirmative propositions instead of translating the latter into some men arenot jews and regarding it as a negative propositions  the fact is the logicians have somehow acquired a perfectly morbid dread of negative attributes which makes them shut their eyes like frightened children when they come across such terrible propositions as all notx are y and thus they exclude from their system many very useful forms of syllogisms  under the influence of this unreasoning terror they plead that in dichotomy by contradiction the negative part is too large to deal with so that it is better to regard each thing as either included in or excluded from the positive part i see no force in this plea and the facts often go the other way as a personal question dear reader if you were to group your acquaintances into the two classes men that you would like to be seen with and men that you would not like to be seen with do you think the latter group would be so very much the larger of the two  for the purposes of symbolic logic it is so much the most convenient plan to regard the two subdivisions produced by dichotomy on the same footing and to say of any thing either that it is in the one or that it is in the other that i do not think any reader of this book is likely to demur to my adopting that course                                                                     pg173 § 4  the theory that two negative premisses prove nothing   this i consider to be another craze of the logicians fully as morbid as their dread of a negative attribute  it is perhaps best refuted by the method of instantia contraria  take the following pairs of premisses      none of my boys are conceited      none of my girls are greedy      none of my boys are clever      none but a clever boy could solve this problem      none of my boys are learned      some of my boys are not choristers  this last proposition is in my system an affirmative one since i should read it are notchoristers but in dealing with the logicians i may fairly treat it as a negative one since they would read it arenot choristers  if you dear reader declare after full consideration of these pairs of premisses that you cannot deduce a conclusion from any of themwhy all i can say is that like the duke in patience you will have to be contented with our heartfelt sympathy see note c p 196   § 5  eulers method of diagrams   diagrams seem to have been used at first to represent propositions only in eulers wellknown circles each was supposed to contain a class and the diagram consisted of two circles which exhibited the relations as to inclusion and exclusion existing between the two classes                   \         y \  \        \         \   x           \  thus the diagram here given exhibits the two classes whose respective attributes are x and y as so related to each other that the following propositions are all simultaneously trueall x are y no x are noty some x are y some y are notx some noty are notx and of course the converses of the last four                                                                    pg174                  \         y \  \        \         \   x           \  similarly with this diagram the following propositions are trueall y are x no y are notx some y are x some x are noty some notx are noty and of course the converses of the last four                                 \            \               \              \          x             y           \            \               \         \  similarly with this diagram the following are trueall x are noty all y are notx no x are y some x are noty some y are notx some notx are noty and the converses of the last four                         \     \              \       \          x     y           \      \              \ \  similarly with this diagram the following are truesome x are y some x are noty some notx are y some notx are noty and of course their four converses  note that all eulers diagrams assert some notx are noty apparently it never occured to him that it might sometimes fail to be true  now to represent all x are y the first of these diagrams would suffice similarly to represent no x are y the third would suffice but to represent any particular proposition at least three diagrams would be needed in order to include all the possible cases and for some notx are noty all the four   § 6  venns method of diagrams   let us represent notx by x  mr venns method of diagrams is a great advance on the above method  he uses the last of the above diagrams to represent any desired relation between x and y by simply shading a compartment known to be empty and placing a  in one known to be occupied  thus he would represent the three propositions some x are y no x are y and all x are y as follows                         \     \              \       \                           \      \              \ \                         \     \             \       \                         \      \              \ \                    \     \       \       \                    \\              \ \                                                                    pg175 it will be seen that of the four classes whose peculiar sets of attributes are xy xy xy and xy only three are here provided with closed compartments while the fourth is allowed the rest of the infinite plane to range about in  this arrangement would involve us in very serious trouble if we ever attempted to represent no x are y mr venn once at p 281 encounters this awful task but evades it in a quite masterly fashion by the simple footnote we have not troubled to shade the outside of this diagram  to represent two propositions containing a common term together a threeletter diagram is needed this is the one used by mr venn                                \           x \            \    \          \   \     \            \             \  m   \   y           \ \  here again we have only seven closed compartments to accommodate the eight classes whose peculiar sets of attributes are xym xym c  with four terms in request mr venn says the most simple and symmetrical diagram seems to me that produced by making four ellipses intersect one another in the desired manner this however provides only fifteen closed compartments           b        c                \      \     a     \   \  d          \   \  \        \

letters the simplest diagram i can suggest mr venn says is one like this the small ellipse in the centre is to be regarded as a portion of the outside of c ie its four component portions are inside b

pg176 this diagram gives us 31 closed compartments  for six letters mr venn suggests that we might use two diagrams like the above one for the fpart and the other for the notfpart of all the other combinations this he says would give the desired 64 subdivisions this however would only give 62 closed compartments and one infinite area which the two classes abcdef and abcdef would have to share between them  beyond six letters mr venn does not go   § 7  my method of diagrams   my method of diagrams resembles mr venns in having separate compartments assigned to the various classes and in marking these compartments as occupied or as empty but it differs from his method in assigning a closed area to the universe of discourse so that the class which under mr venns liberal sway has been ranging at will through infinite space is suddenly dismayed to find itself cabind cribbd confined in a limited cell like any other class also i use rectilinear instead of curvilinear figures and i mark an occupied cell with a i meaning that there is at least one thing in it and an empty cell with a o meaning that there is no thing in it  for two letters i use this diagram in which the north half is assigned to x the south to notx or x the west to y and the east to y thus the nw cell contains the xyclass the ne cell the xyclass and so on      ··                                ··  for three letters i subdivide these four cells by drawing an inner square which i assign to m the outer border being assigned to m i thus get eight cells that are needed to accommodate the eight classes whose peculiar sets of attributes are xym xym c      ··                           ··                                                  ··                           ··  this last diagram is the most complex that i use in the elementary part of my symbolic logic but i may as well take this opportunity of describing the more complex ones which will appear in part ii                                                                    pg177 for four letters which i call a b c d i use this diagram assigning the north half to a and of course the rest of the diagram to a the west half to b the horizontal oblong to c and the upright oblong to d we have now got 16 cells      ··                                    ··                                    ··

all the upper portions to e and all the lower portions to e here i admit we lose the advantage of having the eclass all together in a ringfence like the other 4 classes still it is very easy to find and the operation of erasing it is nearly as easy as that of erasing any other class we have now got 32 cells      ··                                 ··                               ··

solution of a syllogism by various methods   the best way i think to exhibit the differences between these various methods of solving syllogisms will be to take a concrete example and solve it by each method in turn let us take as our example no 29 see p 102      no philosophers are conceited      some conceited persons are not gamblers         some persons who are not gamblers are not philosophers

permutation or obversion we write the minor premiss thus      some conceited persons are notgamblers  we can get a conclusion in fresison viz      no philosophers are conceited      some conceited persons are notgamblers         some notgamblers are not philosophers  this can be proved by reduction to ferio thus      no conceited persons are philosophers      some notgamblers are conceited         some notgamblers are not philosophers  the validity of ferio follows directly from the axiom de omni et nullo   2 symbolic representation  before proceeding to discuss other methods of solution it is necessary to translate our syllogism into an abstract form  let us take persons as our universe of discourse and let x  philosophers m  conceited and y  gamblers  then the syllogism may be written thus      no x are m      some m are y         some y are x   3 solution by eulers method of diagrams  the major premiss requires only one diagram viz                   1

things that are to be met with in the ordinary textbooks of formal logic perhaps the strangest is the violent contrast one finds to exist between their ways of dealing with these two subjects while they have elaborately discussed no less than nineteen different forms of syllogismseach with its own special and exasperating rules while the whole constitute an almost useless machine for practical purposes many of the conclusions being incomplete and many quite legitimate forms being ignoredthey have limited sorites to two forms only of childish simplicity and these they have dignified with special names apparently under the impression that no other possible forms existed  as to syllogisms i find that their nineteen forms with about a score of others which they have ignored can all be arranged under three forms each with a very simple rule of its own and the only question the reader has to settle in working any one of the 101 examples given at p 101 of this book is does it belong to fig i ii or iii                                                                    pg184 as to sorites the only two forms recognised by the textbooks are the aristotelian whose premisses are a series of propositions in a so arranged that the predicate of each is the subject of the next and the goclenian whose premisses are the very same series written backwards goclenius it seems was the first who noticed the startling fact that it does not affect the force of a syllogism to invert the order of its premisses and who applied this discovery to a sorites if we assume as surely we may that he is the same man as that transcendent genius who first noticed that 4 times 5 is the same thing as 5 times 4 we may apply to him what somebody edmund yates i think it was has said of tupper viz here is a man who beyond all others of his generation has been favoured with glimpses of the obvious  these puerilenot to say infantineforms of a sorites i have in this book ignored from the very first and have not only admitted freely propositions in e but have purposely stated the premisses in random order leaving to the reader the useful task of arranging them for himself in an order which can be worked as a series of regular syllogisms in doing this he can begin with any one of them he likes  i have tabulated for curiosity the various orders in which the premisses of the aristotelian sorites      1 all a are b     2 all b are c     3 all c are d     4 all d are e     5 all e are h         all a are h  may be syllogistically arranged and i find there are no less than sixteen such orders viz 12345 21345 23145 23415 23451 32145 32415 32451 34215 34251 34521 43215 43251 43521 45321 54321 of these the first and the last have been dignified with names but the other fourteenfirst enumerated by an obscure writer on logic towards the end of the nineteenth centuryremain without a name                                                                     pg185 § 10  some account of parts ii iii   in part ii will be found some of the matters mentioned in this appendix viz the existential import of propositions the use of a negative copula and the theory that two negative premisses prove nothing i shall also extend the range of syllogisms by introducing propositions containing alternatives such as notall x are y propositions containing 3 or more terms such as all ab are c which taken along with some bc are d would prove some d are a c i shall also discuss sorites containing entities and the very puzzling subjects of hypotheticals and dilemmas i hope in the course of part ii to go over all the ground usually traversed in the textbooks used in our schools and universities and to enable my readers to solve problems of the same kind as and far harder than those that are at present set in their examinations  in part iii i hope to deal with many curious and outoftheway subjects some of which are not even alluded to in any of the treatises i have met with in this part will be found such matters as the analysis of propositions into their elements let the reader who has never gone into this branch of the subject try to make out for himself what additional proposition would be needed to convert some a are b into some a are bc the treatment of numerical and geometrical problems the construction of problems and the solution of syllogisms and sorites containing propositions more complex than any that i have used in part ii  i will conclude with eight problems as a taste of what is coming in part ii i shall be very glad to receive from any reader who thinks he has solved any one of them more especially if he has done so without using any method of symbols what he conceives to be its complete conclusion  it may be well to explain what i mean by the complete conclusion of a syllogism or a sorites i distinguish their terms as being of two kindsthose which can be eliminated eg the middle term of a syllogism which i call the eliminands and those which cannot which i call the retinends and i do not call the conclusion complete unless it states all the relations among the retinends only which can be deduced from the premisses

day at a certain table dhôte remembering how much amusement they had derived from their code of rules for walkingparties they devised the following rules to be observed whenever beef appeared on the table  1 if barry takes salt then either cole or lang takes one only of the two condiments salt and mustard if he takes mustard then either dix takes neither condiment or mill takes both  2 if cole takes salt then either barry takes only one condiment or mill takes neither if he takes mustard then either dix or lang takes both  3 if dix takes salt then either barry takes neither condiment or cole take both if he takes mustard then either lang or mill takes neither  4 if lang takes salt then barry or dix takes only one condiment if he takes mustard then either cole or mill takes neither  5 if mill takes salt then either barry or lang takes both condiments if he takes mustard then either cole or dix takes only one  the problem is to discover whether these rules are compatible and if so what arrangements are possible      nb in this problem it is assumed that the phrase if barry     takes salt allows of two possible cases viz 1 he takes     salt only 2 he takes both condiments and so with all     similar phrases      it is also assumed that the phrase either cole or lang takes     one only of the two condiments allows three possible cases     viz 1 cole takes one only lang takes both or neither     2 cole takes both or neither lang takes one only 3     cole takes one only lang takes one only and so with all     similar phrases      it is also assumed that every rule is to be understood as     implying the words and vice versâ thus the first rule would     imply the addition and if either cole or lang takes only one     condiment then barry takes salt

 notes to appendix   a see p 167 line 6  it may perhaps occur to the reader who has studied formal logic that the argument here applied to the propositions i and e will apply equally well to the propositions i and a since in the ordinary textbooks the propositions all xy are z and some xy are not z are regarded as contradictories hence it may appear to him that the argument might have been put as follows  we now have i and a asserting hence if the proposition all xy are z be true some things exist with the attributes x and y ie some x are y  also we know that if the proposition some xy are notz be true the same result follows  but these two propositions are contradictories so that one or other of them must be true hence this result is always true ie the proposition some x are y is always true  quod est absurdum hence i cannot assert  this matter will be discussed in part ii but i may as well give here what seems to me to be an irresistable proof that this view that a and i are contradictories though adopted in the ordinary textbooks is untenable the proof is as follows  with regard to the relationship existing between the class xy and the two classes z and notz there are four conceivable states of things viz      1 some xy are z and some are notz     2                  none          3 no xy             some          4                  none       of these four no 2 is equivalent to all xy are z no 3 is equivalent to all xy are notz and no 4 is equivalent to no xy exist  now it is quite undeniable that of these four states of things each is a priori possible some one must be true and the other three must be false  hence the contradictory to 2 is either 1 or 3 or 4 is true now the assertion either 1 or 3 is true is equivalent to some xy are notz and the assertion 4 is true is equivalent to no xy exist hence the contradictory to all xy are z may be expressed as the alternative proposition either some xy are notz or no xy exist but not as the categorical proposition some y are notz                                                                     pg196 b see p 171 at end of section 2  there are yet other views current among the logicians as to the existential import of propositions which have not been mentioned in this section  one is that the proposition some x are y is to be interpreted neither as some x exist and are y nor yet as if there were any x in existence some of them would be y but merely as some x can be y ie the attributes x and y are compatible on this theory there would be nothing offensive in my telling my friend jones some of your brothers are swindlers since if he indignantly retorted what do you mean by such insulting language you scoundrel i should calmly reply i merely mean that the thing is conceivablethat some of your brothers might possibly be swindlers but it may well be doubted whether such an explanation would entirely appease the wrath of jones  another view is that the proposition all x are y sometimes implies the actual existence of x and sometimes does not imply it and that we cannot tell without having it in concrete form which interpretation we are to give to it this view is i think strongly supported by common usage and it will be fully discussed in part ii but the difficulties which it introduces seem to me too formidable to be even alluded to in part i which i am trying to make as far as possible easily intelligible to mere beginners   c see p 173 § 4  the three conclusions are      no conceited child of mine is greedy     none of my boys could solve this
