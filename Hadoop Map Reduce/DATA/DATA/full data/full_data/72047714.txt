72047714	the dark flower  by john galsworthy          take the flower from my breast i pray thee       take the flower too from out my tresses       and then go hence for see the night is fair       the stars rejoice to watch thee on thy way        from the bard of the dimbovitza      the dark flower    part ispring   i   he walked along holywell that afternoon of early june with his short gown drooping down his arms and no cap on his thick dark hair a youth of middle height and built as if he had come of two very different strains one sturdy the other wiry and light his face too was a curious blend for though it was strongly formed its expression was rather soft and moody his eyesdark grey with a good deal of light in them and very black lasheshad a way of looking beyond what they saw so that he did not seem always to be quite present but his smile was exceedingly swift uncovering teeth as white as a negros and giving his face a peculiar eagerness people stared at him a little as he passedsince in eighteen hundred and eighty he was before his time in not wearing a cap women especially were interested they perceived that he took no notice of them seeming rather to be looking into distance and making combinations in his soul  did he know of what he was thinkingdid he ever know quite definitely at that time of his life when things especially those beyond the immediate horizon were so curious and interestingthe things he was going to see and do when he had got through oxford where everybody was awfully decent to him and all right of course but not so very interesting  he was on his way to his tutors to read an essay on oliver cromwell and under the old wall which had once hedged in the town he took out of his pocket a beast it was a small tortoise and with an extreme absorption he watched it move its little inquiring head feeling it all the time with his short broad fingers as though to discover exactly how it was made it was mighty hard in the back no wonder poor old aeschylus felt a bit sick when it fell on his head the ancients used it to stand the world ona pagoda world perhaps of men and beasts and trees like that carving on his guardians chinese cabinet the chinese made jolly beasts and trees as if they believed in everything having a soul and not only being just fit for people to eat or drive or make houses of if only the art school would let him model things on his own instead of copying and copyingit was just as if they imagined it would be dangerous to let you think out anything for yourself  he held the tortoise to his waistcoat and let it crawl till noticing that it was gnawing the corner of his essay he put it back into his pocket what would his tutor do if he were to know it was therecock his head a little to one side and say ah there are things lennan not dreamed of in my philosophy yes there were a good many not dreamed of by old stormer who seemed so awfully afraid of anything that wasnt usual who seemed always laughing at you for fear that you should laugh at him there were lots of people in oxford like that it was stupid you couldnt do anything decent if you were afraid of being laughed at mrs stormer wasnt like that she did things becausethey came into her head but then of course she was austrian not english and ever so much younger than old stormer  and having reached the door of his tutors house he rang the bell   ii   when anna stormer came into the study she found her husband standing at the window with his head a little on one sidea tall longlegged figure in clothes of a pleasant tweed and wearing a low turnover collar not common in those days and a blue silk tie which she had knitted strung through a ring he was humming and gently tapping the windowpane with his wellkept fingernails though celebrated for the amount of work he got through she never caught him doing any in this house of theirs chosen because it was more than half a mile away from the college which held the dear young clowns as he called them of whom he was tutor  he did not turnit was not of course his habit to notice what was not absolutely necessarybut she felt that he was aware of her she came to the window seat and sat down he looked round at that and said ah  it was a murmur almost of admiration not usual from him since with the exception of certain portions of the classics it was hardly his custom to admire but she knew that she was looking her best sitting there her really beautiful figure poised the sun shining on her brown hair and brightening her deepset icegreen eyes under their black lashes it was sometimes a great comfort to her that she remained so goodlooking it would have been an added vexation indeed to have felt that she ruffled her husbands fastidiousness even so her cheekbones were too high for his taste symbols of that something in her character which did not go with histhe dash of desperation of vividness that lack of a certain english smoothness which always annoyed him  haroldshe would never quite flatten her rsi want to go to the mountains this year  the mountains she had not seen them since that season at san martino di castrozza twelve years ago which had ended in her marrying him  nostalgia  i dont know what that meansi am homesick can we go  if you likewhy not but no leading up the cimone della pala for me  she knew what he meant by that no romance how splendidly he had led that day she had almost worshipped him what blindness what distortion was it really the same man standing there with those bright doubting eyes with grey already in his hair yes romance was over and she sat silent looking out into the streetthat little old street into which she looked day and night a figure passed out there came to the door and rang  she said softly here is mark lennan  she felt her husbands eyes rest on her just for a moment knew that he had turned heard him murmur ah the angel clown and quite still she waited for the door to open there was the boy with his blessed dark head and his shy gentle gravity and his essay in his hand  well lennan and hows old noll hypocrite of genius eh draw up lets get him over  motionless from her seat at the window she watched those two figures at the tablethe boy reading in his queer velvety bass voice her husband leaning back with the tips of his fingers pressed together his head a little on one side and that faint satiric smile which never reached his eyes yes he was dozing falling asleep and the boy not seeing was going on then he came to the end and glanced up what eyes he had other boys would have laughed but he looked almost sorry she heard him murmur im awfully sorry sir  ah lennan you caught me fact is terms fagged me out were going to the mountains ever been to the mountains whatnever you should come with us eh what do you say anna dont you think this young man ought to come with us  she got up and stood staring at them both had she heard aright  then she answeredvery gravely  yes i think he ought  good well get him to lead up the cimone della pala   iii   when the boy had said goodbye and she had watched him out into the street anna stood for a moment in the streak of sunlight that came in through the open door her hands pressed to cheeks which were flaming then she shut the door and leaned her forehead against the windowpane seeing nothing her heart beat very fast she was going over and over again the scene just passed through this meant so much more than it had seemed to mean  though she always had heimweh and especially at the end of the summer term this year it had been a different feeling altogether that made her say to her husband i want to go to the mountains  for twelve years she had longed for the mountains every summer but had not pleaded for them this year she had pleaded but she did not long for them it was because she had suddenly realized the strange fact that she did not want to leave england and the reason for it that she had come and begged to go yet why when it was just to get away from thought of this boy had she said yes i think he ought to come ah but life for her was always a strange pull between the conscientious and the desperate a queer vivid aching business how long was it now since that day when he first came to lunch silent and shy and suddenly smiling as if he were all lighted up withinthe day when she had said to her husband afterwards ah hes an angel not yet a yearthe beginning of last october term in fact he was different from all the other boys not that he was a prodigy with untidy hair illfitting clothes and a clever tongue but because of somethingsomethingah welldifferent because he washe because she longed to take his head between her hands and kiss it she remembered so well the day that longing first came to her she was giving him tea it was quite early in the easter term he was stroking her cat who always went to him and telling her that he meant to be a sculptor but that his guardian objected so that of course he could not start till he was of age the lamp on the table had a rosecoloured shade he had been rowinga very cold dayand his face was glowing generally it was rather pale and suddenly he smiled and said its rotten waiting for things isnt it it was then she had almost stretched out her hands to draw his forehead to her lips she had thought then that she wanted to kiss him because it would have been so nice to be his mothershe might just have been his mother if she had married at sixteen but she had long known now that she wanted to kiss not his forehead but his lips he was there in her lifea fire in a cold and unaired house it had even become hard to understand that she could have gone on all these years without him she had missed him so those six weeks of the easter vacation she had revelled so in his three queer little letters halfshy halfconfidential kissed them and worn them in her dress and in return had written him long perfectly correct epistles in her still rather quaint english she had never let him guess her feelings the idea that he might shocked her inexpressibly when the summer term began life seemed to be all made up of thoughts of him if ten years ago her baby had lived if its cruel deathafter her agonyhad not killed for good her wish to have another if for years now she had not been living with the knowledge that she had no warmth to expect and that love was all over for her if life in the most beautiful of all old cities had been able to grip herthere would have been forces to check this feeling but there was nothing in the world to divert the current and she was so brimful of life so conscious of vitality running to sheer waste sometimes it had been terrific that feeling within her of wanting to liveto find outlet for her energy so many hundreds of lonely walks she had taken during all these years trying to lose herself in naturehurrying alone running in the woods over the fields where people did not come trying to get rid of that sense of waste trying once more to feel as she had felt when a girl with the whole world before her it was not for nothing that her figure was superb her hair so bright a brown her eyes so full of light she had tried many distractions work in the back streets music acting hunting given them up one after the other taken to them passionately again they had served in the past but this year they had not served one sunday coming from confession unconfessed she had faced herself it was wicked she would have to kill this feelingmust fly from this boy who moved her so if she did not act quickly she would be swept away and then the thought had come why not life was to be livednot torpidly dozed through in this queer cultured place where age was in the blood life was for loveto be enjoyed and she would be thirtysix next month it seemed to her already an enormous age thirtysix soon she would be old actually oldand never have known passion the worship which had made a hero of the distinguishedlooking englishman twelve years older than herself who could lead up the cimone della pala had not been passion it might perhaps have become passion if he had so willed but he was all form ice books had he a heart at all had he blood in his veins was there any joy of life in this too beautiful city and these people who lived in itthis place where even enthusiasms seemed to be formal and have no wings where everything was settled and sophisticated as the very chapels and cloisters and yet to have this feeling for a boyfor one almost young enough to be her son it was soshameless that thought haunted her made her flush in the dark lying awake at night and desperately she would prayfor she was devoutpray to be made pure to be given the holy feelings of a mother to be filled simply with the sweet sense that she could do everything suffer anything for him for his good after these long prayers she would feel calmed drowsy as though she had taken a drug for hours perhaps she would stay like that and then it would all come over her again she never thought of his loving her that would beunnatural why should he love her she was very humble about it ever since that sunday when she avoided the confessional she had brooded over how to make an endhow to get away from a longing that was too strong for her and she had hit on this planto beg for the mountains to go back to where her husband had come into her life and try if this feeling would not die if it did not she would ask to be left out there with her own people away from this danger and now the foolthe blind foolthe superior foolwith his satiric smile his everlasting patronage had driven her to overturn her own plan well let him take the consequences she had done her best she would have this one fling of joy even if it meant that she must stay out there and never see the boy again  standing in her dusky hall where a faint scent of woodrot crept out into the air whenever windows and doors were closed she was all tremulous with secret happiness to be with him among her mountains to show him all those wonderful glittering or tawny crags to go with him to the top of them and see the kingdoms of the world spread out below to wander with him in the pine woods on the alps in all the scent of the trees and the flowers where the sun was hot the first of july and it was only the tenth of june would she ever live so long they would not go to san martino this time rather to cortinasome new place that had no memories  she moved from the window and busied herself with a bowl of flowers she had heard that humming sound which often heralded her husbands approach as though warning the world to recover its good form before he reached it in her happiness she felt kind and friendly to him if he had not meant to give her joy he had nevertheless given it he came downstairs two at a time with that air of not being a pedagogue which she knew so well and taking his hat off the stand half turned round to her  pleasant youth young lennan hope he wont bore us out there  his voice seemed to have an accent of compunction to ask pardon for having issued that impulsive invitation and there came to her an overwhelming wish to laugh to hide it to find excuse for it she ran up to him and pulling his coat lapels till his face was within reach she kissed the tip of his nose and then she laughed and he stood looking at her with his head just a little on one side and his eyebrows just a little raised   iv   when young mark heard a soft tapping at his door though out of bed he was getting on but dreamilyit was so jolly to watch the mountains lying out in this early light like huge beasts that one they were going up with his head just raised above his paws looked very far away out there opening the door an inch he whispered  is it late  five oclock arent you ready  it was awfully rude of him to keep her waiting and he was soon down in the empty diningroom where a sleepy maid was already bringing in their coffee anna was there alone she had on a flaxblue shirt open at the neck a short green skirt and a greygreen velvety hat small with one blackcocks feather why could not people always wear such nice things and be as splendidlooking and he said  you do look jolly mrs stormer  she did not answer for so long that he wondered if it had been rude to say that but she did look so strong and swift and happylooking  down the hill through a wood of larchtrees to the river and across the bridge to mount at once by a path through hayfields how could old stormer stay in bed on such a morning the peasant girls in their blue linen skirts were already gathering into bundles what the men had scythed one raking at the edge of a field paused and shyly nodded to them she had the face of a madonna very calm and grave and sweet with delicate arched browsa face it was pure pleasure to see the boy looked back at her everything to him who had never been out of england before seemed strange and glamorous the chalets with their long wide burntbrown wooden balconies and lowhanging eaves jutting far beyond the walls these bright dresses of the peasant women the friendly little creamcoloured cows with blunt smokegrey muzzles even the feel in the air was new that delicious crisp burning warmth that lay so lightly as it were on the surface of frozen stillness and the special sweetness of all places at the foot of mountainsscent of pinegum burning larchwood and all the meadow flowers and grasses but newest of all was the feeling within hima sort of pride a sense of importance a queer exhilaration at being alone with her chosen companion of one so beautiful  they passed all the other pilgrims bound the same waystout square germans with their coats slung through straps who trailed behind them heavy alpenstocks carried greenish bags and marched stolidly at a pace that never varied growling as anna and the boy went by aber eilen ist nichts  but those two could not go fast enough to keep pace with their spirits this was no real climbjust a training walk to the top of the nuvolau and they were up before noon and soon again descending very hungry when they entered the little diningroom of the cinque torre hutte they found it occupied by a party of english people eating omelettes who looked at anna with faint signs of recognition but did not cease talking in voices that all had a certain halflanguid precision a slight but brisk pinching of sounds as if determined not to tolerate a drawl and yet to have one most of them had fieldglasses slung round them and cameras were dotted here and there about the room their faces were not really much alike but they all had a peculiar drooping smile and a particular lift of the eyebrows that made them seem reproductions of a single type their teeth too for the most part were a little prominent as though the drooping of their mouths had forced them forward they were eating as people eat who distrust the lower senses preferring not to be compelled to taste or smell  from our hotel whispered anna and ordering red wine and schnitzels she and the boy sat down the lady who seemed in command of the english party inquired now how mr stormer washe was not laid up she hoped no only lazy indeed he was a great climber she believed it seemed to the boy that this lady somehow did not quite approve of them the talk was all maintained between her a gentleman with a crumpled collar and puggaree and a short thickset greybearded man in a dark norfolk jacket if any of the younger members of the party spoke the remark was received with an arch lifting of the brows and drooping of the lids as who should say ah very promising  nothing in my life has given me greater pain than to observe the aptitude of human nature for becoming crystallized it was the lady in command who spoke and all the young people swayed their faces up and down as if assenting how like they were the boy thought to guineafowl with their small heads and sloping shoulders and speckly grey coats  ah my dear ladyit was the gentleman with the crumpled collaryou novelists are always girding at the precious quality of conformity the sadness of our times lies in this questioning spirit never was there more revolt especially among the young to find the individual judging for himself is a grave symptom of national degeneration but this is not a subject  surely the subject is of the most poignant interest to all young people again all the young ones raised their faces and moved them slightly from side to side  my dear lady we are too prone to let the interest that things arouse blind our judgment in regard to the advisability of discussing them we let these speculations creep and creep until they twine themselves round our faith and paralyze it  one of the young men interjected suddenly madreand was silent  i shall not i thinkit was the lady speakingbe accused of licence when i say that i have always felt that speculation is only dangerous when indulged in by the crude intelligence if culture has nothing to give us then let us have no culture but if culture be as i think it indispensable then we must accept the dangers that culture brings  again the young people moved their faces and again the younger of the two young men said madre  dangers have cultured people dangers  who had spoken thus every eyebrow was going up every mouth was drooping and there was silence the boy stared at his companion in what a strange voice she had made that little interjection there seemed a sort of flame too lighted in her eyes then the little greybearded man said and his rather whispering voice sounded hard and acid  we are all human my dear madam  the boy felt his heart go thump at annas laugh it was just as if she had said ah but not yousurely and he got up to follow her towards the door  the english party had begun already talkingof the weather  the two walked some way from the hut in silence before anna said  you didnt like me when i laughed  you hurt their feelings i think  i wanted tothe english grundys ah dont be cross with me they were english grundys werent theyevery one  she looked into his face so hard that he felt the blood rush to his cheeks and a dizzy sensation of being drawn forward  they have no blood those people their voices their supercilious eyes that look you up and down oh ive had so much of them that woman with her liberalism just as bad as any i hate them all  he would have liked to hate them too since she did but they had only seemed to him amusing  they arent human they dont feel some day youll know them they wont amuse you then  she went on in a quiet almost dreamy voice  why do they come here its still young and warm and good out here why dont they keep to their culture where no one knows what it is to ache and feel hunger and hearts dont beat feel  disturbed beyond measure the boy could not tell whether it was in her heart or in his hand that the blood was pulsing so was he glad or sorry when she let his hand go  ah well they cant spoil this day lets rest  at the edge of the larchwood where they sat were growing numbers of little mountain pinks with fringed edges and the sweetest scent imaginable and she got up presently to gather them but he stayed where he was and odd sensations stirred in him the blue of the sky the feathery green of the larchtrees the mountains were no longer to him what they had been early that morning  she came back with her hands full of the little pinks spread her fingers and let them drop they showered all over his face and neck never was so wonderful a scent never such a strange feeling as they gave him they clung to his hair his forehead his eyes one even got caught on the curve of his lips and he stared up at her through their fringed petals there must have been something wild in his eyes then something of the feeling that was stinging his heart for her smile died she walked away and stood with her face turned from him confused and unhappy he gathered the strewn flowers and not till he had collected every one did he get up and shyly take them to her where she still stood gazing into the depths of the larchwood   v   what did he know of women that should make him understand at his public school he had seen none to speak to at oxford only this one at home in the holidays not any save his sister cicely the two hobbies of their guardian fishing and the antiquities of his native county rendered him averse to society so that his little devonshire manorhouse with its black oak panels and its wild stonewalled park along the riverside was from years end to years end innocent of all petticoats save those of cicely and old miss tring the governess then too the boy was shy no there was nothing in his past of not yet quite nineteen years to go by he was not of those youths who are always thinking of conquests the very idea of conquest seemed to him vulgar mean horrid there must be many signs indeed before it would come into his head that a woman was in love with him especially the one to whom he looked up and thought so beautiful for before all beauty he was humble inclined to think himself a clod it was the part of life which was always unconsciously sacred and to be approached trembling the more he admired the more tremulous and diffident he became and so after his one wild moment when she plucked those sweetscented blossoms and dropped them over him he felt abashed and walking home beside her he was quieter than ever awkward to the depths of his soul  if there were confusion in his heart which had been innocent of trouble what must there have been in hers that for so long had secretly desired the dawning of that confusion and she too was very silent  passing a church with open door in the outskirts of the village she said  dont wait for mei want to go in here a little  in the empty twilight within one figure a countrywoman in her black shawl was kneelingmarvellously still he would have liked to stay that kneeling figure the smile of the sunlight filtering through into the half darkness he lingered long enough to see anna too go down on her knees in the stillness was she praying again he had the turbulent feeling with which he had watched her pluck those flowers she looked so splendid kneeling there it was caddish to feel like that when she was praying and he turned quickly away into the road but that sharp sweet stinging sensation did not leave him he shut his eyes to get rid of her imageand instantly she became ten times more visible his feeling ten times stronger he mounted to the hotel there on the terrace was his tutor and oddly enough the sight of him at that moment was no more embarrassing than if it had been the hotel concierge stormer did not somehow seem to count did not seem to want you to count him besides he was so oldnearly fifty  the man who was so old was posed in a characteristic attitudehands in the pockets of his norfolk jacket one shoulder slightly raised head just a little on one side as if preparing to quiz something he spoke as lennan came up smilingbut not with his eyes  well young man and what have you done with my wife  left her in a church sir  ah she will do that has she run you off your legs no then lets walk and talk a little  to be thus pacing up and down and talking with her husband seemed quite natural did not even interfere with those new sensations did not in the least increase his shame for having them he only wondered a little how she could have married himbut so little quite far and academic was his wonderlike his wonder in old days how his sister could care to play with dolls if he had any other feeling it was just a longing to get away and go down the hill again to the church it seemed cold and lonely after all that long day with heras if he had left himself up there walking along hour after hour or lying out in the sun beside her what was old stormer talking about the difference between the greek and roman views of honour always in the pastseemed to think the present was bad form and he said  we met some english grundys sir on the mountain  ah yes any particular brand  some advanced and some not but all the same i think really  i see grundys i think you said  yes sir from this hotel it was mrs stormers name for them they were so very superior  quite  there was something unusual in the tone of that little word and the boy staredfor the first time there seemed a real man standing there then the blood rushed up into his cheeks for there she was would she come up to them how splendid she was looking burnt by the sun and walking as if just starting but she passed into the hotel without turning her head their way had he offended hurt her he made an excuse and got away to his room  in the window from which that same morning he had watched the mountains lying out like lions in the dim light he stood again and gazed at the sun dropping over the high horizon what had happened to him he felt so different so utterly different it was another world and the most strange feeling came on him as of the flowers falling again all over his face and neck and hands the tickling of their softfringed edges the stinging sweetness of their scent and he seemed to hear her voice saying feel and to feel her heart once more beating under his hand   vi   alone with that blackshawled figure in the silent church anna did not pray resting there on her knees she experienced only the sore sensation of revolt why had fate flung this feeling into her heart lighted up her life suddenly if god refused her its enjoyment some of the mountain pinks remained clinging to her belt and the scent of them crushed against her warred with the faint odour of age and incense while they were there with their enticement and their memories prayer would never come but did she want to pray did she desire the mood of that poor soul in her black shawl who had not moved by one hairs breadth since she had been watching her who seemed resting her humble self so utterly letting life lift from her feeling the relief of nothingness ah yes what would it be to have a life so toilsome so little exciting from day to day and hour to hour that just to kneel there in wistful stupor was the greatest pleasure one could know it was beautiful to see her but it was sad and there came over anna a longing to go up to her neighbour and say tell me your troubles we are both women she had lost a son perhaps some loveor perhaps not really love only some illusion ah love why should any spirit yearn why should any body full of strength and joy wither slowly away for want of love was there not enough in this great world for her anna to have a little she would not harm him for she would know when he had had enough of her she would surely have the pride and grace then to let him go for of course he would get tired of her at her age she could never hope to hold a boy more than a few yearsmonths perhaps but would she ever hold him at all youth was so hardit had no heart and then the memory of his eyes came backgazing up troubled almost wildwhen she had dropped on him those flowers that memory filled her with a sort of delirium one look from her then one touch and he would have clasped her to him she was sure of it yet scarcely dared to believe what meant so much and suddenly the torment that she must go through whatever happened seemed to her too brutal and undeserved she rose just one gleam of sunlight was still slanting through the doorway it failed by a yard or so to reach the kneeling countrywoman and anna watched would it steal on and touch her or would the sun pass down behind the mountains and it fade away unconscious of that issue the blackshawled figure knelt never moving and the beam crept on if it touches her then he will love me if only for an hour if it fades out too soon and the beam crept on that shadowy path of light with its dancing dustmotes was it indeed charged with fateindeed the augury of love or darkness and slowly moving it mounted the sun sinking it rose above that bent head hovered in a golden mist passedand suddenly was gone  unsteadily seeing nothing plain anna walked out of the church why she passed her husband and the boy on the terrace without a look she could not quite have saidperhaps because the tortured does not salute her torturers when she reached her room she felt deadly tired and lying down on her bed almost at once fell asleep  she was wakened by a sound and recognizing the delicate rattat of her husbands knock did not answer indifferent whether he came in or no he entered noiselessly if she did not let him know she was awake he would not wake her she lay still and watched him sit down astride of a chair cross his arms on its back rest his chin on them and fix his eyes on her through her veil of eyelashes she had unconsciously contrived that his face should be the one object plainly seenthe more intensely visualized because of this queer isolation she did not feel at all ashamed of this mutual fixed scrutiny in which she had such advantage he had never shown her what was in him never revealed what lay behind those bright satiric eyes now perhaps she would see and she lay regarding him with the intense excited absorption with which one looks at a tiny wildflower through a magnifyinglens and watches its insignificance expanded to the size and importance of a hothouse bloom in her mind was this thought he is looking at me with his real self since he has no reason for armour against me now at first his eyes seemed masked with their customary brightness his whole face with its usual decorous formality then gradually he became so changed that she hardly knew him that decorousness that brightness melted off what lay behind as frosty dew melts off grass and her very soul contracted within her as if she had become identified with what he was seeinga something to be passed over a very nothing yes his was the face of one looking at what was unintelligible and therefore negligible at that which had no soul at something of a different and inferior species and of no great interest to a man his face was like a soundless avowal of some conclusion so fixed and intimate that it must surely emanate from the very core of himbe instinctive unchangeable this was the real he a man despising women her first thought was and hes marriedwhat a fate her second if he feels that perhaps thousands of men do am i and all women really what they think us the conviction in his stareits throughandthrough convictionhad infected her and she gave in to it for the moment crushed then her spirit revolted with such turbulence and the blood so throbbed in her that she could hardly lie still how dare he think her like thata nothing a bundle of soulless inexplicable whims and moods and sensuality a thousand times no it was he who was the soulless one the dry the godless one who in his sickening superiority could thus deny her and with her all women that stare was as if he saw hera doll tricked out in garments labelled soul spirit rights responsibilities dignity freedomall so many words it was vile it was horrible that he should see her thus and a really terrific struggle began in her between the desire to get up and cry this out and the knowledge that it would be stupid undignified even mad to show her comprehension of what he would never admit or even understand that he had revealed to her and then a sort of cynicism came to her rescue what a funny thing was married lifeto have lived all these years with him and never known what was at the bottom of his heart she had the feeling now that if she went up to him and said i am in love with that boy it would only make him droop the corners of his mouth and say in his most satiric voice really that is very interestingwould not change in one iota his real thoughts of her only confirm him in the conviction that she was negligible inexplicable an inferior strange form of animal of no real interest to him  and then just when she felt that she could not hold herself in any longer he got up passed on tiptoe to the door opened it noiselessly and went out  the moment he had gone she jumped up so then she was linked to one for whom she for whom women did not as it were exist it seemed to her that she had stumbled on knowledge of almost sacred importance on the key of everything that had been puzzling and hopeless in their married life if he really secretly wholeheartedly despised her the only feeling she need have for one so dry so narrow so basically stupid was just contempt but she knew well enough that contempt would not shake what she had seen in his face he was impregnably walled within his clever dull conviction of superiority he was for ever intrenched and she would always be only the assailant thoughwhat did it matter now  usually swift almost careless she was a long time that evening over her toilette her neck was very sunburnt and she lingered doubtful whether to hide it with powder or accept her gipsy colouring she did accept it for she saw that it gave her eyes so like glacier ice under their black lashes and her hair with its surprising glints of flame colour a peculiar value  when the dinnerbell rang she passed her husbands door without as usual knocking and went down alone  in the hall she noticed some of the english party of the mountain hut they did not greet her conceiving an immediate interest in the barometer but she could feel them staring at her very hard she sat down to wait and at once became conscious of the boy coming over from the other side of the room rather like a person walking in his sleep he said not a word but how he looked and her heart began to beat was this the moment she had longed for if it indeed had come dared she take it then she saw her husband descending the stairs saw him greet the english party heard the intoning of their drawl she looked up at the boy and said quickly was it a happy day it gave her such delight to keep that look on his face that look as if he had forgotten everything except just the sight of her his eyes seemed to have in them something holy at that moment something of the wonderyearning of nature and of innocence it was dreadful to know that in a moment that look must be gone perhaps never to come back on his facethat look so precious her husband was approaching now let him see if he would let him see that someone could adorethat she was not to everyone a kind of lower animal yes he must have seen the boys face and yet his expression never changed he noticed nothing or was it that he disdained to notice   vii   then followed for young lennan a strange time when he never knew from minute to minute whether he was happyalways trying to be with her restless if he could not be sore if she talked with and smiled at others yet when he was with her restless too unsatisfied suffering from his own timidity  one wet morning when she was playing the hotel piano and he listening thinking to have her to himself there came a young german violinistpale and with a brown thinwaisted coat longish hair and little whiskersrather a beast in fact soon of course this young beast was asking her to accompany himas if anyone wanted to hear him play his disgusting violin every word and smile that she gave him hurt so seeing how much more interesting than himself this foreigner was and his heart grew heavier and heavier and he thought if she likes him i ought not to mindonly i do mind how can i help minding it was hateful to see her smiling and the young beast bending down to her and they were talking german so that he could not tell what they were saying which made it more unbearable he had not known there could be such torture  and then he began to want to hurt her too but that was meanbesides how could he hurt her she did not care for him he was nothing to heronly a boy if she really thought him only a boy who felt so oldit would be horrible it flashed across him that she might be playing that young violinist against him no she never would do that but the young beast looked just the sort that might take advantage of her smiles if only he would do something that was not respectful how splendid it would be to ask him to come for a walk in the woods and having told him why give him a thrashing afterwards he would not tell her he would not try to gain credit by it he would keep away till she wanted him back but suddenly the thought of what he would feel if she really meant to take this young man as her friend in place of him became so actual so poignant so horribly painful that he got up abruptly and went towards the door would she not say a word to him before he got out of the room would she not try and keep him if she did not surely it would be all over it would mean that anybody was more to her than he that little journey to the door indeed seemed like a march to execution would she not call after him he looked back she was smiling but he could not smile she had hurt him too much turning his head away he went out and dashed into the rain bareheaded the feeling of it on his face gave him a sort of dismal satisfaction soon he would be wet through perhaps he would get ill out here far away from his people she would have to offer to nurse him and perhapsperhaps in his illness he would seem to her again more interesting than that young beast and thenah if only he could be ill  he mounted rapidly through the dripping leaves towards the foot of the low mountain that rose behind the hotel a trail went up there to the top and he struck into it going at a great pace his sense of injury began dying away he no longer wanted to be ill the rain had stopped the sun came out he went on up and up he would get to the top quicker than anyone ever had it was something he could do better than that young beast the pinetrees gave way to stunted larches and these to pine scrub and bare scree up which he scrambled clutching at the tough bushes terribly out of breath his heart pumping the sweat streaming into his eyes he had no feeling now but wonder whether he would get to the top before he dropped exhausted he thought he would die of the beating of his heart but it was better to die than to stop and be beaten by a few yards he stumbled up at last on to the little plateau at the top for full ten minutes he lay there on his face without moving then rolled over his heart had given up that terrific thumping he breathed luxuriously stretched out his arms along the steaming grassfelt happy it was wonderful up here with the sun burning hot in a sky clearblue already how tiny everything looked belowhotel trees village chaletslittle toy things he had never before felt the sheer joy of being high up the rainclouds torn and driven in huge white shapes along the mountains to the south were like an army of giants with chariots and white horses hurrying away he thought suddenly suppose i had died when my heart pumped so would it have mattered the least bit everything would be going on just the same the sun shining the blue up there the same and those toy things down in the valley that jealousy of his an hour ago whyit was nothinghe himself nothing what did it matter if she were nice to that fellow in the brown coat what did anything matter when the whole thing was so bigand he such a tiny scrap of it  on the edge of the plateau to mark the highest point someone had erected a rude cross which jutted out stark against the blue sky it looked cruel somehow sagged all crooked and out of place up here a piece of bad manners as if people with only one idea had dragged it in without caring whether or no it suited what was around it one might just as well introduce one of these rocks into that jolly dark church where he had left her the other day as put a cross up here  a sound of bells and of sniffing and scuffling roused him a large grey goat had come up and was smelling at his hairthe leader of a flock that were soon all round him solemnly curious with their queer yellow oblongpupilled eyes and their quaint little beards and tails awfully decent beastsand friendly what jolly things to model he lay still having learnt from the fisherman his guardian that necessary habit in the presence of all beasts while the leader sampled the flavour of his neck the passage of that long rough tongue athwart his skin gave him an agreeable sensation awakened a strange deep sense of comradeship he restrained his desire to stroke the creatures nose it appeared that they now all wished to taste his neck but some were timid and the touch of their tongues simply a tickle so that he was compelled to laugh and at that peculiar sound they withdrew and gazed at him there seemed to be no one with them then at a little distance quite motionless in the shade of a rock he spied the goatherd a boy about his own age how lonely he must be up here all day perhaps he talked to his goats he looked as if he might one would get to have queer thoughts up here get to know the rocks and clouds and beasts and what they all meant the goatherd uttered a peculiar whistle and something lennan could not tell exactly what happened among the goatsa sort of here sir seemed to come from them and then the goatherd moved out from the shade and went over to the edge of the plateau and two of the goats that were feeding there thrust their noses into his hand and rubbed themselves against his legs the three looked beautiful standing there together on the edge against the sky  that night after dinner the diningroom was cleared for dancing so that the guests might feel freedom and gaiety in the air and indeed presently a couple began sawing up and down over the polished boards in the apologetic manner peculiar to hotel guests then three pairs of italians suddenly launched themselves into spacetwirling and twirling and glaring into each others eyes and some americans stimulated by their precept began airily backing and filling two of the english grundys with carefully amused faces next moved out to lennan it seemed that they all danced very well better than he could did he dare ask her then he saw the young violinist go up saw her rise and take his arm and vanish into the dancingroom and leaning his forehead against a windowpane with a sick beaten feeling he stayed looking out into the moonlight seeing nothing he heard his name spoken his tutor was standing beside him  you and i lennan must console each other dancings for the young eh  fortunately it was the boys instinct and his training not to show his feelings to be pleasant though suffering  yes sir jolly moonlight isnt it out there  ah very jolly yes when i was your age i twirled the light fantastic with the best but gradually lennan one came to see it could not be done without a partnerthere was the rub tell medo you regard women as responsible beings i should like to have your opinion on that  it was of course ironicalyet there was something in those wordssomething  i think its you sir who ought to give me yours  my dear lennanmy experience is a mere nothing  that was meant for unkindness to her he would not answer if only stormer would go away the music had stopped they would be sitting out somewhere talking he made an effort and said  i was up the hill at the back this morning where the cross is there were some jolly goats  and suddenly he saw her coming she was aloneflushed smiling it struck him that her frock was the same colour as the moonlight  harold will you dance  he would say yes and she would be gone again but his tutor only made her a little bow and said with that smile of his  lennan and i have agreed that dancing is for the young  sometimes the old must sacrifice themselves mark will you dance  behind him he heard his tutor murmur  ah lennanyou betray me  that little silent journey with her to the dancingroom was the happiest moment perhaps that he had ever known and he need not have been so much afraid about his dancing truly it was not polished but it could not spoil hers so light firm buoyant it was wonderful to dance with her only when the music stopped and they sat down did he know how his head was going round he felt strange very strange indeed he heard her say  what is it dear boy you look so white  without quite knowing what he did he bent his face towards the hand that she had laid on his sleeve then knew no more having fainted   viii   growing boyoverexertion in the morning that was all he was himself very quickly and walked up to bed without assistance rotten of him never was anyone more ashamed of his little weakness than this boy now that he was really a trifle indisposed he simply could not bear the idea of being nursed at all or tended almost rudely he had got away only when he was in bed did he remember the look on her face as he left her how wistful and unhappy seeming to implore him to forgive her as if there were anything to forgive as if she had not made him perfectly happy when she danced with him he longed to say to her if i might be close to you like that one minute every day then i dont mind all the rest perhaps he would dare say that tomorrow lying there he still felt a little funny he had forgotten to close the ribs of the blinds and moonlight was filtering in but he was too idle too drowsy to get up now and do it they had given him brandy rather a lotthat perhaps was the reason he felt so queer not ill but mazy as if dreaming as if he had lost the desire ever to move again just to lie there and watch the powdery moonlight and hear faraway music throbbing down below and still feel the touch of her as in the dance she swayed against him and all the time to have the scent about him of flowers his thoughts were dreams his dreams thoughtsall precious unreality and then it seemed to him that the moonlight was gathered into a single slip of pallorthere was a thrumming a throbbing and that shape of moonlight moved towards him it came so close that he felt its warmth against his brow it sighed hovered drew back soundless and was gone he must have fallen then into dreamless sleep  what time was it when he was awakened by that delicate rattat to see his tutor standing in the doorway with a cup of tea  was young lennan all right yes he was perfectly all rightwould be down directly it was most frightfully good of mr stormer to come he really didnt want anything  yes yes but the maimed and the halt must be attended to  his face seemed to the boy very kind just thenonly to laugh at him a very littlejust enough and it was awfully decent of him to have come and to stand there while he drank the tea he was really all right but for a little headache many times while he was dressing he stood still trying to remember that white slip of moonlight was it moonlight was it part of a dream or was it could it have been she in her moonlightcoloured frock why had he not stayed awake he would not dare to ask her and now would never know whether the vague memory of warmth on his brow had been a kiss  he breakfasted alone in the room where they had danced there were two letters for him one from his guardian enclosing money and complaining of the shyness of the trout the other from his sister the man she was engaged tohe was a budding diplomat attached to the embassy at romewas afraid that his leave was going to be curtailed they would have to be married at once they might even have to get a special licence it was lucky mark was coming back so soon they simply must have him for best man the only bridesmaid now would be sylvia sylvia doone why she was only a kid and the memory of a little girl in a very short holland frock with flaxen hair pretty blue eyes and a face so fair that you could almost see through it came up before him but that of course was six years ago she would not still be in a frock that showed her knees or wear beads or be afraid of bulls that were never there it was stupid being best manthey might have got some decent chap and then he forgot allfor there was she out on the terrace in his rush to join her he passed several of the english grundys who stared at him askance indeed his conduct of the night before might well have upset them an oxford man fainting in an hotel something wrong there     and then when he reached her he did find courage  was it really moonlight  all moonlight  but it was warm  and when she did not answer that he had within him just the same light intoxicated feeling as after he had won a race at school  but now came a dreadful blow his tutors old guide had suddenly turned up after a climb with a party of germans the warhorse had been aroused in stormer he wished to start that afternoon for a certain hut and go up a certain peak at dawn next day but lennan was not to go why not because of last nights faint and because forsooth he was not some stupid thing they called an expert as if where she could go he could this was to treat him like a child of course he could go up this rotten mountain it was because she did not care enough to take him she did not think him man enough did she think that he could not climb whather husbandcould and if it were dangerous she ought not to be going leaving him behindthat was simply cruel but she only smiled and he flung away from her not having seen that all this grief of his only made her happy  and that afternoon they went off without him what deep dark thoughts he had then what passionate hatred of his own youth what schemes he wove by which she might come back and find him goneup some mountain far more dangerous and fatiguing if people did not think him fit to climb with he would climb by himself that anyway everyone admitted was dangerous and it would be her fault she would be sorry then he would get up and be off before dawn he put his things out ready and filled his flask the moonlight that evening was more wonderful than ever the mountains like great ghosts of themselves and she was up there at the hut among them it was very long before he went to sleep brooding over his injuriesintending not to sleep at all so as to be ready to be off at three oclock at nine oclock he woke his wrath was gone he only felt restless and ashamed if instead of flying out he had made the best of it he could have gone with them as far as the hut could have stayed the night there and now he cursed himself for being such a fool and idiot some little of that idiocy he could perhaps retrieve if he started for the hut at once he might still be in time to meet them coming down and accompany them home he swallowed his coffee and set off he knew the way at first then in woods lost it recovered the right track again at last but did not reach the hut till nearly two oclock yes the party had made the ascent that morningthey had been seen been heard jodelling on the top gewiss gewiss but they would not come down the same way oh no they would be going home down to the west and over the other pass they would be back in house before the young herr himself  he heard this oddly almost with relief was it the long walk alone or being up there so high or simply that he was very hungry or just these nice friendly folk in the hut and their young daughter with her fresh face queer little black cloth sailor hat with long ribbons velvet bodice and perfect simple manners or the sight of the little silverydun cows thrusting their broad black noses against her hand what was it that had taken away from him all his restless feeling made him happy and content he did not know that the newest thing always fascinates the puppy in its gambols  he sat a long while after lunch trying to draw the little cows watching the sun on the cheek of that pretty maiden trying to talk to her in german and when at last he said adieu and she murmured kuss die hand adieu there was quite a little pang in his heart wonderful and queer is the heart of a man for all that as he neared home he hastened till he was actually running why had he stayed so long up there she would be backshe would expect to see him and that young beast of a violinist would be with her perhaps instead he reached the hotel just in time to rush up and dress and rush down to dinner ah they were tired no doubtwere resting in their rooms he sat through dinner as best he could got away before dessert and flew upstairs for a minute he stood there doubtful on which door should he knock then timidly he tapped on hers no answer he knocked loud on his tutors door no answer they were not back then not back what could that mean or could it be that they were both asleep once more he knocked on her door then desperately turned the handle and took a flying glance empty tidy untouched not back he turned and ran downstairs again all the guests were streaming out from dinner and he became entangled with a group of english grundys discussing a climbing accident which had occurred in switzerland he listened feeling suddenly quite sick one of them the short greybearded grundy with the rather whispering voice said to him all alone again tonight the stormers not back lennan did his best to answer but something had closed his throat he could only shake his head  they had a guide i think said the english grundy  this time lennan managed to get out yes sir  stormer i fancy is quite an expert and turning to the lady whom the young grundys addressed as madre he added  to me the great charm of mountainclimbing was always the freedom from peoplethe remoteness  the mother of the young grundys looking at lennan with her halfclosed eyes answered  that to me would be the disadvantage i always like to be mixing with my own kind  the greybearded grundy murmured in a muffled voice  dangerous thing that to sayin an hotel  and they went on talking but of what lennan no longer knew lost in this sudden feeling of sick fear in the presence of these english grundys so superior to all vulgar sensations he could not give vent to his alarm already they viewed him as unsound for having fainted then he grasped that there had begun all round him a sort of luxurious speculation on what might have happened to the stormers the descent was very nasty there was a particularly bad traverse the grundy whose collar was not now crumpled said he did not believe in women climbing it was one of the signs of the times that he most deplored the mother of the young grundys countered him at once in practice she agreed that they were out of place but theoretically she could not see why they should not climb an american standing near threw all into confusion by saying he guessed that it might be liable to develop their understandings lennan made for the front door the moon had just come up over in the south and exactly under it he could see their mountain what visions he had then he saw her lying dead saw himself climbing down in the moonlight and raising her stillliving but halffrozen form from some perilous ledge even that was almost better than this actuality of not knowing where she was or what had happened people passed out into the moonlight looking curiously at his set face staring so fixedly one or two asked him if he were anxious and he answered oh no thanks soon there would have to be a search party how soon he would he must be of it they should not stop him this time and suddenly he thought ah it is all because i stayed up there this afternoon talking to that girl all because i forgot her  and then he heard a stir behind him there they were coming down the passage from a side doorshe in front with her alpenstock and rucksacksmiling instinctively he recoiled behind some plants they passed her sunburned face with its high cheekbones and its deepset eyes looked so happy smiling tired triumphant somehow he could not bear it and when they were gone by he stole out into the wood and threw himself down in shadow burying his face and choking back a horrible dry sobbing that would keep rising in his throat   ix   next day he was happy for all the afternoon he lay out in the shade of that same wood at her feet gazing up through larchboughs it was so wonderful with nobody but nature near nature so alive and busy and so big  coming down from the hut the day before he had seen a peak that looked exactly like the figure of a woman with a garment over her head the biggest statue in the world from further down it had become the figure of a bearded man with his arm bent over his eyes had she seen it had she noticed how all the mountains in moonlight or very early morning took the shape of beasts what he wanted most in life was to be able to make images of beasts and creatures of all sorts that were likethat hadthat gave out the spirit ofnature so that by just looking at them one could have all those jolly feelings one had when one was watching trees and beasts and rocks and even some sorts of menbut not english grundys  so he was quite determined to study art  oh yes of course  he would want to leaveoxford then  no oh no only some day he would have to  she answered some never get away  and he said quickly of course i shall never want to leave oxford while you are there  he heard her draw her breath in sharply  oh yes you will now help me up and she led the way back to the hotel  he stayed out on the terrace when she had gone in restless and unhappy the moment he was away from her a voice close by said  well friend lennanbrown study or blue devils which  there in one of those high wicker chairs that insulate their occupants from the world he saw his tutor leaning back head a little to one side and tips of fingers pressed together he looked like an idol sitting there inert and yetyesterday he had gone up that mountain  cheer up you will break your neck yet when i was your age i remember feeling it deeply that i was not allowed to risk the lives of others  lennan stammered out  i didnt think of that but i thought where mrs stormer could go i could  ah for all our admiration we cannot quite admitcan we when it comes to the point  the boys loyalty broke into flame  its not that i think mrs stormer as good as any manonlyonly  not quite so good as you eh  a hundred times better sir  stormer smiled ironic beast  lennan he said distrust hyperbole  of course i know im no good at climbing the boy broke out again butbuti thought where she was allowed to risk her life i ought to be  good i like that it was said so entirely without irony for once that the boy was disconcerted  you are young brother lennan his tutor went on now at what age do you consider men develop discretion because there is just one thing always worth rememberingwomen have none of that better part of valour  i think women are the best things in the world the boy blurted out  may you long have that opinion his tutor had risen and was ironically surveying his knees a bit stiff he said let me know when you change your views  i never shall sir  ah ah never is a long word lennan i am going to have some tea and gingerly he walked away quizzing as it were with a smile his own stiffness  lennan remained where he was with burning cheeks his tutors words again had seemed directed against her how could a man say such things about women if they were true he did not want to know if they were not true it was wicked to say them it must be awful never to have generous feelings always to have to be satirical dreadful to be like the english grundys only different of course because after all old stormer was much more interesting and intelligentever so much more only just as superior some never get away had she meantfrom that superiority just down below were a family of peasants scything and gathering in the grass one could imagine her doing that and looking beautiful with a coloured handkerchief over her head one could imagine her doing anything simpleone could not imagine old stormer doing anything but what he did do and suddenly the boy felt miserable oppressed by these dim glimmerings of lives misplaced and he resolved that he would not be like stormer when he was old no he would rather be a regular beast than be like that     when he went to his room to change for dinner he saw in a glass of water a large clove carnation who had put it there who could have put it therebut she it had the same scent as the mountain pinks she had dropped over him but deeper richera scent moving dark and sweet he put his lips to it before he pinned it into his coat  there was dancing again that nightmore couples this time and a violin beside the piano and she had on a black frock he had never seen her in black her face and neck were powdered over their sunburn the first sight of that powder gave him a faint shock he had not somehow thought that ladies ever put on powder but if she didthen it must be right and his eyes never left her he saw the young german violinist hovering round her even dancing with her twice watched her dancing with others but all without jealousy without troubling all in a sort of dream what was it had he been bewitched into that queer state bewitched by the gift of that flower in his coat what was it when he danced with her that kept him happy in her silence and his own there was no expectation in him of anything that she would say or dono expectation no desire even when he wandered out with her on to the terrace even when they went down the bank and sat on a bench above the fields where the peasants had been scything he had still no feeling but that quiet dreamy adoration the night was black and dreamy too for the moon was still well down behind the mountains the little band was playing the next waltz but he sat not moving not thinking as if all power of action and thought had been stolen out of him and the scent of the flower in his coat rose for there was no wind suddenly his heart stopped beating she had leaned against him he felt her shoulder press his arm her hair touch his cheek he closed his eyes then and turned his face to her he felt her lips press his mouth with a swift burning kiss he sighed stretched out his arms there was nothing there but air the rustle of her dress against the grass was all the flowerit too was gone   x   not one minute all that night did anna sleep was it remorse that kept her awake or the intoxication of memory if she felt that her kiss had been a crime it was not against her husband or herself but against the boythe murder of illusion of something sacred but she could not help feeling a delirious happiness too and the thought of trying to annul what she had done did not even occur to her  he was ready then to give her a little love ever so little compared to hers but still a little there could be no other meaning to that movement of his face with the closed eyes as if he would nestle it down on her breast  was she ashamed of her little manoeuvres of these last few daysashamed of having smiled at the young violinist of that late return from the mountain climb of the flower she had given him of all the conscious siege she had laid since the evening her husband came in and sat watching her without knowing that she saw him no not really ashamed her remorse rose only from the kiss it hurt to think of that because it was death the final extinction of the motherfeeling in her the awakening ofwho knew whatin the boy for if she was mysterious to him what was he not to her with his eagerness and his dreaminess his youthful warmth his innocence what if it had killed in him trust brushed off the dew tumbled a star down could she forgive herself for that could she bear it if she were to make him like so many other boys like that young violinist just a cynical youth looking on women as what they called fair game but could she make him into suchwould he ever grow like that oh surely not or she would not have loved him from the moment she first set eyes on him and spoke of him as an angel  after that kissthat crime if it were onein the dark she had not known what he had done where goneperhaps wandering perhaps straight up to his room why had she refrained left him there vanished out of his arms this she herself hardly understood not shame not fear reverence perhapsfor what for lovefor the illusion the mystery all that made love beautiful for youth and the poetry of it just for the sake of the black still night itself and the scent of that flowerdark flower of passion that had won him to her and that she had stolen back and now wore all night long close to her neck and in the morning placed withered within her dress she had been starved so long and so long waited for that momentit was little wonder if she did not clearly know why she had done just this and not that  and now how should she meet him how first look into his eyes would they have changed would they no longer have the straight look she so loved it would be for her to lead to make the future and she kept saying to herself i am not going to be afraid it is done i will take what life offers of her husband she did not think at all  but the first moment she saw the boy she knew that something from outside and untoward had happened since that kiss he came up to her indeed but he said nothing stood trembling all over and handed her a telegram that contained these words come back at once wedding immediate expect you day after tomorrow cicely the words grew indistinct even as she read them and the boys face all blurred then making an effort she said quietly  of course you must go you cannot miss your only sisters wedding  without protest he looked at her and she could hardly bear that lookit seemed to know so little and ask so much she said it is nothingonly a few days you will come back or we will come to you  his face brightened at once  will you really come to us soon at onceif they ask you then i dont mindii and then he stopped choking  she said again  ask us we will come  he seized her hand pressed and pressed it in both his own then stroked it gently and said  oh im hurting it  she laughed not wishing to cry  in a few minutes he would have to start to catch the only train that would get him home in time  she went and helped him to pack her heart felt like lead but not able to bear that look on his face again she kept cheerfully talking of their return asking about his home how to get to it speaking of oxford and next term when his things were ready she put her arms round his neck and for a moment pressed him to her then she escaped looking back from his door she saw him standing exactly as when she had withdrawn her arms her cheeks were wet she dried them as she went downstairs when she felt herself safe she went out on the terrace her husband was there and she said to him  will you come with me into the town i want to buy some things  he raised his eyebrows smiled dimly and followed her they walked slowly down the hill into the long street of the little town all the time she talked of she knew not what and all the time she thought his carriage will passhis carriage will pass  several carriages went jingling by at last he came sitting there and staring straight before him he did not see them she heard her husband say  hullo where is our young friend lennan off to with his luggagelooking like a lion cub in trouble  she answered in a voice that she tried to make clear and steady  there must be something wrong or else it is his sisters wedding  she felt that her husband was gazing at her and wondered what her face was like but at that moment the word madre sounded close in her ear and they were surrounded by a small drove of english grundys   xi   that twenty mile drive was perhaps the worst part of the journey for the boy it is always hard to sit still and suffer  when anna left him the night before he had wandered about in the dark not knowing quite where he went then the moon came up and he found himself sitting under the eave of a barn close to a chalet where all was dark and quiet and down below him the moonwhitened valley villageits roofs and spires and little glamorous unreal lights  in his evening suit his dark ruffled hair uncovered he would have made a quaint spectacle for the owners of that chalet if they had chanced to see him seated on the haystrewn boards against their barn staring before him with such wistful rapture but they were folk to whom sleep was precious  and now it was all snatched away from him relegated to some immensely faroff future would it indeed be possible to get his guardian to ask them down to hayle and would they really come his tutor would surely never care to visit a place right away in the countryfar from books and everything he frowned thinking of his tutor but it was with perplexityno other feeling and yet if he could not have them down there how could he wait the two whole months till next term began so went his thoughts round and round while the horses jogged dragging him further and further from her  it was better in the train the distraction of all the strange crowd of foreigners the interest of new faces and new country and then sleepa long night of it snoozed up in his corner thoroughly fagged out and next day more new country more new faces and slowly his mood changing from ache and bewilderment to a sense of something promised delightful to look forward to then calais at last and a nightcrossing in a wet little steamer a summer gale blowing spray in his face waves leaping white in a black sea and the wild sound of the wind on again to london the early drive across the town still sleepy in august haze an english breakfastporridge chops marmalade and at last the train for home at all events he could write to her and tearing a page out of his little sketchbook he began   i am writing in the train so please forgive this joggly writing   then he did not know how to go on for all that he wanted to say was such as he had never even dreamed of writingthings about his feelings which would look horrible in words besides he must not put anything that might not be read by anyone so what was there to say   it has been such a long journey he wrote at last away from the tyrol he did not dare even to put from you i thought it would never end but at last it hasvery nearly i have thought a great deal about the tyrol it was a lovely timethe loveliest time i have ever had and now its over i try to console myself by thinking of the future but not the immediate futurethat is not very enjoyable i wonder how the mountains are looking today please give my love to them especially the lion ones that come and lie out in the moonlightyou will not recognize them from thisthen followed a sketch and this is the church we went to with someone kneeling and this is meant for the english grundys looking at someone who is coming in very late with an alpenstockonly i am better at the english grundys than at the person with the alpenstock i wish i were the english grundys now still in the tyrol i hope i shall get a letter from you soon and that it will say you are getting ready to come back my guardian will be awfully keen for you to come and stay with us he is not half bad when you know him and there will be his sister mrs doone and her daughter left there after the wedding it will be simply disgusting if you and mr stormer dont come i wish i could write all i feel about my lovely time in the tyrol but you must please imagine it   and just as he had not known how to address her so he could not tell how to subscribe himself and only put mark lennan  he posted the letter at exeter where he had some time to wait and his mind moved still more from past to future now that he was nearing home he began to think of his sister in two days she would be gone to italy he would not see her again for a long time and a whole crowd of memories began to stretch out hands to him how she and he used to walk together in the walled garden and on the sunk croquet ground she telling him stories her arm round his neck because she was two years older and taller than he in those days their first talk each holidays when he came back to her the first teawith unlimited jamin the old mullionwindowed flowerchintzed schoolroom just himself and her and old tingle miss tring the ancient governess whose chaperonage would now be gone and sometimes that kid sylvia when she chanced to be staying there with her mother cicely had always understood him when he explained to her how inferior school was because nobody took any interest in beasts or birds except to kill them or in drawing or making things or anything decent they would go off together rambling along the river or up the park where everything looked so jolly and wildthe ragged oaktrees and huge boulders of whose presence old godden the coachman had said i cant think but what these ha been washed here by the flood mast mark these and a thousand other memories beset his conscience now and as the train drew closer to their station he eagerly made ready to jump out and greet her there was the honeysuckle full out along the paling of the platform over the waitingroom wonderful this yearand there was she standing alone on the platform no it was not cicely he got out with a blank sensation as if those memories had played him false it was a girl indeed but she only looked about sixteen and wore a sunbonnet that hid her hair and half her face she had on a blue frock and some honeysuckle in her waistbelt she seemed to be smiling at him and expecting him to smile at her and so he did smile she came up to him then and said  im sylvia  he answered oh thanks awfullyit was awfully good of you to come and meet me  cicelys so busy its only the tcart have you got much luggage  she took up his holdall and he took it from her she took his bag and he took it from her then they went out to the tcart a small groom stood there holding a silverroan cob with a black mane and black swish tail  she said dyou mind if i drive because im learning  and he answered oh no rather not  she got up he noticed that her eyes looked quite excited then his portmanteau came out and was deposited with the other things behind and he got up beside her  she said let go billy  the roan rushed past the little groom whose top boots seemed to twinkle as he jumped up behind they whizzed round the corner from the station yard and observing that her mouth was just a little open as though this had disconcerted her he said  he pulls a bit  yesbut isnt he perfectly sweet  he is rather decent  ah when she came he would drive her they would go off alone in the tcart and he would show her all the country round  he was reawakened by the words  oh i know hes going to shy at once there was a swerve the roan was cantering  they had passed a pig  doesnt he look lovely now ought i to have whipped him when he shied  rather not  why  because horses are horses and pigs are pigs its natural for horses to shy at them  oh  he looked up at her then sidelong the curve of her cheek and chin looked very soft and rather jolly  i didnt know you you know he said youve grown up so awfully  i knew you at once your voice is still furry  there was another silence till she said  he does pull ratherdoesnt he going home  shall i drive  yes please  he stood up and took the reins and she slipped past under them in front of him her hair smelt exactly like hay as she was softly bumped against him  she kept regarding him steadily with very blue eyes now that she was relieved of driving  cicely was afraid you werent coming she said suddenly what sort of people are those old stormers  he felt himself grow very red choked something down and answered  its only he thats old shes not more than about thirtyfive  that is old  he restrained the words of course its old to a kid like you and instead he looked at her was she exactly a kid she seemed quite tall for a girl and not very thin and there was something frank and soft about her face and as if she wanted you to be nice to her  is she very pretty  this time he did not go red such was the disturbance that question made in him if he said yes it was like letting the world know his adoration but to say anything less would be horrible disloyal so he did say yes listening hard to the tone of his own voice  i thought she was do you like her very much again he struggled with that thing in his throat and again said yes  he wanted to hate this girl yet somehow could notshe looked so soft and confiding she was staring before her now her lips still just parted so evidently that had not been because of boleros pulling they were pretty all the same and so was her short straight little nose and her chin and she was awfully fair his thoughts flew back to that other faceso splendid so full of life suddenly he found himself unable to picture itfor the first time since he had started on his journey it would not come before him  oh look  her hand was pulling at his arm there in the field over the hedge a buzzard hawk was dropping like a stone  oh mark oh oh its got it  she was covering her face with both her hands and the hawk with a young rabbit in its claws was sailing up again it looked so beautiful that he did not somehow feel sorry for the rabbit but he wanted to stroke and comfort her and said  its all right sylvia it really is the rabbits dead already you know and its quite natural  she took her hands away from a face that looked just as if she were going to cry  poor little rabbit it was such a little one   xii   on the afternoon of the day following he sat in the smokingroom with a prayer book in his hand and a frown on his forehead reading the marriage service the book had been effectively designed for not spoiling the figure when carried in a pocket but this did not matter for even if he could have read the words he would not have known what they meant seeing that he was thinking how he could make a certain petition to a certain person sitting just behind at a large bureau with a sliding top examining artificial flies  he fixed at last upon this form  gordy why gordy no one quite knew nowwhether because his name was george or by way of corruption from guardian when cis is gone itll be rather awful wont it  not a bit  mr heatherley was a man of perhaps sixtyfour if indeed guardians have ages and like a doctor rather than a squire his face square and puffy his eyes always halfclosed and his curly mouth using bluntly a voice of that refined coarseness peculiar to people of old family  but it will you know  well supposin it is  i only wondered if youd mind asking mr and mrs stormer to come here for a littlethey were awfully kind to me out there  strange man and woman my dear fellow  mr stormer likes fishing  does he and what does she like  very grateful that his back was turned the boy said  i dont knowanythingshes awfully nice  ah pretty  he answered faintly  i dont know what you call pretty gordy  he felt rather than saw his guardian scrutinizing him with those halfclosed eyes under their gouty lids  all right do as you like have em here and have done with it by all means  did his heart jump not quite but it felt warm and happy and he said  thanks awfully gordy its most frightfully decent of you and turned again to the marriage service he could make out some of it in places it seemed to him fine and in other places queer about obeying for instance if you loved anybody it seemed rotten to expect them to obey you if you loved them and they loved you there couldnt ever be any question of obeying because you would both do the things always of your own accord and if they didnt love you or you them thenoh then it would be simply too disgusting for anything to go on living with a person you didnt love or who didnt love you but of course she didnt love his tutor had she once those bright doubting eyes that studiously satiric mouth came very clearly up before him you could not love them and yethe was really very decent a feeling as of pity almost of affection rose in him for his remote tutor it was queer to feel so since the last time they had talked together out there on the terrace he had not felt at all like that  the noise of the bureau top sliding down aroused him mr heatherley was closing in the remains of the artificial flies that meant he would be going out to fish and the moment he heard the door shut mark sprang up slid back the bureau top and began to write his letter it was hard work   dear mrs stormer  my guardian wishes me to beg you and mr stormer to pay us a visit as soon as you come back from the tyrol please tell mr stormer that only the very best fishermenlike himcan catch our trout the rest catch our trees this is me catching our trees here followed a sketch my sister is going to be married tomorrow and it will be disgusting afterwards unless you come so do come please and with my very best greetings  i am  your humble servant  m lennan   when he had stamped this production and dropped it in the letterbox he had the oddest feeling as if he had been let out of school a desire to rush about to frolic what should he do cis of course would be busythey were all busy about the wedding he would go and saddle bolero and jump him in the park or should he go down along the river and watch the jays both seemed lonely occupations and he stood in the windowdejected at the age of five walking with his nurse he had been overheard remarking nurse i want to eat a biscuitall the way i want to eat a biscuit and it was still rather so with him perhapsall the way he wanted to eat a biscuit he bethought him then of his modelling and went out to the little empty greenhouse where he kept his masterpieces they seemed to him now quite horribleand two of them the sheep and the turkey he marked out for summary destruction the idea occurred to him that he might try and model that hawk escaping with the little rabbit but when he tried no nice feeling came and flinging the things down he went out he ran along the unweeded path to the tennis groundlawn tennis was then just coming in the grass looked very rough but then everything about that little manor house was left rather wild and anyhow why nobody quite knew and nobody seemed to mind he stood there scrutinizing the condition of the ground a sound of humming came to his ears he got up on the wall there was sylvia sitting in the field making a wreath of honeysuckle he stood very quiet and listened she looked prettylost in her tune then he slid down off the wall and said gently  hallo  she looked round at him her eyes very wide open  your voice is jolly sylvia  oh no  it is come and climb a tree  where  in the park of course  they were some time selecting the tree many being too easy for him and many too hard for her but one was found at last an oak of great age and frequented by rooks then insisting that she must be roped to him he departed to the house for some blindcord the climb began at four oclocknamed by him the ascent of the cimone della pala he led the momentous expedition taking a hitch of the blindcord round a branch before he permitted her to move two or three times he was obliged to make the cord fast and return to help her for she was not an expert her arms seemed soft and she was inclined to straddle instead of trusting to one foot but at last they were settled streaked indeed with moss on the top branch but two they rested there silent listening to the rooks soothing an outraged dignity save for this slowly subsiding demonstration it was marvellously peaceful and remote up there halfway to a blue sky thinly veiled from them by the crinkled browngreen leaves the peculiar dry mossy smell of an oaktree was disturbed into the air by the least motion of their feet or hands against the bark they could hardly see the ground and all around other gnarled trees barred off any view  he said  if we stay up here till its dark we might see owls  oh no owls are horrible  what theyre lovelyespecially the white ones  i cant stand their eyes and they squeak so when theyre hunting  oh but thats so jolly and their eyes are beautiful  theyre always catching mice and little chickens all sorts of little things  but they dont mean to they only want them to eat dont you think things are jolliest at night  she slipped her arm in his  no i dont like the dark  why not its splendidwhen things get mysterious he dwelt lovingly on that word  i dont like mysterious things they frighten you  oh sylvia  no i like early morningespecially in spring when its beginning to get leafy  well of course  she was leaning against him for safety just a little and stretching out his arm he took good hold of the branch to make a back for her there was a silence then he said  if you could only have one tree which would you have  not oaks limesnobirches which would you  he pondered there were so many trees that were perfect birches and limes of course but beeches and cypresses and yews and cedars and holmoaksalmost and planetrees then he said suddenly  pines i mean the big ones with reddish stems and branches pretty high up  why  again he pondered it was very important to explain exactly why his feelings about everything were concerned in this and while he mused she gazed at him as if surprised to see anyone think so deeply at last he said  because theyre independent and dignified and never quite cold and their branches seem to brood but chiefly because the ones i mean are generally out of the common where you find them you knowjust one or two strong and dark standing out against the sky  theyre too dark  it occurred to him suddenly that he had forgotten larches they of course could be heavenly when you lay under them and looked up at the sky as he had that afternoon out there then he heard her say  if i could only have one flower i should have lilies of the valley the small ones that grow wild and smell so jolly  he had a swift vision of another flower darkvery different and was silent  what would you have mark her voice sounded a little hurt you are thinking of one arent you  he said honestly  yes i am  which  its dark too you wouldnt care for it a bit  how dyou know  a clove carnation  but i do like itonlynot very much  he nodded solemnly  i knew you wouldnt  then a silence fell between them she had ceased to lean against him and he missed the cosy friendliness of it now that their voices and the cawings of the rooks had ceased there was nothing heard but the dry rustle of the leaves and the plaintive cry of a buzzard hawk hunting over the little tor across the river there were nearly always two up there quartering the sky to the boy it was lovely that silencelike nature talking to younature always talked in silences the beasts the birds the insects only really showed themselves when you were still you had to be awfully quiet too for flowers and plants otherwise you couldnt see the real jolly separate life there was in them even the boulders down there that old godden thought had been washed up by the flood never showed you what queer shapes they had and let you feel close to them unless you were thinking of nothing else sylvia after all was better in that way than he had expected she could keep quiet he had thought girls hopeless she was gentle and it was rather jolly to watch her through the leaves there came the faint far tinkle of the teabell  she said we must get down  it was much too jolly to go in really but if she wanted her teagirls always wanted tea and twisting the cord carefully round the branch he began to superintend her descent about to follow he heard her cry  oh mark im stuckim stuck i cant reach it with my foot im swinging and he saw that she was swinging by her hands and the cord  let go drop on to the branch belowthe cordll hold you straight till you grab the trunk  her voice mounted piteously  i canti really canti should slip  he tied the cord and slithered hastily to the branch below her then bracing himself against the trunk he clutched her round the waist and knees but the taut cord held her up and she would not come to anchor he could not hold her and untie the cord which was fast round her waist if he let her go with one hand and got out his knife he would never be able to cut and hold her at the same time for a moment he thought he had better climb up again and slack off the cord but he could see by her face that she was getting frightened he could feel it by the quivering of her body  if i heave you up he said can you get hold again above and without waiting for an answer he heaved she caught hold frantically  hold on just for a second  she did not answer but he saw that her face had gone very white he snatched out his knife and cut the cord she clung just for that moment then came loose into his arms and he hauled her to him against the trunk safe there she buried her face on his shoulder he began to murmur to her and smooth her softly with quite a feeling of its being his business to smooth her like this to protect her he knew she was crying but she let no sound escape and he was very careful not to show that he knew for fear she should feel ashamed he wondered if he ought to kiss her at last he did on the top of her head very gently then she put up her face and said she was a beast and he kissed her again on an eyebrow  after that she seemed all right and very gingerly they descended to the ground where shadows were beginning to lengthen over the fern and the sun to slant into their eyes   xiii   the night after the wedding the boy stood at the window of his pleasant attic bedroom with one wall sloping and a faint smell of mice he was tired and excited and his brain full of pictures this was his first wedding and he was haunted by a vision of his sisters little white form and her face with its starry eyes she was gonehis no more how fearful the wedding march had sounded on that organthat awful old wheezer and the sermon one didnt want to hear that sort of thing when one felt inclined to cry even gordy had looked rather boiled when he was giving her away with perfect distinctness he could still see the group before the altar rails just as if he had not been a part of it himself cis in her white sylvia in fluffy grey his impassive brotherinlaws tall figure gordy looking queer in a black coat with a very yellow face and eyes still halfclosed the rotten part of it all had been that you wanted to be just feeling and you had to be thinking of the ring and your gloves and whether the lowest button of your white waistcoat was properly undone girls could do both it seemedcis seemed to be seeing something wonderful all the time and sylvia had looked quite holy he himself had been too conscious of the rectors voice and the sort of professional manner with which he did it all as if he were making up a prescription with directions how to take it and yet it was all rather beautiful in a kind of fashion every face turned one way and a tremendous hushexcept for poor old goddens blowing of his nose with his enormous red handkerchief and the soft darkness up in the roof and down in the pews and the sunlight brightening the south windows all the same it would have been much jollier just taking hands by themselves somewhere and saying out before god what they really feltbecause after all god was everything everywhere not only in stuffy churches that was how he would like to be married out of doors on a starry night like this when everything felt wonderful all round you surely god wasnt half as small as people seemed always making hima sort of superior man a little bigger than themselves even the very most beautiful and wonderful and awful things one could imagine or make could only be just nothing to a god who had a temple like the night out there but then you couldnt be married alone and no girl would ever like to be married without rings and flowers and dresses and words that made it all feel small and cosy cis might have perhaps only she wouldnt because of not hurting other peoples feelings but sylvianevershe would be afraid only of course she was young and the thread of his thoughts brokeand scattered like beads from a string  leaning out and resting his chin on his hands he drew the night air into his lungs honeysuckle or was it the scent of lilies still the stars all out and lots of owls tonightfour at least what would night be like without owls and stars but that was ityou never could think what things would be like if they werent just what and where they were you never knew what was coming either and yet when it came it seemed as if nothing else ever could have come that was queeryou could do anything you liked until youd done it but when you had done it then you knew of course that you must always have had to what was that light below and to the left whose room old tinglesno the little spare roomsylvias she must be awake then he leaned far out and whispered in the voice she had said was still furry  sylvia  the light flickered he could just see her head appear with hair all loose and her face turning up to him he could only half see half imagine it mysterious blurry and he whispered  isnt this jolly  the whisper travelled back  awfully  arent you sleepy  no are you  not a bit dyou hear the owls  rather  doesnt it smell good  perfect can you see me  only just not too much can you  i cant see your nose shall i get the candle  nothatd spoil it what are you sitting on  the window sill  it doesnt twist your neck does it  nooonly a little bit  are you hungry  yes  wait half a shake ill let down some chocolate in my big bath towel itll swing along to youreach out  a dim white arm reached out  catch i say you wont get cold  rather not  its too jolly to sleep isnt it  mark  yes  which star is yours mine is the white one over the top branch of the big sycamore from here  mine is that twinkling red one over the summer house sylvia  yes  catch  oh i couldntwhat was it  nothing  no but what was it  only my star its caught in your hair  oh  listen  silence then until her awed whisper  what  and his floating down dying away  cave  what had stirredsome window opened cautiously he spied along the face of the dim house there was no light anywhere nor any shifting blur of white at her window below all was dark remotestill sweet with the scent of something jolly and then he saw what that something was all over the wall below his window white jessamine was in flowerstars not only in the sky perhaps the sky was really a field of white flowers and god walked there and plucked the stars  the next morning there was a letter on his plate when he came down to breakfast he couldnt open it with sylvia on one side of him and old tingle on the other then with a sort of anger he did open it he need not have been afraid it was written so that anyone might have read it told of a climb of bad weather said they were coming home was he relieved disturbed pleased at their coming back or only uneasily ashamed she had not got his second letter yet he could feel old tingle looking round at him with those queer sharp twinkling eyes of hers and sylvia regarding him quite frankly and conscious that he was growing red he said to himself i wont and did not in three days they would be at oxford would they come on here at once old tingle was speaking he heard sylvia answer no i dont like bopsies theyre so hard it was their old name for high cheekbones sylvia certainly had none her cheeks went softly up to her eyes  do you mark  he said slowly  on some people  people who have them are strongwilled arent they  was sheannastrongwilled it came to him that he did not know at all what she was  when breakfast was over and he had got away to his old greenhouse he had a strange unhappy time he was a beast he had not been thinking of her half enough he took the letter out and frowned at it horribly why could he not feel more what was the matter with him why was he such a brutenot to be thinking of her day and night for long he stood disconsolate in the little dark greenhouse among the images of his beasts the letter in his hand  he stole out presently and got down to the river unobserved comfortingthat crisp gentle sound of water ever so comforting to sit on a stone very still and wait for things to happen round you you lost yourself that way just became branches and stones and water and birds and sky you did not feel such a beast gordy would never understand why he did not care for fishingone thing trying to catch anotherinstead of watching and understanding what things were you never got to the end of looking into water or grass or fern always something queer and new it was like that too with yourself if you sat down and looked properlymost awfully interesting to see things working in your mind  a soft rain had begun to fall hissing gently on the leaves but he had still a boys love of getting wet and stayed where he was on the stone some people saw fairies in woods and down in water or said they did that did not seem to him much fun what was really interesting was noticing that each thing was different from every other thing and what made it so you must see that before you could draw or model decently it was fascinating to see your creatures coming out with shapes of their very own they did that without your understanding how but this vacation he was no goodcouldnt draw or model a bit  a jay had settled about forty yards away and remained in full view attending to his manycoloured feathers of all things birds were the most fascinating he watched it a long time and when it flew on followed it over the high wall up into the park he heard the lunchbell ring in the far distance but did not go in so long as he was out there in the soft rain with the birds and trees and other creatures he was free from that unhappy feeling of the morning he did not go back till nearly seven properly wet through and very hungry  all through dinner he noticed that sylvia seemed to be watching him as if wanting to ask him something she looked very soft in her white frock open at the neck and her hair almost the colour of special moonlight so goldypale and he wanted her to understand that it wasnt a bit because of her that he had been out alone all day after dinner when they were getting the table ready to play red nines he did murmur  did you sleep last nightafter  she nodded fervently to that  it was raining really hard now swishing and dripping out in the darkness and he whispered  our stars would be drowned tonight  do you really think we have stars  we might but mines safe of course your hair is jolly sylvia  she gazed at him very sweet and surprised   xiv   anna did not receive the boys letter in the tyrol it followed her to oxford she was just going out when it came and she took it up with the mingled beatitude and almost sickening tremor that a lover feels touching the loved ones letter she would not open it in the street but carried it all the way to the garden of a certain college and sat down to read it under the cedartree that little letter so short boyish and dry transported her halfway to heaven she was to see him again at once not to wait weeks with the fear that he would quite forget her her husband had said at breakfast that oxford without the dear young clowns assuredly was charming but oxford full of tourists and other strange bodies as certainly was not where should they go thank heaven the letter could be shown him for all that a little stab of pain went through her that there was not one word which made it unsuitable to show still she was happy never had her favourite college garden seemed so beautiful with each tree and flower so cared for and the very wind excluded never had the birds seemed so tame and friendly the sun shone softly even the clouds were luminous and joyful she sat a long time musing and went back forgetting all she had come out to do having both courage and decision she did not leave the letter to burn a hole in her corsets but gave it to her husband at lunch looking him in the face and saying carelessly  providence you see answers your question  he read it raised his eyebrows smiled and without looking up murmured  you wish to prosecute this romantic episode  did he mean anythingor was it simply his way of putting things  i naturally want to be anywhere but here  perhaps you would like to go alone  he said that of course knowing she could not say yes and she answered simply no  then let us both goon monday i will catch the young mans trout thou shalt catchhmhe shall catchwhat is it he catchestrees good thats settled  and three days later without another word exchanged on the subject they started  was she grateful to him no afraid of him no scornful of him not quite but she was afraid of herself horribly how would she ever be able to keep herself in hand how disguise from these people that she loved their boy it was her desperate mood that she feared but since she so much wanted all the best for him that life could give surely she would have the strength to do nothing that might harm him yet she was afraid  he was there at the station to meet them in riding things and a nice rough norfolk jacket that she did not recognize though she thought she knew his clothes by heart and as the train came slowly to a standstill the memory of her last moment with him up in his room amid the luggage that she had helped to pack very nearly overcame her it seemed so hard to have to meet him coldly formally to have to waitwho knew how longfor a minute with him alone and he was so polite so beautifully considerate with all the manners of a host hoping she wasnt tired hoping mr stormer had brought his fishingrod though they had lots of course they could lend him hoping the weather would be fine hoping that they wouldnt mind having to drive three miles and busying himself about their luggage all this when she just wanted to take him in her arms and push his hair back from his forehead and look at him  he did not drive with themhe had thought they would be too crowdedbut followed keeping quite close in the dust to point out the scenery mounted on a palfrey as her husband called the roan with the black swish tail  this countryside so rich and yet a little wild the independentlooking cottages the old dark cosy manorhouse all was very new to one used to oxford and to london and to little else of england and all was delightful even marks guardian seemed to her delightful for gordy when absolutely forced to face an unknown woman could bring to the encounter a certain bluff ingratiation his sister too mrs doone with her faded gentleness seemed soothing  when anna was alone in her room reached by an unexpected little stairway she stood looking at its carved fourposter bed and the wide lattice window with chintz curtains and the flowers in a blue bowl yes all was delightful and yet what was it what had she missed ah she was a fool to fret it was only his anxiety that they should be comfortable his fear that he might betray himself out there those last few dayshis eyes and now she brooded earnestly over what dress she should put on she who tanned so quickly had almost lost her sunburn in the week of travelling and oxford today her eyes looked tired and she was pale she was not going to disdain anything that might help she had reached thirtysix last month and he would be nineteen tomorrow she decided on black in black she knew that her neck looked whiter and the colour of her eyes and hair stranger she put on no jewellery did not even pin a rose at her breast took white gloves since her husband did not come to her room she went up the little stairway to his she surprised him ready dressed standing by the fireplace smiling faintly what was he thinking of standing there with that smile was there blood in him at all  he inclined his head slightly and said  good chaste as the night black suits you shall we find our way down to these savage halls  and they went down  everyone was already there waiting a single neighbouring squire and magistrate by name trusham had been bidden to make numbers equal  dinner was announced they went in at the round table in a diningroom all black oak with many candles and terrible portraits of departed ancestors anna sat between the magistrate and gordy mark was opposite between a quaintlooking old lady and a young girl who had not been introduced a girl in white with very fair hair and very white skin blue eyes and lips a little parted a daughter evidently of the faded mrs doone a girl like a silvery moth like a forgetmenot anna found it hard to take her eyes away from this girls face not that she admired her exactly pretty she wasyes but weak with those parted lips and soft chin and almost wistful look as if her deepblue halfeager eyes were in spite of her but she was youngso young that was why not to watch her seemed impossible sylvia doone indeed yes a soft name a pretty nameand very like her every time her eyes could travel away from her duty to squire trusham and to gordy on both of whom she was clearly making an impression she gazed at this girl sitting there by the boy and whenever those two young things smiled and spoke together she felt her heart contract and hurt her was this why that something had gone out of his eyes ah she was foolish if every girl or woman the boy knew was to cause such a feeling in her what would life be like and her will hardened against her fears she was looking brilliant herself and she saw that the girl in her turn could not help gazing at her eagerly wistfully a little bewilderedhatefully young and the boy slowly surely as a magnet draws anna could feel that she was drawing him could see him stealing chances to look at her once she surprised him full what troubled eyes it was not the old adoring face yet she knew from its expression that she could make him want hermake him jealouseasily fire him with her kisses if she would  and the dinner wore to an end then came the moment when the girl and she must meet under the eyes of the mother and that sharp quaintlooking old governess it would be a hard moment that and it camea hard moment and a long one for gordy sat full span over his wine but anna had not served her time beneath the gaze of upper oxford for nothing she managed to be charming full of interest and questions in her still rather foreign accent miss doonesoon she became sylviamust show her all the treasures and antiquities was it too dark to go out just to look at the old house by night oh no not a bit there were goloshes in the hall and they went the girl leading and talking of anna knew not what so absorbed was she in thinking how for a moment just a moment she could contrive to be with the boy alone  it was not remarkable this old house but it was his homemight some day perhaps be his and houses at night were strangely alive with their window eyes  that is my room the girl said where the jessamine isyou can just see it marks is abovelook under where the eave hangs out away to the left the other night  yes the other night  oh i dont listen thats an owl we have heaps of owls mark likes them i dont much  always mark  hes awfully keen you see about all beasts and birdshe models them shall i show you his workshopits an old greenhouse here you can see in  there through the glass anna indeed could just see the boys quaint creations huddling in the dark on a bare floor a grotesque company of small monsters she murmured  yes i see them but i wont really look unless he brings me himself  oh hes sure to they interest him more than anything in the world  for all her cautious resolutions anna could not for the life of her help saying  what more than you  the girl gave her a wistful stare before she answered  oh i dont count much  anna laughed and took her arm how soft and young it felt a pang went through her heart half jealous half remorseful  do you know she said that you are very sweet  the girl did not answer  are you his cousin  no gordy is only marks uncle by marriage my mother is gordys sisterso im nothing  nothing  i seejust what you english call a connection  they were silent seeming to examine the night then the girl said  i wanted to see you awfully youre not like what i thought  oh and what did you think  i thought you would have dark eyes and venetian red hair and not be quite so tall of course i havent any imagination  they were at the door again when the girl said that and the hall light was falling on her her slip of a white figure showed clear younghow young she looked everything she saidso young  and anna murmured and you aremore than i thought too  just then the men came out from the diningroom her husband with the look on his face that denoted he had been well listened to squire trusham laughing as a man does who has no sense of humour gordy having a curly slightly asphyxiated air and the boy his pale brooding look as though he had lost touch with his surroundings he wavered towards her seemed to lose himself went and sat down by the old governess was it because he did not dare to come up to her or only because he saw the old lady sitting alone it might well be that  and the evening so different from what she had dreamed of closed in squire trusham was gone in his high dogcart with his famous mare whose exploits had entertained her all through dinner her candle had been given her she had said goodnight to all but mark what should she do when she had his hand in hers she would be alone with him in that grasp whose strength no one could see and she did not know whether to clasp it passionately or to let it go coolly back to its owner whether to claim him or to wait but she was unable to help pressing it feverishly at once in his face she saw again that troubled look and her heart smote her she let it go and that she might not see him say goodnight to the girl turned and mounted to her room  fully dressed she flung herself on the bed and there lay her handkerchief across her mouth gnawing at its edges   xv   marks nineteenth birthday rose in grey mist slowly dropped its veil to the grass and shone clear and glistening he woke early from his window he could see nothing in the steep park but the soft bluegrey balloonshaped oaks suspended one above the other among the roundtopped boulders it was in early morning that he always got his strongest feeling of wanting to model things then and after dark when for want of light it was no use this morning he had the craving badly and the sense of not knowing how weighed down his spirit his drawings his modelsthey were all so bad so fumbly if only this had been his twentyfirst birthday and he had his money and could do what he liked he would not stay in england he would be off to athens or rome or even to paris and work till he could do something and in his holidays he would study animals and birds in wild countries where there were plenty of them and you could watch them in their haunts it was stupid having to stay in a place like oxford but at the thought of what oxford meant his roaming fancy like a bird hypnotized by a hawk fluttered stayed suspended and dived back to earth and that feeling of wanting to make things suddenly left him it was as though he had woken up his real self thenlost that self again very quietly he made his way downstairs the garden door was not shuttered not even lockedit must have been forgotten overnight last night he had never thought he would feel like this when she cameso bewildered and confused drawn towards her but by something held back and he felt impatient angry with himself almost with her why could he not be just simply happy as this morning was happy he got his fieldglasses and searched the meadow that led down to the river yes there were several rabbits out with the white marguerites and the dew cobwebs it was all moonflowery and white and the rabbits being there made it perfect he wanted one badly to model from and for a moment was tempted to get his rook riflebut what was the good of a dead rabbitbesides they looked so happy he put the glasses down and went towards his greenhouse to get a drawing block thinking to sit on the wall and make a sort of midsummer nights dream sketch of flowers and rabbits someone was there bending down and doing something to his creatures who had the cheek why it was sylviain her dressinggown he grew hot then cold with anger he could not bear anyone in that holy place it was hateful to have his things even looked at and sheshe seemed to be fingering them he pulled the door open with a jerk and said what are you doing he was indeed so stirred by righteous wrath that he hardly noticed the gasp she gave and the collapse of her figure against the wall she ran past him and vanished without a word he went up to his creatures and saw that she had placed on the head of each one of them a little sprig of jessamine flower why it was idiotic he could see nothing at first but the ludicrousness of flowers on the heads of his beasts then the desperation of this attempt to imagine something graceful something that would give him pleasure touched him for he saw now that this was a birthday decoration from that it was only a second before he was horrified with himself poor little sylvia what a brute he was she had plucked all that jessamine hung out of her window and risked falling to get hold of it and she had woken up early and come down in her dressinggown just to do something that she thought he would like horriblewhat he had done now when it was too late he saw only too clearly her startled white face and quivering lips and the way she had shrunk against the wall how pretty she had looked in her dressinggown with her hair all about her frightened like that he would do anything now to make up to her for having been such a perfect beast the feeling always a little with him that he must look after herdating no doubt from days when he had protected her from the bulls that were not there and the feeling of her being so sweet and decent to him always and some other feeling tooall these suddenly reached poignant climax he simply must make it up to her he ran back into the house and stole upstairs outside her room he listened with all his might but could hear nothing then tapped softly with one nail and putting his mouth to the keyhole whispered sylvia again and again he whispered her name he even tried the handle meaning to open the door an inch but it was bolted once he thought he heard a noise like sobbing and this made him still more wretched at last he gave it up she would not come would not be consoled he deserved it he knew but it was very hard and dreadfully dispirited he went up to his room took a bit of paper and tried to write   dearest sylvia  it was most awfully sweet of you to put your stars on my beasts it was just about the most sweet thing you could have done i am an awful brute but of course if i had only known what you were doing i should have loved it do forgive me i deserve it i knowonly it is my birthday  your sorrowful  mark   he took this down slipped it under her door tapped so that she might notice it and stole away it relieved his mind a little and he went downstairs again  back in the greenhouse sitting on a stool he ruefully contemplated those chapletted beasts they consisted of a crow a sheep a turkey two doves a pony and sundry fragments she had fastened the jessamine sprigs to the tops of their heads by a tiny daub of wet clay and had evidently been surprised trying to put a sprig into the mouth of one of the doves for it hung by a little thread of clay from the beak he detached it and put it in his buttonhole poor little sylvia she took things awfully to heart he would be as nice as ever he could to her all day and balancing on his stool he stared fixedly at the wall against which she had fallen back the line of her soft chin and throat seemed now to be his only memory it was very queer how he could see nothing but that the way the throat moved swallowedso white so soft and he had made it go like that it seemed an unconscionable time till breakfast  as the hour approached he haunted the hall hoping she might be first down at last he heard footsteps and waited hidden behind the door of the empty diningroom lest at sight of him she should turn back he had rehearsed what he was going to dobend down and kiss her hand and say dulcinea del toboso is the most beautiful lady in the world and i the most unfortunate knight upon the earth from his favourite passage out of his favourite book don quixote she would surely forgive him then and his heart would no longer hurt him certainly she could never go on making him so miserable if she knew his feelings she was too soft and gentle for that alas it was not sylvia who came but anna fresh from sleep with her icegreen eyes and bright hair and in sudden strange antipathy to her that strong vivid figure he stood dumb and this first lonely moment which he had so many times in fancy spent locked in her arms passed without even a kiss for quickly one by one the others came but of sylvia only news through mrs doone that she had a headache and was staying in bed her present was on the sideboard a book called sartor resartus markfrom sylvia august 1st 1880 together with gordys cheque mrs doones pearl pin old tingles stones of venice and one other little parcel wrapped in tissuepaperfour ties of varying shades of green red and blue handknitted in silka present of how many hours made short by the thought that he would wear the produce of that clicking he did not fail in outer gratitude but did he realize what had been knitted into those ties not then  birthdays like christmas days were made for disenchantment always the false gaiety of gaiety arrangedalways that pistol to the head confound you enjoy yourself how could he enjoy himself with the thought of sylvia in her room made ill by his brutality the vision of her throat working swallowing her grief haunted him like a little white soft spectre all through the long drive out on to the moor and the picnic in the heather and the long drive homehaunted him so that when anna touched or looked at him he had no spirit to answer no spirit even to try and be with her alone but almost a dread of it instead  and when at last they were at home again and she whispered  what is it what have i done he could only mutter  nothing oh nothing its only that ive been a brute  at that enigmatic answer she might well search his face  is it my husband  he could answer that at all events  oh no  what is it then tell me  they were standing in the inner porch pretending to examine the ancestral chartdotted and starred with dolphins and little fullrigged galleons sailing into harbourswhich always hung just there  tell me mark i dont like to suffer  what could he say since he did not know himself he stammered tried to speak could not get anything out  is it that girl  startled he looked away and said  of course not  she shivered and went into the house but he stayed staring at the chart with a dreadful stirredup feelingof shame and irritation pity impatience fear all mixed what had he done said lost it was that horrid feeling of when one has not been kind and not quite true yet might have been kinder if one had been still less true ah but it was all so mixed up it felt all bleak too and wintry in him as if he had suddenly lost everybodys love then he was conscious of his tutor  ah friend lennanlooking deeply into the past from the less romantic present nice things those old charts the dolphins are extremely jolly  it was difficult to remember not to be illmannered then why did stormer jeer like that he just managed to answer  yes sir i wish we had some now  there are so many moons we wish for lennan and they none of them come tumbling down  the voice was almost earnest and the boys resentment fled he felt sorry but why he did not know  in the meantime he heard his tutor say let us dress for dinner  when he came down to the drawingroom anna in her moonlightcoloured frock was sitting on the sofa talking tosylvia he kept away from them they could neither of them want him but it did seem odd to him who knew not too much concerning women that she could be talking so gaily when only half an hour ago she had said is it that girl  he sat next her at dinner again it was puzzling that she should be laughing so serenely at gordys stories did the whispering in the porch then mean nothing and sylvia would not look at him he felt sure that she turned her eyes away simply because she knew he was going to look in her direction and this roused in him a sore feelingeverything that night seemed to rouse that feelingof injustice he was cast out and he could not tell why he had not meant to hurt either of them why should they both want to hurt him so and presently there came to him a feeling that he did not care let them treat him as they liked there were other things besides love if they did not want himhe did not want them and he hugged this reckless unhappy dontcare feeling to him with all the abandonment of youth  but even birthdays come to an end and moods and feelings that seem so desperately real die in the unreality of sleep   xvi   if to the boy that birthday was all bewildered disillusionment to anna it was verily slow torture she found no relief in thinking that there were things in life other than love but next morning brought readjustment a sense of yesterdays extravagance a renewal of hope impossible surely that in one short fortnight she had lost what she had made so sure of she had only to be resolute only to grasp firmly what was hers after all these empty years was she not to have her hour to sit still meekly and see it snatched from her by a slip of a soft girl a thousand times no and she watched her chance she saw him about noon sally forth towards the river with his rod she had to wait a little for gordy and his bailiff were down there by the tennis lawn but they soon moved on she ran out then to the park gate once through that she felt safe her husband she knew was working in his room the girl somewhere invisible the old governess still at her housekeeping mrs doone writing letters she felt full of hope and courage this old wild tangle of a park that she had not yet seen was beautifula true trystingplace for fauns and nymphs with its mossy trees and boulders and the high bracken she kept along under the wall in the direction of the river but came to no gate and began to be afraid that she was going wrong she could hear the river on the other side and looked for some place where she could climb and see exactly where she was an old ashtree tempted her scrambling up into its fork she could just see over there was the little river within twenty yards its clear dark water running between thick foliage on its bank lay a huge stone balanced on another stone still more huge and with his back to this stone stood the boy his rod leaning beside him and there on the ground her arms resting on her knees her chin on her hands that girl sat looking up how eager his eyes nowhow different from the brooding eyes of yesterday  so you see that was all you might forgive me sylvia  and to anna it seemed verily as if those two young faces formed suddenly but onethe face of youth  if she had stayed there looking for all time she could not have had graven on her heart a vision more indelible vision of spring of all that was gone from her for ever she shrank back out of the fork of the old ashtree and like a stricken beast went hurrying stumbling away amongst the stones and bracken she ran thus perhaps a quarter of a mile then threw up her arms fell down amongst the fern and lay there on her face at first her heart hurt her so that she felt nothing but that physical pain if she could have died but she knew it was nothing but breathlessness it left her and that which took its place she tried to drive away by pressing her breast against the ground by clutching the stalks of the brackenan ache an emptiness too dreadful youth to youth he was gone from herand she was alone again she did not cry what good in crying but gusts of shame kept sweeping through her shame and rage so this was all she was worth the sun struck hot on her back in that lair of tangled fern where she had fallen she felt faint and sick she had not known till now quite what this passion for the boy had meant to her how much of her very belief in herself was bound up with it how much clinging to her own youth what bitterness one soft slip of a white girlone young thingand she had become as nothing but was that true could she not even now wrench him back to her with the passion that this child knew nothing of surely oh surely let him but once taste the rapture she could give him and at that thought she ceased clutching at the bracken stalks lying as still as the very stones around her could she not might she not even now and all feeling except just a sort of quivering deserted heras if she had fallen into a trance why spare this girl why falter she was first he had been hers out there and she still had the power to draw him at dinner the first evening she had dragged his gaze to her away from that girlaway from youth as a magnet draws steel she could still bind him with chains that for a little while at all events he would not want to break bind him hateful word take him hankering after what she could not give himyouth white innocence spring it would be infamous infamous she sprang up from the fern and ran along the hillside not looking where she went stumbling among the tangled growth in and out of the boulders till she once more sank breathless on to a stone it was bare of trees just here and she could see across the river valley the high larchcrowned tor on the far side the sky was clearthe sun bright a hawk was wheeling over that hill far up very near the blue infamous she could not do that could not drug him drag him to her by his senses by all that was least high in him when she wished for him all the finest things that life could give as if she had been his mother she could not it would be wicked in that moment of intense spiritual agony those two down there in the sun by the grey stone and the dark water seemed guarded from her protected the girls white flowerface trembling up the boys gaze leaping down strange that a heart which felt that could hate at the same moment that flowerface and burn to kill with kisses that eagerness in the boys eyes the storm in her slowly passed and she prayed just to feel nothing it was natural that she should lose her hour natural that her thirst should go unslaked and her passion never bloom natural that youth should go to youth this boy to his own kind by the law oflove the breeze blowing down the valley fanned her cheeks and brought her a faint sensation of relief nobility was it just a word or did those that gave up happiness feel noble  she wandered for a long time in the park not till late afternoon did she again pass out by the gate through which she had entered full of hope she met no one before she reached her room and there to be safe took refuge in her bed she dreaded only lest the feeling of utter weariness should leave her she wanted no vigour of mind or body till she was away from here she meant neither to eat nor drink only to sleep if she could tomorrow if there were any early train she could be gone before she need see anyone her husband must arrange as to what he would think and she could saytime enough to decide that and what did it matter the one vital thing now was not to see the boy for she could not again go through hours of struggle like those she rang the bell and sent the startled maid with a message to her husband and while she waited for him to come her pride began revolting she must not let him see that would be horrible and slipping out of bed she got a handkerchief and the eaudecologne flask and bandaged her forehead he came almost instantly entering in his quick noiseless way and stood looking at her he did not ask what was the matter but simply waited and never before had she realized so completely how he began as it were where she left off began on a plane from which instinct and feeling were as carefully ruled out as though they had been blasphemous she summoned all her courage and said i went into the park the sun must have been too hot i should like to go home tomorrow if you dont mind i cant bear not feeling well in other peoples houses  she was conscious of a smile flickering over his face then it grew grave  ah he said yes the sun a touch of that will last some days will you be fit to travel though  she had a sudden conviction that he knew all about it but thatsince to know all about it was to feel himself ridiculoushe had the power of making himself believe that he knew nothing was this fine of him or was it hateful  she closed her eyes and said  my head is bad but i shall be able only i dont want a fuss made could we go by a train before they are down  she heard him say  yes that will have its advantages  there was not the faintest sound now but of course he was still there in that dumb motionless presence was all her future yes that would be her futurea thing without feeling and without motion a fearful curiosity came on her to look at it she opened her gaze he was still standing just as he had been his eyes fixed on her but one hand on the edge of his coat pocketout of the picture as it werewas nervously closing and unclosing and suddenly she felt pity not for her futurewhich must be like that but for him how dreadful to have grown so that all emotion was exiledhow dreadful and she said gently  i am sorry harold  as if he had heard something strange and startling his eyes dilated in a curious way he buried that nervous hand in his pocket turned and went out   xvii   when young mark came on sylvia by the loganstone it was less surprising to him than if he had not known she was therehaving watched her go she was sitting all humped together brooding over the water her sunbonnet thrown back and that hair in which his star had caught shining faintgold under the sun he came on her softly through the grass and when he was a little way off thought it best to halt if he startled her she might run away and he would not have the heart to follow how still she was lost in her brooding he wished he could see her face he spoke at last gently  sylvia would you mind  and seeing that she did not move he went up to her surely she could not still be angry with him  thanks most awfully for that book you gave meit looks splendid  she made no answer and leaning his rod against the stone he sighed that silence of hers seemed to him unjust what was it she wanted him to say or do life was not worth living if it was to be all bottled up like this  i never meant to hurt you i hate hurting people its only that my beasts are so badi cant bear people to see themespecially youi want to please youi do really so you see that was all you might forgive me sylvia  something over the wall a rustling a scattering in the ferndeer no doubt and again he said eagerly softly  you might be nice to me sylvia you really might  very quickly turning her head away she said  it isnt that any more itsits something else  what else  nothingonly that i dont countnow  he knelt down beside her what did she mean but he knew well enough  of course you count most awfully oh dont be unhappy i hate people being unhappy dont be unhappy sylvia and he began gently to stroke her arm it was all strange and troubled within him one thing only plainhe must not admit anything as if reading that thought her blue eyes seemed suddenly to search right into him then she pulled some blades of grass and began plaiting them  she counts  ah he was not going to say she doesnt it would be caddish to say that even if she didnt countdid she stillit would be mean and low and in his eyes just then there was the look that had made his tutor compare him to a lion cub in trouble  sylvia was touching his arm  mark  yes  dont  he got up and took his rod what was the use he could not stay there with her since he could notmust not speak  are you going  yes  are you angry please dont be angry with me  he felt a choke in his throat bent down to her hand and kissed it then shouldered his rod and marched away looking back once he saw her still sitting there gazing after him forlorn by that great stone it seemed to him then there was nowhere he could go nowhere except among the birds and beasts and trees who did not mind even if you were all mixed up and horrible inside he lay down in the grass on the bank he could see the tiny trout moving round and round the stones swallows came all about him flying very low a hornet too bore him company for a little but he could take interest in nothing it was as if his spirit were in prison it would have been nice indeed to be that water never staying passing passing or wind touching everything never caught to be able to do nothing without hurting someonethat was what was so ghastly if only one were like a flower that just sprang up and lived its life all to itself and died but whatever he did or said now would be like telling lies or else being cruel the only thing was to keep away from people and yet how keep away from his own guests  he went back to the house for lunch but both those guests were out no one seemed quite to know where restless unhappy puzzled he wandered round and about all the afternoon just before dinner he was told of mrs stormers not being well and that they would be leaving tomorrow goingafter three days that plunged him deeper into his strange and sorrowful confusion he was reduced now to a complete brooding silence he knew he was attracting attention but could not help it several times during dinner he caught gordys eyes fixed on him from under those puffy halfclosed lids with asphyxiated speculation but he simply could not talkeverything that came into his mind to say seemed false ah it was a sad eveningwith its glimmering vision into anothers sore heart its confused gnawing sense of things broken faith betrayed and yet always the perplexed wonderhow could i have helped it and always sylvias wistful face that he tried not to look at  he stole out leaving gordy and his tutor still over their wine and roamed about the garden a long time listening sadly to the owls it was a blessing to get upstairs though of course he would not sleep  but he did sleep all through a night of many dreams in the last of which he was lying on a mountain side anna looking down into his eyes and bending her face to his he woke just as her lips touched him still under the spell of that troubling dream he became conscious of the sound of wheels and horses hoofs on the gravel and sprang out of bed there was the waggonette moving from the door old godden driving luggage piled up beside him and the stormers sitting opposite each other in the carriage going away like thathaving never even said goodbye for a moment he felt as people must when they have unwittingly killed someoneutterly stunned and miserable then he dashed into his clothes he would not let her go thus he wouldhe mustsee her again what had he done that she should go like this he rushed downstairs the hall was empty nineteen minutes to eight the train left at eight oclock had he time to saddle bolero he rushed round to the stables but the cob was out being shoed he wouldhe must get there in time it would show her anyway that he was not quite a cad he walked till the drive curved then began running hard a quarter of a mile and already he felt better not so miserable and guilty it was something to feel you had a tough job in hand all your work cut outsomething to have to think of economizing strength picking out the best going keeping out of the sun saving your wind uphill flying down any slope it was cool still and the dew had laid the dust there was no traffic and scarcely anyone to look back and gape as he ran by what he would do if he got there in timehow explain this mad threemile runhe did not think he passed a farm that he knew was just halfway he had left his watch indeed he had put on only his trousers shirt and norfolk jacket no tie no hat not even socks under his tennis shoes and he was as hot as fire with his hair flying backa strange young creature indeed for anyone to meet but he had lost now all feeling save the will to get there a flock of sheep came out of a field into the lane he pushed through them somehow but they lost him several seconds more than a mile still and he was blown and his legs beginning to give downhill indeed they went of their own accord but there was the long runin quite level and he could hear the train now slowly puffing its way along the valley then in spite of exhaustion his spirit rose he would not go in looking like a scarecrow utterly done and make a scene he must pull himself together at the end and stroll inas if he had come for fun but howseeing that at any moment he felt he might fall flat in the dust and stay there for ever and as he ran he made little desperate efforts to mop his face and brush his clothes there were the gates at lasttwo hundred yards away the train he could hear no longer it must be standing in the station and a sob came from his overdriven lungs he heard the guards whistle as he reached the gates instead of making for the bookingoffice he ran along the paling where an entrance to the goodsshed was open and dashing through he fell back against the honeysuckle the engine was just abreast of him he snatched at his sleeve and passed it over his face to wipe the sweat away everything was blurred he must seesurely he had not come in time just not to see he pushed his hands over his forehead and hair and spied up dizzily at the slowly passing train she was there at a window standing looking out he dared not step forward for fear of falling but he put out his handshe saw him yes she saw him wasnt she going to make a sign not one and suddenly he saw her tear at her dress pluck something out and throw it it fell close to his feet he did not pick it uphe wanted to see her face till she was gone it looked wonderfulvery proud and pale she put her hand up to her lips then everything went blurred again and when he could see once more the train had vanished but at his feet was what she had thrown he picked it up all dry and dark it was the flower she had given him in the tyrol and stolen back from his buttonhole  creeping out past the goodsshed he made his way to a field and lay down with his face pressed to that withered thing which still had its scent   the asphyxiated speculation in his guardians eyes had not been without significance mark did not go back to oxford he went instead to rometo live in his sisters house and attend a school of sculpture that was the beginning of a time when nothing counted except his work  to anna he wrote twice but received no answer from his tutor he had one little note   my dear lennan  so you abandon us for art ah wellit was your moon if i rememberone of them a worthy moona little dusty in these daysa little in her declinebut to you no doubt a virgin goddess whose hem etc  we shall retain the friendliest memories of you in spite of your defection  once your tutor and still your friend  harold stormer   after that vacation it was longvery long before he saw sylvia again     part iisummer   i   gleam of a thousand lights clack and mutter of innumerable voices laughter footsteps hiss and rumble of passing trains taking gamblers back to nice or mentone fevered wailing from the violins of four fiddlers with darkwhite skins outside the cafe and above around beyond the dark sky and the dark mountains and the dark sea like some great dark flower to whose heart is clinging a jewelled beetle so was monte carlo on that may night of 1887  but mark lennan at one of the little marbletopped tables was in too great maze and exaltation of spirit and of senses to be conscious of its glare and babel even of its beauty he sat so very still that his neighbours with the instinctive aversion of the human creature to what is too remote from its own mood after one good stare turned their eyes away as from something ludicrous almost offensive  he was lost indeed in memory of the minutes just gone by for it had come at last after all these weeks of ferment after all this strange time of perturbation  very stealthily it had been creeping on him ever since that chance introduction nearly a year ago soon after he settled down in london following those six years of rome and paris first the merest friendliness because she was so nice about his work then respectful admiration because she was so beautiful then pity because she was so unhappy in her marriage if she had been happy he would have fled the knowledge that she had been unhappy long before he knew her had kept his conscience still and at last one afternoon she said ah if you come out there too marvelously subtle the way that one little outslipped saying had worked in him as though it had a life of its ownlike a strange bird that had flown into the garden of his heart and established itself with its new song and flutterings its new flight its wistful and ever clearer call that and one moment a few days later in her london drawingroom when he had told her that he was coming and she did not could not he felt look at him queer that nothing momentous said doneor even left undonehad altered all the future  and so she had gone with her uncle and aunt under whose wing one might be sure she would meet with no wayward or exotic happenings and he had received from her this little letter   hotel coeur dor  monte carlo  my dear mark  weve arrived it is so good to be in the sun the flowers are wonderful i am keeping gorbio and roquebrune till you come  your friend  olive cramier   that letter was the single clear memory he had of the time between her going and his following he received it one afternoon sitting on an old low garden wall with the spring sun shining on him through appletrees in blossom and a feeling as if all the desire of the world lay before him and he had but to stretch out his arms to take it  then confused unrest all things vague till at the end of his journey he stepped out of the train at beaulieu with a furiously beating heart but why surely he had not expected her to come out from monte carlo to meet him  a week had gone by since then in one long effort to be with her and appear to others as though he did not greatly wish to be two concerts two walks with her alone when all that he had said seemed as nothing said and all her sayings but ghosts of what he wished to hear a week of confusion day and night until a few minutes ago her handkerchief had fallen from her glove on to the dusty road and he had picked it up and put it to his lips nothing could take away the look she had given him then nothing could ever again separate her from him utterly she had confessed in it to the same sweet fearful trouble that he himself was feeling she had not spoken but he had seen her lips part her breast rise and fall and he had not spoken what was the use of words  he felt in the pocket of his coat there against his fingers was that wisp of lawn and lace soft yet somehow alive and stealthily he took it out the whole of her with her fragrance seemed pressed to his face in the touch of that lawn border roughened by little white stars more secretly than ever he put it back and for the first time looked round these people they belonged to a world that he had left they gave him the same feeling that her uncle and aunt had given him just now when they said goodnight following her into their hotel that good colonel that good mrs ercott the very concretion of the world he had been brought up in of the english point of view symbolic figures of health reason and the straight path on which at that moment seemingly he had turned his back the colonels profile ruddy through its tan with grey moustache guiltless of any wax his cheery highpitched goodnight young lennan his wifes curly smile her flat cosy confidential voicehow strange and remote they had suddenly become and all these people here chattering drinkinghow queer and far away or was it just that he was queer and remote to them  and getting up from his table he passed the fiddlers with the darkwhite skins out into the place   ii   he went up the side streets to the back of her hotel and stood by the railings of the gardenone of those hotel gardens which exist but to figure in advertisements with its few arid palms its paths staring white between them and a fringe of dusty lilacs and mimosas  and there came to him the oddest feelingthat he had been there before peering through blossoms at those staring paths and shuttered windows a scent of woodsmoke was abroad and some dry plant rustled ever so faintly in what little wind was stirring what was there of memory in this night this garden some dark sweet thing invisible to feel whose presence was at once ecstasy and the irritation of a thirst that will not be quenched  and he walked on houses houses at last he was away from them alone on the high road beyond the limits of monaco and walking thus through the night he had thoughts that he imagined no one had ever had before him the knowledge that she loved him had made everything seem very sacred and responsible whatever he did he must not harm her women were so helpless  for in spite of six years of art in rome and paris he still had a fastidious reverence for women if she had loved her husband she would have been safe enough from him but to be bound to a companionship that she gave unwillinglythis had seemed to him atrocious even before he loved her how could any husband ask that have so little prideso little pity the unpardonable thing what was there to respect in such a marriage only he must not do her harm but now that her eyes had said i love youwhat then it was simply miraculous to know that under the stars of this warm southern night burning its incense of trees and flowers  climbing up above the road he lay down if only she were there beside him the fragrance of the earth not yet chilled crept to his face and for just a moment it seemed to him that she did come if he could keep her there for ever in that embrace that was no embracein that ghostly rapture on this wild fragrant bed that no lovers before had ever pressed save the creeping things and the flowers save sunlight and moonlight with their shadows and the wind kissing the earth     then she was gone his hands touched nothing but the crumbled pine dust and the flowers of the wild thyme fallen into sleep  he stood on the edge of the little cliff above the road between the dark mountains and the sea black with depth too late for any passerby as far from what men thought and said and did as the very night itself with its whispering warmth and he conjured up her face making certain of itthe eyes clear and brown and wide apart the close sweet mouth the dark hair the whole flying loveliness  then he leaped down into the road and ranone could not walk feeling this miracle that no one had ever felt before the miracle of love   iii   in their most reputable hotel le coeur dor long since remodelled and renamed mrs ercott lay in her brassbound bed looking by starlight at the colonel in his brassbound bed her ears were carefully freed from the pressure of her pillow for she thought she heard a mosquito companion for thirty years to one whose life had been feverishly punctuated by the attentions of those little beasts she had no love for them it was the one subject on which perhaps her imagination was stronger than her common sense for in fact there was not and could not be a mosquito since the first thing the colonel did on arriving at any place farther south than parallel 46 of latitude was to open the windows very wide and nail with many tiny tacks a piece of mosquito netting across that refreshing space while she held him firmly by the coattails the fact that other people did not so secure their windows did not at all trouble the colonel a true englishman who loved to act in his own way and to think in the ways of other people after that they would wait till night came then burn a peculiar little lamp with a peculiar little smell and in the full glare of the gaslight stand about on chairs with slippers and their eyes fixed on true or imaginary beasts then would fall little slaps making little messes and little joyous or doleful cries would arise ive got that one oh john i missed him and in the middle of the room the colonel in pyjamas and spectacles only worn in very solemn moments low down on his nose would revolve slowly turning his eyes with that look in them of outfacing death which he had so long acquired on every inch of wall and ceiling till at last he would say well dolly thats the lot at which she would say give me a kiss dear and he would kiss her and get into his bed  there was then no mosquito save that general ghost of him which lingered in the mind of one devoted to her husband spying out his profile for he was lying on his back she refrained from saying john are you awake a whiffling sound was coming from a nose to whichoriginally straightattention to military duties had given a slight crook half an inch below the level of grizzled eyebrows raised a little as though surprised at the sounds beneath she could hardly see him but she thought how good he looks and in fact he did it was the face of a man incapable of evil having in its sleep the candour of one at heart a childthat simple candour of those who have never known how to seek adventures of the mind and have always sought adventures of the body then somehow she did say  john are you asleep  the colonel instantly alive as at some oldtime attack answered  yes  that poor young man  which  mark lennan havent you seen  what  my dear it was under your nose but you never do see these things  the colonel slowly turned his head his wife was an imaginative woman she had always been so dimly he perceived that something romantic was about to come from her but with that almost professional gentleness of a man who has cut the heads and arms off people in his time he answered  what things  he picked up her handkerchief  whose  olives he put it in his pocket i distinctly saw him  there was silence then mrs ercotts voice rose again impersonal far away  what always astonishes me about young people is the way they think theyre not seenpoor dears  still there was silence  john are you thinking  for a considerable sound of breathing not mere whiffling now was coming from the colonelto his wife a sure sign  and indeed he was thinking dolly was an imaginative woman but something told him that in this case she might not be riding past the hounds  mrs ercott raised herself he looked more good than ever a little perplexed frown had climbed up with his eyebrows and got caught in the wrinkles across his forehead  im very fond of olive he said  mrs ercott fell back on her pillows in her heart there was just that little soreness natural to a woman over fifty whose husband has a niece  no doubt she murmured  something vague moved deep down in the colonel he stretched out his hand in that strip of gloom between the beds it encountered another hand which squeezed it rather hard  he said look here old girl and there was silence  mrs ercott in her turn was thinking her thoughts were flat and rapid like her voice but had that sort of sentiment which accompanies the mental exercise of women with good hearts poor young man and poor olive but was a woman ever to be pitied when she was so pretty as that besides when all was said and done she had a finelooking man for husband in parliament with a career and fond of herdecidedly and their little house in london so close to westminster was a distinct dear and nothing could be more charming than their cottage by the river was olive then to be pitied and yetshe was not happy it was no good pretending that she was happy all very well to say that such things were within ones control but if you read novels at all you knew they werent there was such a thing as incompatibility oh yes and there was the matter of difference in their ages olive was twentysix robert cramier fortytwo and now this young mark lennan was in love with her what if she were in love with him john would realize then perhaps that the young flew to the young for meneven the best like john were funny she would never dream of feeling for any of her nephews as john clearly felt for olive  the colonels voice broke in on her thoughts  nice young fellowlennan great pity better sheer offif hes getting  and rather suddenly she answered  suppose he cant  cant  did you never hear of a grande passion  the colonel rose on his elbow this was another of those occasions that showed him how during the later years of his service in madras and upper burmah when dollys health had not been equal to the heat she had picked up in london a queer way of looking at thingsas if they were notnot so right or wrong asas he felt them to be and he repeated those two french words in his own way adding  isnt that just what im saying the sooner he stands clear the better  but mrs ercott too sat up  be human she said  the colonel experienced the same sensation as when one suddenly knows that one is not digesting food because young lennan was in danger of getting into a dishonourable fix he was told to be human really dolly was the white blur of her new boudoir cap suddenly impinged on his consciousness surely she was not gettingunenglish at her time of life  im thinking of olive he said i dont want her worried with that sort of thing  perhaps olive can manage for herself in these days it doesnt do to interfere with love  love muttered the colonel what phew  if ones own wife called thisthis sort ofthing lovethen why had he been faithful to herin very hot climatesall these years a sense of waste and of injustice tried to rear its head against all the side of him that attached certain meanings to certain words and acted up to them and this revolt gave him a feeling strange and so unpleasant love it was not a word to use thus loosely love led to marriage this could not lead to marriage except throughthe divorce court and suddenly the colonel had a vision of his dead brother lindsay olives father standing there in the dark with his grave clearcut ivorypale face under the black hair supposed to be derived from a french ancestress who had escaped from the massacre of st bartholomew upright fellow always lindsayeven before he was made bishop queer somehow that olive should be his daughter not that she was not upright not at all but she was soft lindsay was not imagine him seeing that young fellow putting her handkerchief in his pocket but had young lennan really done such a thing dolly was imaginative he had mistaken it probably for his own if he had chanced to blow his nose he would have realized for coupled with the almost childlike candour of his mind the colonel had real administrative vigour a true sense of practical values an ounce of illustration was always worth to him a pound of theory dolly was given to riding off on theories thank god she never acted on em  he said gently  my dear young lennan may be an artist and all that but hes a gentleman i know old heatherley his guardian why i introduced him to olive myself  what has that to do with it hes in love with her  one of the countless legion that hold a creed taken at face value into whose roots and reasons they have never dreamed of going the colonel was staggered like some native on an island surrounded by troubled seas which he has stared at with a certain contemptuous awe all his life but never entered he was disconcerted by thus being asked to leave the shore and by his own wife  indeed mrs ercott had not intended to go so far but there was in her as in all women whose minds are more active than their husbands a something worrying her always to go a little farther than she meant with real compunction she heard the colonel say  i must get up and drink some water  she was out of bed in a moment not without boiling  she had seriously troubled him then now he would not sleepthe blood went to his head so quickly he would just lie awake trying not to disturb her she could not bear him not to disturb her it seemed so selfish of her she ought to have known that the whole subject was too dangerous to discuss at night  she became conscious that he was standing just behind her his figure in its thin covering looked very lean his face strangely worn  im sorry you put that idea into my head he said im fond of olive  again mrs ercott felt that jealous twinge soon lost this time in the motherliness of a childless woman for her husband he must not be troubled he should not be troubled and she said  the waters boiling now sip a good glass slowly and get into bed or ill take your temperature  obediently the colonel took from her the glass and as he sipped she put her hand up and stroked his head   iv   in the room below them the subject of their discussion was lying very wide awake she knew that she had betrayed herself made plain to mark lennan what she had never until now admitted to herself but the lovelook which for the life of her she could not keep back had been followed by a feeling of having lost caste for hitherto the world of women had been strictly divided by her into those who did and those who did not do such things and to be no longer quite sure to which half she belonged was frightening but what was the good of thinking of being frightenedit could not lead to anything yesterday she had not known this would come and now she could not guess at tomorrow tonight was enough tonight with its swimming loveliness just to feel to love and to be loved  a new sensation for heras different from those excited by the courtships of her girlhood or by her marriage as light from darkness for she had never been in love not even with her husband she knew it now the sun was shining in a world where she had thought there was none nothing could come of it but the sun was shining and in that sunshine she must warm herself a little  quite simply she began to plan what he and she would do there were six days left they had not yet been to gorbio nor to castellarnone of those long walks or rides they had designed to do for the beauty of them would he come early tomorrow what could they do together no one should know what these six days would be to hernot even he to be with him watch his face hear his voice and now and then just touch him she could trust herself to show no one and then it would beover though of course she would see him again in london  and lying there in the dark she thought of their first meeting one sunday morning in hyde park the colonel religiously observed church parade and would even come all the way down to westminster from his flat near knightsbridge in order to fetch his niece up to it she remembered how during their stroll he had stopped suddenly in front of an old gentleman with a puffy yellow face and eyes half open  ah mr heatherleyyou up from devonshire hows your nephewtheersculptor  and the old gentleman glaring a little as it seemed to her from under his eyelids and his grey top hat had answered colonel ercott i think heres the fellow himselfmark and a young man had taken off his hat she had only noticed at first that his dark hair grewnot longbut very thick and that his eyes were very deepset then she saw him smile it made his face all eager yet left it shy and she decided that he was nice soon after she had gone with the ercotts to see his things for it was of course and especially in those days quite an event to know a sculptorrather like having a zebra in your park the colonel had been delighted and a little relieved to find that the things were nearly all of beasts and birds very interestin to one full of curious lore about such having in his time killed many of them and finding himself at the end of it with a curious aversion to killing any morewhich he never put into words  acquaintanceship had ripened fast after that first visit to his studio and now it was her turn to be relieved that mark lennan devoted himself almost entirely to beasts and birds instead of to the human form socalled divine ah yesshe would have suffered now that she loved him she saw that at all events she could watch his work and help it with sympathy that could not be wrong  she fell asleep at last and dreamed that she was in a boat alone on the river near her country cottage drifting along among spiky flowers like asphodels with birds singing and flying round her she could move neither face nor limbs but that helpless feeling was not unpleasant till she became conscious that she was drawing nearer and nearer to what was neither water nor land light nor darkness but simply some unutterable feeling and then she saw gazing at her out of the rushes on the banks a great bull head it moved as she movedit was on both sides of her yet all the time only one head she tried to raise her hands and cover her eyes but could notand woke with a sob it was light  nearly six oclock already her dream made her disinclined to trust again to sleep sleep was a robber nowof each minute of these few days she got up and looked out the morning was fine the air warm already sweet with dew and heliotrope nailed to the wall outside her window she had but to open her shutters and walk into the sun she dressed took her sunshade stealthily slipped the shutters back and stole forth shunning the hotel garden where the eccentricity of her early wandering might betray the condition of her spirit she passed through into the road toward the casino without perhaps knowing it she was making for where she had sat with him yesterday afternoon listening to the band hatless but defended by her sunshade she excited the admiration of the few connoisseurs as yet abroad strolling in blue blouses to their labours and this simple admiration gave her pleasure for once she was really conscious of the grace in her own limbs actually felt the gentle vividness of her own face with its nearly black hair and eyes and creamy skinstrange sensation and very comforting  in the casino gardens she walked more slowly savouring the aromatic trees and stopping to bend and look at almost every flower then on the seat where she had sat with him yesterday she rested a few paces away were the steps that led to the railwaystation trodden upwards eagerly by so many day after day night after night and lightly or sorrowfully descended above her two pines a peppertree and a palm mingled their shadeso fantastic the jumbling of trees and souls in this strange place she furled her sunshade and leaned back her gaze free and friendly passed from bough to bough against the bright sky unbesieged as yet by heat or dust they had a spiritual look lying sharp and flat along the air she plucked a cluster of pinkish berries from the peppertree crushing and rubbing them between her hands to get their fragrance all these beautiful and sweet things seemed to be a part of her joy at being loved part of this sudden summer in her heart the sky the flowers that jewel of greenblue sea the bright acacias were nothing in the world but love  and those few who passed and saw her sitting there under the peppertree wondered no doubt at the stillness of this dame bien mise who had risen so early   v   in the small hours which so many wish were smaller the colonel had awakened with the affair of the handkerchief swelling visibly his nieces husband was not a man that he had much liking fora taciturn fellow with possibly a bit of the brute in him a man who rather rode people down but since dolly and he were in charge of olive the notion that young lennan was falling in love with her under their very noses was alarming to one naturally punctilious it was not until he fell asleep again and woke in full morning light that the remedy occurred to him she must be taken out of herself dolly and he had been slack too interested in this queer place this queer lot of people they had neglected her left her to   boys and girlsone ought always to remember but it was not too late she was old lindsays daughter would not forget herself poor old lindsayfine fellow bit too much perhaps of thehuguenot in him queer those throwbacks had noticed in horses time and againwhite hairs about the tail carriage of the headskip generations and then pop out and olive had something of his lookthe same ivory skin same colour of eyes and hair only she was not severe like her father not exactly and once more there shot through the colonel a vague dread as of a trusteeship neglected it disappeared however in his bath  he was out before eight oclock a thin upright figure in hard straw hat and grey flannel clothes walking with the indescribable loose poise of the soldier englishman with that air different from the french german what not because of shoulders ever asserting through their drill the right to put on mufti with that perfectly quiet and modest air of knowing that whatever might be said there was only one way of wearing clothes and moving legs and as he walked he smoothed his drooping grey moustache considering how best to take his niece out of herself he passed along by the terrace and stood for a moment looking down at the sea beyond the pigeonshooting ground then he moved on round under the casino into the gardens at the back a beautiful spot wonderful care they had taken with the plants it made him think a little of tushawore where his old friend the rajahprecious old rascalhad gardens to his palace rather like these he paced again to the front it was nice and quiet in the early mornings with the sea down there and nobody trying to get the better of anybody else there were fellows never happy unless they were doing someone in the eye he had known men who would ride at the devil himself make it a point of honour to swindle a friend out of a few pounds odd place this montesort of a garden of eden gone wrong and all the real but quite inarticulate love of nature which had supported the colonel through deserts and jungles on transports at sea and in mountain camps awoke in the sweetness of these gardens his dear mother he had never forgotten the words with which she had shown him the sunset through the coppice down at old withes norton when he was nine years old that is beauty jack do you feel it darling he had not felt it at the timenot he a thickheaded scampering youngster even when he first went to india he had had no eye for a sunset the rising generation were different that young couple for instance under the peppertree sitting there without a word just looking at the trees how long he wondered had they been sitting like that and suddenly something in the colonel leaped his steelcoloured eyes took on their look of outfacing death choking down a cough he faced about back to where he had stood above the pigeonshooting ground olive and that young fellow an assignation at this time in the morning the earth reeled his brothers childhis favourite niece the woman whom he most admiredthe woman for whom his heart was softest leaning over the stone parapet no longer seeing either the smooth green of the pigeonshooting ground or the smooth blue of the sea beyond he was moved distressed bewildered beyond words before breakfast that was the devil of it confession as it were of everything moreover he had seen their hands touching on the seat the blood rushed up to his face he had seen spied out what was not intended for his eyes nice positionthat dolly too last night had seen but that was different women might see thingsit was expected of them but for a manaa gentleman the fullness of his embarrassment gradually disclosed itself his hands were tied could he even consult dolly he had a feeling of isolation of utter solitude nobodynot anybody in the worldcould understand his secret and intense discomfort to take up a positionthe position he was bound to take up as olives nearest relative and protector andwhat was itchaperon by the aid of knowledge come at in such a way however unintentionally never in all his days in the regimentand many delicate matters affecting honour had come his wayhad he had a thing like this to deal with poor child but he had no business to think of her like that no indeed she had not behavedasand there he paused curiously unable to condemn her suppose they got up and came that way  he took his hands off the stone parapet and made for his hotel his palms were white from the force of his grip he said to himself as he went along i must consider the whole question calmly i must think it out this gave him relief with young lennan at all events he could be angry but even there he found to his dismay no finality of judgment and this absence of finality so unwonted distressed him horribly there was something in the way the young man had been sitting there beside herso quiet so almost timidthat had touched him this was bad by jovevery bad the two of them they made somehow a nice couple confound it this would not do the chaplain of the little english church passing at this moment called out fine morning colonel ercott the colonel saluted and did not answer the greeting at the moment seemed to him paltry no morning could be fine that contained such a discovery he entered the hotel passed into the diningroom and sat down nobody was there they all had their breakfast upstairs even dolly olive alone was in the habit of supporting him while he ate an english breakfast and suddenly he perceived that he was face to face already with this dreadful situation to have breakfast without as usual waiting for her seemed too pointed she might be coming in at any minute now to wait for her and have it without showing anythinghow could he do that  he was conscious of a faint rustling behind him there she was and nothing decided in this moment of hopeless confusion the colonel acted by pure instinct rose patted her cheek and placed a chair  well my dear he said hungry  she was looking very dainty very soft that creamy dress showed off her dark hair and eyes which seemed somehow to beflying off somewhere yesit was queer but that was the only way to put it he got no reassurance no comfort from the sight of her and slowly he stripped the skin from the banana with which he always commenced breakfast one might just as well be asked to shoot a tame dove or tear a pretty flower to pieces as be expected to take her to task even if he could in honour and he sought refuge in the words  been out then could have bitten his tongue off suppose she answered no  but she did not so answer the colour came into her cheeks indeed but she nodded its so lovely  how pretty she looked saying that he had put himself out of court nowcould never tell her what he had seen after setting as it were that trap for her and presently he asked  got any plans today  she answered without flinching in the least  mark lennan and i were going to take mules from mentone up to gorbio  he was amazed at her steadinessnever to his knowledge having encountered a woman armoured at every point to preserve a love that flies against the world how tell what was under her smile and in confusion of feeling that amounted almost to pain he heard her say  will you and aunt dolly come  between sense of trusteeship and hatred of spoiling sport between knowledge of the danger she was in and halfpitying admiration at the sight of her between real disapproval of an illicit and underhand business what else was it after all and some dim perception that here was something he did not begin to be able to fathomsomething that perhaps no one but those two themselves could deal withbetween these various extremes he was lost indeed and he stammered out  i must ask your aunt shesshes not very good on a mule  then in an impulse of sheer affection he said with startling suddenness my dear ive often meant to ask are you happy at home  at home  there was something sinister about the way she repeated that as if the word home were strange to her  she drank her coffee and got up and the colonel felt afraid of her standing thereafraid of what she was going to tell him he grew very red but worse than all she said absolutely nothing only shrugged her shoulders with a little smile that went to his heart   vi   on the wild thyme under the olives below the rock village of gorbio with their mules cropping at a little distance those two sat after their lunch listening to the cuckoos since their uncanny chance meeting that morning in the gardens when they sat with their hands just touching amazed and elated by their own good fortune there was not much need to say what they felt to break with words this rapture of belonging to each otherso shyly so wildly so as it were without reality they were like epicures with old wine in their glasses not yet tired of its fragrance and the spell of anticipation  and so their talk was not of love but in that pathetic way of starcrossed lovers of the things they loved leaving outeach other  it was the telling of her dream that brought the words from him at last but she drew away and answered  it cantit mustnt be  then he just clung to her hand and presently seeing that her eyes were wet took courage enough to kiss her cheek  trembling and fugitive indeed that first passage of their love not much of the conquering male in him nor in her of the ordinary enchantress  and then they went outwardly sober enough riding their mules down the stony slopes back to mentone  but in the grey dusty railwaycarriage when she had left him he was like a man drugged staring at where she had sat opposite  two hours later at dinner in her hotel between her and mrs ercott with the colonel opposite he knew for the first time what he was faced with to watch every thought that passed within him lest it should by the slightest sign betray him to regulate and veil every look and every word he spoke to her never for a second to forget that these other persons were actual and dangerous not merely the insignificant and grotesque shadows that they seemed it would be perhaps for ever a part of his love for her to seem not to love her he did not dare dream of fulfilment he was to be her friend and try to bring her happinessburn and long for her and not think about reward this was his first real overwhelming passionso different to the loves of springand he brought to it all that naivete that touching quality of young englishmen whose secret instinct it is to back away from the full nature of love even from admitting that it has that nature they two were to love andnot to love for the first time he understood a little of what that meant a few stolen adoring minutes now and then and for the rest the presence of a world that must be deceived already he had almost a hatred of that orderly brownfaced colonel with his eyes that looked so steady and saw nothing of that flat kindly lady who talked so pleasantly throughout dinner saying things that he had to answer without knowing what they signified he realized with a sense of shock that he was deprived of all interests in life but one not even his work had any meaning apart from her it lit no fire within him to hear mrs ercott praise certain execrable pictures in the royal academy which she had religiously visited the day before leaving home and as the interminable meal wore on he began even to feel grief and wonder that olive could be so smiling so gay and calm so as it seemed to him indifferent to this intolerable impossibility of exchanging even one look of love did she really love himcould she love him and show not one little sign of it and suddenly he felt her foot touch his own it was the faintest sidelong supplicating pressure withdrawn at once but it said i know what you are suffering i too but i love you characteristically he felt that it cost her dear to make use of that little primitive device of common loves the touch awoke within him only chivalry he would burn for ever sooner than cause her the pain of thinking that he was not happy  after dinner they sat out on a balcony the stars glowed above the palms a frog was croaking he managed to draw his chair so that he could look at her unseen how deep and softly dark her eyes when for a second they rested on his a moth settled on her kneea cunning little creature with its hooded horned owls face and tiny black slits of eyes would it have come so confidingly to anyone but her the colonel knew its namehe had collected it very common he said the interest in it passed but lennan stayed bent forward gazing at that silkcovered knee  the voice of mrs ercott sharper than its wont said what day does robert say he wants you back my dear  he managed to remain gazing at the moth even to take it gently from her knee while he listened to her calm answer  tuesday i believe  then he got up and let the moth fly into the darkness his hands and lips were trembling and he was afraid of their being seen he had never known had not dreamed of such a violent sick feeling that this man could thus hale her home at will it was grotesque fantastic awful butit was true next tuesday she would journey back away from him to be again at the mercy of her fate the pain of this thought made him grip the railing and grit his teeth to keep himself from crying out and another thought came to him i shall have to go about with this feeling day and night and keep it secret  they were saying goodnight and he had to smirk and smile and pretendto her above allthat he was happy and he could see that she knew it was pretence  then he was alone with the feeling that he had failed her at the first shot torn too between horror of what he suddenly saw before him and longing to be back in her presence at any cost and all this on the day of that first kiss which had seemed to him to make her so utterly his own  he sat down on a bench facing the casino neither the lights nor the people passing in and out not even the gipsy bandsmens music distracted his thoughts for a second could it be less than twentyfour hours since he had picked up her handkerchief not thirty yards away in that twentyfour hours he seemed to have known every emotion that man could feel and in all the world there was now not one soul to whom he could speak his real thoughtsnot even to her because from her beyond all he must keep at any cost all knowledge of his unhappiness so this was illicit loveas it was called loneliness and torture not jealousyfor her heart was his but amazement outrage fear endless lonely suffering and nobody if they knew would care or pity him one jot  was there really then as the ancients thought a daemon that liked to play with men as men liked to stir an earwig and turn it over and put a foot on it in the end  he got up and made his way towards the railwaystation there was the bench where she had been sitting when he came on her that very morning the stars in their courses had seemed to fight for them then but whether for joy he no longer knew and there on the seat were still the pepper berries she had crushed and strewn he broke off another bunch and bruised them that scent was the ghost of sacred minutes when her hand lay against his own the stars in their coursesfor joy or sorrow   vii   there was no peace now for colonel and mrs ercott they felt themselves conspirators and of conspiracy they had never had the habit yet how could they openly deal with anxieties which had arisen solely from what they had chanced secretly to see what was not intended for ones eyes and ears did not exist no canon of conduct could be quite so sacred as well defend the opening of another persons letters as admit the possibility of making use of adventitious knowledge so far tradition and indeed character made them feel at one and conspire freely but they diverged on a deeper plane mrs ercott had said indeed that here was something which could not be controlled the colonel had felt ita very different thing less tolerant in theory he was touched at heart mrs ercott in theory almost approvingshe read that dangerous authoress george eliotat heart felt cold towards her husbands niece for these reasons they could not in fact conspire without in the end saying suddenly well its no good talking about it and almost at once beginning to talk about it again  in proposing to her that mule the colonel had not had time or rather not quite conviction enough as to his line of action to explain so immediately the new need for her to sit upon it it was only when to his somewhat strange relief she had refused the expedition and olive had started without them that he told her of the meeting in the gardens of which he had been witness she then said at once that if she had known she would of course have put up with anything in order to go not because she approved of interfering but because they must think of robert and the colonel had said dn the fellow and there the matter had rested for the moment for both of them were wondering a little which fellow it was that he had damned that indeed was the trouble if the colonel had not cared so much about his niece and had liked instead of rather disliking cramier if mrs ercott had not found mark lennan a nice boy and had not secretly felt her husbands niece rather dangerous to her peace of mind if in few words those three had been puppets made of wood and worked by law it would have been so much simpler for all concerned it was the discovery that there was a personal equation in such matters instead of just a simple rule of three which disorganized the colonel and made him almost angry which depressed mrs ercott and made her almost silent these two good souls had stumbled on a problem which has divided the world from birth shall cases be decided on their individual merits or according to formal codes  beneath an appearance and a vocabulary more orthodox than ever the colonels allegiance to authority and the laws of form was really shaken he simply could not get out of his head the sight of those two young people sitting side by side nor the tone of olives voice when she had repeated his regrettable words about happiness at home  if only the thing had not been so human if only she had been someone elses niece it would clearly have been her duty to remain unhappy as it was the more he thought the less he knew what to think a man who had never had any balance to speak of at his bank and from the nomadic condition of his life had no exaggerated feeling for a settled social statusdeeming society in fact rather a borehe did not unduly exaggerate the worldly dangers of this affair neither did he honestly believe that she would burn in everlasting torment if she did not succeed in remaining true to that great black chap as he secretly called cramier his feeling was simply that it was an awful pity a sort of unhappy conviction that it was not like the women of his family to fall upon such ways that his dead brother would turn in his grave in two words that it was not done yet he was by no means of those who giving latitude to women in general fall with whips on those of their own family who take it on the contrary believing that woman in general should be stainless to the worlds eye he was inclined to make allowance for any individual woman that he knew and loved a suspicion he had always entertained that cramier was not by breeding quite the clean potato may insensibly have influenced him just a little he had heard indeed that he was not even entitled to the name of cramier but had been adopted by a childless man who had brought him up and left him a lot of money there was something in this that went against the grain of the childless colonel he had never adopted nor been adopted by anyone himself there was a certain lack about a man who had been adopted of reasonable guaranteehe was like a nonvintage wine or a horse without a pedigree you could not quite rely on what he might do having no tradition in his blood his appearance too and manner somehow lent colour to this distrust a touch of the tarbrush somewhere and a stubborn silent pushing fellow why on earth had olive ever married him but then women were such kittle cattle poor things and old lindsay with his vestments and his views on obedience must have been a tartar as a father poor old chap besides cramier no doubt was what most women would call goodlooking more taking to the eye than such a quiet fellow as young lennan whose features were rather anyhow though pleasant enough and with a nice smilethe sort of young man one could not help liking and who certainly would never hurt a fly and suddenly there came the thought why should he not go to young lennan and put it to him straight that he was in love with olive not quitebut the way to do it would come to him he brooded long over this idea and spoke of it to mrs ercott while shaving the next morning her answer my dear john bosh removed his last doubt  without saying where he was going he strolled out the moment after breakfastand took a train to beaulieu at the young mans hotel he sent in his card and was told that this monsieur had already gone out for the day his mood of marching straight up to the guns thus checked he was left pensive and distraught not having seen beaulieu they spoke of it then as a coming place he made his way up an incline that whole hillside was covered with rosetrees thousands of these flowers were starring the lower air and the strewn petals of blown and fallen roses covered the light soil the colonel put his nose to blossoms here and there but they had little scent as if they knew that the season was already over a few bluebloused peasants were still busy among them and suddenly he came on young lennan himself sitting on a stone and dabbing away with his fingers at a lump of putty stuff the colonel hesitated apart from obvious reasons for discomfiture he had that feeling towards art common to so many of his caste it was not work of course but it was very clevera mystery to him how anyone could do it on seeing him lennan had risen dropping his handkerchief over what he was modellingbut not before the colonel had received a dim impression of something familiar the young man was very redthe colonel too was conscious suddenly of the heat he held out his hand  nice quiet place this he stammered never seen it before i called at your hotel  now that he had his chance he was completely at a loss the sight of the face emerging from that lump of putty stuff had quite unnerved him the notion of this young man working at it up here all by himself just because he was away an hour or two from the original touched him how on earth to say what he had come to say it was altogether different from what he had thought and it suddenly flashed through himdolly was right shes always righthang it  youre busy he said i mustnt interrupt you  not at all sir it was awfully good of you to look me up  the colonel stared there was something about young lennan that he had not noticed before a dont take liberties with me look that made things difficult but still he lingered staring wistfully at the young man who stood waiting with such politeness then a safe question shot into his mind  ah and when do you go back to england were off on tuesday  while he spoke a puff of wind lifted the handkerchief from the modelled face would the young fellow put it back he did not and the colonel thought  it would have been bad form he knew i wouldnt take advantage yes hes a gentleman  lifting his hand to the salute he said well i must be getting back see you at dinner perhaps and turning on his heel he marched away  the remembrance of that face in the putty stuff up there by the side of the road accompanied him home it was badit was serious and the sense that he counted for nothing in all of it grew and grew in him he told no one of where he had been  when the colonel turned with ceremony and left him lennan sat down again on the flat stone took up his putty stuff and presently effaced that image he sat still a long time to all appearance watching the little blue butterflies playing round the red and tawny roses then his fingers began to work feverishly shaping a head not of a man not of a beast but a sort of horned heavy mingling of the two there was something frenetic in the movement of those rather short bluntended fingers as though they were strangling the thing they were creating   viii   in those days such as had served their country travelled as befitted spartans in ordinary firstclass carriages and woke in the morning at la roche or some strangesounding place for paler coffee and the pale brioche so it was with colonel and mrs ercott and their niece accompanied by books they did not read viands they did not eat and one somnolent irishman returning from the east in the disposition of legs there was the usual difficulty no one quite liking to put them up and all ultimately doing so save olive more than once during that night the colonel lying on the seat opposite awoke and saw her sitting withdrawn into her corner with eyes still open staring at that little head which he admired so much upright and unmoving in its dark straw toque against the cushion he would become suddenly alert kicking the irishman slightly in the effort he would slip his legs down bend across to her in the darkness and conscious of a faint fragrance as of violets whisper huskily anything i can do for you my dear when she had smiled and shaken her head he would retreat and after holding his breath to see if dolly were asleep would restore his feet slightly kicking the irishman after one such expedition for full ten minutes he remained awake wondering at her tireless immobility for indeed she was spending this night entranced with the feeling that lennan was beside her holding her hand in his she seemed actually to feel the touch of his finger against the tiny patch of her bare palm where the glove opened it was wonderful this uncanny communion in the dark rushing nightshe would not have slept for worlds never before had she felt so close to him not even when he had kissed her that once under the olives nor even when at the concert yesterday his arm pressed hers and his voice whispered words she heard so thirstily and that golden fortnight passed and passed through her on an endless band of reminiscence its memories were like flowers such scent and warmth and colour in them and of all none perhaps quite so poignant as the memory of the moment at the door of their carriage when he said so low that she just heard goodbye my darling  he had never before called her that not even his touch on her cheek under the olives equalled the simple treasure of that word and above the roar and clatter of the train and the snoring of the irishman it kept sounding in her ears hour after dark hour it was perhaps not wonderful that through all that night she never once looked the future in the facemade no plans took no stock of her position just yielded to memory and to the halfdreamed sensation of his presence close beside her whatever might come afterwards she was his this night such was the trance that gave to her the strange soft tireless immobility which so moved her uncle whenever he woke up  in paris they drove from station to station in a vehicle unfit for threeto stretch their legsas the colonel said since he saw in his niece no signs of flagging no regret his spirits were rising and he confided to mrs ercott in the buffet at the gare du nord when olive had gone to wash that he did not think there was much in it after all looking at the way shed travelled  but mrs ercott answered  havent you ever noticed that olive never shows what she does not want to she has not got those eyes for nothing  what eyes  eyes that see everything and seem to see nothing  conscious that something was hurting her the colonel tried to take her hand  but mrs ercott rose quickly and went where he could not follow  thus suddenly deserted the colonel brooded drumming on the little table what now dolly was unjust poor dolly he was as fond of her as ever of course how could he help olives being youngand pretty how could he help looking after her and wanting to save her from this mess thus he sat wondering dismayed by the unreasonableness of women it did not enter his head that mrs ercott had been almost as sleepless as his niece watching through closed eyes every one of those little expeditions of his and saying to herself ah he doesnt care how i travel  she returned serene enough concealing her grief and soon they were once more whirling towards england  but the future had begun to lay its hand on olive the spell of the past was already losing power the sense that it had all been a dream grew stronger every minute in a few hours she would reenter the little house close under the shadow of that old wren church which reminded her somehow of childhood and her austere father with his chiselled face the meeting with her husband how go through that and tonight but she did not care to contemplate tonight and all those tomorrows wherein there was nothing she had to do of which it was reasonable to complain yet nothing she could do without feeling that all the friendliness and zest and colour was out of life and she a prisoner into those tomorrows she felt she would slip back out of her dream lost with hardly perhaps an effort to get away to the house on the river where her husband came only at weekends had hitherto been a refuge only she would not see mark thereunless then with the thought that she would must still see him sometimes all again grew faintly glamorous if only she did see him what would the rest matter never again as it had before  the colonel was reaching down her handbag his cheery looks as if it would be rough aroused her glad to be alone and tired enough now she sought the ladies cabin and slept through the crossing till the voice of the old stewardess awakened her youve had a nice sleep were alongside miss ah if she were but that now she had been dreaming that she was sitting in a flowery field and lennan had drawn her up by the hands with the words were here my darling  on deck the colonel laden with bags was looking back for her and trying to keep a space between him and his wife he signalled with his chin threading her way towards him she happened to look up by the rails of the pier above she saw her husband he was leaning there looking intently down his tall broad figure made the people on each side of him seem insignificant the cleanshaved squarecut face with those almost epileptic forceful eyes had a stillness and intensity beside which the neighbouring faces seemed to disappear she saw him very clearly even noting the touch of silver in his dark hair on each side under his straw hat noting that he seemed too massive for his neat blue suit his face relaxed he made a little movement of one hand suddenly it shot through her suppose mark had travelled with them as he had wished to do for ever and ever now that dark massive creature smiling down at her was her enemy from whom she must guard and keep herself if she could keep at all events each one of her real thoughts and hopes she could have writhed and cried out instead she tightened her grip on the handle of her bag and smiled though so skilled in knowledge of his moods she felt in his greeting his fierce grip of her shoulders the smouldering of some feeling the nature of which she could not quite fathom his voice had a grim sincerity glad youre backthought you were never coming resigned to his charge a feeling of sheer physical faintness so beset her that she could hardly reach the compartment he had reserved it seemed to her that for all her foreboding she had not till this moment had the smallest inkling of what was now before her and at his muttered must we have the old fossils in she looked back to assure herself that her uncle and aunt were following to avoid having to talk she feigned to have travelled badly leaning back with closed eyes in her corner if only she could open them and see not this squarejawed face with its intent gaze of possession but that other with its eager eyes humbly adoring her the interminable journey ended all too soon she clung quite desperately to the colonels hand on the platform at charing cross when his kind face vanished she would be lost indeed then in the closed cab she heard her husbands arent you going to kiss me and submitted to his embrace  she tried so hard to think what does it matter its not i not my soul my spiritonly my miserable lips  she heard him say you dont seem too glad to see me and then i hear you had young lennan out there what was he doing  she felt the turmoil of sudden fear wondered whether she was showing it lost it in unnatural alertnessall in the second before she answered oh just a holiday  some seconds passed and then he said  you didnt mention him in your letters  she answered coolly didnt i we saw a good deal of him  she knew that he was looking at heran inquisitive halfmenacing regard whyoh whycould she not then and there cry out and i love himdo you heari love him so awful did it seem to be denying her love with these half lies but it was all so much more grim and hopeless than even she had thought how inconceivable now that she had ever given herself up to this man for life if only she could get away from him to her room and scheme and think for his eyes never left her travelling over her with their pathetic greed their menacing inquiry till he said well its not done you any harm you look very fit but his touch was too much even for her selfcommand and she recoiled as if he had struck her  whats the matter did i hurt you  it seemed to her that he was jeeringthen realized as vividly that he was not and the full danger to her perhaps to mark himself of shrinking from this man striking her with all its pitiable force she made a painful effort slipped her hand under his arm and said im very tired you startled me  but he put her hand away and turning his face stared out of the window and so they reached their home  when he had left her alone she remained where she was standing by her wardrobe without sound or movement thinking what am i going to do how am i going to live   ix   when mark lennan travelling through from beaulieu reached his rooms in chelsea he went at once to the little pile of his letters twice hunted through them then stood very still with a stunned sick feeling why had she not sent him that promised note and now he realizedthough not yet to the fullwhat it meant to be in love with a married woman he must wait in this suspense for eighteen hours at least till he could call and find out what had happened to prevent her till he could hear from her lips that she still loved him the chilliest of legal lovers had access to his love but he must possess a soul that was on fire in this deadly patience for fear of doing something that might jeopardize her telegraph he dared not write she would get it by the first post but what could he say that was not dangerous if cramier chanced to see call still more impossible till three oclock at very earliest tomorrow his gaze wandered round the studio were these household gods and all these works of his indeed the same he had left twenty days ago they seemed to exist now only in so far as she might come to see themcome and sit in such a chair and drink out of such a cup and let him put this cushion for her back and that footstool for her feet and so vividly could he see her lying back in that chair looking across at him that he could hardly believe she had never yet sat there it was odd howwithout any resolution taken without admission that their love could not remain platonic without any change in their relations save one humble kiss and a few whispered wordseverything was changed a month or so ago if he had wanted he would have gone at once calmly to her house it would have seemed harmless and quite natural now it was impossible to do openly the least thing that strict convention did not find desirable sooner or later they would find him stepping over convention and take him for what he was nota real lover a real lover he knelt down before the empty chair and stretched out his arms no substanceno warmthno fragrancenothing longing that passed through air as the wind through grass  he went to the little round window which overlooked the river the last evening of may gloaming above the water dusk resting in the trees and the air warm better to be out and moving in the night out in the ebb and flow of things among others whose hearts were beating than stay in this place that without her was so cold and meaningless  lampsthe passionfruit of townswere turning from pallor to full orange and the stars were coming out halfpast nine at ten oclock and not before he would walk past her house to have this something to look forward to however furtive and barren helped but on a saturday night there would be no sitting at the house cramier would be at home or they would both be out or perhaps have gone down to their river cottage cramier what cruel demon had presided over that marring of her life why had he never met her till after she had bound herself to this man from a negative contempt for one who was either not sensitive enough to recognize that his marriage was a failure or not chivalrous enough to make that failure bear as little hardly as possible on his wife he had come already to jealous hatred as of a monster to be face to face with cramier in a mortal conflict could alone have satisfied his feeling yet he was a young man by nature gentle  his heart beat desperately as he approached that streetone of those little old streets so beautiful that belonged to a vanished london it was very narrow there was no shelter and he thought confusedly of what he could say if met in this remote backwater that led nowhere he would tell some lie no doubt lies would now be his daily business lies and hatred those violent things of life would come to seem quite natural in the violence of his love  he stood a moment hesitating by the rails of the old church black whiteveined with shadowy summits in that half darkness it was like some gigantic vision mystery itself seemed modelled there he turned and walked quickly down the street close to the houses on the further side the windows of her house were lighted so she was not away dim light in the diningroom lights in the room aboveher bedroom doubtless was there no way to bring her to the window no way his spirit could climb up there and beckon hers out to him perhaps she was not there perhaps it was but a servant taking up hot water he was at the end of the street by now but to leave without once more passing was impossible and this time he went slowly his head down feigning abstraction grudging every inch of pavement and all the time furtively searching that window with the light behind the curtains nothing once more he was close to the railings of the church and once more could not bring himself to go away in the little close deserted street not a soul was moving not even a cat or dog nothing alive but many discreet lighted windows like veiled faces showing no emotion they seemed to watch his indecision and he thought ah well i dare say there are lots like me lots as near and yet as far away lots who have to suffer but what would he not have given for the throwing open of those curtains then suddenly scared by an approaching figure he turned and walked away   x   at three oclock next day he called  in the middle of her white drawingroom whose latticed window ran the whole length of one wall stood a little table on which was a silver jar full of early larkspurs evidently from her garden by the river and lennan waited his eyes fixed on those blossoms so like to little blue butterflies and strangehued crickets tethered to the pale green stems in this room she passed her days guarded from him once a week at most he would be able to come thereonce a week for an hour or two of the hundred and sixtyeight hours that he longed to be with her  and suddenly he was conscious of her she had come in without sound and was standing by the piano so pale in her creamwhite dress that her eyes looked jet black he hardly knew that face like a flower closed against cold  what had he done what had happened in these five days to make her like this to him he took her hands and tried to kiss them but she said quickly  hes in  at that he stood silent looking into that face frozen to a dreadful composure on the breaking up of which his very life seemed to depend at last he said  what is it am i nothing to you after all  but as soon as he had spoken he saw that he need not have asked and flung his arms round her she clung to him with desperation then freed herself and said  no no lets sit down quietly  he obeyed halfdivining halfrefusing to admit all that lay behind that strange coldness and this desperate embrace all the selfpity and selfloathing shame rage and longing of a married woman for the first time face to face with her lover in her husbands house  she seemed now to be trying to make him forget her strange behaviour to be what she had been during that fortnight in the sunshine but suddenly just moving her lips she said  quick when can we see each other i will come to you to teatomorrow and following her eyes he saw the door opening and cramier coming in unsmiling very big in the low room he crossed over to them and offered his hand to lennan then drawing a low chair forward between their two chairs sat down  so youre back he said have a good time  thanks yes very  luck for olive you were there those places are dull holes  it was luck for me  no doubt and with those words he turned to his wife his elbows rested along the arms of his chair so that his clenched palms were upwards it was as if he knew that he was holding those two gripped one in each hand  i wonder he said slowly that fellows like you with nothing in the world to tie them ever sit down in a place like london i should have thought rome or paris were your happy huntinggrounds in his voice in those eyes of his a little bloodshot with their look of power in his whole attitude there was a sort of muffled menace and contempt as though he were thinking step into my path and i will crush you  and lennan thought  how long must i sit here then past that figure planted solidly between them he caught a look from her swift sure marvellously timedagain and againas if she were being urged by the very presence of this danger one of those glances would surelysurely be seen by cramier is there need for fear that a swallow should dash itself against the wall over which it skims but he got up unable to bear it longer  going that one suave word had an inimitable insolence  he could hardly see his hand touching cramiers heavy fist then he realized that she was standing so that their faces when they must say goodbye could not be seen her eyes were smiling yet imploring her lips shaped the word tomorrow and squeezing her hand desperately he got away  he had never dreamed that to see her in the presence of the man who owned her would be so terrible for a moment he thought that he must give her up give up a love that would drive him mad  he climbed on to an omnibus travelling west another twentyfour hours of starvation had begun it did not matter at all what he did with them they were simply so much aching that had to be got through somehowso much aching and what relief at the end an hour or two with her desperately holding himself in  like most artists and few englishmen he lived on feelings rather than on facts so found no refuge in decisive resolutions but he made manythe resolution to give her up to be true to the ideal of service for no reward to beseech her to leave cramier and come to himand he made each many times  at hyde park corner he got down and went into the park thinking that to walk would help him  a great number of people were sitting there taking mysterious anodyne doing the right thing to avoid them he kept along the rails and ran almost into the arms of colonel and mrs ercott who were coming from the direction of knightsbridge slightly flushed having lunched and talked of monte at the house of a certain general  they greeted him with the surprise of those who had said to each other many times that young man will come rushing back it was very nicethey saidto run across him when did he arrive they had thought he was going on to italyhe was looking rather tired they did not ask if he had seen herbeing too kind and perhaps afraid that he would say yes which would be embarrassing or that he would say no which would be still more embarrassing when they found that he ought to have said yes would he not come and sit with them a littlethey were going presently to see how olive was lennan perceived that they were warning him and forcing himself to look at them very straight he said i have just been there  mrs ercott phrased her impressions that same evening he looks quite hunted poor young man im afraid theres going to be fearful trouble there did you notice how quickly he ran away from us hes thin too if it wasnt for his tan hed look really ill the boys eyes are so pathetic and he used to have such a nice smile in them  the colonel who was fastening her hooks paused in an operation that required concentration  its a thousand pities he muttered that he hasnt any work to do that puddling about with clay or whatever he does is no good at all and slowly fastening one hook he unhooked several others  mrs ercott went on  and i saw olive when she thought i wasnt looking it was just as if shed taken off a mask but robert cramier will never put up with it hes in love with her still i watched him its tragic john  the colonel let his hands fall from the hooks  if i thought that he said id do something  if you could it would not be tragic  the colonel stared there was always something to be done  you read too many novels he said but without spirit  mrs ercott smiled and made no answer to an aspersion she had heard before   xi   when lennan reached his rooms again after that encounter with the ercotts he found in his letterbox a visiting card mrs doone miss sylvia doone and on it pencilled the words do come and see us before we go down to haylesylvia he stared blankly at the round handwriting he knew so well  sylvia nothing perhaps could have made so plain to him how in this tornado of his passion the world was drowned sylvia he had almost forgotten her existence and yet only last year after he definitely settled down in london he had once more seen a good deal of her and even had soft thoughts of her againwith her palegold hair her true look her sweetness then they had gone for the winter to algiers for her mothers health  when they came back he had already avoided seeing her though that was before olive went to monte carlo before he had even admitted his own feeling and sincehe had not once thought of her not once the world had indeed vanished do come and see ussylvia the very notion was an irritation no rest from aching and impatience to be had that way  and then the idea came to him why not kill these hours of waiting for tomorrows meeting by going on the river passing by her cottage there was still one train that he could catch  he reached the village after dark and spent the night at the inn got up early next morning took a boat and pulled downstream the bluffs of the opposite bank were wooded with high trees the sun shone softly on their leaves and the bright stream was ruffled by a breeze that bent all the reeds and slowly swayed the waterflowers one thin white line of wind streaked the blue sky he shipped his sculls and drifted listening to the woodpigeons watching the swallows chasing if only she were here to spend one long day thus drifting with the stream to have but one such rest from longing her cottage he knew lay on the same side as the village and just beyond an island she had told him of a hedge of yewtrees and a white dovecote almost at the waters edge he came to the island and let his boat slide into the backwater it was all overgrown with willowtrees and alders dark even in this early morning radiance and marvellously still there was no room to row he took the boathook and tried to punt but the green water was too deep and entangled with great roots so that he had to make his way by clawing with the hook at branches birds seemed to shun this gloom but a single magpie crossed the one little clear patch of sky and flew low behind the willows the air here had a sweetish earthy odour of too rank foliage all brightness seemed entombed he was glad to pass out again under a huge poplartree into the fluttering gold and silver of the morning and almost at once he saw the yewhedge at the border of some bright green turf and a pigeonhouse high on its pole painted creamwhite about it a number of ringdoves and snowwhite pigeons were perched or flying and beyond the lawn he could see the dark veranda of a low house covered by wistaria just going out of flower a drift of scent from late lilacs and newmown grass was borne out to him together with the sound of a mowingmachine and the humming of many bees it was beautiful here and seemed for all its restfulness to have something of that flying quality he so loved about her face about the sweep of her hair the quick soft turn of her eyesor was that but the darkness of the yewtrees the whiteness of the dovecote and the doves themselves flying  he lay there a long time quietly beneath the bank careful not to attract the attention of the old gardener who was methodically pushing his machine across and across the lawn how he wanted her with him then wonderful that there could be in life such beauty and wild softness as made the heart ache with the delight of it and in that same life grey rules and rigid barrierscoffins of happiness that doors should be closed on love and joy there was not so much of it in the world she who was the very spirit of this flying nymphlike summer was untimely winteredup in bleak sorrow there was a hateful unwisdom in that thought it seemed so grim and violent so corpselike gruesome narrow and extravagant what possible end could it serve that she should be unhappy even if he had not loved her he would have hated her fate just as muchall such stories of imprisoned lives had roused his anger even as a boy  soft white cloudsthose bright angels of the river never very long awayhad begun now to spread their wings over the woods and the wind had dropped so that the slumbrous warmth and murmuring of summer gathered full over the water the old gardener had finished his job of mowing and came with a little basket of grain to feed the doves lennan watched them going to him the ringdoves very dainty and capricious keeping to themselves in place of that old fellow he was really seeing her feeding from her hands those birds of cypris what a group he could have made of her with them perching and flying round her if she were his what could he not achieveto make her immortallike the old greeks and italians who in their work had rescued their mistresses from time     he was back in his rooms in london two hours before he dared begin expecting her living alone there but for a caretaker who came every morning for an hour or two made dust and departed he had no need for caution and when he had procured flowers and the fruits and cakes which they certainly would not eatwhen he had arranged the teatable and made the grand tour at least twenty times he placed himself with a book at the little round window to watch for her approach there very still he sat not reading a word continually moistening his dry lips and sighing to relieve the tension of his heart at last he saw her coming she was walking close to the railings of the houses looking neither to right nor left she had on a lawn frock and a hat of the palest coffeecoloured straw with a narrow black velvet ribbon she crossed the side street stopped for a second gave a swift look round then came resolutely on what was it made him love her so what was the secret of her fascination certainly no conscious enticements never did anyone try less to fascinate he could not recall one single little thing that she had done to draw him to her was it perhaps her very passivity her native pride that never offered or asked anything a sort of soft stoicism in her fibre that and some mysterious charm as close and intimate as scent was to a flower  he waited to open till he heard her footstep just outside she came in without a word not even looking at him and he too said not a word till he had closed the door and made sure of her then they turned to each other her breast was heaving a little under her thin frock but she was calmer than he with that wonderful composure of pretty women in all the passages of love as who should say this is my native air  they stood and looked at each other as if they could never have enough till he said at last  i thought i should die before this moment came there isnt a minute that i dont long for you so terribly that i can hardly live  and do you think that i dont long for you  then come to me  she looked at him mournfully and shook her head  well he had known that she would not he had not earned her what right had he to ask her to fly against the world to brave everything to have such faith in himas yet he had no heart to press his words beginning then to understand the paralyzing truth that there was no longer any resolving this or that with love like his he had ceased to be a separate being with a separate will he was entwined with her could act only if her will and his were one he would never be able to say to her you must he loved her too much and she knew it so there was nothing for it but to forget the ache and make the hour happy but how about that other truththat in love there is no pause no resting with any watering however scant the flower will grow till its time comes to be plucked this oasis in the desertthese few minutes with her alone were swept through and through with a feverish wind to be closer how not try to be that how not long for her lips when he had but her hand to kiss and how not be poisoned with the thought that in a few minutes she would leave him and go back to the presence of that other who even though she loathed him could see and touch her when he would she was leaning back in the very chair where in fancy he had seen her and he only dared sit at her feet and look up and this which a week ago would have been rapture was now almost torture so far did it fall short of his longing it was torture too to keep his voice in tune with the sober sweetness of her voice and bitterly he thought how can she sit there and not want me as i want her then at a touch of her fingers on his hair he lost control and kissed her lips her surrender lasted only for a second  no noyou must not  that mournful surprise sobered him at once  he got up stood away from her begged to be forgiven  and when she was gone he sat in the chair where she had sat that clasp of her the kiss he had begged her to forgetto forgetnothing could take that from him he had done wrong had startled her had fallen short of chivalry and yeta smile of utter happiness would cling about his lips his fastidiousness his imagination almost made him think that this was all he wanted if he could close his eyes now and pass out before he lost that moment of halffulfilment  and the smile still on his lips he lay back watching the flies wheeling and chasing round the hanginglamp sixteen of them there were wheeling and chasingnever still   xii   when walking from lennans studio olive reentered her dark little hall she approached its alcove and glanced first at the hatstand they were all therethe silk hat the bowler the straw so he was in and within each hat in turn she seemed to see her husbands headwith the face turned away from herso distinctly as to note the leathery look of the skin of his cheek and neck and she thought i pray that he will die it is wicked but i pray that he will die then quietly that he might not hear she mounted to her bedroom the door into his dressingroom was open and she went to shut it he was standing there at the window  ah youre in been anywhere  to the national gallery  it was the first direct lie she had ever told him and she was surprised to feel neither shame nor fear but rather a sense of pleasure at defeating him he was the enemy all the more the enemy because she was still fighting against herself and so strangely in his behalf  alone  yes  rather boring wasnt it i should have thought youd have got young lennan to take you there  why  by instinct she had seized on the boldest answer and there was nothing to be told from her face if he were her superior in strength he was her inferior in quickness  he lowered his eyes and said  his line isnt it  with a shrug she turned away and shut the door she sat down on the edge of her bed very still in that little passage of wits she had won she could win in many such but the full hideousness of things had come to her lies lies that was to be her life that or to say farewell to all she now cared for to cause despair not only in herself but in her lover andfor what in order that her body might remain at the disposal of that man in the next roomher spirit having flown from him for ever such were the alternatives unless those words then come to me were to be more than words were they could they be they would mean such happiness ifif his love for her were more than a summer love and hers for him was itwere theymore than summer loves how know and without knowing how give such pain to everyone how break a vow she had thought herself quite above breaking how make such a desperate departure from all the traditions and beliefs in which she had been brought up but in the very nature of passion is that which resents the intrusion of hard and fast decisions and suddenly she thought if our love cannot stay what it is and if i cannot yet go to him for always is there not still another way  she got up and began to dress for dinner standing before her glass she was surprised to see that her face showed no signs of the fears and doubts that were now her comrades was it because whatever happened she loved and was beloved she wondered how she had looked when he kissed her so passionately had she shown her joy before she checked him  in her garden by the river were certain flowers that for all her care would grow rank and of the wrong colourwanting a different soil was she then like those flowers of hers ah let her but have her true soil and she would grow straight and true enough  then in the doorway she saw her husband she had never till today quite hated him but now she did with a real blind horrible feeling what did he want of her standing there with those eyes fixed on herthose forceful eyes touched with blood that seemed at once to threaten covet and beseech she drew her wrapper close round her shoulders at that he came up and said  look at me olive  against instinct and will she obeyed and he went on  be careful i say be careful  then he took her by the shoulders and raised her up to him and quite unnerved she stood without resisting  i want you he said i mean to keep you  then suddenly letting her go he covered his eyes with his hands that frightened her mostit was so unlike him not till now had she understood between what terrifying forces she was balancing she did not speak but her face grew white from behind those hands he uttered a sound not quite like a human noise turned sharply and went out she dropped back into the chair before her mirror overcome by the most singular feeling she had ever known as if she had lost everything even her love for lennan and her longing for his love what was it all worth what was anything worth in a world like this all was loathsome herself loathsome all was a void hateful hateful hateful it was like having no heart at all and that same evening when her husband had gone down to the house she wrote to lennan   our love must never turn to earthiness as it might have this afternoon everything is black and hopeless he suspects for you to come here is impossible and too dreadful for us both and i have no right to ask you to be furtive i cant bear to think of you like that and i cant bear it myself i dont know what to do or say dont try to see me yet i must have time i must think   xiii   colonel ercott was not a racing man but he had in common with others of his countrymen a religious feeling in the matter of the derby his remembrances of it went back to early youth for he had been born and brought up almost within sound of the coachingroad to epsom every derby and oaks day he had gone out on his pony to watch the passing of the tall hats and feathers of the great and the pothats and feathers of the lowly and afterwards in the fields at home had ridden races with old lindsay finishing between a cow that judged and a clump of bulrushes representing the grand stand  but for one reason or another he had never seen the great race and the notion that it was his duty to see it had now come to him he proposed this to mrs ercott with some diffidence she read so many bookshe did not quite know whether she would approve finding that she did he added casually  and we might take olive  mrs ercott answered dryly  you know the house of commons has a holiday  the colonel murmured  oh i dont want that chap  perhaps said mrs ercott you would like mark lennan  the colonel looked at her most dubiously dolly could talk of it as a tragedy and aa grand passion and yet make a suggestion like that then his wrinkles began slowly to come alive and he gave her waist a squeeze  mrs ercott did not resist that treatment  take olive alone she said i dont really care to go  when the colonel went to fetch his niece he found her ready and very halfheartedly he asked for cramier it appeared she had not told him  relieved yet somewhat disconcerted he murmured  he wont mind not going i suppose  if he went i should not  at this quiet answer the colonel was beset again by all his fears he put his white topper down and took her hand  my dear he said i dont want to intrude upon your feelings butbut is there anything i can do its dreadful to see things going unhappily with you he felt his hand being lifted her face pressed against it and suffering acutely with his other hand cased in a bright new glove he smoothed her arm well have a jolly good day sweetheart he said and forget all about it  she gave the hand a kiss and turned away and the colonel vowed to himself that she should not be unhappylovely creature that she was so delicate and straight and fine in her pearly frock and he pulled himself together brushing his white topper vigorously with his sleeve forgetting that this kind of hat has no nap  and so he was tenderness itself on the journey down satisfying all her wants before she had them telling her stories of indian life and consulting her carefully as to which horse they should back there was the dukes of course but there was another animal that appealed to him greatly his friend tabor had given him the tiptabor who had the best arabs in all indiaand at a nice price a man who practically never gambled the colonel liked to feel that his fancy would bring him in something really substantialif it won the idea that it could lose not really troubling him however they would see it in the paddock and judge for themselves the paddock was the place away from all the dust and racketolive would enjoy the paddock once on the course they neglected the first race it was more important the colonel thought that they should lunch he wanted to see more colour in her cheeks wanted to see her laugh he had an invitation to his old regiments drag where the champagne was sure to be good and he was so proud of herwould not have missed those young fellows admiration of her for the world though to take a lady amongst them was in fact against the rules it was not then till the second race was due to start that they made their way into the paddock here the derby horses were being led solemnly attended each by a little posse of persons looking up their legs and down their ribs to see whether they were worthy of support together with a few who liked to see a whole horse at a time presently they found the animal which had been recommended to the colonel it was a chestnut with a starred forehead parading in a far corner the colonel who really loved a horse was deep in admiration he liked its head and he liked its hocks above all he liked its eye a fine creature all sense and fireperhaps just a little straight in the shoulder for coming down the hill and in the midst of his examination he found himself staring at his niece what breeding the child showed with her delicate arched brows little ears and fine close nostrils and the way she movedso sure and springy she was too pretty to suffer a shame if she hadnt been so pretty that young fellow wouldnt have fallen in love with her if she werent so prettythat husband of hers wouldnt and the colonel dropped his gaze startled by the discovery he had stumbled on if she hadnt been so pretty was that the meaning of it all the cynicism of his own reflection struck him between wind and water and yet something in himself seemed to confirm it somehow what then was he to let them tear her in two between them destroying her because she was so pretty and somehow this discovery of histhat passion springs from worship of beauty and warmth of form and colourdisturbed him horribly for he had no habit of philosophy the thought seemed to him strangely crude even immoral that she should be thus between two ravening desiresa bird between two hawks a fruit between two mouths it was a way of looking at things that had never before occurred to him the idea of a husband clutching at his wife the idea of that young man who looked so gentle swooping down on her and the idea that if she faded lost her looks went off their greed indeed any mans would die awayall these horrible ideas hurt him the more for the remarkable suddenness with which they had come to him a tragic business dolly had said so queer and quickwere women but his resolution that the day was to be jolly soon recurred to him and he hastily resumed inspection of his fancy perhaps they ought to have a tenpound note on it and they had better get back to the stand and as they went the colonel saw standing beneath a tree at a little distance a young man that he could have sworn was lennan not likely for an artist chap to be down here but it was undoubtedly young lennan brushedup in a tophat fortunately however his face was not turned in their direction he said nothing to olive not wishingespecially after those unpleasant thoughtsto take responsibility and he kept her moving towards the gate congratulating himself that his eyes had been so sharp in the crush there he was separated from her a little but she was soon beside him again and more than ever he congratulated himself that nothing had occurred to upset her and spoil the day her cheeks were warm enough now her dark eyes glowing she was excited no doubt by thoughts of the race and of the tenner he was going to put on for her  he recounted the matter afterwards to mrs ercott that chestnut tabor put me on to finished nowherecouldnt get down the hillknew it wouldnt the moment i set eyes on it but the child enjoyed herself wish youd been there my dear of his deeper thoughts and of that glimpse of young lennan he did not speak for on the way home an ugly suspicion had attacked him had the young fellow after all seen and managed to get close to her in the crush at the paddock gateway   xiv   that letter of hers fanned the flame in lennan as nothing had yet fanned it earthiness was it earthiness to love as he did if so then not for all the world would he be otherwise than earthy in the shock of reading it he crossed his rubicon and burned his boats behind him no more did the pale ghost chivalrous devotion haunt him he knew now that he could not stop short since she asked him he must not of course try to see her just yet but when he did then he would fight for his life the thought that she might be meaning to slip away from him was too utterly unbearable but she could not be meaning that she would never be so cruel ah she wouldshe must come to him in the end the world life itself would be well lost for love of her  thus resolved he was even able to work again and all that tuesday he modelled at a big version of the fantastic bulllike figure he had conceived after the colonel left him up on the hillside at beaulieu he worked at it with a sort of evil joy into this creature he would put the spirit of possession that held her from him and while his fingers forced the clay he felt as if he had cramiers neck within his grip yet now that he had resolved to take her if he could he had not quite the same hatred after all this man loved her too could not help it that she loathed him could not help it that he had the disposition of her body and soul  june had come in with skies of a blue that not even london glare and dust could pale in every square and park and patch of green the air simmered with life and with the music of birds swaying on little boughs piano organs in the streets were no longer wistful for the south lovers already sat in the shade of trees  to remain indoors when he was not working was sheer torture for he could not read and had lost all interest in the little excitements amusements occupations that go to make up the normal life of man every outer thing seemed to have dropped off shrivelled leaving him just a condition of the spirit a state of mind  lying awake he would think of things in the past and they would mean nothingall dissolved and dispersed by the heat of this feeling in him indeed his sense of isolation was so strong that he could not even believe that he had lived through the facts which his memory apprehended he had become one burning moodthat and nothing more  to be out especially amongst trees was the only solace  and he sat for a long time that evening under a large limetree on a knoll above the serpentine there was very little breeze just enough to keep alive a kind of whispering what if men and women when they had lived their gusty lives became trees what if someone who had burned and ached were now spreading over him this leafy peacethis blueblack shadow against the stars or were the stars perhaps the souls of men and women escaped for ever from love and longing he broke off a branch of the lime and drew it across his face it was not yet in flower but it smelled lemony and fresh even here in london if only for a moment he could desert his own heart and rest with the trees and stars  no further letter came from her next morning and he soon lost his power to work it was derby day he determined to go down perhaps she would be there even if she were not he might find some little distraction in the crowd and the horses he had seen her in the paddock long before the colonels sharp eyes detected him and following in the crush managed to touch her hand in the crowded gateway and whisper tomorrow the national gallery at four oclockby the bacchus and ariadne for gods sake her gloved hand pressed his hard and she was gone he stayed in the paddock too happy almost to breathe  next day while waiting before that picture he looked at it with wonder for there seemed his own passion transfigured in the darkening starcrowned sky and the eyes of the leaping god in spirit was he not always rushing to her like that minutes passed and she did not come what should he do if she failed him surely die of disappointment and despair he had little enough experience as yet of the toughness of the human heart how life bruises and crushes yet leaves it beating then from an unlikely quarter he saw her coming  they walked in silence down to the quiet rooms where the turner watercolours hung no one save two frenchmen and an old official watched them passing slowly before those little pictures till they came to the end wall and unseen unheard by any but her he could begin  the arguments he had so carefully rehearsed were all forgotten nothing left but an incoherent pleading life without her was not life and they had only one life for loveone summer it was all dark where she was notthe very sun itself was dark better to die than to live such false broken lives apart from each other better to die at once than to live wanting each other longing and longing and watching each others sorrow and all for the sake of what it maddened killed him to think of that man touching her when he knew she did but hate him it shamed all manhood it could not be good to help such things to be a vow when the spirit of it was gone was only superstition it was wicked to waste ones life for the sake of that societyshe knew she must knowonly cared for the forms the outsides of things and what did it matter what society thought it had no soul no feeling nothing and if it were said they ought to sacrifice themselves for the sake of others to make things happier in the world she must know that was only true when love was light and selfish but not when people loved as they did with all their hearts and souls so that they would die for each other any minute so that without each other there was no meaning in anything it would not help a single soul for them to murder their love and all the happiness of their lives to go on in a sort of living death even if it were wrong he would rather do that wrong and take the consequences but it was not it could not be wrong when they felt like that  and all the time that he was pouring forth those supplications his eyes searched and searched her face but there only came from her i dont knowi cant tellif only i knew and then he was silent stricken to the heart till at a look or a touch from her he would break out again you do love meyou do then what does anything else matter  and so it went on and on that summer afternoon in the deserted room meant for such other things where the two frenchmen were too sympathetic and the old official too drowsy to come then it all narrowed to one fierce insistent question  what is itwhat is it youre afraid of  but to that too he got only the one mournful answer paralyzing in its fateful monotony  i dont knowi cant tell  it was awful to go on thus beating against this uncanny dark shadowy resistance these unreal doubts and dreads that by their very dumbness were becoming real to him too if only she could tell him what she feared it could not be povertythat was not like herbesides he had enough for both it could not be loss of a social position which was but irksome to her surely it was not fear that he would cease to love her what was it in gods namewhat  tomorrowshe had told himshe was to go down alone to the riverhouse would she not come now this very minute to him instead and they would start offthat night back to the south where their love had flowered but again it was i cant i dont knowi must have time and yet her eyes had that brooding lovelight how could she hold back and waver but utterly exhausted he did not plead again did not even resist when she said you must go now and leave me to get back i will write perhapssooni shall know he begged for and took one kiss then passing the old official went quickly up and out   xv   he reached his rooms overcome by a lassitude that was not however quite despair he had made his effort failedbut there was still within him the unconquerable hope of the passionate lover as well try to extinguish in full june the beating of the heart of summer deny to the flowers their deepening hues or to winged life its slumbrous buzzing as stifle in such a lover his conviction of fulfilment  he lay down on a couch and there stayed a long time quite still his forehead pressed against the wall his will was already beginning to recover for a fresh attempt it was merciful that she was going away from cramier going to where he had in fancy watched her feed her doves no laws no fears not even her commands could stop his fancy from conjuring her up by day and night he had but to close his eyes and she was there  a ring at the bell repeated several times roused him at last to go to the door his caller was robert cramier and at sight of him all lennans lethargy gave place to a steely feeling what had brought him here had he been spying on his wife the old longing for physical combat came over him cramier was perhaps fifteen years his senior but taller heavier thicker chances then were pretty equal  wont you come in he said  thanks  the voice had in it the same mockery as on sunday and it shot through him that cramier had thought to find his wife here if so he did not betray it by any crude look round he came in with his deliberate step light and wellpoised for so big a man  so this he said is where you produce your masterpieces anything great since you came back  lennan lifted the cloths from the halfmodelled figure of his bullman he felt malicious pleasure in doing that would cramier recognize himself in this creature with the hornlike ears and great bossed forehead if this man who had her happiness beneath his heel had come here to mock he should at all events get what he had come to give and he waited  i see you are giving the poor brute horns  if cramier had seen he had dared to add a touch of cynical humour which the sculptor himself had never thought of and this even evoked in the young man a kind of admiring compunction  those are not horns he said gently only ears  cramier lifted a hand and touched the edge of his own ear  not quite like that are theyhuman ears but i suppose you would call this symbolic what if i may ask does it represent  all the softness in lennan vanished  if you cant gather that from looking it must be a failure  not at all if i am right you want something for it to tread on dont you to get your full effect  lennan touched the base of the clay  the broken curve herethen with sudden disgust at this fencing was silent what had the man come for he must want something and as if answering cramier said  to pass to another subjectyou see a good deal of my wife i just wanted to tell you that i dont very much care that you should it is as well to be quite frank i think  lennan bowed  is that not he said perhaps rather a matter for her decision  that heavy figurethose threatening eyes the whole thing was like a dream come true  i do not feel it so i am not one of those who let things drift please understand me you come between us at your peril  lennan kept silence for a moment then he said quietly  can one come between two people who have ceased to have anything in common  the veins in cramiers forehead were swollen his face and neck had grown crimson and lennan thought with strange elation now hes going to hit me he could hardly keep his hands from shooting out and seizing in advance that great strong neck if he could strangle and have done with him  but quite suddenly cramier turned on his heel i have warned you he said and went  lennan took a long breath so that was over and he knew where he was if cramier had struck out he would surely have seized his neck and held on till life was gone nothing should have shaken him off in fancy he could see himself swaying writhing reeling battered about by those heavy fists but always with his hands on the thick neck squeezing out its life he could feel absolutely feel the last reel and stagger of that great bulk crashing down dragging him with it till it lay upturned still he covered his eyes with his hands thank god the fellow had not hit out  he went to the door opened it and stood leaning against the doorpost all was still and drowsy out there in that quiet backwater of a street not a soul in sight how still for london only the birds in a neighbouring studio someone was playing chopin queer he had almost forgotten there was such a thing as chopin a mazurka spinning like some top thing round and roundweird little tune well and what now only one thing certain sooner give up life than give her up far sooner love her achieve heror give up everything and drown to that tune going on and on that little dancing dirge of summer   xvi   at her cottage olive stood often by the river  what lay beneath all that bright waterwhat strange deep swaying life so far below the ruffling of wind and the shadows of the willow trees was love down there too love between sentient things where it was almost dark or had all passion climbed up to rustle with the reeds and float with the waterflowers in the sunlight was there colour or had colour been drowned no scent and no music but movement there would be for all the dim groping things bending one way to the currentmovement no less than in the aspenleaves never quite still and the winged droves of the clouds and if it were dark down there it was dark too above the water and hearts ached and eyes just as much searched for that which did not come  to watch it always flowing by to the sea never looking back never swaying this way or that drifting along quiet as fatedark or glamorous with the gold and moonlight of these beautiful days and nights when every flower in her garden in the fields and along the river banks was full of sweet life when dogroses starred the lanes and in the wood the bracken was nearly a foot high  she was not alone there though she would much rather have been two days after she left london her uncle and aunt had joined her it was from cramier they had received their invitation he himself had not yet been down  every night having parted from mrs ercott and gone up the wide shallow stairs to her room she would sit down at the window to write to lennan one candle beside herone pale flame for comrade as it might be his spirit every evening she poured out to him her thoughts and ended always have patience she was still waiting for courage to pass that dark hedge of impalpable doubts and fears and scruples of a dread that she could not make articulate even to herself having finished she would lean out into the night the colonel his black figure cloaked against the dew would be pacing up and down the lawn with his goodnight cigar whose fiery spark she could just discern and beyond her ghostly dovehouse and beyond the riverflowing then she would clasp herself closeafraid to stretch out her arms lest she should be seen  each morning she rose early dressed and slipped away to the village to post her letter from the woods across the river wild pigeons would be callingas though love itself pleaded with her afresh each day she was back well before breakfast to go up to her room and come down again as if for the first time the colonel meeting her on the stairs or in the hall would say ah my dear just beaten you slept well and while her lips touched his cheek slanted at the proper angle for uncles he never dreamed that she had been three miles already through the dew  now that she was in the throes of an indecision whose ending one way or the other must be so tremendous now that she was in the very swirl she let no sign at all escape her the colonel and even his wife were deceived into thinking that after all no great harm had been done it was grateful to them to think so because of that stewardship at monte carlo of which they could not render too good account the warm sleepy days with a little croquet and a little paddling on the river and much sitting out of doors when the colonel would read aloud from tennyson were very pleasant to himif not to mrs ercottit was especially jolly to be out of town this confounded crowded time of year and so the days of early june went by each finer than the last  and then cramier came down without warning on a friday evening it was hot in londonthe session dull the jubilee turning everything upside down they were lucky to be out of town  a silent dinnerthat  mrs ercott noticed that he drank wine like water and for minutes at a time fixed his eyes that looked heavy as if he had not been sleeping not on his wifes face but on her neck if olive really disliked and feared himas john would have itshe disguised her feelings very well for so pale a woman she was looking brilliant that night the sun had caught her cheeks perhaps that black lowcut frock suited her with old milanesepoint lace matching her skin so well and one carnation of darkest red at her breast her eyes were really sometimes like black velvet it suited pale women to have those eyes that looked so black at night she was talking too and laughing more than usual one would have said a wife delighted to welcome her husband and yet there was somethingsomething in the air in the feel of thingsthe lowering fixity of that mans eyes orthunder coming after all this heat surely the night was unnaturally still and dark hardly a breath of air and so many moths out there passing the beam of light like little pale spirits crossing a river mrs ercott smiled pleased at that image moths men were like moths there were women from whom they could not keep away yes there was something about olive that drew men to her not meretriciousto do her justice not that at all but something soft andfatal like one of these candleflames to the poor moths johns eyes were never quite as she knew them when he was looking at olive and robert cramierswhat a queer drugged look they had as for that other poor young fellowshe had never forgotten his face when they came on him in the park  and when after dinner they sat on the veranda they were all more silent still just watching it seemed the smoke of their cigarettes rising quite straight as though wind had been withdrawn from the world the colonel twice endeavoured to speak about the moon it ought to be up by now it was going to be full  and then cramier said put on that scarf thing olive and come round the garden with me  mrs ercott admitted to herself now that what john said was true just one gleam of eyes turned quickly this way and that as a bird looks for escape and then olive had got up and quietly gone with him down the path till their silent figures were lost to sight  disturbed to the heart mrs ercott rose and went over to her husbands chair he was frowning and staring at his evening shoe balanced on a single toe he looked up at her and put out his hand mrs ercott gave it a squeeze she wanted comfort  the colonel spoke  its heavy tonight dolly i dont like the feel of it   xvii   they had passed without a single word spoken down through the laurels and guelder roses to the river bank then he had turned to the right and gone along it under the dovehouse to the yewtrees there he had stopped in the pitch darkness of that foliage it seemed to her dreadfully still if only there had been the faintest breeze the faintest lisping of reeds on the water one bird to make a sound but nothing nothing save his breathing deep irregular with a quiver in it what had he brought her here for to show her how utterly she was his was he never going to speak never going to say whatever it was he had in mind to say if only he would not touch her  then he moved and a stone dislodged fell with a splash into the water she could not help a little gasp how black the river looked but slowly beyond the dim shape of the giant poplar a shiver of light stole outwards across the blackness from the far bankthe moon whose rim she could now see rising of a thick gold like a coin above the woods her heart went out to that warm light at all events there was one friendly inhabitant of this darkness  suddenly she felt his hands on her waist she did not move her heart beat too furiously but a sort of prayer fluttered up from it against her lips in the grip of those heavy hands was such quivering force  his voice sounded very husky and strange olive this cant go on i suffer my god i suffer  a pang went through her a sort of surprise suffer she might wish him dead but she did not want him to suffergod knew and yet gripped by those hands she could not say i am sorry  he made a sound that was almost a groan and dropped on his knees feeling herself held fast she tried to push his forehead back from her waist it was fiery hot and she heard him mutter have mercy love me a little but the clutch of his hands never still on the thin silk of her dress turned her faint she tried to writhe away but could not stood still again and at last found her voice  mercy can i make myself love no one ever could since the world began please please get up let me go  but he was pulling her down to him so that she was forced on to her knees on the grass with her face close to his a low moaning was coming from him it was horribleso horrible and he went on pleading the words all confused not looking in her face it seemed to her that it would never end that she would never get free of that grip away from that stammering whispering voice she stayed by instinct utterly still closing her eyes then she felt his gaze for the first time that evening on her face and realized that he had not dared to look until her eyes were closed for fear of reading what was in them she said very gently  please let me go i think im going to faint  he relaxed the grip of his arms she sank down and stayed unmoving on the grass after such utter stillness that she hardly knew whether he were there or not she felt his hot hand on her bare shoulder was it all to begin again she shrank down lower still and a little moan escaped her he let her go suddenly and when at last she looked up was gone  she got to her feet trembling and moved quickly from under the yewtrees she tried to thinktried to understand exactly what this portended for her for him for her lover but she could not there was around her thoughts the same breathless darkness that brooded over this night ah but to the night had been given that palegold moonray to herself nothing no faintest gleam as well try to pierce below the dark surface of that water  she passed her hands over her face and hair and dress how long had it lasted how long had they been out here and she began slowly moving back towards the house thank god she had not yielded to fear or pity not uttered falsities not pretended she could love him and betrayed her heart that would have been the one unbearable thing to have been left remembering she stood long looking down as if trying to see the future in her dim flowerbeds then bracing herself hurried to the house no one was on the veranda no one in the drawingroom she looked at the clock nearly eleven ringing for the servant to shut the windows she stole up to her room had her husband gone away as he had come or would she presently again be face to face with that dread the nerve of which never stopped aching now dread of the night when he was near she determined not to go to bed and drawing a long chair to the window wrapped herself in a gown and lay back  the flower from her dress miraculously uncrushed in those dark minutes on the grass she set in water beside her at the windowmarks favourite flower he had once told her it was a comfort with its scent and hue and memory of him  strange that in her life with all the faces seen and people known she had not loved one till she had met lennan she had even been sure that love would never come to her had not wanted itvery much had thought to go on well enough and pass out at the end never having known or much cared to know full summer love had taken its revenge on her now for all slighted love offered her in the past for the one hated love that had tonight been on its knees to her they said it must always come once to every man and womanthis witchery this dark sweet feeling springing up who knew how or why she had not believed but now she knew and whatever might be coming she would not have this different since all things changed she must change and get old and be no longer pretty for him to look at but this in her heart could not change she felt sure of that it was as if something said this is for ever beyond life beyond death this is for ever he will be dust and you dust but your love will live somewherein the woods among the flowers or down in the dark water it will haunt for it only you have lived then she noticed that a slender silverywinged thing unlike any moth she had ever seen had settled on her gown close to her neck it seemed to be sleeping so delicate and drowsy having come in from the breathless dark thinking perhaps that her whiteness was a light what dim memory did it rouse something of him something he had donein darkness on a night like this ah yes that evening after gorbio the little owlmoth on her knee he had touched her when he took that cosy wan velveteyed thing off her  she leaned out for air what a nightwhose stars were hiding in the sheer heavy warmth whose small round golden moon had no transparency a night like a black pansy with a little gold heart and silent for of the trees that whispered so much at night not even the aspens had voice the unstirring air had a dreamsolidity against her cheeks but in all the stillness what sentiency what passionas in her heart could she not draw him to her from those woods from that dark gleaming river draw him from the flowers and trees and the passionmood of the skydraw him up to her waiting here so that she was no more this craving creature but one with him and the night and she let her head droop down on her hands  all night long she stayed there at the window sometimes dozing in the chair once waking with a start fancying that her husband was bending over her had he beenand stolen away and the dawn came dewgrey filmy and wistful woven round each black tree and round the white dovecot and falling scarflike along the river and the chirrupings of birds stirred among leaves as yet invisible  she slept then   xviii   when she awoke once more in daylight smiling cramier was standing beside her chair his face all dark and bitter had the sodden look of a man very tired  so he said sleeping this way doesnt spoil your dreams dont let me disturb them i am just going back to town  like a frightened bird she stayed not stirring gazing at his back as he leaned in the window till turning round on her again he said  but remember this what i cant have no one else shall do you understand no one else and he bent down close repeating do you understandyou bad wife  four years submission to a touch she shrank from one long effort not to shrink bad wife not if he killed her would she answer now  do you hear he said once more make up your mind to that i mean it  he had gripped the arms of her chair till she could feel it quiver beneath her would he drive his fist into her face that she managed to keep still smiling but there only passed into his eyes an expression which she could not read  well he said you know and walked heavily towards the door  the moment he had gone she sprang up yes she was a bad wife a wife who had reached the end of her tether a wife who hated instead of loving a wife in prison bad wife martyrdom then for the sake of a faith in her that was lost already could be but folly if she seemed bad and false to him there was no longer reason to pretend to be otherwise no longer would she in the words of the old songsit and sighpulling bracken pulling bracken no more would she starve for want of love and watch the nights throb and ache as last night had throbbed and ached with the passion that she might not satisfy  and while she was dressing she wondered why she did not look tired to get out quickly to send her lover word at once to hasten to her while it was safethat she might tell him she was coming to him out of prison she would telegraph for him to come that evening with a boat opposite the tall poplar she and her aunt and uncle were to go to dinner at the rectory but she would plead headache at the last minute when the ercotts had gone she would slip out and he and she would row over to the wood and be together for two hours of happiness and they must make a clear plan toofor tomorrow they would begin their life together but it would not be safe to send that message from the village she must go down and over the bridge to the postoffice on the other side where they did not know her it was too late now before breakfast better after when she could slip away knowing for certain that her husband had gone it would still not be too late for her telegramlennan never left his rooms till the midday post which brought her letters  she finished dressing and knowing that she must show no trace of her excitement sat quite still for several minutes forcing herself into languor then she went down her husband had breakfasted and gone at everything she did and every word she spoke she was now smiling with a sort of wonder as if she were watching a self that she had abandoned like an old garment perform for her amusement it even gave her no feeling of remorse to think she was going to do what would be so painful to the good colonel he was dear to herbut it did not matter she was past all that nothing matterednothing in the world it amused her to believe that her uncle and aunt misread her last nights walk in the dark garden misread her languor and serenity and at the first moment possible she flew out and slipped away under cover of the yewtrees towards the river passing the spot where her husband had dragged her down to him on her knees in the grass she felt a sort of surprise that she could ever have been so terrified what was he the pastnothing and she flew on she noted carefully the river bank opposite the tall poplar it would be quite easy to get down from there into a boat but they would not stay in that dark backwater they would go over to the far side into those woods from which last night the moon had risen those woods from which the pigeons mocked her every morning those woods so full of summer coming back no one would see her landing for it would be pitch dark in the backwater and while she hurried she looked back across her shoulder marking where the water entering ceased to be bright a dragonfly brushed her cheek she saw it vanish where the sunlight failed how suddenly its happy flight was quenched in that dark shade as a candle flame blown out the tree growth there was too thickthe queer stumps and snags had uncanny shapes as of monstrous creatures whose eyes seemed to peer out at you she shivered she had seen those monsters with their peering eyes somewhere ah in her dream at monte carlo of that bullface staring from the banks while she drifted by unable to cry out no the backwater was not a happy placethey would not stay there a single minute and more swiftly than ever she flew on along the path soon she had crossed the bridge sent off her message and returned but there were ten hours to get through before eight oclock and she did not hurry now she wanted this day of summer to herself alone a day of dreaming till he came this day for which all her life till now had been shaping herthe day of love fate was very wonderful if she had ever loved before if she had known joy in her marriageshe could never have been feeling what she was feeling now what she well knew she would never feel again she crossed a newmown hayfield and finding a bank threw herself down on her back among its uncut grasses far away at the other end men were scything it was all very beautifulthe soft clouds floating the cloverstalks pushing themselves against her palms and stems of the tall couch grass cool to her cheeks little blue butterflies a lark invisible the scent of the ripe hay and the goldfairy arrows of the sun on her face and limbs to grow and reach the hour of summer all must do that that was the meaning of life she had no more doubts and fears she had no more dread no bitterness and no remorse for what she was going to do she was doing it because she must as well might grass stay its ripening because it shall be cut down she had instead a sense of something blessed and uplifting whatever power had made her heart had placed within it this love whatever it was whoever it was could not be angry with her  a wild bee settled on her arm and she held it up between her and the sun so that she might enjoy its dusky glamour it would not sting hernot today the little blue butterflies too kept alighting on her who lay there so still and the lovesongs of the woodpigeons never ceased nor the faint swish of scything  at last she rose to make her way home a telegram had come saying simply yes she read it with an unmoved face having resorted again to her mask of languor toward teatime she confessed to headache and said she would lie down up there in her room she spent those three hours writingwriting as best she could all she had passed through in thought and feeling before making her decision it seemed to her that she owed it to herself to tell her lover how she had come to what she had never thought to come to she put what she had written in an envelope and sealed it she would give it to him that he might read and understand when she had shown him with all of her how she loved him it would pass the time for him until tomorrowuntil they set out on their new life together for tonight they would make their plans and tomorrow start  at halfpast seven she sent word that her headache was too bad to allow her to go out this brought a visit from mrs ercott the colonel and she were so distressed but perhaps olive was wise not to exert herself and presently the colonel himself spoke lugubriously through the door not well enough to come no fun without her but she mustnt on any account strain herself no no  her heart smote her at that he was always so good to her  at last watching from the corridor she saw them sally forth down the drivethe colonel a little in advance carrying his wifes evening shoes how nice he lookedwith his brown face and his grey moustache so upright and concerned with what he had in hand  there was no languor in her now she had dressed in white and now she took a blue silk cloak with a hood and caught up the flower that had so miraculously survived last nights wearing and pinned it at her breast then making sure no servant was about she slipped downstairs and out it was just eight and the sun still glistened on the dovecot she kept away from that lest the birds should come fluttering about her and betray her by cooing when she had nearly reached the towpath she stopped affrighted surely something had moved something heavy with a sound of broken branches was it the memory of last night come on her again or indeed someone there she walked back a few steps foolish alarm in the meadow beyond a cow was brushing against the hedge and stealing along the grass out on to the towpath she went swiftly towards the poplar   xix   a hundred times in these days of her absence lennan had been on the point of going down against her orders just to pass the house just to feel himself within reach to catch a glimpse of her perhaps from afar if his body haunted london his spirit had passed down on to that river where he had drifted once already reconnoitring a hundred timesby day in fancy and by night in dreamspulling himself along by the boughs he stole down that dim backwater till the dark yews and the white dovecot came into view  for he thought now only of fulfilment she was wasting cruelly away why should he leave her where she was leave her to profane herself and all womanhood in the arms of a man she hated  and on that day of midjune when he received her telegram it was as if he had been handed the key of paradise  would shecould she mean to come away with him that very night he would prepare for that at all events he had so often in mind faced this crisis in his affairs that now it only meant translating into action what had been carefully thought out he packed supplied himself liberally with money and wrote a long letter to his guardian it would hurt the old mangordy was over seventy nowbut that could not be helped he would not post it till he knew for certain  after telling how it had all come about he went on thus i know that to many people and perhaps to you gordy it will seem very wrong but it does not to me and that is the simple truth everybody has his own views on such things i suppose and as i would noton my honour gordyever have held or wished to hold or ever will hold in marriage or out of marriage any woman who does not love me so i do not think it is acting as i would resent others acting towards me to take away from such unhappiness this lady for whom i would die at any minute i do not mean to say that pity has anything to do with iti thought so at first but i know now that it is all swallowed up in the most mighty feeling i have ever had or ever shall have i am not a bit afraid of conscience if god is universal truth he cannot look hardly upon us for being true to ourselves and as to people we shall just hold up our heads i think that they generally take you at your own valuation but anyway society does not much matter we shant want those who dont want usyou may be sure i hope he will divorce her quicklythere is nobody much to be hurt by that except you and cis but if he doesntit cant be helped i dont think she has anything but with my six hundred and what i can make even if we have to live abroad we shall be all right for money you have been awfully good to me always gordy and i am very grieved to hurt you and still more sorry if you think i am being ungrateful but when one feels as i dobody and soul and spiritthere isnt any question there wouldnt be if death itself stood in the way if you receive this we shall be gone together i will write to you from wherever we pitch our tent and of course i shall write to cicely but will you please tell mrs doone and sylvia and give them my love if they still care to have it goodbye dear gordy i believe you would have done the same if you had been i always your affectionatemark  in all those preparations he forgot nothing employing every minute of the few hours in a sort of methodic exaltation the last thing before setting out he took the damp cloths off his bullman into the face of the monster there had come of late a hungry yearning look the artist in him had done his work that unconscious justice against his will had set down the truth and wondering whether he would ever work at it again he redamped the cloths and wrapped it carefully  he did not go to her village but to one five or six miles down the riverit was safer and the row would steady him hiring a skiff he pulled up stream he travelled very slowly to kill time keeping under the far bank and as he pulled his very heart seemed parched with nervousness was it real that he was going to her or only some fantastic trick of fate a dream from which he would wake to find himself alone again he passed the dovecot at last and kept on till he could round into the backwater and steal up under cover to the poplar he arrived a few minutes before eight oclock turned the boat round and waited close beneath the bank holding to a branch and standing so that he could see the path if a man could die from longing and anxiety surely lennan must have died then  all wind had failed and the day was fallen into a wonderful still evening gnats were dancing in the sparse strips of sunlight that slanted across the dark water now that the sun was low from the fields bereft of workers came the scent of hay and the heavy scent of meadowsweet the musky odour of the backwater was confused with them into one brooding perfume no one passed and sounds were few and far to that wistful listener for birds did not sing just there how still and warm was the air yet seemed to vibrate against his cheeks as though about to break into flame that fancy came to him vividly while he stood waitinga vision of heat simmering in little pale red flames on the thick reeds some large slow dusky flies were still feeding and now and then a moorhen a few yards away splashed a little or uttered a sharp shrill note when she cameif she did comethey would not stay here in this dark earthy backwater he would take her over to the other side away to the woods but the minutes passed and his heart sank then it leaped up someone was comingin white with bare head and something blue or black flung across her arm it was she no one else walked like that she came very quickly and he noticed that her hair looked like little wings on either side of her brow as if her face were a white bird with dark wings flying to love now she was close so close that he could see her lips parted and her eyes lovelightedlike nothing in the world but darkness wild with dew and starlight he reached up and lifted her down into the boat and the scent of some flower pressed against his face seemed to pierce into him and reach his very heart awakening the memory of something past forgotten then seizing the branches snapping them in his haste he dragged the skiff along through the sluggish water the gnats dancing in his face she seemed to know where he was taking her and neither of them spoke a single word while he pulled out into the open and over to the far bank  there was but one field between them and the wooda field of young wheat with a hedge of thorn and alder and close to that hedge they set out their hands clasped they had nothing to say yetlike children saving up she had put on her cloak to hide her dress and its silk swished against the silvery blades of the wheat what had moved her to put on this blue cloak blue of the sky and flowers of birds wings and the blackburning blue of the night the hue of all holy things and how still it was in the late gleam of the sun not one little sound of beast or bird or tree not one bee humming and not much colouronly the starry white hemlocks and globecampion flowers and the lowflying glamour of the last warm light on the wheat   xx      now over wood and river the evening drew in fast and first the swallows that had looked as if they would never stay their hunting ceased and the light that had seemed fastened above the world for all its last brightenings slowly fell wingless and dusky  the moon would not rise till ten and all things waited the creatures of night were slow to come forth after that long bright summers day watching for the shades of the trees to sink deeper and deeper into the now chalkwhite water watching for the chalkwhite face of the sky to be masked with velvet the very blackplumed trees themselves seemed to wait in suspense for the grapebloom of night all things stared wan in that hour of passing dayall things had eyes wistful and unblessed in those moments glamour was so dead that it was as if meaning had abandoned the earth but not for long winged with darkness it stole back not the soul of meaning that had gone but a witchlike and brooding spirit harbouring in the black trees in the high dark spears of the rushes and on the grimsnouted snags that lurked along the river bank then the owls came out and nightflying things and in the wood there began a cruel birdtragedysome dark pursuit in the twilight above the bracken the piercing shrieks of a creature into whom talons have again and again gone home and mingled with them hoarse raging cries of triumph many minutes they lasted those noises of the night soundemblems of all the cruelty in the heart of nature till at last death appeased that savagery and any soul abroad that pitied fugitives might once more listen and not weep  then a nightingale began to give forth its long liquid gurgling and a corncrake churred in the young wheat again the night brooded in the silent tops of the trees in the more silent depths of the water it sent out at long intervals a sigh or murmur a tiny scuttling splash an owls hunting cry and its breath was still hot and charged with heavy odour for no dew was falling   xxi   it was past ten when they came out from the wood she had wanted to wait for the moon to rise not a gold coin of a moon as last night but ivory pale and with a gleaming radiance level over the fern and covering the lower boughs as it were with a drift of white blossom  through the wicket gate they passed once more beside the mooncoloured wheat which seemed of a different world from that world in which they had walked but an hour and a half ago  and in lennans heart was a feeling such as a mans heart can only know once in all his lifesuch humble gratitude and praise and adoration of her who had given him her all there should be nothing for her now but joylike the joy of this last hour she should never know less happiness and kneeling down before her at the waters edge he kissed her dress and hands and feet which tomorrow would be his forever  then they got into the boat  the smile of the moonlight glided over each ripple and reed and closing waterlily over her face where the hood had fallen back from her loosened hair over one hand trailing the water and the other touching the flower at her breast and just above her breath she said  row my dear love its late  dipping his sculls he shot the skiff into the darkness of the backwater  what happened then he never knew never clearlyin all those after years a vision of her white form risen to its feet bending forward like a creature caught that cannot tell which way to spring a crashing shock his head striking something hard nothingness and thenan awful awful struggle with roots and weeds and slime a desperate agony of groping in that pitchy blackness among treestumps in dead water that seemed to have no bottomhe and that other who had leaped at them in the dark with his boat like a murdering beast a nightmare search more horrible than words could tell till in a patch of moonlight on the bank they laid her who for all their efforts never stirred there she lay all white and they two crouched at her head and feetlike dark creatures of the woods and waters over that which with their hunting they had slain  how long they stayed there not once looking at each other not once speaking not once ceasing to touch with their hands that dead thinghe never knew how long in the summer night with its moonlight and its shadows quivering round them and the night wind talking in the reeds  and then the most enduring of all sentient things had moved in him again so that he once more felt never again to see those eyes that had loved him with their light never again to kiss her lips frozenlike moonlight to the earth with the flower still clinging at her breast thrown out on the bank like a plucked waterlily dead no no not dead alive in the nightalive to himsomewhere not on this dim bank in this hideous backwater with that dark dumb creature who had destroyed her out there on the riverin the wood of their happinesssomewhere alive and staggering up past cramier who never moved he got into his boat and like one demented pulled out into the stream  but once there in the tide he fell huddled forward motionless above his oars  and the moonlight flooded his dark skiff drifting down and the moonlight effaced the ripples on the water that had stolen away her spirit her spirit mingled now with the white beauty and the shadows for ever part of the stillness and the passion of a summer night hovering floating listening to the rustle of the reeds and the whispering of the woods one with the endless dreamthat spirit passing out as all might wish to pass in the hour of happiness     part iiiautumn   i   when on that november night lennan stole to the open door of his dressingroom and stood watching his wife asleep fate still waited for an answer  a low fire was burningone of those fires that throw faint shadows everywhere and once and again glow so that some object shines for a moment some shape is clearly seen the curtains were not quite drawn and a planetree branch with leaves still hanging which had kept them company all the fifteen years they had lived there was moving darkly in the wind now touching the glass with a frail tap as though asking of him who had been roaming in that wind so many hours to let it in unfailing comradeslondon planetrees  he had not dared hope that sylvia would be asleep it was merciful that she was whichever way the issue wentthat issue so cruel her face was turned towards the fire and one hand rested beneath her cheek so she often slept even when life seemed all at sea its landmarks lost one still did what was customary poor tenderhearted thingshe had not slept since he told her fortyeight hours that seemed such years ago with her flaxen hair and her touching candour even in sleep she looked like a girl lying there not so greatly changed from what she had been that summer of cicelys marriage down at hayle her face had not grown old in all those twentyeight years there had been till now no special reason why it should thought strong feeling suffering those were what changed faces sylvia had never thought very deeply never suffered much till now and was it for him who had been careful of hervery careful on the whole despite mans selfishness despite her never having understood the depths of himwas it for him of all people to hurt her so to stamp her face with sorrow perhaps destroy her utterly  he crept a little farther in and sat down in the armchair beyond the fire what memories a fire gathered into it with its flaky ashes its little leaflike flames and that quiet glow and flicker what tale of passions how like to a fire was a mans heart the first young fitful leapings the sudden fierce mastering heat the long steady sober burning and thenthat last flamingup that clutch back at its own vanished youth the final eager flight of flame before the ashes wintered it to nothing visions and memories he saw down in the fire as only can be seen when a mans heart by the agony of long struggle has been stripped of skin and quivers at every touch love a strange haphazard thing was loveso spun between ecstacy and torture a thing insidious irresponsible desperate a flying sweetness more poignant than anything on earth more dark in origin and destiny a thing without reason or coherence a mans lovelifewhat say had he in the ebb and flow of it no more than in the flights of autumn birds swooping down alighting here and there passing on the loves one left behindeven in a life by no means vagabond in love as mens lives went the love that thought the tyrol skies would fall if he were not first with a certain lady the love whose star had caught in the hair of sylvia now lying there asleep a socalled lovethat halfglamorous yet sordid little meal of pleasure which youth however sensitive must eat it seems some time or other with some young light of lovea glimpse of life that beforehand had seemed much and had meant little save to leave him disillusioned with himself and sorry for his partner and then the love that he could not even after twenty years bear to remember that alldevouring summer passion which in one night had gained all and lost all terribly leaving on his soul a scar that could never be quite healed leaving his spirit always a little lonely haunted by the sense of what might have been of his share in that night of tragedythat terrible accident on the riverno one had ever dreamed and then the long despair which had seemed the last death of love had slowly passed and yet another love had been bornor rather born again pale sober but quite real the fresh springingup of a feeling long forgotten of that protective devotion of his boyhood he still remembered the expression on sylvias face when he passed her by chance in oxford street soon after he came back from his four years of exile in the east and romethat look eager yet reproachful then stoically ironic as if saying oh no after forgetting me four years and moreyou cant remember me now and when he spoke the still more touching pleasure in her face then uncertain months with a feeling of what the end would be and then their marriage happy enoughgentle not very vivid nor spiritually very intimatehis work always secretly as remote from her as when she had thought to please him by putting jessamine stars on the heads of his beasts a quiet successful union not meaning he had thought so very much to him nor so very much to heruntil fortyeight hours ago he told her and she had shrunk and wilted and gone all to pieces and what was it he had told her  a long storythat  sitting there by the fire with nothing yet decided he could see it all from the start with its devilish delicate intricacy its subtle slow enchantment spinning itself out of him out of his own state of mind and body rather than out of the spell cast over him as though a sort of fatal force long dormant were working up again to burst into dark flower   ii   yes it had begun within him over a year ago with a queer unhappy restlessness a feeling that life was slipping ebbing away within reach of him and his arms never stretched out to arrest it it had begun with a sort of long craving stilled only when he was working harda craving for he knew not what an ache which was worst whenever the wind was soft  they said that about fortyfive was a perilous age for a manespecially for an artist all the autumn of last year he had felt this vague misery rather badly it had left him alone most of december and january while he was working so hard at his group of lions but the moment that was finished it had gripped him hard again in those last days of january he well remembered wandering about in the parks day after day trying to get away from it mild weather with a scent in the wind with what avidity he had watched children playing the premature buds on the bushes anything everything youngwith what an ache too he had been conscious of innumerable lives being lived round him and loves loved and he outside unable to know to grasp to gather them and all the time the sands of his hourglass running out a most absurd and unreasonable feeling for a man with everything he wanted with work that he loved quite enough money and a wife so good as sylviaa feeling that no englishman of fortysix in excellent health ought for a moment to have been troubled with a feeling such as indeed no englishman ever admitted havingso that there was not even as yet a society for its suppression for what was this disquiet feeling but the sense that he had had his day would never again know the stir and fearful joy of falling in love but only just hanker after what was past and gone could anything be more reprehensible in a married man  it wasyesthe last day of january when returning from one of those restless rambles in hyde park he met dromore queer to recognize a man hardly seen since schooldays yet unmistakably johnny dromore sauntering along the rails of piccadilly on the green park side with that slightly rolling gait of his thin horsemans legs his dandified hat a little to one side those strange chaffing goggling eyes that look as if making a perpetual bet yesthe very same teasing now moody now reckless always astute johnny dromore with a good heart beneath an outside that seemed ashamed of it truly to have shared a room at schoolto have been at college together were links mysteriously indestructible  mark lennan by gum havent seen you for ages not since you turned out a fullblownwhat dyou call it awfully glad to meet you old chap here was the past indeed long vanished in feeling and thought and all and lennans head buzzed trying to find some common interest with this hunting racing manabouttown  johnny dromore come to life againhe whom the machine had stamped with astute simplicity by the time he was twentytwo and for ever after left untouched in thought and feelingjohnny dromore who would never pass beyond the philosophy that all was queer and freakish which had not to do with horses women wine cigars jokes goodheartedness and that perpetual bet johnny dromore who somewhere in him had a pocket of depth a streak of hunger that was not just johnny dromore  how queer was the sound of that jerky talk  you ever see old fookes now been racin at all you live in town remember good old blenker and then silence and then another spurt ever go down to bamburys ever go racin    come on up to my digs youve got nothin to do no persuading johnny dromore that a what dyou call it could have anything to do come on old chap ive got the hump its this damned east wind  well he remembered it when they shared a room at bamburysthat hump of johnny dromores after some reckless spree or bout of teasing  and down that narrow byestreet of piccadilly he had gone and up into those digs on the first floor with their little dark hall their van beers drawing and vanity fair cartoons and prints of racehorses and of the old nightgown steeplechase with the big chairs and all the paraphernalia of race guides and raceglasses foxmasks and stagshorns and huntingwhips and yet something that from the first moment struck him as not quite in keeping foreign to the picturea little jumble of books a vase of flowers a grey kitten  sit down old chap whatll you drink  sunk into the recesses of a marvellous chair with huge arms of tawny leather he listened and spoke drowsily bamburys oxford gordys clubsdear old gordy gone nowthings long passed by they seemed all round him once again and yet always that vague sense threading this resurrection threading the smoke of their cigars and johnny dromores clipped talkof something that did not quite belong might it be perhaps that sepia drawingabove the tantalus on the oak sideboard at the far endof a womans face gazing out into the room mysteriously unlike everything else except the flowers and this kitten that was pushing its furry little head against his hand odd how a single thing sometimes took possession of a room however remote in spirit it seemed to reach like a shadow over dromores outstretched limbs and weathered longnosed face behind his huge cigar over the queer solemn chaffing eyes with something brooding in the depths of them  ever get the hump bally awful isnt it its getting old were bally old you know lenny ah no one had called him lenny for twenty years and it was true they were unmentionably old  when a fellow begins to feel old you know its time he went brokeor something doesnt bear sittin down and lookin at come out to monte with me  monte that old wound never quite healed started throbbing at the word so that he could hardly speak his no i dont care for monte  and at once he saw dromores eyes probing questioning  you married  yes  never thought of you as married  so dromore did think of him queer he never thought of johnny dromore  winters bally awful when youre not huntin youve changed a lot should hardly have known you last time i saw you youd just come back from rome or somewhere whats it like bein aa sculptor saw something of yours once ever do things of horses  yes he had done a relief of ponies only last year  you do women too i spose  not often  the eyes goggled slightly quaint that unholy interest just like boys the johnny dromoreswould never grow up no matter how life treated them if dromore spoke out his soul as he used to speak it out at bamburys he would say you get a pull there you have a bally good time i expect that was the way it took them just a converse manifestation of the very same feeling towards art that the pious philistines had with their deploring eyebrows and their peril to the soul babes all not a glimmering of what art meantof its effort and its yearnings  you make money at it  oh yes  again that appreciative goggle as who should say ho theres more in this than i thought  a long silence then in the dusk with the violet glimmer from outside the windows the fire flickering in front of them the grey kitten purring against his neck the smoke of their cigars going up and such a strange dozing sense of rest as he had not known for many days and thensomething someone at the door over by the sideboard and dromore speaking in a queer voice  come in nell dyou know my daughter  a hand took lennans a hand that seemed to waver between the aplomb of a woman of the world and a childs impulsive warmth and a voice young clipped clear said  how dyou do shes rather sweet isnt shemy kitten  then dromore turned the light up a figure fairly tall in a grey ridinghabit stupendously well cut a face not quite so round as a childs nor so shaped as a womans blushing slightly very calm crinkly lightbrown hair tied back with a black ribbon under a neat hat and eyes like those eyes of gainsboroughs perditaslow grey mesmeric with long lashes curling up eyes that draw things to them still innocent  and just on the point of saying i thought youd stepped out of that picturehe saw dromores face and mumbled instead  so its your kitten  yes she goes to everybody do you like persians shes all fur really feel  entering with his fingers the recesses of the kitten he said  cats without fur are queer  have you seen one without fur  oh yes in my profession we have to go below furim a sculptor  that must be awfully interesting  what a woman of the world but what a child too and now he could see that the face in the sepia drawing was older altogetherlips not so full look not so innocent cheeks not so round and something sad and desperate about ita face that life had rudely touched but the same eyes it hadand what charm for all its disillusionment its air of a history then he noticed fastened to the frame on a thin rod a dustcoloured curtain drawn to one side the selfpossessed young voice was saying  would you mind if i showed you my drawings it would be awfully good of you you could tell me about them and with dismay he saw her open a portfolio while he scrutinized those schoolgirl drawings he could feel her looking at him as animals do when they are making up their minds whether or no to like you then she came and stood so close that her arm pressed his he redoubled his efforts to find something good about the drawings but in truth there was nothing good and if in other matters he could lie well enough to save peoples feelings where art was concerned he never could so he merely said  you havent been taught you see  will you teach me  but before he could answer she was already effacing that naive question in her most grownup manner  of course i oughtnt to ask it would bore you awfully  after that he vaguely remembered dromores asking if he ever rode in the row and those eyes of hers following him about and her hand giving his another childish squeeze then he was on his way again down the dimlylighted stairs past an interminable array of vanity fair cartoons out into the east wind   iii   crossing the green park on his way home was he more or less restless difficult to say a little flattered certainly a little warmed yet irritated as always when he came into contact with people to whom the world of art was such an amusing unreality the notion of trying to show that child how to drawthat featherpate with her riding and her kitten and her perdita eyes quaint how she had at once made friends with him he was a little different perhaps from what she was accustomed to and how daintily she spoke a strange attractive almost lovely child certainly not more than seventeenandjohnny dromores daughter  the wind was bitter the lamps bright among the naked trees beautiful alwayslondon at night even in january even in an east wind with a beauty he never tired of its great dark chiselled shapes its gleaming lights like droves of flying stars come to earth and all warmed by the beat and stir of innumerable livesthose lives that he ached so to know and to be part of  he told sylvia of his encounter dromore the name struck her she had an old irish song the castle of dromore with a queer haunting refrain  it froze hard all the week and he began a lifesize group of their two sheepdogs then a thaw set in with that first southwest wind which brings each february a feeling of spring such as is never again recaptured and mens senses like sleepy bees in the sun go roving it awakened in him more violently than ever the thirst to be living knowing lovingthe craving for something new not this of course took him back to dromores rooms oh no just friendliness since he had not even told his old roommate where he lived or said that his wife would be glad to make his acquaintance if he cared to come round for johnny dromore had assuredly not seemed too happy under all his hardbitten air yes it was but friendly to go again  dromore was seated in his long armchair a cigar between his lips a pencil in his hand a ruffs guide on his knee beside him was a large green book there was a festive air about him very different from his spasmodic gloom of the other day and he murmured without rising  halo old manglad to see you take a pew look here agapemonewhich dyou think i ought to put her tosan diavolo or ponte canetnot more than four crosses of st paul goin to get a real good one from her this time  he who had never heard these sainted names answered  oh ponte canet without doubt but if youre working ill come in another time  lord no have a smoke ill just finish lookin out their bloodand take a pull  and so lennan sat down to watch those researches wreathed in cigar smoke and punctuated by muttered expletives they were as sacred and absorbing no doubt as his own efforts to create in clay for before dromores inner vision was the perfect racehorsehe too was creating here was no mere dodge for making money but a process hallowed by the peculiar sensation felt when one rubbed the palms of the hands together the sensation that accompanied all creative achievement once only dromore paused to turn his head and say  bally hard gettin a taproot right  real art how well an artist knew that desperate search after the point of balance the central rivet that must be found before a form would come to life and he noted that today there was no kitten no flowers no sense at all of an extraneous presenceeven the picture was curtained had the girl been just a dreama fancy conjured up by his craving after youth  then he saw that dromore had dropped the large green book and was standing before the fire  nell took to you the other day but you always were a ladys man remember the girl at coasters  coasters teashop where he would go every afternoon that he had money just for the pleasure of looking shyly at a face something beautiful to look atnothing more johnny dromore would no better understand that now than when they were at bamburys not the smallest good even trying to explain he looked up at the goggling eyes he heard the bantering voice  i sayyou are goin grey were bally old lenny a fellow gets old when he marries  and he answered  by the way i never knew that you had been  from dromores face the chaffing look went like a candleflame blown out and a coppery flush spread over it for some seconds he did not speak then jerking his head towards the picture he muttered gruffly  never had the chance of marrying there nells outside  a sort of anger leaped in lennan why should dromore speak that word as if he were ashamed of his own daughter just like his sortnone so hidebound as menabouttown flotsam on the tide of other mens opinions poor devils adrift without the one true anchorage of their own real feelings and doubtful whether dromore would be pleased or think him gushing or even distrustful of his morality he said  as for that it would only make any decent man or woman nicer to her when is she going to let me teach her drawing  dromore crossed the room drew back the curtain of the picture and in a muffled voice said  my god lenny lifes unfair nells coming killed her mother id rather it had been mebar chaff women have no luck  lennan got up from his comfortable chair for startled out of the past the memory of that summer night when yet another woman had no luck was flooding his heart with its black inextinguishable grief he said quietly  the past is past old man  dromore drew the curtain again across the picture and came back to the fire and for a full minute he stared into it  what am i to do with nell shes growing up  what have you done with her so far  shes been at school in the summer she goes to irelandive got a bit of an old place there shell be eighteen in july i shall have to introduce her to women and all that its the devil how who  lennan could only murmur my wife for one  he took his leave soon after johnny dromore bizarre guardian for that child queer life she must have of it in that bachelors den surrounded by ruffs guides what would become of her caught up by some young spark about town married to him no doubther father would see to the thoroughness of that his standard of respectability was evidently high and aftergo the way maybe of her motherthat poor thing in the picture with the alluring desperate face well it was no business of his   iv   no business of his the merest sense of comradeship then took him once more to dromores after that disclosure to prove that the word outside had no significance save in his friends own fancy to assure him again that sylvia would be very glad to welcome the child at any time she liked to come  when he had told her of that little matter of nells birth she had been silent a long minute looking in his face and then had said poor child i wonder if she knows people are so unkind even nowadays he could not himself think of anyone who would pay attention to such a thing except to be kinder to the girl but in such matters sylvia was the better judge in closer touch with general thought she met people that he did notand of a more normal species  it was rather late when he got to dromores diggings on that third visit  mr dromore sir the man saidhe had one of those strictly confidential faces bestowed by an allwise providence on servants in the neighbourhood of piccadillymr dromore sir is not in but he will be almost sure to be in to dress miss nell is in sir  and there she was sitting at the table pasting photographs into an albumlonely young creature in that abode of male middleage lennan stood unheard gazing at the back of her head with its thick crinklybrown hair tied back on her darkred frock and to the confidential mans soft  mr lennan miss he added a softer may i come in  she put her hand into his with intense composure  oh yes do if you dont mind the mess im making and with a little squeeze of the tips of his fingers added would it bore you to see my photographs  and down they sat together before the photographssnapshots of people with guns or fishingrods little groups of schoolgirls kittens dromore and herself on horseback and several of a young man with a broad daring rather goodlooking face thats oliveroliver dromoredads first cousin once removed rather nice isnt he do you like his expression  lennan did not know not her second cousin her fathers first cousin once removed and again there leaped in him that unreasoning flame of indignant pity  and how about drawing you havent come to be taught yet  she went almost as red as her frock  i thought you were only being polite i oughtnt to have asked of course i want to awfullyonly i know itll bore you  it wont at all  she looked up at that what peculiar languorous eyes they were  shall i come tomorrow then  any day you like between halfpast twelve and one  where  he took out a card  mark lennanyesi like your name i liked it the other day its awfully nice  what was in a name that she should like him because of it his fame as a sculptorsuch as it wascould have nothing to do with that for she would certainly not know of it ah but there was a lot in a namefor children in his childhood what fascination there had been in the words macaroon and spaniard and carinola and aldebaran and mr mccrae for quite a week the whole world had been mr mccraea most ordinary friend of gordys  by whatever fascination moved she talked freely enough nowof her school of riding and motoringshe seemed to love going very fast about newmarketwhich was perfect and theatresplays of the type that johnny dromore might be expected to approve these together with hamlet and king lear were all she had seen never was a girl so untouched by thought or artyet not stupid having seemingly a certain natural good taste only nothing evidently had come her way how could itjohnny dromore duce et auspice johnny dromore she had been taken indeed to the national gallery while at school and lennan had a vision of eight or ten young maidens trailing round at the skirts of one old maiden admiring landseers dogs giggling faintly at botticellis angels gaping rustling chattering like young birds in a shrubbery  but with all her surroundings this child of johnny dromoredom was as yet more innocent than cultured girls of the same age if those grey mesmeric eyes of hers followed him about they did so frankly unconsciously there was no minx in her so far  an hour went by and dromore did not come and the loneliness of this young creature in her incongruous abode began telling on lennans equanimity  what did she do in the evenings  sometimes i go to the theatre with dad generally i stay at home  and then  oh i just read or talk french  what to yourself  yes or to oliver sometimes when he comes in  so oliver came in  how long have you known oliver  oh ever since i was a child  he wanted to say and how long is that but managed to refrain and got up to go instead she caught his sleeve and said  youre not to go saying that she looked as a dog will going to bite in fun her upper lip shortened above her small white teeth set fast on her lower lip and her chin thrust a little forward a glimpse of a wilful spirit but as soon as he had smiled and murmured  ah but i must you see she at once regained her manners only saying rather mournfully you dont call me by my name dont you like it  nell  yes its really eleanor of course dont you like it  if he had detested the name he could only have answered very much  im awfully glad goodbye  when he got out into the street he felt terribly like a man who instead of having had his sleeve touched has had his heart plucked at and that warm bewildered feeling lasted him all the way home  changing for dinner he looked at himself with unwonted attention yes his dark hair was still thick but going distinctly grey there were very many lines about his eyes too and those eyes still eager when they smiled were particularly deepset as if life had forced them back his cheekbones were almost bopsies now and his cheeks very thin and dark and his jaw looked too set and bony below the almost black moustache altogether a face that life had worn a good deal with nothing for a child to take a fancy to and make friends with that he could see  sylvia came in while he was thus taking stock of himself bringing a freshlyopened flask of eaudecologne she was always bringing him somethingnever was anyone so sweet in those ways in that grey lowcut frock her white still prettiness and palegold hair so little touched by time only just fell short of real beauty for lack of a spice of depth and of incisiveness just as her spirit lacked he knew not what of poignancy he would not for the world have let her know that he ever felt that lack if a man could not hide little rifts in the lute from one so good and humble and affectionate he was not fit to live  she sang the castle of dromore again that night with its queer haunting lilt and when she had gone up and he was smoking over the fire the girl in her darkred frock seemed to come and sit opposite with her eyes fixed on his just as she had been sitting while they talked dark red had suited her suited the look on her face when she said  youre not to go odd indeed if she had not some devil in her with that parentage   v   next day they had summoned him from the studio to see a peculiar phenomenonjohnny dromore very well groomed talking to sylvia with unnatural suavity and carefully masking the goggle in his eyes mrs lennan ride ah too busy of course helped mark with hiserno really read a lot no doubt never had any time for readin himselfawful bore not having time to read and sylvia listening and smiling very still and soft  what had dromore come for to spy out the land discover why lennan and his wife thought nothing of the word outsidewhether in fact their household was respectable a man must always look twice at whatdyoucallems even if they have shared his room at school to his credit of course to be so careful of his daughter at the expense of time owed to the creation of the perfect racehorse on the whole he seemed to be coming to the conclusion that they might be useful to nell in the uncomfortable time at hand when she would have to go about seemed even to be falling under the spell of sylvias transparent goodnessabandoning his habitual vigilance against being scored off in lifes perpetual bet parting with his armour of chaff almost a relief indeed once out of sylvias presence to see that familiar unholy curiosity creeping back into his eyes as though they were hoping against parental hope to find somethingeramusing somewhere about that mysterious mecca of good timesa whatdyoucallits studio delicious to watch the conflict between relief and disappointment alas no modelnot even a statue without clothes nothing but portrait heads casts of animals and suchlike sobrietiesabsolutely nothing that could bring a blush to the cheek of the young person or a glow to the eyes of a johnny dromore  with what curious silence he walked round and round the group of sheepdogs inquiring into them with that long crinkled nose of his with what curious suddenness he said damned good you wouldnt do me one of nell on horseback with what dubious watchfulness he listened to the answer  i might perhaps do a statuette of her if i did you should have a cast  did he think that in some way he was being outmanoeuvered for he remained some seconds in a sort of trance before muttering as though clinching a bet  done and if you want to ride with her to get the hang of it i can always mount you  when he had gone lennan remained staring at his unfinished sheepdogs in the gathering dusk again that sense of irritation at contact with something strange hostile uncomprehending why let these dromores into his life like this he shut the studio and went back to the drawingroom sylvia was sitting on the fender gazing at the fire and she edged along so as to rest against his knees the light from a candle on her writingtable was shining on her hair her cheek and chin that years had so little altered a pretty picture she made with just that candle flame swaying there burning slowly surely down the pale waxcandle flame of all lifeless things most living most like a spirit so bland and vague one would hardly have known it was fire at all a drift of wind blew it this way and that he got up to shut the window and as he came back sylvia said  i like mr dromore i think hes nicer than he looks  hes asked me to make a statuette of his daughter on horseback  and will you  i dont know  if shes really so pretty youd better  prettys hardly the wordbut shes not ordinary  she turned round and looked up at him and instinctively he felt that something difficult to answer was coming next  mark  yes  i wanted to ask you are you really happy nowadays  of course why not  what else to be said to speak of those feelings of the last few monthsthose feelings so ridiculous to anyone who had them notwould only disturb her horribly  and having received her answer sylvia turned back to the fire resting silently against his knees   three days later the sheepdogs suddenly abandoned the pose into which he had lured them with such difficulty and made for the studio door there in the street was nell dromore mounted on a narrow little black horse with a white star a white hoof and devilish little goats ears pricked and very close together at the tips  dad said i had better ride round and show you magpie hes not very good at standing still are those your dogs what darlings  she had slipped her knee already from the pummel and slid down the sheepdogs were instantly on their hindfeet propping themselves against her waist lennan held the black horsea bizarre little beast all fire and whipcord with a skin like satin liquid eyes very straight hocks and a thin bangtail reaching down to them the little creature had none of those commonplace good looks so discouraging to artists  he had forgotten its rider till she looked up from the dogs and said do you like him it is nice of you to be going to do us  when she had ridden away looking back until she turned the corner he tried to lure the two dogs once more to their pose but they would sit no more going continually to the door listening and sniffing and everything felt disturbed and out of gear  that same afternoon at sylvias suggestion he went with her to call on the dromores  while they were being ushered in he heard a mans voice rather highpitched speaking in some language not his own then the girl  no no oliver dans lamour il y a toujours un qui aime et lautre qui se laisse aimer  she was sitting in her fathers chair and on the windowsill they saw a young man lolling who rose and stood stockstill with an almost insolent expression on his broad goodlooking face lennan scrutinized him with interestabout twentyfour he might be rather dandified cleanshaved with crisp dark hair and wideset hazel eyes and as in his photograph a curious look of daring his voice when he vouchsafed a greeting was rather high and not unpleasant with a touch of lazy drawl  they stayed but a few minutes and going down those dimly lighted stairs again sylvia remarked  how prettily she said goodbyeas if she were putting up her face to be kissed i think shes lovely so does that young man they go well together  rather abruptly lennan answered  ah i suppose they do   vi   she came to them often after that sometimes alone twice with johnny dromore sometimes with young oliver who under sylvias spell soon lost his standoff air and the statuette was begun then came spring in earnest and that real business of lifethe racing of horses on the flat when johnny dromores genius was no longer hampered by the illegitimate risks of jumpin he came to dine with them the day before the first newmarket meeting he had a soft spot for sylvia always saying to lennan as he went away charmin womanyour wife she too had a soft spot for him having fathomed the utter helplessness of this worldlings wisdom and thinking him pathetic  after he was gone that evening she said  ought we to have nell to stay with us while youre finishing her she must be very lonely now her fathers so much away  it was like sylvia to think of that but would it be pleasure or vexation to have in the house this child with her quaint grownupness her confiding ways and those perdita eyes in truth he did not know  she came to them with touching alacrityvery like a dog who left at home when the family goes for a holiday takes at once to those who make much of it  and she was no trouble too well accustomed to amuse herself and always quaint to watch with her continual changes from child to woman of the world a new sensation thisof a young creature in the house both he and sylvia had wanted children without luck twice illness had stood in the way was it perhaps just that little lack in herthat lack of poignancy which had prevented her from becoming a mother an only child herself she had no nieces or nephews cicelys boys had always been at school and now were out in the world yes a new sensation and one in which lennans restless feelings seemed to merge and vanish  outside the hours when nell sat to him he purposely saw but little of her leaving her to nestle under sylvias wing and this she did as if she never wanted to come out thus he preserved his amusement at her quaint warmths and quainter calmness his aesthetic pleasure in watching her whose strange halfhypnotized halfhypnotic gaze had a sort of dreamy and pathetic lovingness as if she were brimful of affections that had no outlet  every morning after sitting she would stay an hour bent over her own drawing which made practically no progress and he would often catch her following his movements with those great eyes of hers while the sheepdogs would lie perfectly still at her feet blinking horriblysuch was her attraction his birds also a jackdaw and an owl who had the run of the studio tolerated her as they tolerated no other female save the housekeeper the jackdaw would perch on her and peck her dress but the owl merely engaged her in combats of mesmeric gazing which never ended in victory for either  now that she was with them oliver dromore began to haunt the house coming at all hours on very transparent excuses she behaved to him with extreme capriciousness sometimes hardly speaking sometimes treating him like a brother and in spite of all his nonchalance the poor youth would just sit glowering or gazing out his adoration according to her mood  one of these july evenings lennan remembered beyond all others he had come after a hard days work out from his studio into the courtyard garden to smoke a cigarette and feel the sun on his cheek before it sank behind the wall a pianoorgan far away was grinding out a waltz and on an hydrangea tub under the drawingroom window he sat down to listen nothing was visible from there save just the square patch of a quite blue sky and one soft plume of smoke from his own kitchen chimney nothing audible save that tune and the neverending street murmur twice birds flew acrossstarlings it was very peaceful and his thoughts went floating like the smoke of his cigarette to meet whoknewwhat other thoughtsfor thoughts no doubt had little swift lives of their own desired found their mates and lightly blending sent forth offspring why not all things were possible in this wonderhouse of a world even that waltz tune floating away would find some melody to wed and twine with and produce a fresh chord that might float in turn to catch the hum of a gnat or fly and breed again queerhow everything sought to entwine with something else on one of the pinkish blooms of the hydrangea he noted a beeof all things in this hiddenaway garden of tiles and gravel and plants in tubs the little furry lonely thing was drowsily clinging there as if it had forgotten what it had come forseduced maybe like himself from labour by these last rays of the sun its wings closefurled were glistening its eyes seemed closed and the pianoorgan played on a tune of yearning waiting yearning   then through the window above his head he heard oliver dromorea voice one could always tell pitched high with its slight drawlpleading very softly at first then insistent imperious and suddenly nells answering voice  i wont oliver i wont i wont  he rose to go out of earshot then a door slammed and he saw her at the window above him her waist on a level with his head flushed with her grey eyes ominously bright her full lips parted and he said  what is it nell  she leaned down and caught his hand her touch was fiery hot  he kissed me i wont let himi wont kiss him  through his head went a medley of sayings to soothe children that are hurt but he felt unsteady unlike himself and suddenly she knelt and put her hot forehead against his lips  it was as if she had really been a little child wanting the place kissed to make it well   vii   after that strange outburst lennan considered long whether he should speak to oliver but what could he say from what standpoint say it andwith that feeling or should he speak to dromore not very easy to speak on such a subject to one off whose turf all spiritual matters were so permanently warned nor somehow could he bring himself to tell sylvia it would be like violating a confidence to speak of the childs outburst and that quivering moment when she had kneeled and put her hot forehead to his lips for comfort such a disclosure was for nell herself to make if she so wished  and then young oliver solved the difficulty by coming to the studio himself next day he entered with dromore composure very well groomed in a silk hat a cutaway black coat and charming lemoncoloured gloves what indeed the youth did besides belonging to the yeomanry and hunting all the winter seemed known only to himself he made no excuse for interrupting lennan and for some time sat silently smoking his cigarette and pulling the ears of the dogs and lennan worked on waiting there was always something attractive to him in this young mans broad goodlooking face with its crisp dark hair and halfinsolent good humour now so clouded  at last oliver got up and went over to the unfinished girl on the magpie horse turning to it so that his face could not be seen he said  you and mrs lennan have been awfully kind to me i behaved rather like a cad yesterday i thought id better tell you i want to marry nell you know  lennan was glad that the young mans face was so religiously averted he let his hands come to anchor on what he was working at before he answered shes only a child oliver and then watching his fingers making an inept movement with the clay was astonished at himself  shell be eighteen this month he heard oliver say if she once gets outamongst peoplei dont know what i shall do old johnnys no good to look after her  the young mans face was very red he was forgetting to hide it now then it went white and he said through clenched teeth she sends me mad i dont know how not toif i dont get her i shall shoot myself i shall you knowim that sort its her eyes they draw you right out of yourselfand leave you and from his gloved hand the smokedout cigaretteend fell to the floor they say her mother was like that poor old johnny dyou think ive got a chance mr lennan i dont mean now this minute i know shes too young  lennan forced himself to answer  i dare say my dear fellow i dare say have you talked with my wife  oliver shook his head  shes so goodi dont think shed quite understand my sort of feeling  a queer little smile came up on lennans lips  ah well he said you must give the child time perhaps when she comes back from ireland after the summer  the young man answered moodily  yes ive got the run of that you know and i shant be able to keep away he took up his hat i suppose i oughtnt to have come and bored you about this but nell thinks such a lot of you and you being different to most peoplei thought you wouldnt mind he turned again at the door it wasnt gas what i said just nowabout not getting her fellows say that sort of thing but i mean it  he put on that shining hat and went  and lennan stood staring at the statuette so passion broke down even the defences of dromoredom passion strange hearts it chose to bloom in  being different to most peoplei thought you wouldnt mind how had this youth known that sylvia would not understand passion so out of hand as this and what had made it clear that he lennan would was there then something in his face there must be even johnny dromoremost reticent of creatureshad confided to him that one hour of his astute existence when the wind had swept him out to sea  yes and that statuette would never be any good try as he might oliver was rightit was her eyes how they had smokedin their childish angerif eyes could be said to smoke and how they had drawn and pleaded when she put her face to his in her still more childish entreaty if they were like this now what would they be when the woman in her woke just as well not to think of her too much just as well to work and take heed that he would soon be fortyseven just as well that next week she would be gone to ireland  and the last evening before she went they took her to see carmen at the opera he remembered that she wore a nearly high white frock and a dark carnation in the ribbon tying her crinkly hair that still hung loose how wonderfully entranced she sat drunk on that opera that he had seen a score of times now touching his arm now sylvias whispering questions whos that whats coming now the carmen roused her to adoration but don jose was too fat in his funny little coat till in the maddened jealousy of the last act he rose superior then quite lost in excitement she clutched lennans arm and her gasp when carmen at last fell dead made all their neighbours jump her emotion was far more moving than that on the stage he wanted badly to stroke and comfort her and say there there my dear its only makebelieve and when it was over and the excellent murdered lady and her poor fat little lover appeared before the curtain finally forgetting that she was a woman of the world she started forward in her seat and clapped and clapped fortunate that johnny dromore was not there to see but all things coming to an end they had to get up and go and as they made their way out to the hall lennan felt a hot little finger crooked into his own as if she simply must have something to squeeze he really did not know what to do with it she seemed to feel this halfheartedness soon letting it go all the way home in the cab she was silent with that same abstraction she ate her sandwiches and drank her lemonade took sylvias kiss and quite a woman of the world once more begged that they would not get up to see her offfor she was to go at seven in the morning to catch the irish mail then holding out her hand to lennan she very gravely said  thanks most awfully for taking me tonight goodbye  he stayed full half an hour at the window smoking no street lamp shone just there and the night was velvety black above the planetrees at last with a sigh he shut up and went tiptoeing upstairs in darkness suddenly in the corridor the white wall seemed to move at him a warmth a fragrance a sound like a tiny sigh and something soft was squeezed into his hand then the wall moved back and he stood listeningno sound no anything but in his dressingroom he looked at the soft thing in his hand it was the carnation from her hair what had possessed the child to give him that carmen ah carmen and gazing at the flower he held it away from him with a sort of terror but its scent arose and suddenly he thrust it all fresh as it was into a candleflame and held it burning writhing till it blackened to velvet then his heart smote him for so cruel a deed it was still beautiful but its scent was gone and turning to the window he flung it far out into the darkness   viii   now that she was gone it was curious how little they spoke of her considering how long she had been with them and they had from her but one letter written to sylvia very soon after she left ending dad sends his best respects please and with my love to you and mr lennan and all the beastsnell  oliver is coming here next week we are going to some races  it was difficult of course to speak of her with that episode of the flower too bizarre to be toldthe sort of thing sylvia would see out of all proportionas indeed any woman might yetwhat had it really been but the uncontrolled impulse of an emotional child longing to express feelings kindled by the excitement of that opera what but a childs feathery warmth one of those flying peeps at the mystery of passion that young things take he could not give away that pretty foolishness and because he would not give it away he was more than usually affectionate to sylvia  they had made no holiday plans and he eagerly fell in with her suggestion that they should go down to hayle there if anywhere this curious restlessness would leave him they had not been down to the old place for many years indeed since gordys death it was generally let  they left london late in august the day was closing in when they arrived honeysuckle had long been improved away from that station paling against which he had stood twentynine years ago watching the train carrying anna stormer away in the hired fly sylvia pressed close to him and held his hand beneath the ancient dustrug both felt the same excitement at seeing again this old home not a single soul of the past days would be there nowonly the house and the trees the owls and the stars the river park and logan stone it was dark when they arrived just their bedroom and two sittingrooms had been made ready with fires burning though it was still high summer the same old execrable heatherleys looked down from the black oak panellings the same scent of apples and old mice clung here and there about the dark corridors with their unexpected stairways it was all curiously unchanged as old houses are when they are let furnished  once in the night he woke through the wideopen uncurtained windows the night was simply alive with stars such swarms of them swinging and trembling up there and far away rose the melancholy velvetsoft hooting of an owl  sylvias voice close to him said  mark that night when your star caught in my hair do you remember  yes he remembered and in his drowsy mind just roused from dreams there turned and turned the queer nonsensical refrain i neverneverwill desert mr micawber  a pleasant month thatof reading and walking with the dogs the country round of lying out long hours amongst the boulders or along the river banks watching beasts and birds  the little old greenhouse temple of his early masterpieces was still extant used now to protect watering pots but no vestige of impulse towards work came to him down there he was marking time not restless not bored just waitingbut for what he had no notion and sylvia at any rate was happy blooming in these old haunts losing her fairness in the sun even taking again to a sunbonnet which made her look extraordinarily young the trout that poor old gordy had so harried were left undisturbed no gun was fired rabbits pigeons even the few partridges enjoyed those first days of autumn unmolested the bracken and leaves turned very early so that the park in the hazy september sunlight had an almost golden hue a gentle mellowness reigned over all that holiday and from ireland came no further news save one picture postcard with the words this is our housenell  in the last week of september they went back to london and at once there began in him again that restless unreasonable achingthat sense of being drawn away out of himself so that he once more took to walking the park for hours over grass already strewn with leaves always lookingcravingand for what  at dromores the confidential man did not know when his master would be back he had gone to scotland with miss nell after the st leger was lennan disappointed not sorelieved rather but his ache was there all the time feeding on its secrecy and loneliness unmentionable feeling that it was why had he not realized long ago that youth was over passion done with autumn upon him how never grasped the fact that time steals away and as before the only refuge was in work the sheepdogs and the girl on the magpie horse were finished he began a fantastic reliefa nymph peering from behind a rock and a wildeyed man creeping through reeds towards her if he could put into the nymphs face something of this lure of youth and life and love that was dragging at him into the mans face the state of his own heart it might lay that feeling to rest anything to get it out of himself and he worked furiously laboriously all october making no great progress what could he expect when life was all the time knocking with that muffled tapping at his door  it was on the tuesday after the close of the last newmarket meeting and just getting dusk when life opened the door and walked in she wore a darkred dress a new one and surely her faceher figurewere very different from what he had remembered they had quickened and become poignant she was no longer a childthat was at once plain cheeks mouth neck waistall seemed fined shaped the crinkly lightbrown hair was coiled up now under a velvet cap only the great grey eyes seemed quite the same and at sight of her his heart gave a sort of dive and flight as if all its vague and wistful sensations had found their goal  then in sudden agitation he realized that his last moment with this girlnow a child no longerhad been a secret moment of warmth and of emotion a moment which to her might have meant in her might have bred feelings that he had no inkling of he tried to ignore that fighting and diving of his heart held out his hand and murmured  ah nell back at last youve grown then with a sensation of every limb gone weak he felt her arms round his neck and herself pressed against him there was time for the thought to flash through him this is terrible he gave her a little convulsive squeezecould a man do lessthen just managed to push her gently away trying with all his might to think shes a child its nothing more than after carmen she doesnt know what i am feeling but he was conscious of a mad desire to clutch her to him the touch of her had demolished all his vagueness made things only too plain set him on fire  he said uncertainly  come to the fire my child and tell me all about it  if he did not keep to the notion that she was just a child his head would go perditathe lost one a good name for her indeed as she stood there her eyes shining in the firelightmore mesmeric than ever they had been and to get away from the lure of those eyes he bent down and raked the grate saying  have you seen sylvia but he knew that she had not even before she gave that impatient shrug then he pulled himself together and said  what has happened to you child  im not a child  no weve both grown older i was fortyseven the other day  she caught his handheavens how supple she wasand murmured  youre not old a bit youre quite young at his wits end with his heart thumping but still keeping his eyes away from her he said  where is oliver  she dropped his hand at that  oliver i hate him  afraid to trust himself near her he had begun walking up and down and she stood following him with her gazethe firelight playing on her red frock what extraordinary stillness what power she had developed in these few months had he let her see that he felt that power and had all this come of one little moment in a dark corridor of one flower pressed into his hand why had he not spoken to her roughly thentold her she was a romantic little fool god knew what thoughts she had been feeding on but who could have supposedwho dreamed and again he fixed his mind resolutely on that thought shes a childonly a child  come he said tell me all about your time in ireland  oh it was just dullits all been dull away from you  it came out without hesitancy or shame and he could only murmur  ah youve missed your drawing  yes can i come tomorrow  that was the moment to have said no you are a foolish child and i an elderly idiot but he had neither courage nor clearness of mind enough northe desire and without answering he went towards the door to turn up the light  oh no please dont its so nice like this  the shadowy room the bluish dusk painted on all the windows the fitful shining of the fire the pallor and darkness of the dim casts and bronzes and that one glowing figure there before the hearth and her voice a little piteous went on  arent you glad im back i cant see you properly out there  he went back into the glow and she gave a little sigh of satisfaction then her calm young voice said ever so distinctly  oliver wants me to marry him and i wont of course  he dared not say why not he dared not say anything it was too dangerous and then followed those amazing words you know why dont you of course you do  it was ridiculous almost shameful to understand their meaning and he stood staring in front of him without a word humility dismay pride and a sort of mad exultation all mixed and seething within him in the queerest pudding of emotion but all he said was  come my child were neither of us quite ourselves tonight lets go to the drawingroom   ix   back in the darkness and solitude of the studio when she was gone he sat down before the fire his senses in a whirl why was he not just an ordinary animal of a man that could enjoy what the gods had sent it was as if on a november day someone had pulled aside the sober curtains of the sky and there in a chink had been april standingthick white blossom a purple cloud a rainbow grass vivid green light flaring from one knew not where and such a tingling passion of life on it all as made the heart stand still this then was the marvellous enchanting maddening end of all that year of restlessness and wanting this bit of spring suddenly given to him in the midst of autumn her lips her eyes her hair her touching confidence above allquite unbelievableher love not really love perhaps just childish fancy but on the wings of fancy this child would fly far too farall wistfulness and warmth beneath that light veneer of absurd composure  to live againto plunge back into youth and beautyto feel spring once moreto lose the sense of all being over save just the sober jogtrot of domestic bliss to know actually to know ecstasy again in the love of a girl to rediscover all that youth yearns for and feels and hopes and dreads and loves it was a prospect to turn the head even of a decent man  by just closing his eyes he could see her standing there with the firelight glow on her red frock could feel again that marvellous thrill when she pressed herself against him in the halfinnocent seducing moment when she first came in could feel again her eyes drawingdrawing him she was a witch a greyeyed brownhaired witcheven unto her love of red she had the witchs power of lighting fever in the veins and he simply wondered at himself that he had not as she stood there in the firelight knelt and put his arms round her and pressed his face against her waist why had he not but he did not want to think the moment thought began he knew he must be torn this way and that tossed here and there between reason and desire pity and passion every sense struggled to keep him wrapped in the warmth and intoxication of this discovery that he in the full of autumn had awakened love in spring it was amazing that she could have this feeling yet there was no mistake her manner to sylvia just now had been almost dangerously changed there had been a queer cold impatience in her look frightening from one who but three months ago had been so affectionate and going away she had whispered with that old tremblingup at him as if offering to be kissed i may come maynt i and dont be angry with me please i cant help it a monstrous thing at his age to let a young girl love himcompromise her future a monstrous thing by all the canons of virtue and gentility and yetwhat futurewith that naturethose eyesthat originwith that father and that home but he would notsimply must not think  nevertheless he showed the signs of thought and badly for after dinner sylvia putting her hand on his forehead said  youre working too hard mark you dont go out enough  he held those fingers fast sylvia no indeed he must not think but he took advantage of her words and said that he would go out and get some air  he walked at a great paceto keep thought awaytill he reached the river close to westminster and moved by sudden impulse seeking perhaps an antidote turned down into that little street under the big wren church where he had never been since the summer night when he lost what was then more to him than life there she had lived there was the housethose windows which he had stolen past and gazed at with such distress and longing who lived there now once more he seemed to see that face out of the past the dark hair and dark soft eyes and sweet gravity and it did not reproach him for this new feeling was not a love like that had been only once could a man feel the love that passed all things the love before which the world was but a spark in a draught of wind the love that whatever dishonour grief and unrest it might come through alone had in it the heart of peace and joy and honour fate had torn that love from him nipped it off as a sharp wind nips off a perfect flower this new feeling was but a fever a passionate fancy a grasping once more at youth and warmth ah well but it was real enough and in one of those moments when a man stands outside himself seems to be lifted away and see his own life twirling lennan had a vision of a shadow driven here and there a straw going round and round a midge in the grip of a mad wind where was the home of this mighty secret feeling that sprang so suddenly out of the dark and caught you by the throat why did it come now and not then for this one and not that other what did man know of it save that it made him spin and hoverlike a moth intoxicated by a light or a bee by some dark sweet flower save that it made of him a distraught humble eager puppet of its fancy had it not once already driven him even to the edge of death and must it now come on him again with its sweet madness its drugging scent what was it why was it why these passionate obsessions that could not decently be satisfied had civilization so outstripped man that his nature was cramped into shoes too smalllike the feet of a chinese woman what was it why was it  and faster than ever he walked away  pall mall brought him back to that counterfeit presentment of the realreality there in st jamess street was johnny dromores club and again moved by impulse he pushed open its swing door no need to ask for there was dromore in the hall on his way from dinner to the cardroom the glossy tan of hard exercise and good living lay on his cheeks as thick as clouted cream his eyes had the peculiar shine of superabundant vigour a certain subfestive air in face and voice and movements suggested that he was going to make a night of it and the sardonic thought flashed through lennan shall i tell him  hallo old chap awfully glad to see you what you doin with yourself workin hard hows your wife you been away been doin anything great and then the question that would have given him his chance if he had liked to be so cruel  seen nell  yes she came round this afternoon  what dyou think of her comin on nicely isnt she  that old query half furtive and half proud as much as to say i know shes not in the studbook but dn it i sired her and then the old sudden gloom which lasted but a second and gave way again to chaff  lennan stayed very few minutes never had he felt farther from his old schoolchum  no whatever happened johnny dromore must be left out it was a position he had earned with his goggling eyes and his astute philosophy from it he should not be disturbed  he passed along the railings of the green park on the cold air of this last october night a thin haze hung and the acrid fragrance from little bonfires of fallen leaves what was there about that scent of burnedleaf smoke that had always moved him so symbol of partingthat most mournful thing in all the world for what would even death be but for parting sweet long sleep or new adventure but if a man loved othersto leave them or be left ah and it was not death only that brought partings  he came to the opening of the street where dromore lived she would be there sitting by the fire in the big chair playing with her kitten thinking dreaming andalone he passed on at such a pace that people stared till turning the last corner for home he ran almost into the arms of oliver dromore  the young man was walking with unaccustomed indecision his fur coat open his operahat pushed up on his crisp hair dark under the eyes he had not the proper gloss of a dromore at this season of the year  mr lennan ive just been round to you  and lennan answered dazedly  will you come in or shall i walk your way a bit  id ratherout here if you dont mind  so in silence they went back into the square and oliver said  lets get over by the rails  they crossed to the railings of the squares dark garden where nobody was passing and with every step lennans humiliation grew there was something false and undignified in walking with this young man who had once treated him as a father confessor to his love for nell and suddenly he perceived that they had made a complete circuit of the square garden without speaking a single word  yes he said  oliver turned his face away  you remember what i told you in the summer well its worse now ive been going a mucker lately in all sorts of ways to try and get rid of it but its all no good shes got me  and lennan thought youre not alone in that but he kept silence his chief dread was of saying something that he would remember afterwards as the words of judas  then oliver suddenly burst out  why cant she care i suppose im nothing much but shes known me all her life and she used to like me theres somethingi cant make out could you do anything for me with her  lennan pointed across the street  in every other one of those houses oliver he said theres probably some creature who cant make out why another creature doesnt care passion comes when it will goes when it will and we poor devils have no say in it  what do you advise me then  lennan had an almost overwhelming impulse to turn on his heel and leave the young man standing there but he forced himself to look at his face which even then had its attractionperhaps more so than ever so pallid and desperate it was and he said slowly staring mentally at every word  im not up to giving you advice the only thing i might say is one does not press oneself where one isnt wanted all the samewho knows so long as she feels youre there waiting she might turn to you at any moment the more chivalrous you are oliver the more patiently you wait the better chance you have  oliver took those words of little comfort without flinching i see he said thanks but my god its hard i never could wait and with that epigram on himself holding out his hand he turned away  lennan went slowly home trying to gauge exactly how anyone who knew all would judge him it was a little difficult in this affair to keep a shred of dignity  sylvia had not gone up and he saw her looking at him anxiously the one strange comfort in all this was that his feeling for her at any rate had not changed it seemed even to have deepenedto be more real to him  how could he help staying awake that night how could he help thinking then and long time he lay staring at the dark  as if thinking were any good for fever in the veins   x   passion never plays the game it at all events is free from selfconsciousness and pride from dignity nerves scruples cant moralities from hypocrisies and wisdom and fears for pocket and position in this world and the next well did the old painters limn it as an arrow or a wind if it had not been as swift and darting earth must long ago have drifted through space untenantedto let  after that fevered night lennan went to his studio at the usual hour and naturally did not do a stroke of work he was even obliged to send away his model the fellow had been his hairdresser but getting ill and falling on dark days one morning had come to the studio to ask with manifest shame if his head were any good after having tested his capacity for standing still and giving him some introductions lennan had noted him down five feet nine good hair lean face something tortured and pathetic give him a turn if possible the turn had come and the poor man was posing in a painful attitude talking whenever permitted of the way things had treated him and the delights of cutting hair this morning he took his departure with the simple pleasure of one fully paid for services not rendered  and so walking up and down up and down the sculptor waited for nells knock what would happen now thinking had made nothing clear here was offered what every warmblooded man whose spring is past desiresyouth and beauty and in that youth a renewal of his own what all men save hypocrites and englishmen would even admit that they desired and it was offered to one who had neither religious nor moral scruples as they are commonly understood in theory he could accept in practice he did not as yet know what he could do one thing only he had discovered during the nights reflections that those who scouted belief in the principle of liberty made no greater mistake than to suppose that liberty was dangerous because it made a man a libertine to those with any decency the creed of freedom wasof allthe most enchaining easy enough to break chains imposed by others fling his cap over the windmill and cry for the moment at least i am unfettered free hard indeed to say the same to his own unfettered self yes his own self was in the judgmentseat by his own verdict and decision he must abide and though he ached for the sight of her and his will seemed paralyzedmany times already he had thought it wont do god help me  then twelve oclock had come and she had not would the girl on the magpie horse be all he would see of her todaythat unsatisfying work so cold and devoid of witchery better have tried to paint herwith a red flower in her hair a pout on her lips and her eyes fey or languorous goya could have painted her  and then just as he had given her up she came  after taking one look at his face she slipped in ever so quietly like a very good child marvellous the instinct and finesse of the young when they are women not a vestige in her of yesterdays seductive power not a sign that there had been a yesterday at alljust confiding like a daughter sitting there telling him about ireland showing him the little batch of drawings she had done while she was away had she brought them because she knew they would make him feel sorry for her what could have been less dangerous more appealing to the protective and paternal side of him than she was that morning as if she only wanted what her father and her home could not give heronly wanted to be a sort of daughter to him  she went away demurely as she had come refusing to stay to lunch manifestly avoiding sylvia only then he realized that she must have taken alarm from the look of strain on his face been afraid that he would send her away only then perceived that with her appeal to his protection she had been binding him closer making it harder for him to break away and hurt her and the fevered aching began againworse than everthe moment he lost sight of her and more than ever he felt in the grip of something beyond his power to fight against something that however he swerved and backed and broke away would close in on him find means to bind him again hand and foot  in the afternoon dromores confidential man brought him a note the fellow with his castdown eyes and his wellparted hair seemed to lennan to be saying yes sirit is quite natural that you should take the note out of eyeshot sirbut i know fortunately there is no necessity for alarmi am strictly confidential  and this was what the note contained   you promised to ride with me onceyou did promise and you never have do please ride with me tomorrow then you will get what you want for the statuette instead of being so cross with it you can have dads horsehe has gone to newmarket again and im so lonely pleasetomorrow at halfpast twostarting from here nell   to hesitate in view of those confidential eyes was not possible it must be yes or no and if no it would only mean that she would come in the morning instead so he said  just say all right  very good sir then from the door mr dromore will be away till saturday sir  now why had the fellow said that curious how this desperate secret feeling of his own made him see sinister meaning in this servant in olivers visit of last nightin everything it was vilethis suspiciousness he could feel almost see himself deteriorating already with this furtive feeling in his soul it would soon be written on his face but what was the use of troubling what would come wouldone way or the other  and suddenly he remembered with a shock that it was the first of novembersylvias birthday he had never before forgotten it in the disturbance of that discovery he was very near to going and pouring out to her the whole story of his feelings a charming birthday present that would make taking his hat instead he dashed round to the nearest flower shop a frenchwoman kept it  what had she  what did monsieur desire des oeillets rouges jen ai de bien beaux ce soir  nonot those white flowers  une belle azalee  yes that would doto be sent at onceat once  next door was a jewellers he had never really known if sylvia cared for jewels since one day he happened to remark that they were vulgar and feeling that he had fallen low indeed to be trying to atone with some miserable gewgaw for never having thought of her all day because he had been thinking of another he went in and bought the only ornament whose ingredients did not make his gorge rise two small pearshaped black pearls one at each end of a fine platinum chain coming out with it he noticed over the street in a clear sky fast deepening to indigo the thinnest slip of a new moon like a bright swallow with wings bent back flying towards the ground that meantfine weather if it could only be fine weather in his heart and in order that the azalea might arrive first he walked up and down the square which he and oliver had patrolled the night before  when he went in sylvia was just placing the white azalea in the window of the drawingroom and stealing up behind her he clasped the little necklet round her throat she turned round and clung to him he could feel that she was greatly moved and remorse stirred and stirred in him that he was betraying her with his kiss  but even while he kissed her he was hardening his heart   xi   next day still following the lead of her words about fresh air and his tired look he told her that he was going to ride and did not say with whom after applauding his resolution she was silent for a littlethen asked  why dont you ride with nell  he had already so lost his dignity that he hardly felt disgraced in answering  it might bore her  oh no it wouldnt bore her  had she meant anything by that and feeling as if he were fencing with his own soul he said  very well i will  he had perceived suddenly that he did not know his wife having always till now believed that it was she who did not quite know him  if she had not been out at lunchtime he would have lunched out himselfafraid of his own face for feverishness in sick persons mounts steadily with the approach of a certain hour and surely his face to anyone who could have seen him being conveyed to piccadilly would have suggested a fevered invalid rather than a healthy middleaged sculptor in a cab  the horses were before the doorthe little magpie horse and a thoroughbred bay mare weeded from dromores racing stable nell too was standing ready her cheeks very pink and her eyes very bright she did not wait for him to mount her but took the aid of the confidential man what was it that made her look so perfect on that little horseshape of limb or something soft and fiery in her spirit that the little creature knew of  they started in silence but as soon as the sound of hoofs died on the tan of rotten row she turned to him  it was lovely of you to come i thought youd be afraidyou are afraid of me  and lennan thought youre right  but please dont look like yesterday todays too heavenly oh i love beautiful days and i love riding and she broke off and looked at him why cant you just be nice to meshe seemed to be sayingand love me as you ought that was her powerthe conviction that he did and ought to love her that she ought to and did love him how simple  but riding too is a simple passion and simple passions distract each other it was a treat to be on that bay mare who so to be trusted to ride the best as johnny dromore  at the far end of the row she cried out lets go on to richmond now and trotted off into the road as if she knew she could do with him what she wished and following meekly he asked himself why what was there in her to make up to him for all that he was losinghis power of work his dignity his selfrespect what was there just those eyes and lips and hair  and as if she knew what he was thinking she looked round and smiled  so they jogged on over the bridge and across barnes common into richmond park  but the moment they touched turf with one look back at him she was off had she all the time meant to give him this breakneck chaseor had the loveliness of that autumn day gone to her headblue sky and coppery flames of bracken in the sun and the beech leaves and the oak leaves pure highland colouring come south for once  when in the first burst he had tested the mares wind this chase of her indeed was sheer delight through glades over fallen treetrunks in bracken up to the hocks out across the open past a herd of amazed and solemn deer over rotten ground all rabbitburrows till just as he thought he was up to her she slipped away by a quick turn round trees mischief incarnate but something deeper than mischief too he came up with her at last and leaned over to seize her rein with a cut of her whip that missed his hand by a bare inch and a wrench she made him shoot past wheeled in her tracks and was off again like an arrow back amongst the treeslying right forward under the boughs along the neck of her little horse then out from amongst the trees she shot downhill right down she went full tilt and after her went lennan lying back and expecting the bay mare to come down at every stride this was her idea of fun she switched round at the bottom and went galloping along the foot of the hill and he thought now ive got her she could not break back up that hill and there was no other cover for fully half a mile  then he saw not thirty yards in front an old sandpit and great god she was going straight at it and shouting frantically he reined his mare outwards but she only raised her whip cut the magpie horse over the flank and rode right on he saw that little demon gather its feet and springdown down saw him pitch struggle sinkand she flung forward roll over and lie on her back he felt nothing at the moment only had that fixed vision of a yellow patch of sand the blue sky a rook flying and her face upturned but when he came on her she was on her feet holding the bridle of her dazed horse no sooner did he touch her than she sank down her eyes were closed but he could feel that she had not fainted and he just held her and kept pressing his lips to her eyes and forehead suddenly she let her head fall back and her lips met his then opening her eyes she said im not hurt onlyfunny has magpie cut his knees  not quite knowing what he did he got up to look the little horse was cropping at some grass unharmedthe sand and fern had saved his knees and the languid voice behind him said its all rightyou can leave the horses theyll come when i call  now that he knew she was unhurt he felt angry why had she behaved in this mad waygiven him this fearful shock but in that same languid voice she went on dont be cross with me i thought at first id pull up but then i thought if i jump he cant help being niceso i diddont leave off loving me because im not hurt please  terribly moved he sat down beside her took her hands in his and said  nell nell its all wrongits madness  why dont think about it i dont want you to thinkonly to love me  my child you dont know what love is  for answer she only flung her arms round his neck then since he held back from kissing her let them fall again and jumped up  very well but i love you you can think of thatyou cant prevent me and without waiting for help she mounted the magpie horse from the sandheap where they had fallen  very sober that ride home the horses as if ashamed of their mad chase were edging close to each other so that now and then his arm would touch her shoulder he asked her once what she had felt while she was jumping  only to be sure my foot was free it was rather horrid coming down thinking of magpies knees and touching the little horses goatlike ears she added softly poor dear hell be stiff tomorrow  she was again only the confiding rather drowsy child or was it that the fierceness of those past moments had killed his power of feeling an almost dreamy hourwith the sun going down the lamps being lighted one by oneand a sort of sweet oblivion over everything  at the door where the groom was waiting lennan would have said goodbye but she whispered oh no please i am tired nowyou might help me up a little  and so half carrying her he mounted past the vanity fair cartoons and through the corridor with the red paper and the van beers drawings into the room where he had first seen her  once settled back in dromores great chair with the purring kitten curled up on her neck she murmured  isnt it nice you can make tea and well have hot buttered toast  and so lennan stayed while the confidential man brought tea and toast and never once looking at them seemed to know all that had passed all that might be to come  then they were alone again and gazing down at her stretched out in that great chair lennan thought  thank god that im tired toobody and soul  but suddenly she looked up at him and pointing to the picture that today had no curtain drawn said  do you think im like her i made oliver tell me aboutmyself this summer thats why you neednt bother it doesnt matter what happens to me you see and i dont carebecause you can love me without feeling bad about it and you will wont you  then with her eyes still on his face she went on quickly  only we wont talk about that now will we its too cosy i am nice and tired do smoke  but lennans fingers trembled so that he could hardly light that cigarette and watching them she said please give me one dad doesnt like my smoking  the virtue of johnny dromore yes it would always be by proxy and he muttered  how do you think he would like to know about this afternoon nell  i dont care then peering up through the kittens fur she murmured oliver wants me to go to a dance on saturdayits for a charity shall i  of course why not  will you come  i  oh do you must its my very first you know ive got an extra ticket  and against his will his judgmenteverything lennan answered yes  she clapped her hands and the kitten crawled down to her knees  when he got up to go she did not move but just looked up at him and how he got away he did not know  stopping his cab a little short of home he ran for he felt cold and stiff and letting himself in with his latchkey went straight to the drawingroom the door was ajar and sylvia standing at the window he heard her sigh and his heart smote him very still and slender and lonely she looked out there with the light shining on her fair hair so that it seemed almost white then she turned and saw him he noticed her throat working with the effort she made not to show him anything and he said  surely you havent been anxious nell had a bit of a falljumping into a sandpit shes quite mad sometimes i stayed to tea with herjust to make sure she wasnt really hurt but as he spoke he loathed himself his voice sounded so false  she only answered its all right dear but he saw that she kept her eyesthose blue too true eyesaverted even when she kissed him  and so began another evening and night and morning of fever subterfuge wariness aching a round of halfecstatic torment out of which he seemed no more able to break than a man can break through the walls of a cell  though it live but a day in the sun though it drown in tenebrous night the dark flower of passion will have its hour   xii   to deceive undoubtedly requires a course of training and unversed in this art lennan was fast finding it intolerable to scheme and watch himself and mislead one who had looked up to him ever since they were children yet all the time he had a feeling that since he alone knew all the circumstances of his case he alone was entitled to blame or to excuse himself the glib judgments that moralists would pass upon his conduct could be nothing but the imbecilities of smug and pharisaic foolsof those not under this drugging spellof such as had not blood enough perhaps ever to fall beneath it  the day after the ride nell had not come and he had no word from her was she then hurt after all she had lain back very inertly in that chair and sylvia never asked if he knew how the girl was after her fall nor offered to send round to inquire did she not wish to speak of her or had she simplynot believed when there was so much he could not talk of it seemed hard that just what happened to be true should be distrusted she had not yet indeed by a single word suggested that she felt he was deceiving her but at heart he knew that she was not deceived those feelers of a woman who lovescan anything check their delicate apprehension     towards evening the longing to see the girla sensation as if she were calling him to come to herbecame almost insupportable yet whatever excuse he gave he felt that sylvia would know where he was going he sat on one side of the fire she on the other and they both read books the only strange thing about their reading was that neither of them ever turned a leaf it was don quixote he read the page which had these words let altisidora weep or sing still i am dulcineas and hers alone dead or alive dutiful and unchanged in spite of all the necromantic powers in the world and so the evening passed when she went up to bed he was very near to stealing out driving up to the dromores door and inquiring of the confidential man but the thought of the confounded fellows eyes was too much for him and he held out he took up sylvias book de maupassants fort comme la mortopen at the page where the poor woman finds that her lover has passed away from her to her own daughter and as he read the tears rolled down his cheek sylvia sylvia were not his old favourite words from that old favourite book still true dulcinea del toboso is the most beautiful woman in the world and i the most unfortunate knight upon the earth it were unjust that such perfection should suffer through my weakness no pierce my body with your lance knight and let my life expire with my honour why could he not wrench this feeling from his heart banish this girl from his eyes why could he not be wholly true to her who was and always had been wholly true to him horriblethis willless nerveless feeling this paralysis as if he were a puppet moved by a cruel hand and as once before it seemed to him that the girl was sitting there in sylvias chair in her dark red frock with her eyes fixed on him uncannily vividthat impression a man could not go on long with his head in chancery like this without becoming crazed  it was growing dusk on saturday afternoon when he gave up that intolerable waiting and opened the studio door to go to nell it was now just two days since he had seen or heard of her she had spoken of a dance for that very nightof his going to it she must be ill  but he had not taken six steps when he saw her coming she had on a grey furry scarf hiding her mouth making her look much older the moment the door was shut she threw it off went to the hearth drew up a little stool and holding her hands out to the fire said  have you thought about me have you thought enough now  and he answered yes ive thought but im no nearer  why nobody need ever know you love me and if they did i wouldnt care  simple how simple glorious egoistic youth  he could not speak of sylvia to this childspeak of his married life hitherto so dignified so almost sacred it was impossible then he heard her say  it cant be wrong to love you i dont care if it is wrong and saw her lips quivering and her eyes suddenly piteous and scared as if for the first time she doubted of the issue here was fresh torment to watch an unhappy child and what was the use of even trying to make clear to heron the very threshold of lifethe hopeless maze that he was wandering in what chance of making her understand the marsh of mud and tangled weeds he must drag through to reach her nobody need know so simple what of his heart and his wifes heart and pointing to his new workthe first man bewitched by the first nymphhe said  look at this nell that nymph is you and this man is me she got up and came to look and while she was gazing he greedily drank her in what a strange mixture of innocence and sorcery what a wonderful young creature to bring to full knowledge of love within his arms and he said you had better understand what you are to meall that i shall never know again there it is in that nymphs face oh no not your face and there am i struggling through slime to reach younot my face of course  she said poor face then covered her own was she going to cry and torture him still more but instead she only murmured but you have reached me swayed towards him and put her lips to his  he gave way then from that too stormy kiss of his she drew back for a second then as if afraid of her own recoil snuggled close again but the instinctive shrinking of innocence had been enough for lennanhe dropped his arms and said  you must go child  without a word she picked up her fur put it on and stood waiting for him to speak then as he did not she held out something white it was the card for the dance  you said you were coming  and he nodded her eyes and lips smiled at him she opened the door and still with that slow happy smile went out  yes he would be coming wherever she was whenever she wanted him  his blood on fire heedless of everything but to rush after happiness lennan spent those hours before the dance he had told sylvia that he would be dining at his cluba set of rooms owned by a small coterie of artists in chelsea he had taken this precaution feeling that he could not sit through dinner opposite her and then go out to that danceand nell he had spoken of a guest at the club to account for evening dressanother lie but what did it matter he was lying all the time if not in words in actionmust lie indeed to save her suffering  he stopped at the frenchwomans flower shop  que desirezvous monsieur des oeillets rougesjen ai de bien beaux ce soir  des oeillets rouges yes those tonight to this address no green with them no card  how strange the feelingwith the die once cast for loveof rushing of watching his own self being left behind  in the brompton road outside a little restaurant a thin musician was playing on a violin ah and he knew this place he would go in there not to the cluband the fiddler should have all he had to spare for playing those tunes of love he turned in he had not been there since the day before that night on the river twenty years ago never since and yet it was not changed the same tarnished gilt and smell of cooking the same macaroni in the same tomato sauce the same chianti flasks the same staring lightblue walls wreathed with pink flowers only the waiter differenthollowcheeked patient dark of eye he too should be well tipped and that poor overhatted lady eating her frugal mealto her at all events a look of kindness for all desperate creatures he must feel this desperate night and suddenly he thought of oliver another desperate one what should he say to oliver at this dancehe aged fortyseven coming there without his wife some imbecility such as watching the human form divine in motion catching sidelights on nell for the statuettesome cant it did not matter the wine was drawn and he must drink  it was still early when he left the restauranta dry night very calm not cold when had he danced last with olive cramier before he knew he loved her well that memory could not be broken for he would not dance tonight just watch sit with the girl a few minutes feel her hand cling to his see her eyes turned back to him andcome away and thenthe future for the wine was drawn the leaf of a planetree fluttering down caught on his sleeve autumn would soon be gone and after autumnonly winter she would have done with him long before he came to winter nature would see to it that youth called for her and carried her away nature in her courses but just to cheat nature for a little while to cheat naturewhat greater happiness  here was the place with redstriped awning carriages driving away loiterers watching he turned in with a beating heart was he before her how would she come to this first dance with oliver alone or had some chaperon been found to have come because shethis child so lovely born outsidemight have need of chaperonage would have been some comfort to dignity so wistful so lost as his but alas he knew he was only there because he could not keep away  already they were dancing in the hall upstairs but not she yet and he stood leaning against the wall where she must pass lonely and out of place he felt as if everyone must know why he was there people stared and he heard a girl ask whos that against the wall with the hair and dark moustacheand her partner murmuring his answer and her voice again yes he looks as if he were seeing sand and lions for whom then did they take him thank heaven they were all the usual sort there would be no one that he knew suppose johnny dromore himself came with nell he was to be back on saturday what could he say then how meet those doubting knowing eyes goggling with the fixed philosophy that a man has but one use for woman god and it would be true for a moment he was on the point of getting his coat and hat and sneaking away that would mean not seeing her till monday and he stood his ground but after tonight there must be no more such riskstheir meetings must be wisely planned must sink underground and then he saw her at the foot of the stairs in a dress of a shellpink colour with one of his flowers in her lightbrown hair and the others tied to the handle of a tiny fan how selfpossessed she looked as if this were indeed her native elementher neck and arms bare her cheeks a deep soft pink her eyes quickly turning here and there she began mounting the stairs and saw him was ever anything so lovely as she looked just then behind her he marked oliver and a tall girl with red hair and another young man he moved deliberately to the top of the stairs on the wall side so that from behind they should not see her face when she greeted him she put the little fan with the flowers to her lips and holding out her hand said quick and low  the fourth its a polka well sit out wont we  then swaying a little so that her hair and the flower in it almost touched his face she passed and there in her stead stood oliver  lennan had expected one of his old insolent looks but the young mans face was eager and quite friendly  it was awfully good of you to come mr lennan is mrs lennan  and lennan murmured  she wasnt able shes not quite and could have sunk into the shining floor youth with its touching confidence its eager trust this was the way he was fulfilling his duty towards youth  when they had passed into the ballroom he went back to his position against the wall they were dancing number three his time of waiting then was drawing to a close from where he stood he could not see the dancersno use to watch her go round in someone elses arms  not a true waltzsome french or spanish pavement song played in waltz time bizarre pathetic whirling after its own happiness that chase for happiness well life with all its prizes and its possibilities had nothing that quite satisfiedsave just the fleeting moments of passion nothing else quite poignant enough to be called pure joy or so it seemed to him  the waltz was over he could see her now on a rout seat against the wall with the other young man turning her eyes constantly as if to make sure that he was still standing there what subtle fuel was always being added to the fire by that flattery of her inexplicable adorationof those eyes that dragged him to her yet humbly followed him too five times while she sat there he saw the redhaired girl or oliver bring men up saw youths cast longing glances saw girls watching her with cold appraisement or with a touching frank delight from the moment that she came in there had been in her fathers phrase only one in it and she could pass all this by and still want him incredible  at the first notes of the polka he went to her it was she who found their place of refugea little alcove behind two palmplants but sitting there he realized as never before that there was no spiritual communion between him and this child she could tell him her troubles or her joys he could soothe or sympathize but never would the gap between their natures and their ages be crossed his happiness was only in the sight and touch of her but that god knew was happiness enougha feverish craving joy like an overtired mans thirst growing with the drink on which it tries to slake itself sitting there in the scent of those flowers and of some sweet essence in her hair with her fingers touching his and her eyes seeking his he tried loyally not to think of himself to grasp her sensations at this her first dance and just help her to enjoyment but he could notparalyzed made drunk by that insensate longing to take her in his arms and crush her to him as he had those few hours back he could see her expanding like a flower in all this light and motion and intoxicating admiration round her what business had he in her life with his dark hunger after secret hours hea coin worn thin alreadya destroyer of the freshness and the glamour of her youth and beauty  then holding up the flowers she said  did you give me these because of the one i gave you  yes  what did you do with that  burned it  oh but why  because you are a witchand witches must be burned with all their flowers  are you going to burn me  he put his hand on her cool arm  feel the flames are lighted  you may i dont care  she took his hand and laid her cheek against it yet to the music which had begun again the tip of her shoe was already beating time and he said  you ought to be dancing child  oh no only its a pity you dont want to  yes do you understand that it must all be secretunderground  she covered his lips with the fan and said youre not to think youre not to thinknever when can i come  i must find the best way not tomorrow nobody must know nellfor your sakefor hersnobody  she nodded and repeated with a soft mysterious wisdom nobody and then aloud heres oliver it was awfully good of you to come goodnight  and as on olivers arm she left their little refuge she looked back  he lingeredto watch her through this one dance how they made all the other couples sink into insignificance with that something in them both that was better than mere good looksthat something not outre or eccentric but poignant wayward they went well together those two dromoreshis dark head and her fair head his clear brown daring eyes and her grey languorous mesmeric eyes ah master oliver was happy now with her so close to him it was not jealousy that lennan felt not quiteone did not feel jealous of the young something very deeppride sense of proportion who knew whatprevented that she too looked happy as if her soul were dancing vibrating with the music and the scent of the flowers he waited for her to come round once more to get for a last time that flying glance turned back then found his coat and hat and went   xiii   outside he walked a few steps then stood looking back at the windows of the hall through some trees the shadows of whose trunks in the light of a street lamp were spilled out along the ground like the splines of a fan a church clock struck eleven for hours yet she would be there going round and round in the arms of youth try as he might he could never recapture for himself the look that olivers face had wornthe look that was the symbol of so much more than he himself could give her why had she come into his lifeto her undoing and his own and the bizarre thought came to him if she were dead should i really care should i not be almost glad if she were dead her witchery would be dead and i could stand up straight again and look people in the face what was this power that played with men darted into them twisted their hearts to rags this power that had looked through her eyes when she put her fan with his flowers to her lips  the thrumming of the music ceased he walked away  it must have been nearly twelve when he reached home now once more would begin the gruesome process of deceptionflinching of soul and brazening of visage it would be better when the whole thievish business was irretrievably begun and ordered in its secret courses  there was no light in the drawingroom save just the glow of the fire if only sylvia might have gone to bed then he saw her sitting motionless out there by the uncurtained window  he went over to her and began his hateful formula  im afraid youve been lonely i had to stay rather late a dull evening and since she did not move or answer but just sat there very still and white he forced himself to go close bend down to her touch her cheek even to kneel beside her she looked round then her face was quiet enough but her eyes were strangely eager with a pitiful little smile she broke out  oh mark what is itwhat is it anything is better than this  perhaps it was the smile perhaps her voice or eyesbut something gave way in lennan secrecy precaution went by the board bowing his head against her breast he poured it all out while they clung clutched together in the half dark like two frightened children only when he had finished did he realize that if she had pushed him away refused to let him touch her it would have been far less piteous far easier to bear than her wan face and her hands clutching him and her words i never thoughtyou and ioh markyou and i the trust in their life together in himself that those words revealed yet not greater than he had hadstill had she could not understandhe had known that she could never understand it was why he had fought so for secrecy all through she was taking it as if she had lost everything and in his mind she had lost nothing this passion this craving for youth and life this madnesscall it what one wouldwas something quite apart not touching his love and need of her if she would only believe that over and over he repeated it over and over again perceived that she could not take it in the only thing she saw was that his love had gone from her to anotherthough that was not true suddenly she broke out of his arms pushing him from her and cried that girlhateful horrible false never had he seen her look like this with flaming spots in her white cheeks soft lips and chin distorted blue eyes flaming breast heaving as if each breath were drawn from lungs that received no air and then as quickly the fire went out of her she sank down on the sofa covering her face with her arms rocking to and fro she did not cry but a little moan came from her now and then and each one of those sounds was to lennan like the cry of something he was murdering at last he went and sat down on the sofa by her and said  sylvia sylvia dont oh dont and she was silent ceasing to rock herself letting him smooth and stroke her but her face she kept hidden and only once she spoke so low that he could hardly hear i canti wont keep you from her and with the awful feeling that no words could reach or soothe the wound in that tender heart he could only go on stroking and kissing her hands  it was atrocioushorriblethis that he had done god knew that he had not sought itthe thing had come on him surely even in her misery she could see that deep down beneath his grief and selfhatred he knew what neither she nor anyone else could knowthat he could not have prevented this feeling which went back to days before he ever saw the girlthat no man could have stopped that feeling in himself this craving and roving was as much part of him as his eyes and hands as overwhelming and natural a longing as his hunger for work or his need of the peace that sylvia gave and alone could give him that was the tragedyit was all sunk and rooted in the very nature of a man since the girl had come into their lives he was no more unfaithful to his wife in thought than he had been before if only she could look into him see him exactly as he was as without part or lot in the process he had been madethen she would understand and even might not suffer but she could not and he could never make it plain and solemnly desperately with a weary feeling of the futility of words he went on trying could she not see it was all a thing outside hima craving a chase after beauty and life after his own youth at that word she looked at him  and do you think i dont want my youth back  he stopped  for a woman to feel that her beautythe brightness of her hair and eyes the grace and suppleness of her limbswere slipping from her and from the man she loved was there anything more bitteror any more sacred duty than not to add to that bitterness not to push her with suffering into old age but to help keep the star of her faith in her charm intact  man and womanthey both wanted youth again she that she might give it all to him he because it would help him towards somethingnew just that world of difference  he got up and said  come dear lets try and sleep  he had not once said that he could give it up the words would not pass his lips though he knew she must be conscious that he had not said them must be longing to hear them all he had been able to say was  so long as you want me you shall never lose me and i will never keep anything from you again  up in their room she lay hour after hour in his arms quite unresentful but without life in her and with eyes that when his lips touched them were always wet  what a maze was a mans heart wherein he must lose himself every minute what involved and intricate turnings and turnings on itself what fugitive replacement of emotion by emotion what strife between pities and passions what longing for peace     and in his feverish exhaustion which was almost sleep lennan hardly knew whether it was the thrum of music or sylvias moaning that he heard her body or nells within his arms  but life had to be lived a face preserved against the world engagements kept and the nightmare went on for both of them under the calm surface of an ordinary sunday they were like people walking at the edge of a high cliff not knowing from step to step whether they would fall or like swimmers struggling for issue out of a dark whirlpool  in the afternoon they went together to a concert it was just something to dosomething that saved them for an hour or two from the possibility of speaking on the one subject left to them the ship had gone down and they were clutching at anything that for a moment would help to keep them above water  in the evening some people came to supper a writer and two painters with their wives a grim eveningnever more so than when the conversation turned on that perennial themethe freedom spiritual mental physical requisite for those who practise art all the stale arguments were brought forth and had to be joined in with unmoved faces and for all their talk of freedom lennan could see the volteface his friends would be making if they only knew it was not the thing to seduce young girlsas if forsooth there were freedom in doing only what people thought the thing their cant about the free artist spirit experiencing everything would wither the moment it came up against a canon of good form so that in truth it was no freer than the bourgeois spirit with its conventions or the priest spirit with its cry of sin no no to resistif resistance were possible to this dragging powermaxims of good form dogmas of religion and morality were no helpnothing was any help but some feeling stronger than passion itself sylvias face forced to smilethat indeed was a reason why they should condemn him none of their doctrines about freedom could explain that awaythe harm the death that came to a mans soul when he made a loving faithful creature suffer  but they were gone at lastwith their thanks so much and their delightful evening  and those two were face to face for another night  he knew that it must begin all over againinevitable after the stab of that wretched argument plunged into their hearts and turned and turned all the evening  i wont i mustnt keep you starved and spoil your work dont think of me mark i can bear it  and then a breakdown worse than the night before what genius what sheer genius nature had for torturing her creatures if anyone had told him even so little as a week ago that he could have caused such suffering to sylviasylvia whom as a child with wide blue eyes and a blue bow on her flaxen head he had guarded across fields full of imaginary bulls sylvia in whose hair his star had caught sylvia who day and night for fifteen years had been his devoted wife whom he loved and still admiredhe would have given him the lie direct it would have seemed incredible monstrous silly had all married men and women such things to go throughwas this but a very usual crossing of the desert or was it once for all shipwreck deathunholy violent deathin a storm of sand  another night of misery and no answer to that question yet  he had told her that he would not see nell again without first letting her know so when morning came he simply wrote the words dont come todayshowed them to sylvia and sent them by a servant to dromores  hard to describe the bitterness with which he entered his studio that morning in all this chaos what of his work could he ever have peace of mind for it again those people last night had talked of inspiration of passion of experience in pleading with her he had used the words himself shepoor soulhad but repeated them trying to endure them to believe them true and were they true again no answer or certainly none that he could give to have had the waters broken up to be plunged into emotion to feel desperately instead of stagnatingsome day he might be gratefulwho knew some day there might be fair country again beyond this desert where he could work even better than before but just now as well expect creative work from a condemned man it seemed to him that he was equally destroyed whether he gave nell up and with her once for all that roving seeking instinct which ought forsooth to have been satisfied and was not or whether he took nell knowing that in doing so he was torturing a woman dear to him that was as far as he could see today what he would come to see in time god only knew but freedom of the spirit that was a phrase of bitter irony indeed and there with his work all round him like a man tied hand and foot he was swept by such a feeling of exasperated rage as he had never known women these women only let him be free of both of all women and the passions and pities they aroused so that his brain and his hands might live and work again they should not strangle they should not destroy him  unfortunately even in his rage he knew that flight from them both could never help him one way or the other the thing would have to be fought through if it had been a straight fight even a clear issue between passion and pity but both he loved and both he pitied there was nothing straight and clear about it anywhere it was all too deeply rooted in full human nature and the appalling sense of rushing ceaselessly from barrier to barrier began really to affect his brain  true he had now and then a lucid interval of a few minutes when the ingenious nature of his own torments struck him as supremely interesting and queer but this was not precisely a relief for it only meant as in prolonged toothache that his power of feeling had for a moment ceased a very pretty little hell indeed  all day he had the premonition amounting to certainty that nell would take alarm at those three words he had sent her and come in spite of them and yet what else could he have written nothing save what must have alarmed her more or plunged him deeper he had the feeling that she could follow his moods that her eyes could see him everywhere as a cats eyes can see in darkness that feeling had been with him more or less ever since the last evening of october the evening she came back from her summergrownup how long ago only six dayswas it possible ah yes she knew when her spell was weakening when the current wanted as it were renewing and about six oclockdusk alreadywithout the least surprise with only a sort of empty quivering he heard her knock and just behind the closed door as near as he could get to her he stood holding his breath he had given his word to sylviaof his own accord had given it through the thin wood of the old door he could hear the faint shuffle of her feet on the pavement moved a few inches this way and that as though supplicating the inexorable silence he seemed to see her head bent a little forward listening three times she knocked and each time lennan writhed it was so cruel with that seeingsense of hers she must know he was there his very silence would be telling herfor his silence had its voice its pitiful breathless sound then quite distinctly he heard her sigh and her footsteps move away and covering his face with his hands he rushed to and fro in the studio like a madman  no sound of her any more gone it was unbearable and seizing his hat he ran out which way at random he ran towards the square there she was over by the railings languidly irresolutely moving towards home   xiv   but now that she was within reach he wavered he had given his wordwas he going to break it then she turned and saw him and he could not go back in the biting easterly wind her face looked small and pinched and cold but her eyes only the larger the more full of witchery as if beseeching him not to be angry not to send her away  i had to come i got frightened why did you write such a tiny little note  he tried to make his voice sound quiet and ordinary  you must be brave nell i have had to tell her  she clutched at his arm then drew herself up and said in her clear clipped voice  oh i suppose she hates me then  she is terribly unhappy  they walked a minute that might have been an hour without a word not round the square as he had walked with oliver but away from the house at last she said in a halfchoked voice i only want a little bit of you  and he answered dully in love there are no little bitsno standing still  then suddenly he felt her hand in his the fingers lacing twining restlessly amongst his own and again the halfchoked voice said  but you will let me see you sometimes you must  hardest of all to stand against was this pathetic clinging frightened child and not knowing very clearly what he said he murmured  yesyes itll be all right be braveyou must be brave nell itll all come right  but she only answered  no no im not brave i shall do something  her face looked just as when she had ridden at that gravel pit loving wild undisciplined without resource of any kindwhat might she not do why could he not stir without bringing disaster upon one or other and between these two suffering so because of him he felt as if he had lost his own existence in quest of happiness he had come to that  suddenly she said  oliver asked me again at the dance on saturday he said you had told him to be patient did you  yes  why  i was sorry for him  she let his hand go  perhaps you would like me to marry him  very clearly he saw those two going round and round over the shining floor  it would be better nell  she made a little soundof anger or dismay  you dont really want me then  that was his chance but with her arm touching his her face so pale and desperate and those maddening eyes turned to him he could not tell that lie and answered  yesi want you god knows  at that a sigh of content escaped her as if she were saying to herself if he wants me he will not let me go strange little tribute to her faith in love and her own youth  they had come somehow to pall mall by now and scared to find himself so deep in the huntingground of the dromores lennan turned hastily towards st jamess park that they might cross it in the dark round to piccadilly to be thus slinking out of the worlds sight with the daughter of his old roommateof all men in the world the last perhaps that he should do this to a nice treacherous business but the thing men called honourwhat was it when her eyes were looking at him and her shoulder touching his  since he had spoken those words yes i want you she had been silentfearful perhaps to let other words destroy their comfort but near the gate by hyde park corner she put her hand again into his and again her voice so clear said  i dont want to hurt anybody but you will let me come sometimesyou will let me see youyou wont leave me all alone thinking that ill never see you again  and once more without knowing what he answered lennan murmured  no no itll be all right dearitll all come right it mustand shall  again her fingers twined amongst his like a childs she seemed to have a wonderful knowledge of the exact thing to say and do to keep him helpless and she went on  i didnt try to love youit isnt wrong to loveit wouldnt hurt her i only want a little of your love  a littlealways a little but he was solely bent on comforting her now to think of her going home and sitting lonely frightened and unhappy all the evening was dreadful and holding her fingers tight he kept on murmuring words of wouldbe comfort  then he saw that they were out in piccadilly how far dared he go with her along the railings before he said goodbye a man was coming towards them just where he had met dromore that first fatal afternoon nine months ago a man with a slight lurch in his walk and a tall shining hat a little on one side but thank heavenit was not dromoreonly one somewhat like him who in passing stared sphinxlike at nell and lennan said  you must go home now child we mustnt be seen together  for a moment he thought she was going to break down refuse to leave him then she threw up her head and for a second stood like that quite motionless looking in his face suddenly stripping off her glove she thrust her warm clinging hand into his her lips smiled faintly tears stood in her eyes then she drew her hand away and plunged into the traffic he saw her turn the corner of her street and disappear and with the warmth of that passionate little hand still stinging his palm he almost ran towards hyde park  taking no heed of direction he launched himself into its dark space deserted in this cold homeless wind that had little sound and no scent travelling its remorseless road under the greyblack sky  the dark firmament and keen cold air suited one who had little need of aids to emotionone who had indeed but the single wish to get rid if he only could of the terrible sensation in his head that bruised battered imprisoned feeling of a man who paces his cellnever never to get out at either end without thought or intention he drove his legs along not running because he knew that he would have to stop the sooner alas what more comic spectacle for the eyes of a good citizen than this married man of middle age striding for hours over those dry dark empty pastureshunted by passion and by pity so that he knew not even whether he had dined but no good citizen was abroad of an autumn night in a bitter easterly wind the trees were the sole witnesses of this grim exercisethe trees resigning to the cold blast their crinkled leaves that fluttered past him just a little lighter than the darkness here and there his feet rustled in the drifts waiting their turn to serve the little bonfires whose scent still clung in the air a desperate walk in this heart of londonround and round up and down hour after hour keeping always in the dark not a star in the sky not a human being spoken to or even clearly seen not a bird or beast just the gleam of the lights far away and the hoarse muttering of the traffic a walk as lonely as the voyage of the human soul is lonely from birth to death with nothing to guide it but the flickering glow from its own frail spirit lighted it knows not where  and so tired that he could hardly move his legs but free at last of that awful feeling in his headfree for the first time for days and dayslennan came out of the park at the gate where he had gone in and walked towards his home certain that tonight one way or the other it would be decided   xv   this thenthis long trouble of body and of spiritwas what he remembered sitting in the armchair beyond his bedroom fire watching the glow and sylvia sleeping there exhausted while the dark planetree leaves taptapped at the window in the autumn wind watching with the uncanny certainty that he would not pass the limits of this night without having made at last a decision that would not alter for even conflict wears itself out even indecision has this measure set to its miserable powers of torture that any issue in the end is better than the hell of indecision itself once or twice in those last days even death had seemed to him quite tolerable but now that his head was clear and he had come to grips death passed out of his mind like the shadow that it was nothing so simple extravagant and vain could serve him other issues had reality deathnone to leave sylvia and take this young love away there was reality in that but it had always faded as soon as it shaped itself and now once more it faded to put such a public and terrible affront on a tender wife whom he loved do her to death as it were before the worlds eyesand then ever remorseful grow old while the girl was still young he could not if sylvia had not loved him yes or even if he had not loved her or if again though loving him she had stood upon her rightsin any of those events he might have done it but to leave her whom he did love and who had said to him so generously i will not hamper yougo to herwould be a black atrocity every memory from their boyandgirl lovering to the desperate clinging of her arms these last two nightsmemory with its innumerable tentacles the invincible strength of its countless threads bound him to her too fast what then must it come after all to giving up the girl and sitting there by that warm fire he shivered how desolate sacrilegious wasteful to throw love away to turn from the most precious of all gifts to drop and break that vase there was not too much love in the world nor too much warmth and beautynot anyway for those whose sands were running out whose blood would soon be cold  could sylvia not let him keep both her love and the girls could she not bear that she had said she could but her face her eyes her voice gave her the lie so that every time he heard her his heart turned sick with pity this then was the real issue could he accept from her such a sacrifice exact a daily misery see her droop and fade beneath it could he bear his own happiness at such a cost would it be happiness at all he got up from the chair and crept towards her she looked very fragile sleeping there the darkness below her closed eyelids showed cruelly on that too fair skin and in her flaxcoloured hair he saw what he had never noticeda few strands of white her softly opened lips almost colourless quivered with her uneven breathing and now and again a little feverish shiver passed up as from her heart all soft and fragile not much life not much strength youth and beauty slipping to know that he who should be her champion against age and time would day by day be placing one more mark upon her face one more sorrow in her heart that he should do thisthey both going down the years together  as he stood there holding his breath bending to look at her that slurring swish of the planetree branch flung against and against the window by the autumn wind seemed filling the whole world then her lips moved in one of those little soft hurrying whispers that unhappy dreamers utter the words all blurred with their wistful rushing  and he thought i who believe in bravery and kindness i who hate crueltyif i do this cruel thing what shall i have to live for how shall i work how bear myself if i do it i am lostan outcast from my own faitha renegade from all that i believe in  and kneeling there close to that face so sad and lonely that heart so beaten even in its sleep he knew that he could not do itknew it with sudden certainty and a curious sense of peace overthe long struggleover at last youth with youth summer to summer falling leaf with falling leaf and behind him the fire flickered and the planetree leaves taptapped  he rose and crept away stealthily downstairs into the drawingroom and through the window at the far end out into the courtyard where he had sat that day by the hydrangea listening to the pianoorgan very dark and cold and eerie it was there and he hurried across to his studio there too it was cold and dark and eerie with its ghostly plaster presences stale scent of cigarettes and just one glowing ember of the fire he had left when he rushed out after nellthose seven hours ago  he went first to the bureau turned up its lamp and taking out some sheets of paper marked on them directions for his various works for the statuette of nell he noted that it should be taken with his compliments to mr dromore he wrote a letter to his banker directing money to be sent to rome and to his solicitor telling him to let the house he wrote quickly if sylvia woke and found him still away what might she not think he took a last sheet did it matter what he wrote what deliberate lie if it helped nell over the first shock   dear nell  i write this hastily in the early hours to say that we are called out to italy to my only sister who is very ill we leave by the first morning boat and may be away some time i will write again dont fret and god bless you  m l   he could not see very well as he wrote poor loving desperate child well she had youth and strength and would soon haveoliver and he took yet another sheet   dear oliver  my wife and i are obliged to go posthaste to italy i watched you both at the dance the other night be very gentle with nell andgood luck to you but dont say again that i told you to be patient it is hardly the way to make her love you  m lennan   that then was allyes all he turned out the little lamp and groped towards the hearth but one thing left to say goodbye to her and youth and passionto the only salve for the aching that spring and beauty bringthe aching for the wild the passionate the new that never quite dies in a mans heart ah well sooner or later all men had to say goodbye to that all menall men  he crouched down before the hearth there was no warmth in that fastblackening ember but it still glowed like a darkred flower and while it lived he crouched there as though it were that to which he was saying goodbye and on the door he heard the girls ghostly knocking and beside hima ghost among the ghostly presencesshe stood slowly the glow blackened till the last spark had faded out  then by the glimmer of the night he found his way back softly as he had come to his bedroom  sylvia was still sleeping and to watch for her to wake he sat down again by the fire in silence only stirred by the frail taptapping of those autumn leaves and the little catch in her breathing now and then it was less troubled than when he had bent over her before as though in her sleep she knew he must not miss the moment of her waking must be beside her before she came to full consciousness to say there there its all over we are going away at onceat once to be ready to offer that quick solace before she had time to plunge back into her sorrow was an island in this black sea of night a single little refuge point for his bereaved and naked being something to dosomething fixed real certain and yet another long hour before her waking he sat forward in the chair with that wistful eagerness his eyes fixed on her face staring through it at some vision some faint glimmering lightfar out there beyondas a traveller watches a star
