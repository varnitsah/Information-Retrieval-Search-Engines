16780857	the relics of general chassea tale of antwerp  by anthony trollope     that belgium is now one of the european kingdoms living by its own laws resting on its own bottom with a king and court palaces and parliament of its own is known to all the world  and a very nice little kingdom it is full of old towns fine flemish pictures and interesting gothic churches  but in the memory of very many of us who do not think ourselves old men belgium as it is now calledin those days it used to be flanders and brabantwas a part of holland and it obtained its own independence by a revolution  in that revolution the most important military step was the siege of antwerp which was defended on the part of the dutch by general chasse with the utmost gallantry but nevertheless ineffectually  after the siege antwerp became quite a show place and among the visitors who flocked there to talk of the gallant general and to see what remained of the great effort which he had made to defend the place were two englishmen  one was the hero of this little history and the other was a young man of considerably less weight in the world  the less i say of the latter the better but it is necessary that i should give some description of the former  the rev augustus horne was at the time of my narrative a beneficed clergyman of the church of england  the profession which he had graced sat easily on him  its external marks and signs were as pleasing to his friends as were its internal comforts to himself he was a man of much quiet mirth full of polished wit and on some rare occasions he could descend to the more noisy hilarity of a joke  loved by his friends he loved all the world  he had known no care and seen no sorrow  always intended for holy orders he had entered them without a scruple and remained within their pale without a regret  at twentyfour he had been a deacon at twenty seven a priest at thirty a rector and at thirtyfive a prebendary and as his rectory was rich and his prebendal stall well paid the rev augustus horne was called by all and called himself a happy man  his stature was about six feet two and his corpulence exceeded even those bounds which symmetry would have preferred as being most perfectly compatible even with such a height  but nevertheless mr horne was a wellmade man his hands and feet were small his face was handsome frank and full of expression his bright eyes twinkled with humour his finelycut mouth disclosed two marvellous rows of wellpreserved ivory and his slightly aquiline nose was just such a projection as one would wish to see on the face of a wellfed goodnatured dignitary of the church of england  when i add to all this that the reverend gentleman was as generous as he was richand the kind mother in whose arms he had been nurtured had taken care that he should never wanti need hardly say that i was blessed with a very pleasant travelling companion  i must mention one more interesting particular mr horne was rather inclined to dandyism in an innocent way  his clerical starched neckcloth was always of the whitest his cambric handkerchief of the finest his bands adorned with the broadest border his sable suit never degenerated to a rusty brown it not only gave on all occasions glossy evidence of freshness but also of the talent which the artisan had displayed in turning out a welldressed clergyman of the church of england  his hair was ever brushed with scrupulous attention and showed in its regular waves the guardian care of each separate bristle  and all this was done with that ease and grace which should be the characteristics of a dignitary of the established english church  i had accompanied mr horne to the rhine and we had reached brussels on our return just at the close of that revolution which ended in affording a throne to the soninlaw of george the fourth at that moment general chasses name and fame were in every mans mouth and like other curious admirers of the brave mr horne determined to devote two days to the scene of the late events at antwerp  antwerp moreover possesses perhaps the finest spire and certainly one of the three or four finest pictures in the world of general chasse of the cathedral and of the rubens i had heard much and was therefore well pleased that such should be his resolution  this accomplished we were to return to brussels and thence via ghent ostend and dover i to complete my legal studies in london and mr horne to enjoy once more the peaceful retirement of ollerton rectory  as we were to be absent from brussels but one night we were enabled to indulge in the gratification of travelling without our luggage  a small sacdenuit was prepared brushes combs razors strops a change of linen c c were carefully put up but our heavy baggage our coats waistcoats and other wearing apparel were unnecessary  it was delightful to feel oneself so lighthanded  the reverend gentleman with my humble self by his side left the portal of the hotel de belle vue at 7 am in good humour with all the world  there were no railroads in those days but a cabriolet big enough to hold six persons with rope traces and corresponding appendages deposited us at the golden fleece in something less than six hours  the inward man was duly fortified and we started for the castle  it boots not here to describe the effects which gunpowder and grape shot had had on the walls of antwerp  let the curious in these matters read the horrors of the siege of troy or the history of jerusalem taken by titus  the one may be found in homer and the other in josephus  or if they prefer doings of a later date there is the taking of sebastopol as narrated in the columns of the times newspaper  the accounts are equally true instructive and intelligible  in the mean time allow the rev augustus horne and myself to enter the private chambers of the renowned though defeated general  we rambled for a while through the covered way over the glacis and along the counterscarp and listened to the guide as he detailed to us in already accustomed words how the siege had gone  then we got into the private apartments of the general and having dexterously shaken off our attendant wandered at large among the deserted rooms  it is clear that no one ever comes here said i  no said the rev augustus it seems not and to tell the truth i dont know why any one should come  the chambers in themselves are not attractive  what he said was true  they were plain ugly square unfurnished rooms here a big one and there a little one as is usual in most housesunfurnished that is for the most part  in one place we did find a table and a few chairs in another a bedstead and so on but to me it was pleasant to indulge in those ruminations which any traces of the great or unfortunate create in softly sympathising minds  for a time we communicated our thoughts to each other as we roamed free as air through the apartments and then i lingered for a few moments behind while mr horne moved on with a quicker step  at last i entered the bedchamber of the general and there i overtook my friend  he was inspecting with much attention an article of the great mans wardrobe which he held in his hand  it was precisely that virile habiliment to which a wellknown gallant captain alludes in his conversation with the posthumous appearance of miss bailey as containing a bank of england 5 pound note  the general must have been a large man george or he would hardly have filled these said mr horne holding up to the light the respectable leathern articles in question  he must have been a very large manthe largest man in antwerp i should think or else his tailor has done him more than justice  they were certainly large and had about them a charming regimental military appearance  they were made of white leather with bright metal buttons at the knees and bright metal buttons at the top they owned no pockets and were with the exception of the legitimate outlet continuous in the circumference of the waistband no dangling strings gave them an appearance of senile imbecility were it not for a certain rigidity sternness and mental inflexibilitywe will call it military ardourwith which they were imbued they would have created envy in the bosom of a fox hunter  mr horne was no foxhunter but still he seemed to be irresistibly taken with the ladylike propensity of wishing to wear them surely george he said the general must have been a stouter man than i amand he contemplated his own proportions with complacencythese whatsthenames are quite big enough for me  i differed in opinion and was obliged to explain that i thought he did the good living of ollerton insufficient justice  i am sure they are large enough for me he repeated with considerable obstinacy  i smiled incredulously and then to settle the matter he resolved that he would try them on  nobody had been in these rooms for the last hour and it appeared as though they were never visited  even the guide had not come on with us but was employed in showing other parties about the fortifications  it was clear that this portion of the building was left desolate and that the experiment might be safely made  so the sportive rector declared that he would for a short time wear the regimentals which had once contained the valorous heart of general chasse  with all decorum the rev mr horne divested himself of the work of the london artists needle and carefully placing his own garments beyond the reach of dust essayed to fit himself in military garb  at that important momentat the critical instant of the attempt the clatter of female voices was heard approaching the chamber they must have suddenly come round some passage corner for it was evident by the sound that they were close upon us before we had any warning of their advent  at this very minute mr horne was somewhat embarrassed in his attempts and was not fully in possession of his usual active powers of movement nor of his usual presence of mind he only looked for escape and seeing a door partly open he with difficulty retreated through it and i followed him  we found that we were in a small dressingroom and as by good luck the door was defended by an inner bolt my friend was able to protect himself  there shall be another siege at any rate as stout as the last before i surrender said he  as the ladies seemed inclined to linger in the room it became a matter of importance that the abovenamed articles should fit not only for ornament but for use  it was very cold and mr horne was altogether unused to move in a highland sphere of life  but alas alas  general chasse had not been nurtured in the classical retirement of ollerton  the ungiving leather would stretch no point to accommodate the divine though it had been willing to minister to the convenience of the soldier  mr horne was vexed and chilled and throwing the now hateful garments into a corner and protecting himself from the cold as best he might by standing with his knees together and his body somewhat bent so as to give the skirts of his coat an opportunity of doing extra duty he begged me to see if those jabbering females were not going to leave him in peace to recover his own property  i accordingly went to the door and opening it to a small extent i peeped through  who shall describe my horror at the sight which i then saw  the scene which had hitherto been tinted with comic effect was now becoming so decidedly tragic that i did not dare at once to acquaint my worthy pastor with that which was occurringand alas had already occurred  five countrywomen of our ownit was easy to know them by their dress and general aspectwere standing in the middle of the room and one of them the centre of the group the senior harpy of the lot a maiden ladyi could have sworn to thatwith a red nose held in one hand a huge pair of scissors and in the otherthe already devoted goods of my most unfortunate companion  down from the waistband through that goodly expanse a fell gash had already gone through and through and in useless unbecoming disorder the broadcloth fell pendant from her arm on this side and on that  at that moment i confess that i had not the courage to speak to mr hornenot even to look at him  i must describe that group  of the figure next to me i could only see the back  it was a broad back done up in black silk not of the newest  the whole figure one may say was dumpy  the black silk was not long as dresses now are worn nor wide in its skirts  in every way it was skimpy considering the breadth it had to cover and below the silk i saw the heels of two thick shoes and enough to swear by of two woollen stockings  above the silk was a red and blue shawl and above that a ponderous elaborate brown bonnet as to the materials of which i should not wish to undergo an examination  over and beyond this i could only see the backs of her two hands  they were held up as though in wonder at that which the rednosed holder of the scissors had dared to do  opposite to this lady and with her face fully tamed to me was a kindlylooking fat motherly woman with lightcoloured hair not in the best order  she was hot and scarlet with exercise being perhaps too stout for the steep steps of the fortress and in one hand she held a handkerchief with which from time to time she wiped her brow  in the other hand she held one of the extremities of my friends property feelinggood careful soulwhat was the texture of the cloth  as she did so i could see a glance of approbation pass across her warm features  i liked that ladys face in spite of her untidy hair and felt that had she been alone my friend would not have been injured  on either side of her there stood a flaxenhaired maiden with long curls large blue eyes fresh red cheeks an undefined lumpy nose and large goodhumoured mouth  they were as like as two peas only that one was half an inch taller than the other and there was no difficulty in discovering at a moments glance that they were the children of that overheated matron who was feeling the web of my friends cloth  but the principal figure was she who held the centre place in the group  she was tall and thin with fiercelooking eyes rendered more fierce by the spectacles which she wore with a red nose as i said before and about her an undescribable something which quite convinced me that she had never knowncould never knowaught of the comforts of married life  it was she who held the scissors and the black garments  it was she who had given that unkind cut  as i looked at her she whisked herself quickly round from one companion to the other triumphing in what she had done and ready to triumph further in what she was about to do  i immediately conceived a deep hatred for that queen of the harpies  well i suppose they cant be wanted again said the mother rubbing her forehead  oh dear no said she of the red nose  they are relics  i thought to leap forth but for what purpose should i have leaped the accursed scissors had already done their work and the symmetry nay even the utility of the vestment was destroyed  general chasse wore a very good articlei will say that for him continued the mother  of course he did said the queen harpy  why should he not seeing that the country paid for it for him  well ladies whos for having a bit  oh my you wont go for to cut them up said the stout back  wont i said the scissors and she immediately made another incision  whos for having a bit  dont all speak at once  i should like a morsel for a pincushion said flaxenhaired miss no 1 a young lady about nineteen actuated by a general affection for all swordbearing fireeating heroes  i should like to have something to make me think of the poor general  snip snip went the scissors with professional rapidity and a round piece was extracted from the back of the calf of the left leg  i shuddered with horror and so did the rev augustus horne with cold  i hardly think its proper to cut them up said miss no 2  oh isnt it said the harpy  then ill do whats improper  and she got her finger and thumb well through the holes in the scissors handles  as she spoke resolution was plainly marked on her brow  well if they are to be cut up i should certainly like a bit for a penwiper said no 2  no 2 was a literary young lady with a periodical correspondence a journal and an album  snip snip went the scissors again and the broad part of the upper right division afforded ample materials for a penwiper  then the lady with the back seeing that the desecration of the article had been completed plucked up heart of courage and put in her little request i think i might have a needlecase out of it said she just as a suvneer of the poor generaland a long fragment cut rapidly out of the waistband afforded her unqualified delight  mamma with the hot face and untidy hair came next  well girls she said as you are all served i dont see why im to be left out  perhaps miss grogramshe was an old maid you see perhaps miss grogram you could get me as much as would make a decentsized reticule  there was not the slightest difficulty in doing this  the harpy in the centre again went to work snip snip and extracting from that portion of the affairs which usually sustained the greater portion of mr hornes weight two large round pieces of cloth presented them to the wellpleased matron  the general knew well where to get a bit of good broadcloth certainly said she again feeling the pieces  and now for no 1 said she whom i so absolutely hated i think there is still enough for a pair of slippers  theres nothing so nice for the house as good black cloth slippers that are warm to the feet and dont show the dirt  and so saying she spread out on the floor the lacerated remainders  theres a nice bit there said young lady no 2 poking at one of the pockets with the end of her parasol  yes said the harpy contemplating her plunder  but im thinking whether i couldnt get leggings as well  i always wear leggings in the thick of the winter  and so she concluded her operations and there was nothing left but a melancholy skeleton of seams and buttons  all this having been achieved they pocketed their plunder and prepared to depart  there are people who have a wonderful appetite for relics  a stone with which washington had broken a window when a boywith which he had done so or had not for there is little difference a button that was on a coat of napoleons or on that of one of his lackeys a bullet said to have been picked up at waterloo or bunkers hill these and suchlike things are great treasures and their most desirable characteristic is the ease with which they are attained  any bullet or any button does the work  faith alone is necessary  and now these ladies had made themselves happy and glorious with relics of general chasse cut from the illused habiliments of an elderly english gentleman  they departed at last and mr horne for once in an ill humour followed me into the bedroom  here i must be excused if i draw a veil over his manly sorrow at discovering what fate had done for him  remember what was his position unclothed in the castle of antwerp  the nearest suitable change for those which had been destroyed was locked up in his portmanteau at the hotel de belle rue in brussels  he had nothing left to himliterally nothing in that antwerp world  there was no other wretched being wandering then in that dutch town so utterly denuded of the goods of life  for what is a man fitfor what can he be fitwhen left in such a position  there are some evils which seem utterly to crush a man and if there be any misfortune to which a man may be allowed to succumb without imputation on his manliness surely it is such as this  how was mr horne to return to his hotel without incurring the displeasure of the municipality  that was my first thought  he had a cloak but it was at the inn and i found that my friend was oppressed with a great horror at the idea of being left alone so that i could not go in search of it  there is an old saying that no man is a hero to his valet de chambre the reason doubtless being this that it is customary for his valet to see the hero divested of those trappings in which so much of the heroic consists who reverences a clergyman without his gown or a warrior without his sword and sabretasche  what would even minerva be without her helmet  i do not wish it to be understood that i no longer reverenced mr horne because he was in an undress but he himself certainly lost much of his composed wellsustained dignity of demeanour  he was fearful and querulous cold and rather cross  when forgetting his size i offered him my own he thought that i was laughing at him he began to be afraid that the story would get abroad and he then and there exacted a promise that i would never tell it during his lifetime  i have kept my word but now my old friend has been gathered to his fathers full of years  at last i got him to the hotel  it was long before he would leave the castle cloaked though he wasnot indeed till the shades of evening had dimmed the outlines of men and things and made indistinct the outward garniture of those who passed to and fro in the streets  then wrapped in his cloak mr horne followed me along the quays and through the narrowest of the streets and at length without venturing to return the gaze of any one in the hotel court he made his way up to his own bedroom  dinnerless and supperless he went to his couch  but when there he did consent to receive some consolation in the shape of mutton cutlets and fried potatoes a savory omelet and a bottle of claret the mutton cutlets and fried potatoes at the golden fleece at antwerp areor were then for i am speaking now of wellnigh thirty years sinceremarkably good the claret also was of the best and so by degrees the look of despairing dismay passed from his face and some scintillations of the old fire returned to his eyes  i wonder whether they find themselves much happier for what they have got said he  a great deal happier said i  theyll boast of those things to all their friends at home and we shall doubtless see some account of their success in the newspapers  it would be delightful to expose their blunderto show them up would it not george  to turn the tables on them  yes said i i should like to have the laugh against them  so would i only that i should compromise myself by telling the story  it wouldnt do at all to have it told at oxford with my name attached to it  to this also i assented  to what would i not have assented in my anxiety to make him happy after his misery  but all was not over yet  he was in bed now but it was necessary that he should rise again on the morrow  at home in england what was required might perhaps have been made during the night but here among the slow flemings any such exertion would have been impossible  mr horne moreover had no desire to be troubled in his retirement by a tailor  now the landlord of the golden fleece was a very stout mana very stout man indeed  looking at him as he stood with his hands in his pockets at the portal of his own establishment i could not but think that he was stouter even than mr horne  but then he was certainly much shorter and the want of due proportion probably added to his unwieldy appearance  i walked round him once or twice wishfully measuring him in my eye and thinking of what texture might be the sunday best of such a man  the clothes which he then had on were certainly not exactly suited to mr hornes tastes  he saw that i was observing him and appeared uneasy and offended i had already ascertained that he spoke a little english  of flemish i knew literally nothing and in french with which probably he was also acquainted i was by no means voluble  the business which i had to transact was intricate and i required the use of my mothertongue  it was intricate and delicate and difficult withal  i began by remarking on the weather but he did not take my remarks kindly  i am inclined to fancy that he thought i was desirous of borrowing money from him  at any rate he gave me no encouragement in my first advances  vat misfortune at last he asked when i had succeeded in making him understand that a gentleman up stairs required his assistance  he has lost these things and i took hold of my own garments its a long story or id tell you how but he has not a pair in the world till he gets back to brusselsunless you can lend him one  lost hees br and he opened his eyes wide and looked at me with astonishment  yes yes exactly so said i interrupting him  most astonishing thing isnt it  but its quite true  vas hees money in de pocket asked my auspicious landlord  no no no  its not so bad as that his money is all right  i had the money luckily  ah dat is better  but he have lost hees b  yes yes i was now getting rather impatient  there is no mistake about it  he has lost them as sure as you stand there and then i proceeded to explain that as the gentleman in question was very stout and as he the landlord was stoat also he might assist us in this great calamity by a loan from his own wardrobe  when he found that the money was not in the pocket and that his bill therefore would be paid he was not indisposed to be gracious he would he said desire his servant to take up what was required to mr hornes chamber  i endeavoured to make him understand that a sombre colour would be preferable but he only answered that he would put the best that he had at the gentlemans disposal  he could not think of offering anything less than his best on such an occasion  and then he turned his back and went his way muttering as he went something in flemish which i believed to be an exclamation of astonishment that any man should under any circumstances lose such an article  it was now getting late so when i had taken a short stroll by myself i went to bed without disturbing mr horne again that night on the following morning i thought it best not to go to him unless he sent for me so i desired the boots to let him know that i had ordered breakfast in a private room and that i would await him there unless he wished to see me  he sent me word back to say that he would be with me very shortly  he did not keep me waiting above half an hour but i confess that that half hour was not pleasantly spent  i feared that his temper would be tried in dressing and that he would not be able to eat his breakfast in a happy state of mind  so that when i heard his heavy footstep advancing along the passage my heart did misgive me and i felt that i was trembling  that step was certainly slower and more ponderous than usual  there was always a certain dignity in the very sound of his movements but now this seemed to have been enhanced  to judge merely by the step one would have said that a bishop was coming that way instead of a prebendary  and then he entered  in the upper half of his august person no alteration was perceptible  the hair was as regular and as graceful as ever the handkerchief as white the coat as immaculate but below his wellfilled waistcoat a pair of red plush began to shine in unmitigated splendour and continued from thence down to within an inch above his knee nor as it appeared could any pulling induce them to descend lower  mr horne always wore black silk stockingsat least so the world supposed but it was now apparent that the world had been wrong in presuming him to be guilty of such extravagance  those at any rate which he exhibited on the present occasion were more economical  they were silk to the calf but thence upwards they continued their career in white cotton  these then followed the plush first two snowy fullsized pillars of white and then two jet columns of flossy silk  such was the appearance on that wellremembered morning of the rev augustus horne as he entered the room in which his breakfast was prepared  i could see at a glance that a dark frown contracted his eyebrows and that the compressed muscles of his upper lip gave a strange degree of austerity to his open face  he carried his head proudly on high determined to be dignified in spite of his misfortunes and advanced two steps into the room without a remark as though he were able to show that neither red plush nor black cloth could disarrange the equal poise of his mighty mind  and after all what are a mans garments but the outward husks in which the fruit is kept duly tempered from the wind   the rank is but the guinea stamp the mans the gowd for a that   and is not the tailors art as little worthy as insignificant as that of the king who makes   a marquis duke and a that   who would be content to think that his manly dignity depended on his coat and waistcoat or his hold on the worlds esteem on any other garment of usual wear  that no such weakness soiled his mind mr horne was determined to prove and thus he entered the room with measured tread and stern dignified demeanour  having advanced two steps his eye caught mine  i do not know whether he was moved by some unconscious smile on my partfor in truth i endeavoured to seem as indifferent as himself to the nature of his dressor whether he was invincibly tickled by some inward fancy of his own but suddenly his advancing step ceased a broad flash of comic humour spread itself over his features he retreated with his back against the wall and then burst out into an immoderate roar of loud laughter  and iwhat else could i then do but laugh  he laughed and i laughed  he roared and i roared  he lifted up his vast legs to view till the rays of the morning sun shone through the window on the bright hues which he displayed and he did not sit down to his breakfast till he had in every fantastic attitude shown off to the best advantage the red plush of which he had so recently become proud  an antwerp private cabriolet on that day reached the yard of the hotel de belle vue at about 4 pm and four waiters in a frenzy of astonishment saw the reverend augustus horne descend from the vehicle and seek his chamber dressed in the garments which i have described  but i am inclined to think that he never again favoured any of his friends with such a sight  it was on the next evening after this that i went out to drink tea with two maiden ladies relatives of mine who kept a seminary for english girls at brussels  the misses macmanus were very worthy women and earned their bread in an upright painstaking manner  i would not for worlds have passed through brussels without paying them this compliment  they were however perhaps a little dull and i was aware that i should not probably meet in their drawing room many of the fashionable inhabitants of the city  mr horne had declined to accompany me but in doing so he was good enough to express a warm admiration for the character of my worthy cousins  the elder miss macmanus in her little note had informed me that she would have the pleasure of introducing me to a few of my compatriots  i presumed she meant englishmen and as i was in the habit of meeting such every day of my life at home i cannot say that i was peculiarly elevated by the promise  when however i entered the room there was no englishman therethere was no man of any kind  there were twelve ladies collected together with the view of making the evening pass agreeably to me the single virile being among them all  i felt as though i were a sort of mohammed in paradise but i certainly felt also that the paradise was none of my own choosing  in the centre of the amphitheatre which the ladies formed sat the two misses macmanusthere at least they sat when they had completed the process of shaking hands with me  to the left of them making one wing of the semicircle were arranged the five pupils by attending to whom the misses macmanus earned their living and the other wing consisted of the five ladies who had furnished themselves with relics of general chasse  they were my compatriots  i was introduced to them all one after the other but their names did not abide in my memory one moment  i was thinking too much of the singularity of the adventure and could not attend to such minutiae  that the redrosed harpy was miss grogram that i rememberedthat i may say i shall never forget  but whether the motherly lady with the somewhat blowsy hair was mrs jones or mrs green or mrs walker i cannot now say  the dumpy female with the broad back was always called aunt sally by the young ladies  too much sugar spoils ones tea i think i have heard that even prosperity will cloy when it comes in overdoses and a schoolboy has been known to be overdone with jam  i myself have always been peculiarly attached to ladies society and have avoided bachelor parties as things execrable in their very nature  but on this special occasion i felt myself to be that schoolboyi was literally overdone with jam  my tea was all sugar so that i could not drink it  i was one among twelve  what could i do or say  the proportion of alloy was too small to have any effect in changing the nature of the virgin silver and the conversation became absolutely feminine  i must confess also that my previous experience as to these compatriots of mine had not prejudiced me in their favour  i regarded them withi am ashamed to say so seeing that they were ladiesbut almost with loathing  when last i had seen them their occupation had reminded me of some obscene feast of harpies or almost of ghouls  they had brought down to the verge of desperation the man whom of all men i most venerated  on these accounts i was inclined to be taciturn with reference to themand then what could i have to say to the misses macmanuss five pupils  my cousin at first made an effort or two in my favour but these efforts were fruitless  i soon died away into utter unrecognised insignificance and the conversation as i have before said became feminine  and indeed that horrid miss grogram who was as it were the princess of the ghouls nearly monopolised the whole of it mamma joneswe will call her jones for the occasionput in a word now and then as did also the elder and more energetic miss macmanus  the dumpy lady with the broad back ate teacake incessantly the two daughters looked scornful as though they were above their company with reference to the five pupils and the five pupils themselves sat in a row with the utmost propriety each with her hands crossed on her lap before her  of what they were talking at last i became utterly oblivious  they had ignored me going into realms of muslin questions of maid servants female rights and cheap underclothing and i therefore had ignored them  my mind had gone back to mr horne and his garments  while they spoke of their rights i was thinking of his wrongs when they mentioned the price of flannel i thought of that of broadcloth  but of a sudden my attention was arrested  miss macmanus had said something of the black silks of antwerp when miss grogram replied that she had just returned from that city and had there enjoyed a great success  my cousin had again asked something about the black silks thinking no doubt that miss grogram had achieved some bargain but that lady had soon undeceived her  oh no said miss grogram it was at the castle  we got such beautiful relics of general chasse  didnt we mrs jones  indeed we did said mrs jones bringing out from beneath the skirts of her dress and ostensibly displaying a large black bag  and ive got such a beautiful needlecase said the broadback displaying her prize  ive been making it up all the morning and she handed over the article to miss macmanus  and only look at this duck of a penwiper simpered flaxenhair no 2  only think of wiping ones pens with relics of general chasse and she handed it over to the other miss macmanus  and mines a pincushion said no 1 exhibiting the trophy  but thats nothing to what ive got said miss grogram  in the first place theres a pair of slippersa beautiful pairtheyre not made up yet of course and then  the two misses macmanus and their five pupils were sitting open eared openeyed and openmouthed  how all these sombrelooking articles could be relics of general chasse did not at first appear clear to them  what are they miss grogram said the elder miss macmanus holding the needlecase in one hand and mrs joness bag in the other  miss macmanus was a strongminded female and i reverenced my cousin when i saw the decided way in which she intended to put down the greedy arrogance of miss grogram  they are relics  but where do they come from miss grogram  why from the castle to be surefrom general chasses own rooms  did anybody sell them to you  no  or give them to you  why noat least not exactly give  there they were and she took em said the broadback  oh what a look miss grogram gave her  took them of course i took them that is you took them as much as i did  they were things that we found lying about  what things asked miss macmanus in a peculiarly strongminded tone  miss grogram seemed to be for a moment silenced  i had been ignored as i have said and my existence forgotten but now i observed that the eyes of the culprits were turned towards methe eyes that is of four of them  mrs jones looked at me from beneath her fan the two girls glanced at me furtively and then their eyes fell to the lowest flounces of their frocks  miss grogram turned her spectacles right upon me and i fancied that she nodded her head at me as a sort of answer to miss macmanus  the five pupils opened their mouths and eyes wider but she of the broad back was nothing abashed  it would have been nothing to her had there been a dozen gentlemen in the room  we just found a pair of black  the whole truth was told in the plainest possible language  oh aunt sally  aunt sally how can you  hold your tongue aunt sally  and then miss grogram just cut them up with her scissors continued aunt sally not a whit abashed and gave us each a bit only she took more than half for herself  it was clear to me that there had been some quarrel some delicious quarrel between aunt sally and miss grogram  through the whole adventure i had rather respected aunt sally  she took more than half for herself continued aunt sally  she kept all the  jemima said the elder miss macmanus interrupting the speaker and addressing her sister it is time i think for the young ladies to retire  will you be kind enough to see them to their rooms  the five pupils thereupon rose from their seatsand courtesied  they then left the room in file the younger miss macmanus showing them the way  but we havent done any harm have we asked mrs jones with some tremulousness in her voice  well i dont know said miss macmanus  what im thinking of now is thisto whom i wonder did the garments properly belong  who had been the owner and wearer of them  why general chasse of course said miss grogram  they were the generals repeated the two young ladies blushing however as they alluded to the subject  well we thought they were the generals certainly and a very excellent article they were said mrs jones  perhaps they were the butlers said aunt sally  i certainly had not given her credit for so much sarcasm  butlers exclaimed miss grogram with a toss of her head  oh aunt sally aunt sally how can you shrieked the two young ladies  oh laws ejaculated mrs jones  i dont think that they could have belonged to the butler said miss macmanus with much authority seeing that domestics in this country are never clad in garments of that description so far my own observation enables me to speak with certainty  but it is equally sure that they were never the property of the general lately in command at antwerp  generals when they are in full dress wear ornamental lace upon theirtheir regimentals and when  so much she said and something more which it may be unnecessary that i should repeat but such were her eloquence and logic that no doubt would have been left on the mind of any impartial hearer  if an argumentative speaker ever proved anything miss macmanus proved that general chasse had never been the wearer of the article in question  but i know very well they were his said miss grogram who was not an impartial hearer  of course they were whose elses should they be  im sure i hope they were his said one of the young ladies almost crying  i wish id never taken it said the other  dear dear dear said mrs jones  ill give you my needlecase miss grogram said aunt sally  i had sat hitherto silent during the whole scene meditating how best i might confound the rednosed harpy  now i thought was the time for me to strike in  i really think ladies that there has been some mistake said i  there has been no mistake at all sir said miss grogram  perhaps not i answered very mildly very likely not  but some affair of a similar nature was very much talked about in antwerp yesterday  oh laws again ejaculated mrs jones  the affair i allude to has been talked about a good deal certainly i continued  but perhaps it may be altogether a different circumstance  and what may be the circumstance to which you allude asked miss macmanus in the same authoritative tone  i dare say it has nothing to do with these ladies said i but an article of dress of the nature they have described was cut up in the castle of antwerp on the day before yesterday  it belonged to a gentleman who was visiting the place and i was given to understand that he is determined to punish the people who have wronged him  it cant be the same said miss grogram but i could see that she was trembling  oh laws what will become of us said mrs jones  you can all prove that i didnt touch them and that i warned her not said aunt sally  in the mean time the two young ladies had almost fainted behind their fans  but how had it come to pass asked miss macmanus that the gentleman had  i know nothing more about it cousin said i only it does seem that there is an odd coincidence  immediately after this i took my leave  i saw that i had avenged my friend and spread dismay in the hearts of these who had injured him  i had learned in the course of the evening at what hotel the five ladies were staying and in the course of the next morning i sauntered into the hall and finding one of the porters alone asked if they were still there  the man told me that they had started by the earliest diligence  and said he if you are a friend of theirs perhaps you will take charge of these things which they have left behind them  so saying he pointed to a table at the back of the hall on which were lying the black bag the black needlecase the black pin cushion and the black penwiper  there was also a heap of fragments of cloth which i well knew had been intended by miss grogram for the comfort of her feet and ancles  i declined the commission however  they were no special friends of mine i said and i left all the relics still lying on the little table in the back hall  upon the whole i am satisfied said the rev augustus horne when i told him the finale of the story
