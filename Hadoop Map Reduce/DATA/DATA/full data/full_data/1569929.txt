hereward the last of the english     prelude   the heroic deeds of highlanders both in these islands and elsewhere have been told in verse and prose and not more often nor more loudly than they deserve but we must remember now and then that there have been heroes likewise in the lowland and in the fen why however poets have so seldom sung of them why no historian save mr motley in his rise of the dutch republic has condescended to tell the tale of their doughty deeds is a question not difficult to answer  in the first place they have been fewer in number the lowlands of the world being the richest spots have been generally the soonest conquered the soonest civilized and therefore the soonest taken out of the sphere of romance and wild adventure into that of order and law hard work and common sense as well astoo ofteninto the sphere of slavery cowardice luxury and ignoble greed the lowland populations for the same reasons have been generally the first to deteriorate though not on account of the vices of civilization the vices of incivilization are far worse and far more destructive of human life and it is just because they are so that rude tribes deteriorate physically less than polished nations in the savage struggle for life none but the strongest healthiest cunningest have a chance of living prospering and propagating their race in the civilized state on the contrary the weakliest and the silliest protected by law religion and humanity have chance likewise and transmit to their offspring their own weakliness or silliness in these islands for instance at the time of the norman conquest the average of man was doubtless superior both in body and mind to the average of man now simply because the weaklings could not have lived at all and the rich and delicate beauty in which the women of the eastern counties still surpass all other races in these isles was doubtless far more common in proportion to the numbers of the population  another reasonand one which every scot will understandwhy lowland heroes carent vate sacro is that the lowlands and those who live in them are wanting in the poetic and romantic elements there is in the lowland none of that background of the unknown fantastic magical terrible perpetually feeding curiosity and wonder which still remains in the scottish highlands which when it disappears from thence will remain embalmed forever in the pages of walter scott against that halfmagical background his heroes stand out in vivid relief and justly so it was not put there by him for stage purposes it was there as a fact and the men of whom he wrote were conscious of it were moulded by it were not ashamed of its influence nature among the mountains is too fierce too strong for man he cannot conquer her and she awes him he cannot dig down the cliffs or chain the stormblasts and his fear of them takes bodily shape he begins to people the weird places of the earth with weird beings and sees nixes in the dark linns as he fishes by night dwarfs in the caves where he digs halftrembling morsels of copper and iron for his weapons witches and demons on the snowblast which overwhelms his herd and his hut and in the dark clouds which brood on the untrodden mountainpeak he lives in fear and yet if he be a valianthearted man his fears do him little harm they may break out at times in witchmanias with all their horrible suspicions and thus breed cruelty which is the child of fear but on the whole they rather produce in man thoughtfulness reverence a sense confused yet precious of the boundless importance of the unseen world his superstitions develop his imagination the moving accidents of a wild life call out in him sympathy and pathos and the mountaineer becomes instinctively a poet  the lowlander on the other hand has his own strength his own virtues or manfulnesses in the good old sense of the word but they are not for the most part picturesque or even poetical  he finds out soon enough for his weal and his bane that he is stronger than nature and right tyrannously and irreverently he lords it over her clearing delving diking building without fear or shame he knows of no natural force greater than himself save an occasional thunderstorm and against that as he grows more cunning he insures his crops why should he reverence nature let him use her and eat one cannot blame him man was sent into the world so says the scripture to fill and subdue the earth but he was sent into the world for other purposes which the lowlander is but too apt to forget with the awe of nature the awe of the unseen dies out in him meeting with no visible superior he is apt to become not merely unpoetical and irreverent but somewhat of a sensualist and an atheist the sense of the beautiful dies out in him more and more he has little or nothing around him to refine or lift up his soul and unless he meet with a religion and with a civilization which can deliver him he may sink into that dull brutality which is too common among the lowest classes of the english lowlands and remain for generations gifted with the strength and industry of the ox and with the courage of the lion and alas with the intellect of the former and the selfrestraint of the latter  but there may be a period in the history of a lowland race when they too become historic for a while there was such a period for the men of the eastern counties for they proved it by their deeds  when the men of wessex the once conquering race of britain fell at hastings once and for all and struck no second blow then the men of the danelagh disdained to yield to the norman invader for seven long years they held their own not knowing like true englishmen when they were beaten and fought on desperate till there were none left to fight their bones lay white on every island in the fens their corpses rotted on gallows beneath every norman keep their few survivors crawled into monasteries with eyes picked out or hands and feet cut off or took to the wild wood as strong outlaws like their successors and representatives robin hood scarlet and john adam bell and clym of the cleugh and william of cloudeslee but they never really bent their necks to the norman yoke they kept alive in their hearts that proud spirit of personal independence which they brought with them from the moors of denmark and the dales of norway and they kept alive too though in abeyance for a while those free institutions which were without a doubt the germs of our british liberty  they were a changed folk since first they settled in that danelaghsince first in the days of king beorhtric in the year 787 three ships of northmen came from haeretha land and the kings reeve rode to the place and would have driven them up to the kings town for he knew not what men they were but they slew him there and then and after the saxons and angles began to find out to their bitter bale what men they were those fierce vikings out of the dark northeast  but they had long ceased to burn farms sack convents torture monks for gold and slay every human being they met in mere berserker lust of blood no barnakill could now earn his nickname by entreating his comrades as they tossed the children on their spearpoints to na kill the barns gradually they had settled down on the land intermarried with the angles and saxons and colonized all england north and east of watling street a rough line from london to chester and the eastern lowlands of scotland likewise gradually they had deserted thor and odin for the white christ had their own priests and bishops and built their own minsters the convents which the fathers had destroyed the sons or at least the grandsons rebuilt and often casting away sword and axe they entered them as monks themselves and peterborough ely and above all crowland destroyed by them in alfreds time with a horrible destruction had become their holy places where they decked the altars with gold and jewels with silks from the far east and furs from the far north and where as in sacred fortresses they and the liberty of england with them made their last unavailing stand  for a while they had been lords of all england the anglosaxon race was wearing out the men of wessex priestridden and enslaved by their own aristocracy quailed before the free norsemen among whom was not a single serf the goddescended line of cerdic and alfred was worn out vain incapable profligate kings the tools of such prelates as odo and dunstan were no match for such wild heroes as thorkill the tall or olaf trygvasson or swend forkbeard the danes had gradually colonized not only their own danelagh and northumbria but great part of wessex vast sums of danegelt were yearly sent out of the country to buy off the fresh invasions which were perpetually threatened then ethelred the unready ethelred evilcounsel advised himself to fulfil his name and the curse which dunstan had pronounced against him at the baptismal font by his counsel the men of wessex rose against the unsuspecting danes and on st brices eve a d 1002 murdered them all with tortures man woman and child it may be that they only did to the children as the fathers had done to them but the deed was worse than a crime it was a mistake the danes of the danelagh and of northumbria their brothers of denmark and norway the orkneys and the east coast of ireland remained unharmed a mighty host of vikings poured from thence into england the very next year under swend forkbeard and the great canute and after thirteen fearful campaigns came the great battle of assingdown in essex where canute had the victory and all the english nation fought against him and all the nobility of the english race was there destroyed  that same year saw the mysterious death of edmund ironside the last man of cerdics race worthy of the name for the next twentyfive years danish kings ruled from the forth to the lands end  a noble figure he was that great and wise canute the friend of the famous godiva and leofric godivas husband and siward biorn the conqueror of macbeth trying to expiate by justice and mercy the dark deeds of his bloodstained youth trying and not in vain to blend the two races over which he ruled rebuilding the churches and monasteries which his father had destroyed bringing back in state to canterbury the body of archbishop elphegenot unjustly called by the saxons martyr and saintwhom tall thorkills men had murdered with beef bones and oxskulls because he would not give up to them the money destined for gods poor rebuking as every child has heard his housecarles flattery by setting his chair on the brink of the rising tide and then laying his golden crown in token of humility on the high altar of winchester never to wear it more in winchester lie his bones unto this day or what of them the civil wars have left and by him lie the bones of his son hardicanute in whom as in his halfbrother harold harefoot before him the danish power fell to swift decay by insolence and drink and civil war and with the danish power england fell to pieces likewise  canute had divided england into four great earldoms each ruled under him by a jarl or earla danish not a saxon title  at his death in 1036 the earldoms of northumbria and east angliathe more strictly danish partswere held by a true danish hero siward biorn alias digre the stout conqueror of macbeth and son of the fairy bear proving his descent men said by his pointed and hairy ears  mercia the great central plateau of england was held by earl leofric husband of the famous lady godiva  wessex which canute had at first kept in his own hands had passed into those of the famous earl godwin the then ablest man in england possessed of boundless tact and cunning gifted with an eloquence which seems from the accounts remaining of it to have been rather that of a greek than an englishman himself of highperhaps of royalsussex blood for the story of his low birth seems a mere fable of his french enemies and married first to canutes sister and then to his niece he was fitted alike by fortunes and by talents to be the kingmaker which he became  such a system may have worked well as long as the brain of a hero was there to overlook it all but when that brain was turned to dust the history of england became till the norman conquest little more than the history of the rivalries of the two great houses of godwin and leofric  leofric had the first success in kingmaking he though bearing a saxon name was the champion of the danish party and of canutes son or reputed son harold harefoot and he succeeded by the help of the thanes north of thames and the lithsmen of london which city was more than half danish in those days in setting his puppet on the throne but the blood of canute had exhausted itself within seven years harold harefoot and hardicanute who succeeded him had died as foully as they lived and godwins turn had come  he though married to a danish princess and acknowledging his danish connection by the norse names which were borne by his three most famous sons harold sweyn and tostig constituted himself the champion of the men of wessex and the house of cerdic he had murdered or at least caused to be murdered horribly alfred the etheling king ethelreds son and heirapparent when  it seemed his interest to support the claims of hardicanute against harefoot he now found little difficulty in persuading his victims younger brother to come to england and become at once his king his soninlaw and his puppet  edward the confessor if we are to believe the monks whom he pampered was naught but virtue and piety meekness and magnanimitya model ruler of men such a model ruler he was doubtless as monks would be glad to see on every throne because while he rules his subjects they rule him no wonder therefore that according to william of malmesbury the happiness of his times famed as he was both for miracles and the spirit of prophecy was revealed in a dream to brithwin bishop of wilton who made it public who meditating in king canutes time on the near extinction of the royal race of the english was rapt up on high and saw st peter consecrating edward king his chaste life also was pointed out and the exact period of his reign twentyfour years determined and when inquiring about his posterity it was answered the kingdom of the english belongs to god after you he will provide a king according to his pleasure but those who will look at the facts will see in the holy confessors character little but what is pitiable and in his reign little but what is tragical  civil wars invasions outlawry of godwin and his sons by the danish party then of alfgar leofrics son by the saxon party the outlaws on either side attacking and plundering the english shores by the help of norsemen welshmen irish and danesany mercenaries who could be got together and thenin the same year bishop aldred consecrated the minster at gloucester to the glory of god and of st peter and then went to jerusalem with such splendor as no man had displayed before him and so forth the sum and substance of what was done in those happy times may be well described in the words of the anglosaxon chronicler for the year 1058 this year alfgar the earl was banished but he came in again with violence through aid of griffin the king of north wales his brotherinlaw and this year came a fleet from norway it is tedious to tell how these matters went these were the normal phenomena of a reign which seemed to the eyes of monks a holy and a happy one because the king refused whether from spite or superstition to have an heir to the house of cerdic and spent his time between prayer hunting the seeing of fancied visions the uttering of fancied prophecies and the performance of fancied miracles  but there were excuses for him an englishman only in namea norman not only of his mothers descent she was aunt of william the conqueror but by his early education on the continenthe loved the norman better than the englishman norman knights and clerks filled his court and often the high dignities of his provinces and returned as often as expelled the normanfrench language became fashionable norman customs and manners the signs of civilization and thus all was preparing steadily for the great catastrophe by which within a year of edwards death the norman became master of the land  perhaps it ought to have been so perhaps by no other method could england and with england scotland and in due time ireland have become partakers of that classic civilization and learning the fount whereof for good and for evil was rome and the pope of rome but the method was at least wicked the actors in it tyrannous brutal treacherous hypocritical and the conquest of england by william will remain to the end of time a mighty crime abettedone may almost say made possible as too many such crimes have been before and sinceby the intriguing ambition of the pope of rome  against that tyranny the free men of the danelagh and of northumbria rose if edward the descendant of cerdic had been little to them william the descendant of rollo was still less that frenchspeaking knights should expel them from their homes frenchchanting monks from their convents because edward had promised the crown of england to william his foreign cousin or because harold godwinsson of wessex had sworn on the relics of all the saints to be williams man was contrary to their commonsense of right and reason  so they rose and fought too late it may be and without unity or purpose and they were worsted by an enemy who had both unity and purpose whom superstition greed and feudal discipline kept together at least in england in one compact body of unscrupulous and terrible confederates  but theirs was a land worth fighting fora good land and large from humber mouth inland to the trent and merry sherwood across to chester and the dee round by leicester and the five burghs of the danes eastward again to huntingdon and cambridge then a poor village on the site of an old roman town and then northward again into the wide fens the land of the girvii and the eormingas the children of the peatbog where the great central plateau of england slides into the sea to form from the rain and river washings of eight shires lowlands of a fertility inexhaustible because evergrowing to this day  they have a beauty of their own these great fens even now when they are diked and drained tilled and fenceda beauty as of the sea of boundless expanse and freedom much more had they that beauty eight hundred years ago when they were still for the most part as god had made them or rather was making them even then the low rolling uplands were clothed in primeval forest oak and ash beech and elm with here and there perhaps a group of ancient pines ragged and decayed and fast dying out in england even then though lingering still in the forests of the scotch highlands  between the forests were open wolds dotted with white sheep and golden gorse rolling plains of rich though ragged turf whether cleared by the hand of man or by the wild fires which often swept over the hills and between the wood and the wold stood many a danish town with its clusters of low straggling buildings round the holders house stone or mud below and wood above its high dikes round tiny fields its flocks of sheep ranging on the wold its herds of swine in the forest and below a more precious possession stillits herds of mares and colts which fed with the cattle in the rich grassfen  for always from the foot of the wolds the green flat stretched away illimitable to an horizon where from the roundness of the earth the distant trees and islands were hulled down like ships at sea the firm horsefen lay bright green along the foot of the wold beyond it the browner peat or deep fen and among it dark velvet alder beds long lines of reedrond emerald in spring and golden under the autumn sun shining   riverreaches broad meres dotted with a million fowl while the cattle waded along their edges after the rich sedgegrass or wallowed in the mire through the hot summers day here and there too upon the far horizon rose a tall line of ashen trees marking some island of firm rich soil here and there too as at ramsey and crowland the huge ashes had disappeared before the axes of the monks and a minster tower rose over the fen amid orchards gardens cornfields pastures with here and there a tree left standing for shade painted with flowers in the spring with pleasant shores embosomed in still lakes as the monkchronicler of ramsey has it those islands seemed to such as the monk terrestrial paradises  overhead the arch of heaven spread more ample than elsewhere as over the open sea and that vastness gave and still gives such effects of cloudland of sunrise and sunset as can be seen nowhere else within these isles they might well have been star worshippers those girvii had their sky been as clear as that of the east but they were like to have worshipped the clouds rather than the stars according to the too universal law that mankind worship the powers which do them harm rather than the powers which do them good  and therefore the danelagh men who feared not mortal sword or axe feared witches ghosts pucks willothewisps werewolves spirits of the wells and of the trees and all dark capricious and harmful beings whom their fancy conjured up out of the wild wet and unwholesome marshes or the dark wolfhaunted woods for that fair land like all things on earth had its darker aspect the foul exhalations of autumn called up fever and ague crippling and enervating and tempting almost compelling to that wild and desperate drinking which was the scandinavians special sin dark and sad were those short autumn days when all the distances were shut off and the air choked with foul brown fog and drenching rains from off the eastern sea and pleasant the bursting forth of the keen northeast wind with all its whirling snowstorms for though it sent men hurrying out into the storm to drive the cattle in from the fen and lift the sheep out of the snowwreaths and now and then never to return lost in mist and mire in ice and snowyet all knew that after the snow would come the keen frost and the bright sun and cloudless blue sky and the fenmans yearly holiday when work being impossible all gave themselves up to play and swarmed upon the ice on skates and sledges and ran races township against township or visited old friends full forty miles away and met everywhere faces as bright and ruddy as their own cheered by the keen wine of that dry and bracing frost  such was the fenland hard yet cheerful rearing a race of hard and cheerful men showing their power in old times in valiant fighting and for many a century since in that valiant industry which has drained and embanked the land of the girvii till it has become a very garden of the lord and the scotsman who may look from the promontory of peterborough the golden borough of old time  or from the tower of crowland while hereward and torfrida sleep in the ruined nave beneath or from the heights of that isle of ely which was so long the camp of refuge for english freedom over the labyrinth of dikes and lodes the squares of rich corn and verdurewill confess that the lowland as well as the highland can at times breed gallant men footnote the story of hereward often sung by minstrels and oldwives in succeeding generations may be found in the metrical chronicle of geoffrey gaimar and in the prose life of hereward paraphrased from that written by leofric his house priest and in the valuable fragment of the family of hereward these have all three been edited by mr t wright the account of hereward in ingulf seems taken and that carelessly from the same source as the latin prose de gestis herewardi a few curious details may be found in peter of bloiss continuation of ingulf and more concerning the sack of peterborough in the anglosaxon chronicle i have followed the contemporary authorities as closely as i could introducing little but what was necessary to reconcile discrepancies or to illustrate the history manners and sentiments of the timec k     chapter i  how hereward was outlawed and went north to seek his fortunes   known to all is lady godiva the most beautiful as well as the most saintly woman of her day who all her life kept at her own expense thirteen poor folk wherever she went who throughout lent watched in the church at triple matins namely one for the trinity one for the cross and one for st mary who every day read the psalter through and so persevered in good and holy works to her lifes endthe devoted friend of st mary ever a virgin who enriched monasteries without numberleominster wenlock chester st marys stow by lincoln worcester evesham and who above all founded the great monastery in that town of coventry which has made her name immortal for another and a far nobler deed and enriched it so much that no monastery in england possessed such abundance of gold silver jewels and precious stones beside that most precious jewel of all the arm of st augustine which not lady godiva but her friend archbishop ethelnoth presented to coventry having bought it at pavia for a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold footnote william of malmesbury  less known save to students is her husband leofric the great earl of mercia and chester whose bones lie by those of godiva in that same minster of coventry how his counsel was as if one had opened the divine oracles very wise says the anglosaxon chronicle for god and for the world which was a blessing to all this nation the greatest man save his still greater rival earl godwin in edward the confessors court  less known again are the children of that illustrious pair algar or alfgar earl of mercia after his father who died after a short and stormy life leaving two sons edwin and morcar the fair and hapless young earls always spoken of together as if they had been twins a daughter aldytha or elfgiva married first according to some to griffin king of north wales and certainly afterwards to harold king of england and another lucia as  the normans at least called her whose fate was if possible more sad than that of her brothers  their second son was hereward whose history this tale sets forth their third and youngest a boy whose name is unknown  they had probably another daughter beside married it may be to some son of leofrics stanch friend old siward biorn the viking earl of northumberland and conqueror of macbeth and the mother may be of the two young siwards the white and the red who figure in chronicle and legend as the nephews of hereward but this pedigree is little more than a conjecture  be these things as they may godiva was the greatest lady in england save two edith harolds sister the nominal wife of edward the confessor and githa or gyda as her own danes called her harolds mother niece of canute the great great was godiva and might have been proud enough had she been inclined to that pleasant sin and even then for there is a skeleton they say in every house she carried that about her which might well keep her humble namely shame at the misconduct of hereward her son  her favorite residence among the many manors and villas or farms which leofric possessed was neither the stately hall at loughton by bridgenorth nor the statelier castle of warwick but the house of bourne in south lincolnshire between the great woods of the bruneswald and the great level of the fens it may have been her own paternal dowry and have come down to her in right of her danish ancestors and that great and magnificent jarl oslac from whom she derived her allbutroyal blood this is certain that leofric her husband went in east anglia by the name of leofric lord of bourne that as domesday book testifies his son alfgar and his grandson morcar held large lands there and thereabout alfgars name indeed still lives in the village of algarkirk and lady godiva and algar after her enriched with great gifts crowland the island sanctuary and peterborough where brand either her brother or leofrics was a monk and in due time an abbot  the house of bourne as far as it can be reconstructed by imagination was altogether unlike one of the tall and gloomy norman castles which twenty years later reared their evil donjons over england it was much more like a house in a chinese painting an irregular group of low buildings almost all of one story stone below and timber above with highpeaked roofsat least in the more danish countryaffording a separate room or rather house for each different need of the family such a one may be seen in the illuminations of the century in the centre of the building is the hall with door or doors opening out into the court and sitting thereat at the top of a flight of steps the lord and lady dealing clothes to the naked and bread to the hungry on one side of the hall is a chapel by it a large room or bower for the ladies behind the hall a round tower seemingly the strong place of the whole house on the other side a kitchen and stuck on to bower kitchen and every other principal building leanto after leanto the uses of which it is impossible now to discover the house had grown with the wants of the familyas many good old english houses have done to this day round it would be scattered barns and stables in which grooms and herdsmen slept side by side with their own horses and cattle and outside all the yard garth or gardenfence high earthbank with palisades on top which formed a strong defence in time of war such was most probably the villa ton or town of earl leofric the lord of bourne the favorite residence of godivaonce most beautiful and still most holy according to the holiness of those old times  now on a dayabout the year 1054while earl siward was helping to bring birnam wood to dunsinane to avenge his murdered brotherinlaw lady godiva sat not at her hall door dealing food and clothing to her thirteen poor folk but in her bower with her youngest son a twoyears boy at her knee she was listening with a face of shame and horror to the complaint of herluin steward of peterborough who had fallen in that afternoon with hereward and his crew of housecarles  to keep a following of stout housecarles or menatarms was the pride as well as the duty of an anglodanish lord as it was till lately of a scotodanish highland laird and hereward in imitation of his father and his elder brother must needs have his following from the time he was but fifteen years old all the unruly youths of the neighborhood sons of free holders who owed some sort of military service to earl leofric geri his cousin winter whom he called his brotherinarms the wulfrics the wulfards the azers and many another wild blade had banded themselves round a young nobleman more unruly than themselves their names were already a terror to all decent folk at wakes and fairs alehouses and village sports they atoned be it remembered for their early sins by making those names in after years a terror to the invaders of their native land but as yet their prowess was limited to drunken brawls and factionfights to upsetting old women at their work levying blackmail from quiet chapmen on the high road or bringing back in triumph sword in hand and club on shoulder their leader hereward from some duel which his insolence had provoked  but this time if the story of the subprior was to be believed hereward and his housecarles had taken an ugly stride forward toward the pit they had met him riding along intent upon his psalter in a lonely path of the bruneswaldwhereon your son most gracious lady bade me stand saying that his men were thirsty and he had no money to buy ale withal and none so likely to help him thereto as a fat priestfor so he scandalously termed me who as your ladyship knows am leaner than the minster bellropes with fasting wednesdays and fridays throughout the year beside the vigils of the saints and the former and latter lents  but when he saw who i was as if inspired by a malignant spirit he shouted out my name and bade his companions throw me to the ground  throw you to the ground shuddered the lady godiva  in much mire madam after which he took my palfrey saying that heavens gate was too lowly for men on horseback to get in thereat and then my martens fur gloves and cape which your gracious self bestowed on me alleging that the rules of my order allowed only one garment and no furs save catskins and such like and lastlyi tremble while i relate thinking not of the loss of my poor money but the loss of an immortal soultook from me a purse with sixteen silver pennies which i had collected from our tenants for the use of the monastery and said blasphemously that i and mine had swindled your ladyship and therefore him your son out of many a fair manor ere now and it was but fair that he should tithe the rents thereof as he should never get the lands out of our claws again with more of the like which i blush to repeatand so left me to trudge hither in the mire  wretched boy said the lady godiva and hid her face in her hands and more wretched i to have brought such a son into the world  the monk had hardly finished his doleful story when there was a pattering of heavy feet a noise of men shouting and laughing outside and a voice above all calling for the monk by name which made that good man crouch behind the curtain of lady godivas bed the next moment the door of the bower was thrown violently open and in walked or rather reeled a noble lad eighteen years old his face was of extraordinary beauty save that the lower jaw was too long and heavy and that his eyes wore a strange and almost sinister expression from the fact that the one of them was gray and the other blue he was short but of immense breadth of chest and strength of limb while his delicate hands and feet and long locks of golden hair marked him of most noble and even as he really was of ancient royal race he was dressed in a gaudy costume resembling on the whole that of a highland chieftain his knees wrists and throat were tattoed in bright blue patterns  and he carried sword and dagger a gold ring round his neck and gold rings on his wrists he was a lad to have gladdened the eyes of any mother but there was no gladness in the lady godivas eyes as she received him nor had there been for many a year she looked on him with sternnesswith all but horror and he his face flushed with wine which he had tossed off as he passed through the hall to steady his nerves for the coming storm looked at her with smiling defiance the result of long estrangement between mother and son  well my lady said he ere she could speak i heard that this good fellow was here and came home as fast as i could to see that he told you as few lies as possible  he has told me said she that you have robbed the church of god  robbed him it may be an old hoody crow against whom i have a grudge of ten years standing  wretched wretched boy what wickedness next know you not that he who robs the church robs god himself  and he who harms gods people put in the monk from behind the chair harms his maker  his maker said the lad with concentrated bitterness it would be a gay world if the maker thereof were in any way like unto you who call yourselves his people do you remember who told them to set the peatstack on fire under me ten years ago ah ha sir monk you forget that i have been behind the screenthat i have been a monk myself or should have been one if my pious lady mother here had had her will of me as she may if she likes of that doll there at her knee do you forget why i left peterborough abbey when winter and i turned all your priests books upside down in the choir and they would have flogged usme the earls sonme the vikings sonme the champion as i will be yet and make all lands ring with the fame of my deeds as they rung with the fame of my forefathers before they became the slaves of monks and how when winter and i got hold of the kitchen spits and up to the top of the peatstack and held you all at bay there a whole abbeyful of cowards there against two seven years children it was you bade set the peatstack alight under us and so bring us down and would have done it too had it not been for my uncle brand the only man that i care for in this wide world do you think i have not owed you a grudge ever since that day monk and do you think i will not pay it do you think i would not have burned peterborough minster over your head before now had it not been for uncle brands sake see that i do not do it yet see that when there is another prior in borough you do not find hereward the berserker smoking you out some dark night as he would smoke a wasps nest and i will by  hereward hereward cried his mother godless godforgotten boy what words are these silence before you burden your soul with an oath which the devils in hell will accept and force you to keep and she sprung up and seizing his arm laid her hand upon his mouth  hereward looked at her majestic face once lovely now  careworn and trembled for a moment had there been any tenderness in it his history might have been a very different one but alas there was none not that she was in herself untender but that her great piety call it not superstition for it was then the only form known or possible to pure and devout souls was so outraged by this or even by the slightest insult to that clergy whose willing slave she had become that the only method of reclaiming the sinner had been long forgotten in genuine horror at his sin is it not enough she went on sternly that you should have become the bully and the ruffian of all the fensthat hereward the leaper hereward the wrestler hereward the thrower of the hammersports after all only fit for the sons of slavesshould be also hereward the drunkard hereward the common fighter hereward the breaker of houses hereward the leader of mobs of boon companions which bring back to us in shame and sorrow the days when our heathen forefathers ravaged this land with fire and sword is it not enough for me that my son should be a common stabber  whoever called me stabber to you lies if i have killed men or had them killed i have done it in fair fight  but she went on unheedingis it not enough that after having squandered on your fellows all the money that you could wring from my bounty or win at your brutal sports you should have robbed your own father collected his rents behind his back taken money and goods from his tenants by threats and blows but that after outraging them you must add to all this a worse sin likewiseoutraging god and driving meme who have borne with you me who have concealed all for your saketo tell your father that of which the very telling will turn my hair to gray  so you will tell my father said hereward coolly  and if i should not this monk himself is bound to do so or his superior your uncle brand  my uncle brand will not and your monk dare not  then i must i have loved you long and well but there is one thing which i must love better than you and that is my conscience and my maker  those are two things my lady mother and not one so you had better not confound them as for the latter do you not think that he who made the world is well able to defend his own propertyif the lands and houses and cattle and money which these men wheedle and threaten and forge out of you and my father are really his property and not merely their plunder as for your conscience my lady mother really you have done so many good deeds in your life that it might be beneficial to you to do a bad one once in a way so as to keep your soul in a wholesome state of humility  the monk groaned aloud lady godiva groaned but it was inwardly there was silence for a moment both were abashed by the lads utter shamelessness  and you will tell my father said he again he is at the old miracleworkers court at westminster he will tell the miracleworker and i shall be outlawed  and if you be wretched boy whom have you to blame but yourself can you expect that the king sainted even as he is before his death dare pass over such an atrocity towards holy church  blame i shall blame no one pass over i hope he will not pass over it i only want an excuse like that for turning kemperymanknighterrant as those norman puppies call itlike regnar lodbrog or frithiof or harold hardraade and try what man can do for himself in the world with nothing to help him in heaven and earth with neither saint nor angel friend or counsellor to see to him save his wits and his good sword so send off the messenger good mother mine and i will promise you i will not have him hamstrung on the way as some of my housecarles would do for me if i but held up my hand and let the miraclemonger fill up the measure of his folly by making an enemy of one more bold fellow in the world  and he swaggered out of the room  and when he was gone the lady godiva bowed her head into her lap and wept long and bitterly neither her maidens nor the priest dare speak to her for nigh an hour but at the end of that time she lifted up her head and settled her face again till it was like that of a marble saint over a minster door and called for ink and paper and wrote her letter and then asked for a trusty messenger who should carry it up to westminster  none so swift or sure said the house steward as martin lightfoot  lady godiva shook her head i mistrust that man she said he is too fond of my poorof the lord hereward  he is a strange one my lady and no one knows whence he came and i sometimes fancy whither he may go either but ever since my lord threatened to hang him for talking with my young master he has never spoken to him nor scarcely indeed to living soul and one thing there is makes him or any man sure as long as he is well paid and that is that he cares for nothing in heaven or earth save himself and what he can get  so martin lightfoot was sent for he came in straight into the ladys bedchamber after the simple fashion of those days he was a tall lean bony man as was to be expected from his nickname  with a long hooked nose a scanty brown beard and a high conical head his only garment was a shabby gray woollen tunic which served him both as coat and kilt and laced brogues of untanned hide he might have been any age from twenty to forty but his face was disfigured with deep scars and long exposure to the weather he dropped on one knee holding his greasy cap in his hand and looked not at his ladys face but at her feet with a stupid and frightened expression she knew very little of him save that her husband had picked him up upon the road as a wanderer some five years since and that he had been employed as a doer of odd jobs and runner of messages and that was supposed from his taciturnity and strangeness to have something uncanny about him  martin said the lady they tell me that you are a silent and a prudent man  that am i              tongue speaketh bane    though she herself hath nane  i shall try you do you know your way to london  yes  to your lords lodgings in westminster  yes  how long shall you be going there with this letter  a day and a half  when shall you be back hither  on the fourth day  and you will go to my lord and deliver this letter safely  yes your majesty  why do you call me majesty the king is majesty  you are my queen  what do you mean man  you can hang me  i hang thee poor soul who did i ever hang or hurt for a moment if i could help it  but the earl may  he will neither hang nor hurt thee if thou wilt take this letter safely and bring me back the answer safely  they will kill me  who  they said martin pointing to the bower maidensyoung ladies of good family who stood round chosen for their good looks after the fashion of those times to attend on great ladies there was a cry of angry and contemptuous denial not unmixed with something like laughter which showed that martin had but spoken the truth hereward in spite of all his sins was the darling of his mothers bower and there was not one of the damsels but would have done anything short of murder to have prevented martin carrying the letter  silence man said lady godiva so sternly that martin saw that he had gone too far how knowst such as thou what is in this letter  those others will know said martin sullenly without answering the last question  who  his housecarles outside there  he has promised that they shall not touch thee but how knowest thou what is in this letter  i will take it said martin he held out his hand took it and looked at it but upside down and without any attempt to read it  his own mother said he after a while  what is that to thee said lady godiva blushing and kindling  nothing i had no mother but god has one  what meanest thou knave wilt thou take the letter or no  i will take it and he again looked at it without rising off his knee his own father too  what is that to thee i say again  nothing i have no father but gods son has one  what wilt thou thou strange man asked she puzzled and halffrightened and how camest thou to know what is in this letter  who does not know a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid on the fourth day from this i will be back  and martin rose and putting the letter solemnly into the purse at his girdle shot out of the door with clenched teeth as a man upon a fixed purpose which it would lighten his heart to carry out he ran rapidly through the large outer hall past the long oak table at which hereward and his boon companions were drinking and roistering and as he passed the young lord he cast on him a look so full of meaning that though hereward knew not what the meaning was it startled him and for a moment softened him did this man who had sullenly avoided him for more than two years whom he had looked on as a clod or a post in the field beneath his notice since he could be of no use to himdid this man still care for him hereward had reason to know better than most that there was something strange and uncanny about the man did he mean him well or had he some grudge against him which made him undertake this journey willingly and out of spitepossibly with the will to make bad worse for an instant herewards heart misgave him he would stop the letter at all risks hold him he cried to his comrades  but martin turned to him laid his finger on his lips smiled kindly and saying you promised caught up a loaf from the table slipped from among them like an eel and darted out of the door and out of the close they followed him to the great gate and there stopped some cursing some laughing to give martin lightfoot a yard advantage was never to come up with him again some called for bows to bring him down with a parting shot but hereward forbade them and stood leaning against the gatepost watching him trot on like a lean wolf over the lawn till he was lost in the great elmwoods which fringed the southern fen  now lads said hereward home with you all and make your peace with your fathers in this house you never drink ale again  they looked at him surprised  you are disbanded my gallant army as long as i could cut long thongs out of other mens hides i could feed you like earls sons but now i must feed myself and a dog over his bone wants no company outlawed i shall be before the week is out and unless you wish to be outlawed too you will obey orders and home  we will follow you to the worlds end cried some  to the ropes end lads that is all you will get in my company go home with you and those who feel a calling let them turn monks and those who have not let them learn       for to plough and to sow        and to reap and to mow         and to be a farmers boy  good night  and he went in and shut the great gates after him leaving them astonished  to take his advice and go home was the simplest thing to be done a few of them on their return were soundly thrashed and deserved it a few were hidden by their mothers for a week in haylofts and henroosts till their fathers anger had passed away but only one turned monk or clerk and that was leofric the unlucky godson of the great earl and poetinordinary to the band  the next morning at dawn hereward mounted his best horse armed himself from head to foot and rode over to peterborough  when he came to the abbeygate he smote thereon with his lancebut till the porters teeth rattled in his head for fear  let me in he shouted i am hereward leofricsson i must see my uncle brand  o my most gracious lord cried the porter thrusting his head out of the wicket what is this that you have been doing to our steward  the tithe of what i will do unless you open the gate  o my lord said the porter as he opened it if our lady and st peter would but have mercy on your fair face and convert your soul to the fear of god and man  she would make me as good an old fool as you fetch my uncle the prior  the porter obeyed the son of earl leofric was as a young lion among the sheep in those parts and few dare say him nay certainly not the monks of peterborough moreover the good porter could not help being strangely fond of herewardas was every one whom he did not insult rob or kill  out came brand a noble elder more fit from his eye and gait to be a knight than a monk he looked sadly at hereward  dear is bought the honey that is licked off the thorn quoth hending said he  hending bought his wisdom by experience i suppose said hereward and so must i so i am just starting out to see the world uncle  naughty naughty boy if we had thee safe here again for a week we would take this hot blood out of thee and send thee home in thy right mind  bring a rod and whip me then try and you shall have your chance every one else has had and this is the end of their labors  by the chains of st peter quoth the monk that is just what thou needest hoist thee on such another fools back truss thee up and lay it on lustily till thou art ashamed to treat thee as a man is only to make thee a more heady blownup ass than thou art already  true most wise uncle and therefore my still wiser parents are going to treat me like a man indeed and send me out into the world to seek my fortunes  eh  they are going to prove how thoroughly they trust me to take care of myself by outlawing me eh say i in return is not that an honor and a proof that i have not shown myself a fool though i may have a madman  outlaw you o my boy my darling my pride get off your horse and dont sit there hand on hip like a turbaned saracen defying god and man but come down and talk reason to me for the sake of st peter and all saints  hereward threw himself off his horse and threw his arms round his uncles neck  pish now uncle dont cry do what you will lest i cry too help me to be a man while i live even if i go to the black place when i die  it shall not be  and the monk swore by all the relics in peterborough minster  it must be it shall be i like to be outlawed i want to be outlawed it makes one feel like a man there is not an earl in england save my father who has not been outlawed in his time my brother alfgar will be outlawed before he dies if he has the spirit of a man in him it is the fashion my uncle and i must follow it so hey for the merry greenwood and the long ships and the swans bath and all the rest of it uncle you will lend me fifty silver pennies  i i would not lend thee one if i had it which i have not and yet old fool that i am i believe i would  i would pay thee back honestly i shall go down to constantinople to the varangers get my polotaswarf footnote see the heimskringla harold hardraades saga for the meaning of this word out of the kaisers treasure and pay thee back five to one  what does this son of belial here asked an austere voice  ah abbot leofric my very good lord i have come to ask hospitality of you for some three days by that time i shall be a wolfs head and out of the law and then if you will give me ten minutes start you may put your bloodhounds on my track and see which runs fastest they or i you are a gentleman and a man of honor so i trust to you to feed my horse fairly the meanwhile and not to let your monks poison me  the abbots face relaxed he tried to look as solemn as he could but he ended in bursting into a very great laughter and swearing likewise  the insolence of this lad passes the miracles of all saints he robs st peter on the highway breaks into his abbey insults him to his face and then asks him for hospitality and  and gets it quoth hereward  what is to be done with him brand my friend if we turn him out  which we cannot do said brand looking at the wellmailed and armed lad without calling in half a dozen of our menatarms  in which case there would be blood shed and scandal made in the holy precincts  and nothing gained for yield he would not till he was killed outright which god forbid  amen and if he stay here he may be persuaded to repentance  and restitution  as for that quoth hereward who had remounted his horse from prudential motives and set him athwart the gateway so that there was no chance of the doors being slammed behind him if either of you will lend me sixteen pence i will pay it back to you and st peter before i die with interest enough to satisfy any jew on the word of a gentleman and an earls son  the abbot burst again into a great laughter come in thou graceless renegade and we will see to thee and thy horse and i will pray to st peter and i doubt not he will have patience with thee for he is very merciful and after all thy parents have been exceeding good to us and the righteousness of the father like his sins is sometimes visited on the children  now why were the two ecclesiastics so uncanonically kind to this wicked youth  perhaps because both the old bachelors were wishing from their hearts that they had just such a son of their own and beside earl leofric was a very great man indeed and the wind might change for it is an unstable world  only mind one thing said the naughty boy as he dismounted and halloed to a laybrother to see to his horsedont let me see the face of that herluin  and why you have wronged him and he will forgive you doubtless like a good christian as he is  that is his concern but if i see him i cut off his head and as uncle brand knows i always sleep with my sword under my pillow  o that such a mother should have borne such a son groaned the abbot as they went in  on the fifth day came martin lightfoot and found hereward in prior brands private cell  well asked hereward coolly  is he is he stammered brand and could not finish his sentence  martin nodded  hereward laugheda loud swaggering hysterical laugh  see what it is to be born of just and pious parents come master trotalone speak out and tell us all about it thy lean wolfs legs have run to some purpose open thy lean wolfs mouth and speak for once lest i ease thy legs for the rest of thy life by a cut across the hams find thy lost tongue i say  walls have ears as well as the wildwood said martin  we are safe here said the prior so speak and tell us the whole truth  well when the earl read the letter he turned red and pale again and then naught but men follow me to the king at westminster so we went all with our weapons twenty or more along the strand and up into the kings new hall and a grand hall it is but not easy to get into for the crowd of monks and beggars on the stairs hindering honest folks business and there sat the king on a high settle with his pink face and white hair looking as royal as a bellwether new washed and on either side of him on the same settle sat the old fox and the young wolf  godwin and harold and where was the queen  sitting on a stool at his feet with her hands together as if she were praying and her eyes downcast as demure as any cat and so is fulfilled the story how the sheepdog went out to get married and left the fox the wolf and the cat to guard the flock  if thou hast found thy tongue said brand thou art like enough to lose it again by slice of knife talking such ribaldry of dignities dost not knowand he sank his voicethat abbot leofric is earl harolds man and that harold himself made him abbot  i said walls have ears it was you who told me that we were safe however i will bridle the unruly one and he went on and your father walked up the hall his left hand on his swordhilt looking an earl all over as he is  he is that said hereward in a low voice  and he bowed and the most magnificent powerful and virtuous godwin would have beckoned him up to sit on the high settle but he looked straight at the king as if there were never a godwin or a godwinsson on earth and cried as he stood  justice my lord the king  and at that the king turned pale and said who what o miserable world o last days drawing nearer and nearer o earth full of violence and blood who has wronged thee now most dear and noble earl  justice against my own son  at that the fox looked at the wolf and the wolf at the fox and if they did not smile it was not for want of will i warrant but your father went on and told all his story and when he came to your robbing master monko apostate cries the bellwether o spawn of beelzebub excommunicate him with bell book and candle may he be thrust down with korah balaam and iscariot to the most stygian pot of the sempiternal tartarus  and at that your father smiled that is bishops work says he and i want kings work from you lord king outlaw me this young rebels sinful body as by law you can and leave his sinful soul to the priestsor to gods mercy which is like to be more than theirs  then the queen looked up your own son noble earl think of what you are doing and one whom all say is so gallant and so fair o persuade him fatherpersuade him harold my brotheror if you cannot persuade him persuade the king at least and save this poor youth from exile  puss velvetpaw knew well enough said hereward in a low voice that the way to harden my fathers heart was to set godwin and harold on softening it they ask my pardon from the king i would not take it at their asking even if my father would  there spoke a true leofricsson said brand in spite of himself  by the and martin repeated a certain very solemn oath said your father justice i will have my lord king who talks to me of my own son you put me into my earldom to see justice done and law obeyed and how shall i make others keep within bound if i am not to keep in my own flesh and blood here is this land running headlong to ruin because every noblemanay every churl who owns a manor if he daresmust needs arm and saddle and levy war on his own behalf and harry and slay the kings lieges if he have not garlic to his roast goose every time he choosesand there your father did look at godwin once and for alland shall i let my son follow the fashion and do his best to leave the land open and weak for norseman or dane or frenchman or whoever else hopes next to mount the throne of a king who is too holy to leave an heir behind him  ahoi martin the silent where learnt you so suddenly the trade of preaching i thought you kept your wind for your running this two years past you would make as good a talker among the witan as godwin himself you give it us all word for word and voice and gesture withal as if you were king edwards french chancellor  martin smiled i am like falada the horse my lords who could only speak to his own true princess why i held my tongue of late was only lest they should cut my head off for talking as they did poor faladas  thou art a very crafty knave said brand and hast had clerklearning in thy time i can see and made bad use of it i misdoubt very much that thou art some runaway monk  that am i not by st peters chains said martin in an eager terrified voice lord hereward i came hither as your fathers messenger and servant you will see me safe out of this abbey like an honorable gentleman  i will all i know of him uncle is that he used to tell me stories when i was a boy of enchanters and knights and dragons and such like and got into trouble for filling my head with such fancies now let him tell his story in peace  he shall but i misdoubt the fellow very much he talks as if he knew latin and what business has a footrunning slave to do that  so martin went on somewhat abashed and said your father justice i will have and leave injustice and the overlooking of it to those who wish to profit thereby  and at that godwin smiled and said to the king the earl is wise as usual and speaks like a very solomon your majesty must in spite of your own tenderness of heart have these letters of outlawry made out  then all our men murmuredand i as loud as any but old surturbrand the housecarle did more for out he stepped to your fathers side and spoke right up before the king  bonny times he said i have lived to see when a lad of earl oslacs blood is sent out of the land a beggar and a wolfs head for playing a boys trick or two and upsetting a shaveling priest we managed such wild young colts better we vikings who conquered the danelagh if canute had had a son like herewardas would to god he had hadhe would have dealt with him as old swend forkbeard god grant i meet him in valhalla in spite of all priests did by canute himself when he was young and kicked and plunged awhile at being first bitted and saddled  what does the man say asked the king for old surturbrand was talking broad danish  he is a housecarle of mine lord king a good man and true but old age and rough danish blood has made him forget that he stands before kings and earls  by  earl says surturbrand i have fought knee to knee beside a braver king than that there and nobler earls than ever a one here and was never afraid like a free dane to speak my mind to them by sea or land and if the king with his french ways does not understand a plain mans talk the two earls yonder do right well and i saydeal by this lad in the good old fashion give him half a dozen long ships and what crews he can get together and send him out as canute would have done to seek his fortune like a viking and if he comes home with plenty of wounds and plenty of plunder give him an earldom as he deserves do you ask your countess earl godwinshe is of the right danish blood god bless her though she is your wifeand see if she does not know how to bring a naughty lad to his senses  then harold the earl said the old man is right king listen to what he says and he told him all quite eagerly  how did you know that can you understand french  i am a poor idiot give me a halfpenny said martin in a doleful voice as he threw into his face and whole figure a look of helpless stupidity and awkwardness which set them both laughing  but hereward checked himself and you think he was in earnest  as sure as there are holy crows in crowland but it was of no use your father got a parchment with an outlandish norman seal hanging to it and sent me off with it that same night to give to the lawman so wolfs head you are my lord and there is no use crying over spilt milk  and harold spoke for me it will be as well to tell abbot leofric that in case he be inclined to turn traitor and refuse to open the gates once outside them i care not for mortal man  my poor boy there will be many a one whom thou hast wronged only too ready to lie in wait for thee now thy life is in every mans hand if the outlawry is published thou hadst best start tonight and get past lincoln before morning  i shall stay quietly here and get a good nights rest and then ride out tomorrow morning in the face of the whole shire no not a word you would not have me sneak away like a coward  brand smiled and shrugged his shoulders being very much of the same mind  at least go north  and why north  you have no quarrel in northumberland and the kings writ runs very slowly there if at all old siward digre may stand your friend  he he is a fast friend of my fathers  what of that the old viking will like you none the less for having shown a touch of his own temper go to him i say and tell him that i sent you  but he is fighting the scots beyond the forth  so much the better there will be good work for you to do and gislebert of ghent is up there too i hear trying to settle himself among the scots he is your mothers kinsman and as for your being an outlaw he wants hard hitters and hard riders and all is fish that comes to his net find him out too and tell him i sent you  you are a good old uncle said hereward why were you not a soldier  brand laughed somewhat sadly  if i had been a soldier lad where would you have looked for a friend this day no god has done what was merciful with me and my sins may he do the same by thee and thine  hereward made an impatient movement he disliked any word which seemed likely to soften his own hardness of heart but he kissed his uncle lovingly on both cheeks  by the by martinany message from my lady mother  none  quite right and pious i am an enemy to holy church and therefore to her good night uncle  hey asked brand where is that footmanmartin you call him i must have another word with him  but martin was gone  no matter i shall question him sharply enough tomorrow i warrant  and hereward went out to his lodging while the good prior went to his prayers  when hereward entered his room martin started out of the darkness and followed him in then he shut to the door carefully and pulled out a bag  there was no message from my lady but there was this  the bag was full of money  why did you not tell me of this before  never show money before a monk  villain would you mistrust my uncle  any man with a shaven crown st peter is his god and lord and conscience and if he saw but the shine of a penny for st peter he would want it  and he shall have it quoth hereward and flung out of the room and into his uncles  uncle i have money i am come to pay back what i took from the steward and as much more into the bargain and he told out eightandthirty pieces  thank god and all his saints cried brand weeping abundantly for joy for he had acquired by long devotion the donum lachrymarumthat lachrymose and somewhat hysterical temperament common among pious monks and held to be a mark of grace  blessed st peter thou art repaid and thou wilt be merciful  brand believed in common with all monks then that hereward had robbed not merely the abbey of peterborough but what was more st peter himself thereby converting into an implacable and internecine foe the chief of the apostles the rock on which was founded the whole church  now uncle said hereward do me one good deed in return promise me that if you can help it none of my poor housecarles shall suffer for my sins i led them into trouble i am punished i have made restitutionat least to st peter see that my father and mother if they be the christians they call themselves forgive and forget all offences except mine  i will so help me all saints and our lord o my boy my boy thou shouldst have been a kings thane and not an outlaw  and he hurried off with the news to the abbot  when hereward returned to his room martin was gone  farewell good men of peterborough said hereward as he leapt into the saddle next morning i had made a vow against you and came to try you to see whether you would force me to fulfil it or not but you have been so kind that i have half repented of it and the evil shall not come in the days of abbot leofric nor of brand the prior though it may come in the days of herluin the steward if he live long enough  what do you mean you incarnate fiend only fit to worship thor and odin asked brand  that i would burn goldenborough and herluin the steward within it ere i die i fear i shall do it i fear i must do it ten years ago come lammas herluin bade light the peatstack under me do you recollect  and so he did the hound quoth brand i had forgotten that  little hereward never forgets foe or friend ever since on lammas night hold still horsei dream of fire and flame and of goldenborough in the glare of it if it is written in the big book happen it must if not so much the better for goldenborough for it is a pretty place and honest englishmen in it only see that there be not too many frenchmen crept in when i come back beside our french friend herluin and see too that there be not a peatstack handy a word is enough to wise men like you good by  god help thee thou sinful boy said the abbot  hereward hereward come back cried brand  but the boy had spurred his horse through the gateway and was far down the road  leofric my friend said brand sadly this is my sin and no mans else and heavy penance will i do for it till that lad returns in peace  your sin  mine abbot i persuaded his mother to send him hither to be a monk alas alas how long will men try to be wiser than him who maketh men  i do not understand thee quoth the abbot and no more he did  it was four oclock on a may morning when hereward set out to see the world with good armor on his back good weapon by his side good horse between his knees and  good money in his purse what could a lad of eighteen want more who under the harsh family rule of those times had known nothing of a fathers and but too little of a mothers love he rode away northward through the bruneswald over the higher land of lincolnshire through primeval glades of mighty oak and ash holly and thorn swarming with game which was as highly preserved then as now under canutes severe forest laws the yellow roes stood and stared at him kneedeep in the young fern the pheasant called his hens out to feed in the dewy grass the blackbird and thrush sang out from every bough the woodlark trilled above the high oaktops and sank down on them as his song sank down and hereward rode on rejoicing in it all it was a fine world in the bruneswald what was it then outside not to him as to us a world circular sailed round circumscribed mapped botanized zoologized a tiny planet about which everybody knows or thinks they know everything but a world infinite magical supernaturalbecause unknown a vast flat plain reaching no one knew whence or where save that the mountains stood on the four corners thereof to keep it steady and the four winds of heaven blew out of them and in the centre which was to him the bruneswald such things as he saw but beyond things unspeakabledragons giants rocs orcs witchwhales griffins chimeras satyrs enchanters paynims saracen emirs and sultans kaisers of constantinople kaisers of ind and of cathay and beyond them again of lands as yet unknown at the very least he could go to brittany to the forest of brocheliaunde where so all men said fairies might be seen bathing in the fountains and possibly be won and wedded by a bold and dexterous knight after the fashion of sir gruelan footnote wace author of the roman de rou went to brittany a generation later to see those same fairies but had no sport and sang    fol i alai fol men revins     folie quis por fol me tins  what was there not to be seen and conquered where would he go where would he not go for the spirit of odin the goer the spirit which has sent his children round the world was strong within him he would go to ireland to the ostmen or irish danes men at dublin waterford or cork and marry some beautiful irish princess with gray eyes and raven locks and saffron smock and great gold bracelets from her native hills no he would go off to the orkneys and join bruce and ranald and the vikings of the northern seas and all the hot blood which had found even norway too hot to hold it and sail through witchwhales and icebergs to iceland and greenland and the sunny lands which they said lay even beyond across the all but unknown ocean he would go up the baltic to the jomsburg vikings and fight against lett and esthonian heathen and pierce inland perhaps through puleyn and the bison forests to the land from whence came the magic swords and the old persian coins which he had seen so often in the halls of his forefathers no he would go south to the land of sun and wine and see the magicians of cordova and seville and beard mussulman hounds worshipping their mahomets and perhaps bring home an emirs daughter    with more gay gold about her middle    than would buy half northumberlee  or he would go up the straits and on to constantinople and the great kaiser of the greeks and join the varanger guard and perhaps like harold hardraade in his own days after being cast to the lion for carrying off a fair greek lady tear out the monsters tongue with his own hands and show the easterns what a vikings son could do and as he dreamed of the infinite world and its infinite wonders the enchanters he might meet the jewels he might find the adventures be might essay he held that he must succeed in all with hope and wit and a strong arm and forgot altogether that mixed up with the cosmogony of an infinite flat plain called the earth there was joined also the belief in a flat roof above called heaven on which seen at times in visions through clouds and stars sat saints angels and archangels forevermore harping on their golden harps and knowing neither vanity nor vexation of spirit lust nor pride murder nor warand underneath a floor the name whereof was hell the mouths whereof as all men knew might be seen on hecla and aetna and stromboli and the fiends heard within tormenting amid fire and smoke and clanking chains the souls of the eternally lost  as he rode on slowly though cheerfully as a man who will not tire his horse at the beginning of a long days journey and knows not where he shall pass the night he was aware of a man on foot coming up behind him at a slow steady loping wolflike trot which in spite of its slowness gained ground on him so fast that he saw at once that the man could be no common runner  the man came up and behold he was none other than martin lightfoot  what art thou here asked hereward suspiciously and half cross at seeing any visitor from the old world which he had just cast off how gottest thou out of st peters last night  martins tongue was hanging out of his mouth like a running hounds but he seemed like a hound to perspire through his mouth for he answered without the least sign of distress without even pulling in his tongue  over the wall the moment the priors back was turned i was not going to wait till i was chained up in some ratshole with a halfhundred of iron on my leg and flogged till i confessed that i was what i am nota runaway monk  and why art here  because i am going with you  going with me said hereward what can i do for thee  i can do for you said martin  what  groom your horse wash your shirt clean your weapons find your inn fight your enemies cheat your friendsanything and everything you are going to see the world i am going with you  thou canst be my servant a right slippery one i expect said hereward looking down on him with some suspicion  some are not the rogues they seem i can keep my secrets and yours too  before i can trust thee with my secrets i shall expect to know some of thine said hereward  martin lightfoot looked up with a cunning smile a servant can always know his masters secrets if he likes but that is no reason a master should know his servants  thou shalt tell me thine man or i shall ride off and leave thee  not so easy my lord where that heavy horse can go martin lightfoot can follow but i will tell you one secret which i never told to living man i can read and write like any clerk  thou read and write  ay good latin enough and irish too what is more and now because i love you and because you i will serve willy nilly i will tell you all the secrets i have as long as my breath lasts for my tongue is rather stiff after that long story about the bellwether i was born in ireland in waterford town my mother was an english slave one of those that earl godwins wifenot this one that is now gyda but the old one king canutes sisterused to sell out of england by the score tied together with ropes boys and girls from bristol town her master my father that was i shall know him again got tired of her and wanted to give her away to one of his kernes she would not have that so he hung her up hand and foot and beat her that she died there was an abbey hard by and the church laid on him a penanceall that they dared get out of himthat he should give me to the monks being then a sevenyears boy well i grew up in that abbey they taught me my fa fa mi fa but i liked better conning of ballads and hearing stories of ghosts and enchanters such as i used to tell you ill tell you plenty more whenever youre tired then they made me work and that i never could abide at all then they beat me every day and that i could abide still less but always i stuck to my book for one thing i sawthat learning is power my lord and that the reason why the monks are masters of the land is they are scholars and you fighting men are none then i fell in love as young blood will with an irish lass when i was full seventeen years old and when they found out that they held me down on the floor and beat me till i was wellnigh dead they put me in prison for a month and between breadandwater and darkness i went nigh foolish they let me out thinking i could do no more harm to man or lass and when i found out how profitable folly was foolish i remained at least as foolish as seemed good to me but one night i got into the abbey church stole therefrom that which i have with me now and which shall serve you and me in good stead yetout and away aboard a ship among the buscarles and off into the norway sea but after a voyage or two so it befell i was wrecked in the wash by botulfston deeps and begging my way inland met with your father and took service with him as i have taken service now with you  now what has made thee take service with me  because you are you  give me none of your parables and dark sayings but speak out like a man what canst see in me that thou shouldest share an outlaws fortune with me  i had run away from a monastery so had you i hated the monks so did you i liked to tell storiessince i found good to shut my mouth i tell them to myself all day long sometimes all night too when i found out you liked to hear them i loved you all the more then they told me not to speak to you i held my tongue i bided my time i knew you would be outlawed some day i knew you would turn viking and kemperyman and kill giants and enchanters and win yourself honor and glory and i knew i should have my share in it i knew you would need me some day and you need me now and here i am and if you try to cut me down with your sword i will dodge you and follow you and dodge you again till i force you to let me be your man for with you i will live and die and now i can talk no more  and with me thou shalt live and die said hereward pulling up his horse and frankly holding out his hand to his new friend  martin lightfoot took his hand kissed it licked it almost as a dog would have done i am your man he said amen and true man i will prove to you if you will prove true to me and he dropped quietly back behind herewards horse as if the business of his life was settled and his mind utterly at rest  there is one more likeness between us said hereward after a few minutes thought if i have robbed a church thou hast robbed one too what is this precious spoil which is to serve me and thee in such mighty stead  martin drew from inside his shirt and under his waistband a small battleaxe and handed it up to hereward it was a tool the like of which in shape hereward had seldom seen and never its equal in beauty the handle was some fifteen inches long made of thick strips of black whalebone curiously bound with silver and butted with narwhal ivory this handle was evidently the work of some cunning norseman of old but who was the maker of the blade it was some eight inches long with a sharp edge on one side a sharp crooked pick on the other of the finest steel inlaid with strange characters in gold the work probably of some circassian tartar or persian such a battleaxe as rustum or zohrab may have wielded in fight upon the banks of oxus one of those magic weapons brought men knew not how out of the magic east which were hereditary in many a norse family and sung of in many a norse saga  look at it said martin lightfoot there is magic on it it must bring us luck whoever holds that must kill his man it will pick a lock of steel it will crack a mail corslet as a nuthatch cracks a nut it will hew a lance in two at a single blow devils and spirits forged iti know that virgilius the enchanter perhaps or solomon the great or whosoevers name is on it graven there in letters of gold handle it feel its balance but nodo not handle it too much there is a devil in it who would make you kill me whenever i play with it i long to kill a man it would be so easyso easy give it me back my lord give it me back lest the devil come through the handle into your palm and possess you  hereward laughed and gave him back his battleaxe but he had hardly less doubt of the magic virtues of such a blade than had martin himself  magical or not thou wilt not have to hit a man twice with that martin my lad so we two outlaws are both well armed and having neither wife nor child land nor beeves to lose ought to be a match for any six honest men who may have a grudge against us and sound reasons at home for running away  and so those two went northward through the green bruneswald and northward again through merry sherwood and were not seen in that land again for many a year     chapter ii  how hereward slew the bear   of herewards doings for the next few months naught is known he may very likely have joined siward in the scotch war he may have looked wondering for the first time in his life upon the bones of the old world where they rise at dunkeld out of the lowlands of the tay and have trembled lest the black crags of birnam should topple on his head with all their pines he may have marched down from that famous leaguer with the gospatricks and dolfins and the rest of the kindred of crinan abthane or abbotlet antiquaries decideof dunkeld and of duncan and of siward and of the outraged sibilla he may have helped himself to bring birnam wood to dunsinane on the day of the seven sleepers and heard siward when his son asbiorns corpse was carried into camp footnote shakespeare makes young siward his son he too was slain in the battle but he was siwards nephew ask only has he all his wounds in front he may have seen old siward after macbeths defeat not death as shakespeare relates the story go back to northumbria with such booty as no man had obtained beforea proof if the fact be fact that the scotch lowlands were not in the eleventh century the poor and barbarous country which some have reported them to have been  all this is not only possible but probable enough the dates considered the chroniclers however are silent they only say that hereward was in those days beyond northumberland with gisebert of ghent  gisebert gislebert gilbert guibert goisbricht of ghent who afterwards owned by chance of war many a fair manor about lincoln city was one of those valiant flemings who settled along the east and northeast coast of scotland in the eleventh century they fought with the celtic princes and then married with their daughters got to themselves lands by the titledeed of the sword and so becamethe famous freskin the fleming especiallythe ancestors of the finest aristocracy both physically and intellectually in the world they had their connections moreover with the norman court of rouen through the duchess matilda daughter of their old seigneur baldwin marquis of flanders their connections too with the english court through countess judith wife of earl tosti godwinsson another daughter of baldwins their friendship was sought their enmity feared far and wide throughout the north they seem to have been civilizers and cultivators and traderswith the instinct of true flemingsas well as conquerors they were in those very days bringing to order and tillage the rich lands of the northeast from the frith of moray to that of forth and forming a rampart for scotland against the invasions of sweyn hardraade and all the wild vikings of the northern seas  amongst them in those days gilbert of ghent seems to have been a notable personage to judge from the great house which he kept and the milites tyrones or squires in training for the honor of knighthood who fed at his table where he lived the chroniclers report not to them the country ultra northumbriam beyond the forth was as russia or cathay where    geographers on pathless downs    put elephants for want of towns  as indeed it was to that french mapmaker who as late as the middle of the eighteenth century not having been to aberdeen or elgin leaves all the country north of the tay a blank with the inscription terre inculte et sauvage habitée par les higlanders  wherever gilbert lived however he heard that hereward was outlawed and sent for him says the story and there he lived doubtless happily enough fighting highlanders and hunting deer so that as yet the pains and penalties of exile did not press very hardly upon him the handsome petulant goodhumored lad had become in a few weeks the darling of gilberts ladies and the envy of all his knights and gentlemen hereward the singer harpplayer dancer hereward the rider and hunter was in all mouths but he himself was discontented at having as yet fallen in with no adventure worthy of a man and looked curiously and longingly at the menagerie of wild beasts enclosed in strong wooden cages which gilbert kept in one corner of the great courtyard not for any scientific purposes but to try with them at christmas easter and whitsuntide the mettle of the young gentlemen who were candidates for the honor of knighthood but after looking over the bulls and stags wolves and bears hereward settled it in his mind that there was none worthy of his steel save one huge white bear whom no man had yet dared to face and whom hereward indeed had never seen hidden as he was all day within the old ovenshaped picts house of stone which had been turned into his den there was a mystery about the uncanny brute which charmed hereward he was said to be halfhuman perhaps wholly human to be the son of the fairy bear near kinsman if not uncle or cousin of siward digre he had like his fairy father iron claws he had human intellect and understood human speech and the arts of warat least so all in the place believed and not as absurdly as at first sight seems  for the brown bear and much more the white was among the northern nations in himself a creature magical and superhuman he is gods dog whispered the lapp and called him the old man in the fur cloak afraid to use his right name even inside the tent for fear of his overhearing and avenging the insult he has twelve mens strength and eleven mens wit sang the norseman and prided himself accordingly like a true norseman on outwitting and slaying the enchanted monster  terrible was the brown bear but more terrible the white seadeer as the saxons called him the hound of hrymir the whales bane the seals dread the rider of the iceberg the sailor of the floe who ranged for his prey under the six months night lighted by surturs fires even to the gates of muspelheim to slay him was a feat worthy of beowulfs self and the greatest wonder perhaps among all the wealth of crowland was the twelve white bearskins which lay before the altars the gift of the great canute how gilbert had obtained his white bear and why he kept him there in durance vile was a mystery over which men shook their heads again and again hereward asked his host to let him try his strength against the monster of the north again and again the shrieks of the ladies and gilberts own pity for the stripling youth brought a refusal but hereward settled it in his heart nevertheless that somehow or other when christmas time came round he would extract from gilbert drunk or sober leave to fight that bear and then either make himself a name or die like a man  meanwhile hereward made a friend among all the ladies of gilberts household however kind they were inclined to be to him he took a fancy but to oneand that was to a little girl of eight years old alftruda was her name he liked to amuse himself with this child without as he fancied any danger of falling in love for already his dreams of love were of the highest and most fantastic and an emirs daughter or a princess of constantinople were the very lowest game at which he meant to fly alftruda was beautiful too exceedingly and precocious and it may be vain enough to repay his attentions in good earnest moreover she was english as he was and royal likewise a relation of elfgiva daughter of ethelred once king of england who as all know married uchtred prince of northumberland and grandfather of gospatrick earl of northumberland and ancestor of all the dunbars between the english lad then and the english maiden grew up in a few weeks an innocent friendship which had almost become more than friendship through the intervention of the fairy bear  for as hereward was coming in one afternoon from hunting hawk on fist with martin lightfoot trotting behind crane and heron duck and hare slung over his shoulder on reaching the courtyard gates he was aware of screams and shouts within tumult and terror among man and beast hereward tried to force his horse in at the gate the beast stopped and turned snorting with fear and no wonder for in the midst of the courtyard stood the fairy bear his white mane bristled up till he seemed twice as big as any of the sober brown bears which hereward yet had seen his long snake neck and cruel visage wreathed about in search of prey a dead horse its back broken by a single blow of the paw and two or three writhing dogs showed that the beast had turned like too many of his human kindred berserker the courtyard was utterly empty but from the ladies bower came shrieks and shouts not only of women but of men and knocking at the bower door adding her screams to those inside was a little white figure which hereward recognized as alftrudas they had barricaded themselves inside leaving the child out and now dared not open the door as the bear swung and rolled towards it looking savagely right and left for a fresh victim  hereward leaped from his horse and drawing his sword rushed forward with a shout which made the bear turn round  he looked once back at the child then round again at hereward and making up his mind to take the largest morsel first made straight at him with a growl which there was no mistaking  he was within two paces then he rose on his hind legs a head and shoulders taller than hereward and lifted the iron talons high in air hereward knew that there was but one spot at which to strike and he struck true and strong before the iron paw could fall right on the muzzle of the monster  he heard the dull crash of the steel he felt the sword jammed tight he shut his eyes for an instant fearing lest as in dreams his blow had come to naught lest his sword had turned aside or melted like water in his hand and the next moment would find him crushed to earth blinded and stunned something tugged at his sword he opened his eyes and saw the huge carcass bend reel roll slowly over to one side dead tearing out of his hand the sword which was firmly fixed into the skull  hereward stood awhile staring at the beast like a man astonished at what he himself had done he had had his first adventure and he had conquered he was now a champion in his own righta hero of the heroesone who might take rank if he went on beside beowulf frotho ragnar lodbrog or harald hardraade he had done this deed what was there after this which he might not do and he stood there in the fulness of his pride defiant of earth and heaven while in his heart arose the thought of that old viking who cried in the pride of his godlessness i never on earth met him whom i feared and why should i fear him in heaven if i met odin i would fight with odin if odin were the stronger he would slay me if i were the stronger i would slay him and there he stood staring and dreaming over renown to comea true pattern of the halfsavage hero of those rough times capable of all vices except cowardice and capable too of all virtues save humility  do you not see said martin lightfoots voice close by that there is a fair lady trying to thank you while you are so rude or so proud that you will not vouchsafe her one look  it was true little alftruda had been clinging to him for five minutes past he took the child up in his arms and kissed her with pure kisses which for a moment softened his hard heart then setting her down he turned to martin  i have done it martin  yes you have done it i spied you what will the old folks at home say to this  what care i  martin lightfoot shook his head and drew out his knife  what is that for said hereward  when the master kills the game the knave can but skin it we may sleep warm under this fur in many a cold night by sea and moor  nay said hereward laughing when the master kills the game he must first carry it home let us take him and set him up against the bower door there to astonish the brave knights inside and stooping down he attempted to lift the huge carcass but in vain at last with martins help he got it fairly on his shoulders and the two dragged their burden to the bower and dashed it against the door shouting with all their might to those within to open it  windows it must be remembered were in those days so few and far between that the folks inside had remained quite unaware of what was going on without  the door was opened cautiously enough and out looked to the shame of knighthood be it said two or three knights who had taken shelter in the bower with the ladies whatever they were going to say the ladies forestalled for rushing out across the prostrate bear they overwhelmed hereward with praises thanks and after the straightforward custom of those days with substantial kisses  you must be knighted at once cried they you have knighted yourself by that single blow  a pity then said one of the knights to the others that he had not given that accolade to himself instead of to the bear  unless some means are found said another of taking down this boys conceit life will soon be not worth having here  either he must take ship said a third and look for adventures elsewhere or i must  martin lightfoot heard those words and knowing that envy and hatred like all other vices in those roughhewn times were apt to take very startling and unmistakeable shapes kept his eye accordingly on those three knights  he must be knightedhe shall be knighted as soon as sir gilbert comes home said all the ladies in chorus  i should be sorry to think said hereward with the blundering mock humility of a selfconceited boy that i had done anything worthy of such an honor i hope to win my spurs by greater feats than these  a burst of laughter from the knights and gentlemen followed  how loud the young bantam crows after his first little scuffle  hark to him what will he do next eat a dragon fly to the moon marry the sophy of egypts daughter  this last touched hereward to the quick for it was just what he thought of doing and his blood heated enough already beat quicker as some one cried with the evident intent of picking a quarrel  that was meant for us if the man who killed the bear has not earned knighthood what must we be who have not killed him you understand his meaning gentlemendont forget it  hereward looked down and setting his foot on the bears head wrenched out of it the sword which he had left till now with pardonable pride fast set in the skull  martin lightfoot for his part drew stealthily from his bosom the little magic axe keeping his eye on the brainpan of the last speaker  the lady of the house cried shame and ordered the knights away with haughty words and gestures which because they were so well deserved only made the quarrel more deadly  then she commanded hereward to sheathe his sword  he did so and turning to the knights said with all courtesy you mistake me sirs you were where brave knights should be within the beleaguered fortress defending the ladies had you remained outside and been eaten by the bear what must have befallen them had he burst open the door as for this little lass whom you left outside she is too young to requite knights prowess by ladys love and therefore beneath your attention and only fit for the care of a boy like me and taking up alftruda in his arms he carried her in and disappeared  who now but hereward was in all mens mouths the minstrels made ballads on him the lasses sang his praises says the chronicler as they danced upon the green gilberts lady would need give him the seat and all the honors of a belted knight though knight he was none and daily and weekly the valiant lad grew and hardened into a valiant man and a courteous one withal giving no offence himself and not overready to take offence at other men  the knights were civil enough to him the ladies more than civil he hunted he wrestled he tilted he was promised a chance of fighting for glory as soon as a highland chief should declare war against gilbert or drive off his cattlean event which and small blame to the highland chiefs happened every six months  no one was so well content with himself as hereward and therefore he fancied that the world must be equally content with him and he was much disconcerted when martin drew him aside one day and whispered if i were my lord i should wear a mail shirt under my coat tomorrow out hunting  what  the arrow that can go through a deers bladebone can go through a mans  who should harm me  any man of the dozen who eat at the same table  what have i done to them if i had my laugh at them they had their laugh at me and we are quits  there is another score my lord which you have forgotten and that is all on your side  eh  you killed the bear do you expect them to forgive you that till they have repaid you with interest  pish  you do not want for wit my lord use it and think what right has a little boy like you to come here killing bears which grown men cannot kill what can you expect but just punishment for your insolencesay a lance between your shoulders while you stoop to drink as sigfried had for daring to tame brunhild and more what right have you to come here and so win the hearts of the ladies that the lady of all the ladies should say if aught happen to my poor boyand he cannot live longi would adopt hereward for my own son and show his mother what a fool some folks think her so my lord put on your mail shirt tomorrow and take care of narrow ways and sharp corners for tomorrow it will be tried that i know before my lord gilbert comes back from the highlands but by whom i know not and care little seeing that there are half a dozen in the house who would be glad enough of the chance  hereward took his advice and rode out with three or four knights the next morning into the firforest not afraid but angry and sad he was not yet old enough to estimate the virulence of envy to take ingratitude and treachery for granted he was to learn the lesson then as a wholesome chastener to the pride of success he was to learn it again in later years as an additional bitterness in the humiliation of defeat and find out as does many a man that if he once fall or seem to fall a hundred curs spring up to bark at him who dared not open their mouths while he was on his legs  so they rode into the forest and parted each with his footman and his dogs in search of boar and deer and each had his sport without meeting again for some two hours or more  hereward and martin came at last to a narrow gully a murderous place enough huge firtrees roofed it in and made a night of noon high banks of earth and great boulders walled it in right and left for twenty feet above the track what with packhorses feet and what with the wear and tear of five hundred years rainfall was a rut three feet deep and two feet broad in which no horse could turn any other day hereward would have cantered down it with merely a tightened rein today he turned to martin and said  a very fit and proper place for this same treason unless you have been drinking beer and thinking beer  but martin was nowhere to be seen  a pebble thrown from the right bank struck him and he looked up martins face was peering through the heather overhead his finger on his lips then he pointed cautiously first up the pass then down  hereward felt that his sword was loose in the sheath and then gripped his lance with a heart beating but not with fear  the next moment he heard the rattle of a horses hoofs behind him looked back and saw a knight charging desperately down the gully his bow in hand and arrow drawn to the head  to turn was impossible to stop even to walk on was to be ridden over and hurled to the ground helplessly to gain the mouth of the gully and then turn on his pursuer was his only chance for the first and almost the last time in his life he struck spurs into his horse and ran away as he went an arrow struck him sharply in the back piercing the corslet but hardly entering the flesh as he neared the mouth two other knights crashed their horses through the brushwood from right and left and stood awaiting him their spears ready to strike he was caught in a trap a shield might have saved him but he had none  he did not flinch dropping his reins and driving in the spurs once more he met them in full shock with his left hand he hurled aside the lefthand lance with his right he hurled his own with all his force at the righthand foe and saw it pass clean through the felons chest while his lancepoint dropped and passed harmlessly behind his knee  so much for lances in front but the knight behind would not his sword the next moment be through his brain  there was a clatter a crash and looking back hereward saw horse and man rolling in the rut and rolling with them martin lightfoot he had already pinned the felon knights head against the steep bank and with uplifted axe was meditating a pick at his face which would have stopped alike his lovemaking and his fighting  hold thy hand shouted hereward let us see who he is and remember that he is at least a knight  but one that will ride no more today i finished his horses going as i rolled down the bank  it was true he had broken the poor beasts leg with a blow of the axe and they had to kill the horse out of pity ere they left  martin dragged his prisoner forward  you cried hereward and i saved your life three days ago  the knight answered nothing  you will have to walk home let that be punishment enough for you and he turned  he will have to ride in a woodmans cart if he have the luck to find one  the third knight had fled and after him the dead mans horse hereward and his man rode home in peace and the third knight after trying vainly to walk a mile or two fell and lay and was fain to fulfil martins prophecy and be brought home in a cart to carry for years after like sir lancelot the nickname of the chevalier de la charette  and so was hereward avenged of his enemies  judicial even private inquiry into the matter there was none that gentlemen should meet in the forest and commit or try to commit murder on each others bodies was far too common a mishap in the ages of faith to stir up more than an extra gossiping and cackling among the women and an extra cursing and threatening among the men and as the former were all but unanimously on herewards side his plain and honest story was taken as it stood  and now fair lady said hereward to his hostess i must thank you for all your hospitality and bid you farewell forever and a day  she wept and entreated him only to stay till her lord came back but hereward was firm  you lady and your good lord will i ever love and at your service my sword shall ever be but not here ill blood i will not make among traitors i will not dwell i have killed two of them and shall have to kill two of their kinsmen next and then two more till you have no knights left and pity that would be no the world is wide and there are plenty of good fellows in it who will welcome me without forcing me to wear mail under my coat out hunting  and he armed himself capàpié and rode away great was the weeping in the bower and great the chuckling in the hall but never saw they hereward again upon the scottish shore     chapter iii  how hereward succored a princess of cornwall   the next place in which hereward appeared was far away on the southwest upon the cornish shore how he came there or after how long the chronicles do not say all that shall be told is that he went into port on board a merchant ship carrying wine and intending to bring back tin the merchants had told him of one alef a valiant regulus or kinglet of those parts  who was indeed a distant connection of hereward himself having married as did so many of the celtic princes the daughter of a danish searover of siwards blood they told him also that the kinglet increased his wealth not only by the sale of tin and of red cattle but by a certain amount of autumnal piracy in company with his danish brothersinlaw from dublin and waterford and hereward who believed with most englishmen of the east country that cornwall still produced a fair crop of giants some of them with two and even three heads had hopes that alef might show him some adventure worthy of his sword he sailed in therefore over a rolling bar between jagged points of black rock and up a tide river which wandered  away inland like a landlocked lake between high green walls of oak and ash till they saw at the head of the tide alefs town nestling in a glen which sloped towards the southern sun they discovered besides two ships drawn up upon the beach whose long lines and snakeheads beside the stoat carved on the beakhead of one and the adder on that of the other bore witness to the piratical habits of their owner the merchants it seemed were well known to the cornishmen on shore and hereward went up with them unopposed past the ugly dikes and muddy leats where alefs slaves were streaming the gravel for tin ore through rich alluvial pastures spotted with red cattle and up to alefs town earthworks and stockades surrounded a little church of ancient stone and a cluster of granite cabins thatched with turf in which the slaves abode and in the centre of all a vast stone barn with low walls and high sloping roof which contained alefs family treasures fighting tail horses cattle and pigs they entered at one end between the pigsties passed on through the cowstalls then through the stables and saw before them dim through the reek of thick peatsmoke a long oaken table at which sat huge darkhaired cornishmen with here and there among them the yellow head of a norseman who were alefs following or fighting men boiled meat was there in plenty barley cakes and ale at the head of the table on a highbacked settle was alef himself a jolly giant who was just setting to work to drink himself stupid with mead made from narcotic heather honey by his side sat a lovely darkhaired girl with great gold torcs upon her throat and wrists and a great gold brooch fastening a shawl which had plainly come from the looms of spain or of the east and next to her again feeding her with titbits cut off with his own dagger and laid on barley cake instead of a plate sat a more gigantic personage even than alef the biggest man that hereward had ever seen with high cheek bones and small ferret eyes looking out from a greasy mass of bright red hair and beard  no questions were asked of the newcomers they set themselves down in silence in empty places and according to the laws of the good old cornish hospitality were allowed to eat and drink their fill before they spoke a word  welcome here again friend said alef at last in good enough danish calling the eldest merchant by name do you bring wine  the merchant nodded  and you want tin  the merchant nodded again and lifting his cup drank alefs health following it up by a coarse joke in cornish which raised a laugh all round  the norse trader of those days it must be remembered was none of the cringing and effeminate chapmen who figure in the stories of the middle ages a free norse or dane himself often of noble blood he fought as willingly as he bought and held his own as an equal whether at the court of a cornish kinglet or at that of the great kaiser of the greeks  and you fair sir said alef looking keenly at hereward by what name shall i call you and what service can i do for you you look more like an earls son than a merchant and are come here surely for other things besides tin  health to king alef said hereward raising the cup who i am i will tell to none but alefs self but an earls son i am though an outlaw and a rover my lands are the breadth of my bootsole my plough is my sword my treasure is my good right hand nothing i have and nothing i need save to serve noble kings and earls and win me a champions fame if you have battles to fight tell me that i may fight them for you if you have none thank god for his peace and let me eat and drink and go in peace  king alef needs neither man nor boy to fight his battle as long as ironhook sits in his hall  it was the redbearded giant who spoke in a broken tongue part scotch part cornish part danish which hereward could hardly understand but that the ogre intended to insult him he understood well enough  hereward had hoped to find giants in cornwall and behold he had found one at once though rather to judge from his looks a pictish than a cornish giant and true to his reckless determination to defy and fight every man and beast who was willing to defy and fight him he turned on his elbow and stared at ironhook in scorn meditating some speech which might provoke the hopedfor quarrel  as he did so his eye happily caught that of the fair princess she was watching him with a strange look admiring warning imploring and when she saw that he noticed her she laid her finger on her lip in token of silence crossed herself devoutly and then laid her finger on her lips again as if beseeching him to be patient and silent in the name of him who answered not again  hereward as is well seen wanted not for quick wit or for chivalrous feeling he had observed the rough devotion of the giant to the lady he had observed too that she shrank from it that she turned away with loathing when he offered her his own cup while he answered by a dark and deadly scowl  was there an adventure here was she in duress either from this ironhook or from her father or from both did she need herewards help if so she was so lovely that he could not refuse it and on the chance he swallowed down his high stomach and answered blandly enough  one could see without eyes noble sir that you were worth any ten common men but as every one has not like you the luck of so lovely a lady by your side i thought that perchance you might hand over some of your lesser quarrels to one like me who has not yet seen so much good fighting as yourself and enjoy yourself in pleasant company at home as i should surely do in your place  the princess shuddered and turned pale then looked at hereward and smiled her thanks ironhook laughed a savage laugh  herewards jest being translated into cornish for the benefit of the company was highly approved by all and good humor being restored every man got drunk save hereward who found the mead too sweet and sickening  after which those who could go to bed went to bed not as in england footnote cornwall was not then considered part of england among the rushes on the floor but in the bunks or berths of wattle which stood two or three tiers high along the wall  the next morning as hereward went out to wash his face and hands in the brook below he being the only man in the house who did so martin lightfoot followed him  what is it martin hast thou had too much of that sweet mead last night that thou must come out to cool thy head too  i came out for two reasonsfirst to see fair play in case that ironhook should come to wash his ugly visage and find you on all fours over the brookyou understand and next to tell you what i heard last night among the maids  and what did you hear  fine adventures if we can but compass them you saw that lady with the carrotheaded fellowi saw that you saw well if you will believe me that man has no more gentle blood than i havehas no more right to sit on the settle than i he is a nomans son a pict from galloway who came down with a pirate crew and has made himself the master of this drunken old prince and the darling of all his housecarles and now will needs be his soninlaw whether he will or not  i thought as much said hereward but how didst thou find out this  i went out and sat with the knaves and the maids and listened to their harpplaying and harp they can these cornish like very elves and then i too sang songs and told them stories for i can talk their tongue somewhat till they all blest me for a right good fellow and then i fell to praising up old ironhook to the women  praising him up man  ay just because i suspected him for the women are so contrary that if you speak evil of a man they will surely speak good of him but if you will only speak good of him then you will hear all the evil of him he ever has done and more beside and this i heard that the kings daughter cannot abide him and would as lief marry a seal  one did not need to be told that said hereward as long as one has eyes in ones head i will kill the fellow and carry her off ere fourandtwenty hours be past  softly softly my young master you need to be told something that your eyes would not tell you and that is that the poor lass is betrothed already to a son of old king ranald the ostman of waterford son of old king sigtryg who ruled there when i was a boy  he is a kinsman of mine then said hereward all the more reason that i should kill this ruffian  if you can said martin lightfoot  if i can retorted hereward fiercely  well well wilful heart must have its way only take my counsel speak to the poor young lady first and see what she will tell you lest you only make bad worse and bring down her father and his men on her as well as you  hereward agreed and resolved to watch his opportunity of speaking to the princess  as they went in to the morning meal they met alef he was in high good humor with hereward and all the more so when hereward told him his name and how he was the son of leofric  i will warrant you are he said by the gray head you carry on green shoulders no discreeter man they say in these isles than the old earl  you speak truth sir said hereward though he be no father of mine now for of leofric it is said in king edwards court that if a man ask counsel of him it is as though he had asked it of the oracles of god  then you are his true son young man i saw how you kept the peace with ironhook and i owe you thanks for it for though he is my good friend and will be my soninlaw erelong yet a quarrel with him is more than i can abide just now and i should not like to have seen my guest and my kinsman slain in my house  hereward would have said that he thought there was no fear of that but he prudently held his tongue and having an end to gain listened instead of talking  twenty years ago of course i could have thrashed him as easily as but now i am getting old and shaky and the man has been a great help in need six kings of these parts has he killed for me who drove off my cattle and stopped my tin works and plundered my monks cells too which is worse while i was away sailing the seas and he is a right good fellow at heart though he be a little rough so be friends with him as long as you stay here and if i can do you a service i will  they went in to their morning meal at which hereward resolved to keep the peace which he longed to break and therefore as was to be expected broke  for during the meal the fair lady with no worse intention perhaps than that of teasing her tyrant fell to open praises of herewards fair face and golden hair and being insulted therefore by the ironhook retaliated by observations about his personal appearance which were more common in the eleventh century than they happily are now he to comfort himself drank deep of the french wine which had just been brought and broached and then went out into the courtyard where in the midst of his admiring fellowruffians he enacted a scene as ludicrous as it was pitiable all the childish vanity of the savage boiled over he strutted he shouted he tossed about his huge limbs he called for a harper and challenged all around to dance sing leap fight do anything against him meeting with nothing but admiring silence he danced himself out of breath and then began boasting once more of his fights his cruelties his butcheries his impossible escapes and victories till at last as luck would have it he espied hereward and poured out a stream of abuse against englishmen and english courage  englishmen he said were naught had he not slain three of them himself with one blow  of your mouth i suppose quoth hereward who saw that the quarrel must come and was glad to have it done and over  of my mouth roared ironhook of my sword man  of your mouth said hereward of your brain were they begotten of the breath of your mouth they were born and by the breath of your mouth you can slay them again as often as you choose  the joke as it has been handed down to us by the old chroniclers seems clumsy enough but it sent the princess say they into shrieks of laughter  were it not that my lord alef was here shouted ironhook i would kill you out of hand  promise to fight fair and do your worst the more fairly you fight the more honor you will win said hereward  whereupon the two were parted for the while  two hours afterwards hereward completely armed with helmet and mail shirt sword and javelin hurried across the great courtyard with martin lightfoot at his heels towards the little church upon the knoll above the two wild men entered into the cool darkness and saw before them by the light of a tiny lamp the crucifix over the altar and beneath it that which was then believed to be the body of him who made heaven and earth they stopped trembling for a moment bowed themselves before that to them perpetual miracle and then hurried on to a low doorway to the right inside which dwelt alefs chaplain one of those good celtic priests who were supposed to represent a christianity more ancient than and all but independent of the then allabsorbing church of rome  the cell was such a one as a convict would now disdain to inhabit a low leanto roof the slates and rafters unceiled the stone walls and floor unplastered illlighted by a handbroad window unglazed and closed with a shutter at night a truss of straw and a rug the priests bed lay in a corner the only other furniture was a large oak chest containing the holy vessels and vestments and a few old books it stood directly under the window for the sake of light for it served the good priest for both table and chair and on it he was sitting reading in his book at that minute the sunshine and the wind streaming in behind his head doing no good to his rheumatism of thirty years standing  is there a priest here asked hereward hurriedly  the old man looked up shook his head and answered in cornish  speak to him in latin martin may be he will understand that  martin spoke my lord here wants a priest to shrive him and that quickly he is going to fight the great tyrant ironhook as you call him  ironhook answered the priest in good latin enough and he so young god help him he is a dead man what is thisa fresh soul sent to its account by the hands of that man of belial cannot he entreat himcan he not make peace and save his young life he is but a stripling and that man like goliath of old a man of war from his youth up  and my master said martin lightfoot proudly is like young davidone that can face a giant and kill him for he has slain like david his lion and his bear ere now at least he is one that will neither make peace nor entreat the face of living man so shrive him quickly master priest and let him be gone to his work  poor martin lightfoot spoke thus bravely only to keep up his spirits and his young lords for in spite of his confidence in herewards prowess he had given him up for a lost man and the tears ran down his rugged cheeks as the old priest rising up and seizing herewards two hands in his besought him with the passionate and graceful eloquence of his race to have mercy upon his own youth  hereward understood his meaning though not his words  tell him he said to martin that fight i must and tell him that shrive me he must and that quickly tell him how the fellow met me in the wood below just now and would have slain me there unarmed as i was and how when i told him it was a shame to strike a naked man he told me he would give me but one hours grace to go back on the faith of a gentleman for my armor and weapons and meet him there again to die by his hand so shrive me quick sir priest  hereward knelt down martin lightfoot knelt down by him and with a trembling voice began to interpret for him  what does he say asked hereward as the priest murmured something to himself  he said quoth martin now fairly blubbering that fair and young as you are your shrift should be as short and as clean as davids  hereward was touched anything but that said he smiting on his breast mea culpamea culpamea maxima culpa  tell him how i robbed my father  the priest groaned as martin did so  and how i mocked at my mother and left her in a rage without ever a kind word between us and how i have slain i know not how many men in battle though that i trust need not lay heavily on my soul seeing that i killed them all in fair fight  again the priest groaned  and how i robbed a certain priest of his money and gave it away to my housecarles  here the priest groaned more bitterly still  o my son my son where hast thou found time to lay all these burdens on thy young soul  it will take less time said martin bluntly for you to take the burdens off again  but i dare not absolve him for robbing a priest heaven help him he must go to the bishop for that he is more fit to go on pilgrimage to jerusalem than to battle  he has no time quoth martin for bishops or jerusalem  tell him says hereward that in this purse is all i have that in it he will find sixty silver pennies beside two strange coins of gold  sir priest said martin lightfoot taking the purse from hereward and keeping it in his own hand there are in this bag moneys  martin had no mind to let the priest into the secret of the state of their finances  and tell him continued hereward that if i fall in this battle i give him all that money that he may part it among the poor for the good of my soul  pish said martin to his lord that is paying him for having you killed you should pay him for keeping you alive and without waiting for the answer he spoke in latin  and if he comes back safe from this battle he will give you ten pennies for yourself and your church priest and therefore expects you to pray your very loudest while he is gone  i will pray i will pray said the holy man i will wrestle in prayer ah that he could slay the wicked and reward the proud according to his deservings ah that he could rid me and my master and my young lady of this son of belialthis devourer of widows and orphansthis slayer of the poor and needy who fills this place with innocent bloodhim of whom it is written they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven and their tongue goeth through the world therefore fall the people unto them and thereout suck they no small advantage i will shrive him shrive him of all save robbing the priest and for that he must go to the bishop if he live and if not the lord have mercy on his soul  and so weeping and trembling the good old man pronounced the words of absolution  hereward rose thanked him and then hurried out in silence  you will pray your very loudest priest said martin as he followed his young lord  i will i will quoth he and kneeling down began to chant that noble seventythird psalm quam bonus israel which he had just so fitly quoted  thou gavest him the bag martin said hereward as they hurried on  you are not dead yet no pay no play is as good a rule for priest as for layman  now then martin lightfoot goodbye come not with me it must never be said even slanderously that i brought two into the field against one and if i die martin  you wont die said lightfoot shutting his teeth  if i die go back to my people somehow and tell them that i died like a true earls son  hereward held out his hand martin fell on his knees and kissed it watched him with set teeth till he disappeared in the wood and then started forward and entered the bushes at a different spot  i must be nigh at hand to see fair play he muttered to himself in case any of his ruffians be hanging about fair play ill see and fair play ill give too for the sake of my lords honor though i be bitterly loath to do it so many times as i have been a villain when it was of no use why maynt i be one now when it would serve the purpose indeed why did we ever come into this accursed place but one thing i will do said he as he ensconced himself under a thick holly whence he could see the meeting of the combatants upon an open lawn some twenty yards away if that big bullcalf kills my master and i do not jump on his back and pick his brains out with this trusty steel of mine may my right arm  and martin lightfoot swore a fearful oath which need not here be written  the priest had just finished his chant of the seventythird psalm and had betaken himself in his spiritual warfare as it was then called to the equally apposite fiftysecond quid gloriaris  why boastest thou thyself thou tyrant that thou canst do mischief whereas the goodness of god endureth yet daily  father father cried a soft voice in the doorway where are you  and in hurried the princess  hide this she said breathless drawing from beneath her mantle a huge sword hide it where no one dare touch it under the altar behind the holy rood no place too secret  what is it asked the priest springing up from his knees  his swordthe ogreshis magic sword which kills whomsoever it strikes i coaxed the wretch to let me have it last night when he was tipsy for fear he should quarrel with the young stranger and i have kept it from him ever since by one excuse or another and now he has sent one of his ruffians in for it saying that if i do not give it up at once he will come back and kill me  he dare not do that said the priest  what is there that he dare not said she hide it at once i know that he wants it to fight with this hereward  if he wants it for that said the priest it is too late for half an hour is past since hereward went to meet him  and you let him go you did not persuade him stop him you let him go hence to his death  in vain the good man expostulated and explained that it was no fault of his  you must come with me this instant to my fatherto them they must be parted they shall be parted if you dare not i dare i will throw myself between them and he that strikes the other shall strike me  and she hurried the priest out of the house down the knoll and across the yard there they found others on the same errand the news that a battle was toward had soon spread and the menatarms were hurrying down to the fight kept back however by alef who strode along at their head  alef was sorely perplexed in mind he had taken as all honest men did a great liking to hereward moreover he was his kinsman and his guest save him he would if he could but how to save him without mortally offending his tyrant ironhook he could not see at least he would exert what little power he had and prevent if possible his menatarms from helping their darling leader against the hapless lad  alefs perplexity was much increased when his daughter bounded towards him seizing him by the arm and hurried him on showing by look and word which of the combatants she favored so plainly that the ruffians behind broke into scornful murmurs they burst through the bushes martin lightfoot happily heard them coming and had just time to slip away noiselessly like a rabbit to the other part of the cover  the combat seemed at the first glance to be one between a grown man and a child so unequal was the size of the combatants but the second look showed that the advantage was by no means with ironhook stumbling to and fro with the broken shaft of a javelin sticking in his thigh he vainly tried to seize and crush hereward in his enormous arms hereward bleeding but still active and upright broke away and sprang round him watching for an opportunity to strike a deadly blow the housecarles rushed forward with yells alef shouted to the combatants to desist but ere the party could reach them herewards opportunity had come ironhook after a fruitless lunge stumbled forward hereward leapt aside and spying an unguarded spot below the corslet drove his sword deep into the giants body and rolled him over upon the sward then arose shouts of fury  foul play cried one  and others taking up the cry called out sorcery and treason  hereward stood over ironhook as he lay writhing and foaming on the ground  killed by a boy at last groaned he if i had but had my own swordmy brainbiter which that witch stole from me but last nightand amid foul curses and bitter tears of shame his mortal spirit fled to its doom  the housecarles rushed in on hereward who had enough to do to keep them at arms length by long sweeps of his sword  alef entreated threatened promised a fair trial if the men would give fair play when to complete the confusion the princess threw herself upon the corpse shrieking and tearing her hair and to herewards surprise and disgust bewailed the prowess and the virtues of the dead calling upon all present to avenge his murder  hereward vowed inwardly that he would never again trust womans fancy or fight in womans quarrel he was now nigh at his wits end the housecarles had closed round him in a ring with the intention of seizing him and however well he might defend his front he might be crippled at any moment from behind but in the very nick of time martin lightfoot burst through the crowd set himself heel to heel with his master and broke out not with threats but with a goodhumored laugh  here is a pretty coil about a redheaded brute of a pict danes ostmen he cried are you not ashamed to call such a fellow your lord when you have such a true earls son as this to lead you if you will  the ostmen in the company looked at each other martin lightfoot saw that his appeal to the antipathies of race had told and followed it up by a string of witticisms upon the pictish nation in general of which the only two fit for modern ears to be set down were the two old stories that the picts had feet so large that they used to lie upon their backs and hold up their legs to shelter them from the sun and that when killed they could not fall down but died as they were all standing  so that the only foul play i can see is that my master shoved the fellow over after he had stabbed him instead of leaving him to stand upright there like one of your cornish dolmens till his flesh should fall off his bones  hereward saw the effect of martins words and burst out in danish likewise  look at me he said i am hereward the outlaw i am the champion i am the berserker i am the viking i am the land thief the sea thief the ravager of the world the bearslayer the ogrekiller the ravenfattener the darling of the wolf the curse of the widow touch me and i will give you to the raven and to the wolf as i have this ogre be my men and follow me over the swans road over the whales bath over the longsnakes leap to the land where the sea meets the sun and golden apples hang on every tree and we will freight our ships with moorish maidens and the gold of cadiz and algiers  hark to the viking hark to the right earls son shouted some of the danes whose blood had been stirred many a time before by such wild words and on whom herewards youth and beauty had their due effect and now the counsels of the ruffians being divided the old priest gained courage to step in let them deliver hereward and his serving man into his custody he would bring them forth on the morrow and there should be full investigation and fair trial and so hereward and martin who both refused stoutly to give up their arms were marched back into the town locked in the little church and left to their meditations  hereward sat down on the pavement and cursed the princess martin lightfoot took off his masters corslet and as well as the darkness would allow bound up his wounds which happily were not severe  were i you said he at last i should keep my curses till i saw the end of this adventure  has not the girl betrayed me shamefully  not she i saw her warn you as far as looks could do not to quarrel with the man  that was because she did not know me little she thought that i could  dont hollo till you are out of the wood this is a night for praying rather than boasting  she cannot really love that wretch said hereward after a pause you saw how she mocked him  women are strange things and often tease most where they love most  but such a misbegotten savage  women are strange things say i and with some a big fellow is a pretty fellow be he uglier than seven ironhooks still just because women are strange things have patience say i  the lock creaked and the old priest came in martin leapt to the open door but it was slammed in his face by men outside with scornful laughter  the priest took herewards head in his hands wept over him blessed him for having slain goliath like young david and then set food and drink before the two but he answered martins questions only with sighs and shakings of the head  let us eat and drink then said martin and after that you my lord sleep off your wounds while i watch the door i have no fancy for these fellows taking us unawares at night  martin lay quietly across the door till the small hours listening to every sound till the key creaked once more in the lock he started at the sound and seizing the person who entered round the neck whispered one word and you are dead  do not hurt me half shrieked a stifled voice and martin lightfoot to his surprise found that he had grasped no armed man but the slight frame of a young girl  i am the princess she whispered let me in  a very pretty hostage for us thought martin and letting her go seized the key locking the door in the inside  take me to your master she cried and martin led her up the church wondering but half suspecting some further trap  you have a dagger in your hand said he holding her wrist  i have if i had meant to use it it would have been used first on you take it if you like  she hurried up to hereward who lay sleeping quietly on the altarsteps knelt by him wrung his hands called him her champion her deliverer  i am not well awake yet said he coldly and dont know whether this may not be a dream as more that i have seen and heard seems to be  it is no dream i am true i was always true to you have i not put myself in your power am i not come here to deliver you my deliverer  the tears which you shed over your ogres corpse seem to have dried quickly enough  cruel what else could i do you heard him accuse me to those ruffians of having stolen his sword my life my fathers life were not safe a moment had i not dissembled and done the thing i loathed ah she went on bitterly you men who rule the world and us by cruel steel you forget that we poor women have but one weapon left wherewith to hold our own and that is cunning and are driven by you day after day to tell the lie which we detest  then you really stole his sword  and hid it here for your sake and she drew the weapon from behind the altar  take it it is yours now it is magical whoever smites with it need never smite again now quick you must be gone but promise one thing before you go  if i leave this land safe i will do it be it what it may why not come with me lady and see it done  she laughed vain boy do you think that i love you well enough for that  i have won you and why should i not keep you said hereward sullenly  do you not know that i am betrothed to your kinsman andthough that you cannot knowthat i love your kinsman  so i have all the blows and none of the spoil  tush you have the gloryand the swordand the chance if you will do my bidding of being called by all ladies a true and gentle knight who cared not for his own pleasure but for deeds of chivalry go to my betrothedto waterford over the sea take him this ring and tell him by that token to come and claim me soon lest he run the danger of losing me a second time and lose me then forever for i am in hard case here and were it not for my fathers sake perhaps i might be weak enough in spite of what men might say to flee with you to your kinsman across the sea  trust me and come said hereward whose young blood kindled with a sudden noblenesstrust me and i will treat you like my sister like my queen by the holy rood above i will swear to be true to you  i do trust you but it cannot be here is money for you in plenty to hire a passage if you need it is no shame to take it from me and now one thing more here is a cordyou must bind the hands and feet of the old priest inside and then you must bind mine likewise  never quoth hereward  it must be how else can i explain your having got the key i made them give me the key on the pretence that with one who had most cause to hate you it would be safe and when they come and find us in the morning i shall tell them how i came here to stab you with my own handsyou must lay the dagger by meand how you and your man fell upon us and bound us and you escaped ah mary mother continued the maiden with a sigh when shall we poor weak women have no more need of lying  she lay down and hereward in spite of himself gently bound her hands and feet kissing them as he bound them  i shall do well here upon the altar steps said she how can i spend my time better till the morning light than to lie here and pray  the old priest who was plainly in the plot submitted meekly to the same fate and hereward and martin lightfoot stole out locking the door but leaving the key in it outside to scramble over the old earthwork was an easy matter and in a few minutes they were hurrying down the valley to the sea with a fresh breeze blowing behind them from the north  did i not tell you my lord said martin lightfoot to keep your curses till you had seen the end of this adventure  hereward was silent his brain was still whirling from the adventures of the day and his heart was very deeply touched his shrift of the morning hurried and formal as it had been had softened him his dangerfor he felt how he had been face to face with deathhad softened him likewise and he repented somewhat of his vainglorious and bloodthirsty boasting over a fallen foe as he began to see that there was a purpose more noble in life than ranging land and sea a ruffian among ruffians seeking for glory amid blood and flame the idea of chivalry of succoring the weak and the opprest of keeping faith and honor not merely towards men who could avenge themselves but towards women who could not the dim dawn of purity gentleness and the conquest of his own fierce passionsall these had taken root in his heart during his adventure with the fair cornish girl the seed was sown would it he cut down again by the bitter blasts of the rough fighting world or would it grow and bear the noble fruit of gentle very perfect knighthood  they reached the ship clambered on hoard without ceremony at the risk of being taken and killed as robbers and told their case the merchants had not completed their cargo of tin hereward offered to make up their loss to them if they would set sail at once and they feeling that the place would be for some time to come too hot to hold them and being also in high delight like honest ostmen with herewards prowess agreed to sail straight for waterford and complete their cargo there but the tide was out it was three full hours before the ship could float and for three full hours they waited in fear and trembling expecting the cornishmen to be down upon them in a body every moment under which wholesome fear some on board prayed fervently who had never been known to pray before     chapter iv  how hereward took service with ranald king of waterford   the coasts of ireland were in a state of comparative peace in the middle of the eleventh century the ships of loghlin seen far out at sea no longer drove the population shrieking inland heathen danes whether fairhaired fiongall from norway or brownhaired dubgall from denmark proper no longer burned convents tortured monks for their gold or as at clonmacnoise set a heathen princess oda wife of thorgill son of harold harfager aloft on the high altar to receive the homage of the conquered the scandinavian invaders had become christianized and civilized alsoowing to their continual intercourse with foreign nationsmore highly than the irish whom they had overcome that was easy for early irish civilization seems to have existed only in the convents and for the religious and when they were crushed mere barbarism was left behind and now the same process went on in the east of ireland which went on a generation or two later in the east of scotland the danes began to settle down into peaceful colonists and traders ireland was poor and the convents plundered once could not be plundered again the irish were desperately brave illarmed and almost naked they were as perfect in the arts of forest warfare as those modern maories whom they so much resembled and though their black skenes and light darts were no match for the danish swords and battleaxes which they adopted during the middle age or their plaid trousers and felt capes for the danish helmet and chain corslet still an irishman was so ugly a foe that it was not worth while to fight with him unless he could be robbed afterwards the danes who like their descendants of northumbria the lowlands and ulster were canny commonsense folk with a shrewd eye to interest found somewhat to their regret that there were trades even more profitable than robbery and murder they therefore concentrated themselves round harbors and river mouths and sent forth their ships to all the western seas from dublin waterford wexford cork or limerick every important seaport in ireland owes its existence to those sturdy vikings sons in each of these towns they had founded a petty kingdom which endured until and even in some cases after the conquest of ireland by henry ii and strongbow they intermarried in the mean while with the native irish brian boru for instance was so connected with danish royalty that it is still a question whether he himself had not danish blood in his veins king sigtryg silkbeard who fought against him at clontarf was actually his stepsonand so too according to another irish chronicler was king olaff kvaran who even at the time of the battle of clontarf was married to brian borus daughtera marriage which if a fact was startlingly within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity but the ancient irish were sadly careless on such points and as giraldus cambrensis says followed the example of men of old in their vices more willingly than in their virtues  more than forty years had elapsed since that famous battle of clontarf and since ragnvald reginald or ranald son of sigtryg the norseman had been slain therein by brian boru on that one day so the irish sang the northern invaders were exterminated once and for all by the milesian hero who had craftily used the strangers to fight his battles and then the moment they became formidable to himself crushed them till from howth to brandon in kerry there was not a threshingfloor without a danish slave threshing thereon or a quern without a danish woman grinding thereat  nevertheless in spite of the total annihilation of the danish power in the emerald isle ranald seemed to the eyes of men to be still a hale old warrior ruling constitutionallythat is with a wholesome fear of being outlawed or murdered if he misbehavedover the danes in waterford with five hundred fairhaired warriors at his back twoedged axe on shoulder and twoedged sword on thigh his ships drove a thriving trade with france and spain in irish fish butter honey and furs his workmen coined money in the old round tower of dundory built by his predecessor and namesake about the year 1003 which stands as reginalds tower to this day he had fought many a bloody battle since his death at clontarf by the side of his old leader sigtryg silkbeard he had been many a time to dublin to visit his even more prosperous and formidable friend and was so delighted with the new church of the holy trinity which sigtryg and his bishop donatus had just built not in the danish or ostman town but in the heart of ancient celtic dublin plain proof of the utter overthrow of the danish power that he had determined to build a like church in honor of the holy trinity in waterford itself a thriving valiant old king he seemed as he sat in his great house of pine logs under reginalds tower upon the quay drinking french and spanish wines out of horns of ivory and cups of gold and over his head hanging upon the wall the huge doublededged axe with which so his flatterers had whispered brian boru had not slain him but he brian boru  nevertheless then as since alas the pleasant theory was preferred by the milesian historians to the plain truth and far away inland monks wrote and harpers sung of the death of ranald the fairhaired fiongall and all his mailed swarms  one teague macmurrough indeed a famous bard of those parts composed unto his harp a song of clontarf the fame whereof reached ranalds ears and so amused him that he rested not day or night till he had caught the hapless bard and brought him in triumph into waterford there he compelled him at swords point to sing to him and his housecarles the milesian version of the great historical event and when the harper in fear and trembling came to the story of ranalds own death at brian borus hands then the jolly old viking laughed till the tears ran down his face and instead of cutting off teagues head gave him a cup of goodly wine made him his own harper thenceforth and bade him send for his wife and children and sing to him every day especially the song of clontarf and his own death treating him very much in fact as english royalty during the last generation treated another irish bard whose song was even more sweet and his notions of irish history even more grotesque than those of teague macmurrough  it was to this old king or rather to his son sigtryg godson of sigtryg silkbeard and distant cousin of his own that hereward now took his way and told his story as the king sat in his hall drinking across the fire after the old norse fashion the fire of pine logs was in the midst of the hall and the smoke went out through a louver in the roof on one side was a long bench and in the middle of it the kings high armchair right and left of him sat his kinsmen and the ladies and his seacaptains and men of wealth opposite on the other side of the fire was another bench in the middle of that sat his marshal and right and left all his housecarles there were other benches behind on which sat more freemen but of lesser rank  and they were all drinking ale which a servant poured out of a bucket into a great bulls horn and the men handed round to each other  then hereward came in and sat down on the end of the hindermost bench and martin stood behind him till one of the ladies said  who is that young stranger who sits behind there so humbly though he looks like an earls son more fit to sit here with us on the high bench  so he does quoth king ranald come forward hither young sir and drink  and when hereward came forward all the ladies agreed that he must be an earls son for he had a great gold torc round his neck and gold rings on his wrists and a new scarlet coat bound with gold braid and scarlet stockings crosslaced with gold braid up to the knee and shoes trimmed with martins fur and a short blue silk cloak over all trimmed with martins fur likewise and by his side in a broad belt with gold studs was the ogres sword brainbiter with its ivory hilt and velvet sheath and all agreed that if he had but been a head taller they had never seen a properer man  aha such a gay young seacock does not come hither for naught drink first man and tell us thy business after and he reached the horn to hereward  hereward took it and sang   in this bragabeaker   brave ranald i pledge   in good liquor which lightens   long labor on oarbench   good liquor which sweetens   the song of the scald  thy voice is as fine as thy feathers man nay drink it all we ourselves drink here by the peg at midday but a stranger is welcome to fill his inside all hours of the day  whereon hereward finished the horn duly and at ranalds bidding sat him down on the high settle he did not remark that as he sat down two handsome youths rose and stood behind him  now then sir priest quoth the king go on with your story  a priest irish by his face and dress who sat on the high bench rose and renewed an oration which herewards entrance had interrupted  so o great king as says homerus this wise king called his earls knights seacaptains and housecarles and said unto them which of these two kings is in the right who can tell but mind you that this king of the enchanters lives far away in india and we never heard of him more than his name but this king ulixes and his greeks live hard by and which of the two is it wiser to quarrel with him that lives hard by or him that lives far off therefore king ranald says by the mouth of my humility the great obrodar lord of ivark take example by alcinous the wise king of fairy and listen not to the ambassadors of those lying villains odea lord of slievardagh maccarthy king of cashel and osullivan lord of knockraffin who all three between them could not raise kernes enough to drive off one old widows cow make friends with me who live upon your borders and you shall go peaceably through my lands to conquer and destroy them who live afar off as they deserve the sons of belial and judas  and the priest crost himself and sat down at which speech hereward was seen to laugh  why do you laugh young sir the priest seems to talk like a wise man and is my guest and an ambassador  then rose up hereward and bowed to the king king ranald sigtrygsson it was not for rudeness that i laughed for i learnt good manners long ere i came here but because i find clerks alike all over the world  how  quick at hiding false counsel under learned speech i know nothing of ulixes king nor of this obrodar either and i am but a lad as you see but i heard a bird once in my own country who gave a very different counsel from the priests  speak on then this lad is no fool my merry men all  there were three copses king in our country and each copse stood on a hill in the first there built an eagle in the second there built a sparhawk in the third there built a crow  now the sparhawk came to the eagle and said go shares with me and we will kill the crow and have her wood to ourselves  humph says the eagle i could kill the crow without your help however i will think of it  when the crow heard that she came to the eagle herself king eagle says she why do you want to kill me who live ten miles from you and never flew across your path in my life better kill that little rogue of a sparhawk who lives between us and is always ready to poach on your marches whenever your back is turned so you will have her wood as well as your own  you are a wise crow said the eagle and he went out and killed the sparhawk and took his wood  loud laughed king ranald and his vikings all well spoken young man we will take the sparhawk and let the crow bide  nay but quoth hereward hear the end of the story after a while the eagle finds the crow beating about the edge of the sparhawks wood  oho says he so you can poach as well as that little hooknosed rogue and he killed her too  ah says the crow when she lay adying my blood is on my own head if i had but left the sparhawk between me and this great tyrant  and so the eagle got all three woods to himself  at which the vikings laughed more loudly than ever and king ranald chuckling at the notion of eating up the hapless irish princes one by one sent back the priest not without a present for his church for ranald was a pious man to tell the great obrodar that unless he sent into waterford by that day week two hundred head of cattle a hundred pigs a hundredweight of clear honey and as much of wax ranald would not leave so much as a suckingpig alive in ivark  the cause of quarrel of course was too unimportant to be mentioned each had robbed and cheated the other half a dozen times in the last twenty years as for the morality of the transaction ranald had this salve for his consciencethat as he intended to do to obrodar so would obrodar have gladly done to him had he been living peaceably in norway and obrodar been strong enough to invade and rob him indeed so had obrodar done already ever since he wore beard to every chieftain of his own race whom he was strong enough to illtreat many a fair herd had he driven off many a fair farm burnt many a fair woman carried off a slave after that inveterate fashion of lawless feuds which makes the history of celtic ireland from the earliest times one dull and aimless catalogue of murder and devastation followed by famine and disease and now as he had done to others so it was to be done to him  and now young sir who seem as witty as you are good looking you may if you will tell us your name and your business as for the name however if you wish to keep it to yourself ranald sigtrygsson is not the man to demand it of an honest guest  hereward looked round and saw teague macmurrough standing close to him harp in hand he took it from him courteously enough put a silver penny into the minstrels hand and running his fingers over the strings rose and began    outlaw and free thief    landless and lawless    through the world fare i    thoughtless of life    soft is my beard but    hard my brainbiter    wake men me call whom    warrior or watchman    never caught sleeping    far in northumberland    slew i the witchbear    cleaving his brainpan    at one stroke i felled him  and so forth chanting all his doughty deeds with such a voice and spirit joined to that musical talent for which he was afterwards so famous till the hearts of the wild norsemen rejoiced and skall to the stranger skall to the young viking rang through the hall  then showing proudly the fresh wounds on his bare arms he sang of his fight with the cornish ogre and his adventure with the princess but always though he went into the most minute details he concealed the name both of her and of her father while he kept his eyes steadily fixed on ranalds eldest son sigtryg who sat at his fathers right hand  the young man grew uneasy red almost angry till at last hereward sang    a gold ring she gave me    right royally dwarfworked    to none will i pass it    for prayer or for swordstroke    save to him who can claim it    by love and by troth plight    let that hero speak    if that hero be here  young sigtryg half started from his feet but when hereward smiled at him and laid his finger on his lips he sat down again hereward felt his shoulder touched from behind one of the youths who had risen when he sat down bent over him and whispered in his ear  ah hereward we know you do you not know us we are the twins the sons of your sister siward the white and siward the red the orphans of asbiorn siwardsson who fell at dunsinane  hereward sprang up struck the harp again and sang   outlaw and free thief   my kinsfolk have left me   and no kinsfolk need i   till kinsfolk shall need me   my sword is my father   my shield is my mother   my ship is my sister   my horse is my brother  uncle uncle whispered one of them sadly listen now or never for we have bad news for you and us your father is dead and earl algar your brother here in ireland outlawed a second time  a flood of sorrow passed through herewards heart he kept it down and rising once more harp in hand     hereward king hight i     holy leofric my father     in westminster wiser     none walked with king edward     high minsters he builded     pale monks he maintained     dead is he a beddeath     a leechdeath a priestdeath     a strawdeath a cows death     such doom i desire not     to high heaven all so softly     the angels uphand him     in meads of may flowers     mild mary will meet him     me happier the valkyrs     shall waft from the wardeck     shall hail from the holmgang     or helmetstrewn moorland     and swordstrokes my shrift be     sharp spears be my leeches     with heroes hot corpses     high heaped for my pillow  skall to the viking shouted the danes once more at this outburst of heathendom common enough among their halfconverted race in times when monasticism made so utter a divorce between the life of the devotee and that of the worldling that it seemed reasonable enough for either party to have their own heaven and their own hell after all hereward was not original in his wish he had but copied the deathsong which his fathers friend and compeer siward digre the victor of dunsinane had sung for himself some three years before  all praised his poetry and especially the quickness of his alliterations then a note of the highest art and the old king filling not this time the horn but a golden goblet bid him drain it and keep the goblet for his song  young sigtryg leapt up and took the cup to hereward such a scald he said ought to have no meaner cupbearer than a kings son  hereward drank it dry and then fixing his eyes meaningly on the prince dropt the princesss ring into the cup and putting it back into sigtrygs hand sang     the beaker i reach back     more rich than i took it     no gold will i grasp     of the kings the ringgiver     till by wit or by weapon     i worthily win it     when brained by my biter     obrodar lies gory     while over the wolfs meal     fair widows are wailing  does he refuse my gift grumbled ranald  he has given a fair reason said the prince as he hid the ring in his bosom leave him to me for my brother in arms he is henceforth  after which as was the custom of those parts most of them drank too much liquor but neither sigtryg nor hereward drank and the two siwards stood behind their young uncles seat watching him with that intense admiration which lads can feel for a young man  that night when the warriors were asleep sigtryg and hereward talked out their plans they would equip two ships they would fight all the kinglets of cornwall at once if need was they would carry off the princess and burn alefs town over his head if he said nay nothing could be more simple than the tactics required in an age when might was right  then hereward turned to his two nephews who lingered near him plainly big with news  and what brings you here lads he had hardened his heart and made up his mind to show no kindness to his own kin the day might come when they might need him then it would be his turn  your father as we told you is dead  so much the better for him and the worse for england and harold and the godwinssons of course are lords and masters far and wide  tosti has our grandfather siwards earldom  i know that i know too that he will not keep it long unless he learns that northumbrians are free men and not wessex slaves  and algar our uncle is outlawed again after king edward had given him peaceably your fathers earldom  and why  why was he outlawed two years ago  because the godwinssons hate him i suppose  and algar is gone to griffin the welshman and from him on to dublin to get ships just as he did two years ago and has sent us here to get ships likewise  and what will he do with them when he has got them he burnt hereford last time he was outlawed by way of a wise deed minster and all with st ethelberts relics on board and slew seven clergymen but they were only honest canons with wives at home and not shaveling monks so i suppose that sin was easily shrived well i robbed a priest of a few pence and was outlawed he plunders and burns a whole minster and is made a great earl for if one law for the weak and one for the strong young lads as you will know when you are as old as i and now i suppose he will plunder and burn more minsters and then patch up a peace with harold again which i advise him strongly to do for i warn you young lads and you may carry that message from me to dublin to my good brother your uncle that harolds little finger is thicker than his whole body and that false godwinsson as he is he is the only man with a head upon his shoulders left in england now that his father and my father and dear old siward whom i loved better than my father are dead and gone  the lads stood silent not a little awed and indeed imposed on by the cynical and worldlywise tone which their renowned uncle had assumed  at last one of them asked falteringly then you will do nothing for us  for you nothing against you nothing why should i mix myself up in my brothers quarrels will he make that whiteheaded driveller at westminster reverse my outlawry and if he does what shall i get thereby a younger brothers portion a dirty oxgang of land in kesteven let him leave me alone as i leave him and see if i do not come back to him some day for or against him as he chooses with such a host of vikings sons as harold hardraade himself would be proud of by thors hammer boys i have been an outlaw but five years now and i find it so cheery a life that i do not care if i am an outlaw for fifty more the world is a fine place and a wide place and it is a very little corner of it that i have seen yet and if you were of my mettle you would come along with me and see it throughout to the four corners of heaven instead of mixing yourselves up in these paltry little quarrels with which our two families are tearing england in pieces and being murdered perchance like dogs at last by treachery as sweyn godwinsson murdered biorn  the boys listened wideeyed and wideeared hereward knew to whom he was speaking and he had not spoken in vain  what do you hope to get here he went on ranald will give you no ships he will have enough to do to fight obrodar and he is too cunning to thrust his head into algars quarrels  we hoped to find vikings here who would go to any war on the hope of plunder  if there be any i want them more than you and what is more i will have them they know that they will do finer deeds with me for their captain than burning a few english homesteads and so may you come with me lads once and for all come help me to fight obrodar then help me to another little adventure which i have on handas pretty a one as ever you heard a minstrel singand then we will fit out a longship or two and go where fate leadsto constantinople if you like what can you do better you never will get that earldom from tosti lucky for young waltheof your uncle if he gets itif he and you too are not murdered within seven years for i know tostis humor when he has rivals in his way  algar will protect us said one  i tell you algar is no match for the godwinssons if the monkking died tomorrow neither his earldom nor his life would be safe when i saw your father asbiorn lie dead at dunsinane i said there ends the glory of the house of the bear and if you wish to make my words come false then leave england to founder and rot and fall to piecesas all men say she is doingwithout your helping to hasten her ruin and seek glory and wealth too with me around the world the white bears blood is in your veins lads take to the sea like your ancestor and come over the swans bath with me  that we will said the two lads and well they kept their word     chapter v  how hereward succored the princess of cornwall a second time   fat was the feasting and loud was the harping in the halls of alef the cornishman king of gweek savory was the smell of fried pilchard and hake more savory still that of roast porpoise most savory of all that of fifty huge squab pies built up of layers of apples bacon onions and mutton and at the bottom of each a squab or young cormorant which diffused both through the pie and through the ambient air a delicate odor of mingled guano and polecat and the occasion was worthy alike of the smell and of the noise for king alef finding that after the ogres death the neighboring kings were but too ready to make reprisals on him for his champions murders and robberies had made a treaty of alliance offensive and defensive with hannibal the son of gryll king of marazion and had confirmed the same by bestowing on him the hand of his fair daughter whether she approved of the match or not was asked neither by king alef nor by king hannibal  tonight was the bridalfeast tomorrow morning the church was to hallow the union and after that hannibal grylls was to lead home his bride among a gallant company  and as they ate and drank and harped and piped there came into that hall four shabbily drest menone of them a short broad fellow with black elflocks and a red beardand sat them down sneakingly at the very lowest end of all the benches  in hospitable cornwall especially on such a day every guest was welcome and the strangers sat peaceably but ate nothing though there was both hake and pilchard within reach  next to them by chance sat a great lourdan of a dane as honest brave and stupid a fellow as ever tugged at oar and after a while they fell talking till the strangers had heard the reason of this great feast and all the news of the country side  but whence did they come not to know it already for all cornwall was talking thereof  o they came out of devonshire seeking service down west with some merchant or rover being seafaring men  the stranger with the black hair had been meanwhile earnestly watching the princess who sat at the boards head he saw her watching him in return and with a face sad enough  at last she burst into tears  what should the bride weep for at such a merry wedding asked he of his companion  o cause enough and he told bluntly enough the princesss story and what is more said he the king of waterford sent a ship over last week with forty proper lads on board and two gallant holders with them to demand her but for all answer they were put into the strong house and there they lie chained to a log at this minute pity it is and shame i hold for i am a dane myself and pity too that such a bonny lass should go to an unkempt welshman like this instead of a tight smart vikings son like the waterford lad  the stranger answered nothing but kept his eyes upon the princess till she looked at him steadfastly in return  she turned pale and red again but after a while she spoke  there is a stranger there and what his rank may be i know not but he has been thrust down to the lowest seat in a house that used to honor strangers instead of treating them like slaves let him take this dish from my hand and eat joyfully lest when he goes home he may speak scorn of bridegroom and bride and our cornish weddings  the servant brought the dish down he gave a look at the strangers shabby dress turned up his nose and pretending to mistake put the dish into the hand of the dane  hold lads quoth the stranger if i have ears that was meant for me  he seized the platter with both hands and therewith the hands both of the cornishman and of the dane there was a struggle but so bitter was the strangers gripe that says the chronicler the blood burst from the nails of both his opponents  he was called a savage a devil in mans shape and other dainty names but he was left to eat his squab pie in peace  patience lads quoth he as he filled his mouth before i take my pleasure at this wedding i will hand my own dish round as well as any of you  whereat men wondered but held their tongues  and when the eating was over and the drinking began the princess rose and came round to drink the farewell health  with her maids behind her and her harper before her so was the cornish custom she pledged one by one each of the guests slave as well as free while the harper played a tune  she came down at last to the strangers her face was pale and her eyes red with weeping  she filled a cup of wine and one of her maids offered it to the stranger  he put it back courteously but firmly not from your hand said he  a growl against his bad manners rose straightway and the minstrel who as often happened in those days was jester likewise made merry at his expense and advised the company to turn the wild beast out of the hall  silence fool said the princess why should he know our westcountry ways he may take it from my hand if not from hers  and she held out to him the cup herself  he took it looking her steadily in the face and it seemed to the minstrel as if their hands lingered together round the cuphandle and that he saw the glitter of a ring  like many another of his craft before and since he was a vain meddlesome vagabond and must needs pry into a secret which certainly did not concern him  so he could not leave the stranger in peace and knowing that his privileged calling protected him from that formidable fist he never passed him by without a sneer or a jest as he wandered round the table offering his harp in the cornish fashion to any one who wished to play and sing  but not to you sir elflocks he that is rude to a pretty girl when she offers him wine is too great a boor to understand my trade  it is a fools trick answered the stranger at last to put off what you must do at last if i had but the time i would pay you for your tune with a better one than you ever heard  take the harp then boor said the minstrel with a laugh and a jest  the stranger took it and drew from it such music as made all heads turn toward him at once then he began to sing sometimes by himself and sometimes his comrades more girviorum tripliciter canentes joined their voices in a threemanglee  in vain the minstrel jealous for his own credit tried to snatch the harp away the stranger sang on till all hearts were softened and the princess taking the rich shawl from her shoulders threw it over those of the stranger saying that it was a gift too poor for such a scald  scald roared the bridegroom now well in his cups from the head of the table ask what thou wilt short of my bride and my kingdom and it is thine  give me then hannibal grylls king of marazion the danes who came from ranald of waterford  you shall have them pity that you have asked for nothing better than such tarry ruffians  a few minutes after the minstrel bursting with jealousy and rage was whispering in hannibals ear  the hot old punic footnote hannibal still a common name in cornwall is heldand not unlikelyto have been introduced there by the ancient phoenician colonists blood flushed up in his cheeks and his thin punic lips curved into a snaky smile perhaps the old punic treachery in his heart for all that he was heard to reply was we must not disturb the goodfellowship of a cornish wedding  the stranger nevertheless and the princess likewise had seen that bitter smile  men drank hard and long that night and when daylight came the strangers were gone  in the morning the marriage ceremony was performed and then began the pageant of leading home the bride the minstrels went first harping and piping then king hannibal carrying his bride behind him on a pillion and after them a string of servants and menatarms leading country ponies laden with the brides dower along with them unarmed sulky and suspicious walked the forty danes who were informed that they should go to marazion and there be shipped off for ireland  now as all men know those parts of cornwall flat and open furzedowns aloft are cut for many miles inland by long branches of tide river walled in by woods and rocks which rivers join at last in the great basin of falmouth harbor and by crossing one or more of these the bridal party would save many a mile on their road towards the west  so they had timed their journey by the tides lest finding low water in the rivers they should have to wade to the ferryboats waist deep in mud and going down the steep hillside through oak and ash and hazel copse they entered as many as could a great flatbottomed barge and were rowed across some quarter of a mile to land under a jutting crag and go up again by a similar path into the woods  so the first boatload went up the minstrels in front harping and piping till the greenwood rang king hannibal next with his bride and behind him spearmen and axemen with a dane between every two  when they had risen some two hundred feet and were in the heart of the forest hannibal turned and made a sign to the men behind him  then each pair of them seized the dane between them and began to bind his hands behind his back what will you do with us  send you back to irelanda king never breaks his wordbut pick out your right eyes first to show your master how much i care for him lucky for you that i leave you an eye apiece to find your friend the harper whom if i catch i flay alive  you promised cried the princess  and so did you traitress and he griped her arm which was round his waist till she screamed so did you promise but not to me and you shall pass your bridal night in my dogkennel after my dogwhip has taught you not to give rings again to wandering harpers  the wretched princess shuddered for she knew too well that such an atrocity was easy and common enough she knew it well why should she not the story of the cids daughters and the knights of carrion the far more authentic one of robert of belesme and many another ugly tale of the early middle age will prove but too certainly that before the days of chivalry began neither youth beauty nor the sacred ties of matrimony could protect women from the most horrible outrages at the hands of those who should have been their protectors it was reserved for monks and inquisitors in the name of religion and the gospel to continue through after centuries those brutalities toward women of which gentlemen and knights had grown ashamed save when as in the case of the albigense crusaders monks and inquisitors bade them torture mutilate and burn in the name of him who died on the cross  but the words had hardly passed the lips of hannibal ere he reeled in the saddle and fell to the ground a javelin through his heart  a strong arm caught the princess a voice which she knew bade her have no fear  bind your horse to a tree for we shall want him and wait  three wellarmed men rushed on the nearest cornishmen and hewed them down a fourth unbound the dane and bade him catch up a weapon and fight for his life  a second pair were dispatched a second dane freed ere a minute was over the cornishmen struggling up the narrow path toward the shouts above were overpowered in detail by continually increasing numbers and ere half an hour was over the whole party were freed mounted on the ponies and making their way over the downs toward the west  noble noble hereward said the princess as she sat behind him on hannibals horse i knew you from the first moment and my nurse knew you too is she here is she safe  i have taken care of that she has done us too good service to be left here and be hanged  i knew you in spite of your hair by your eyes  yes said hereward it is not every man who carries one gray eye and one blue the more difficult for me to go mumming when i need  but how came you hither of all places in the world  when you sent your nurse to me last night to warn me that treason was abroad it was easy for me to ask your road to marazion and easier too when i found that you would go home the very way we came to know that i must make my stand here or nowhere  the way you came then where are we going now  beyond marazion to a little covei cannot tell its name there lies sigtryg your betrothed and three good ships of war  there why did he not come for me himself  why because we knew nothing of what was toward we meant to have sailed straight up your river to your fathers town and taken you out with a high hand we had sworn an oathwhich as you saw i keptneither to eat nor drink in your house save out of your own hands but the easterly wind would not let us round the lizard so we put into that cove and there i and these two lads my nephews offered to go forward as spies while sigtryg threw up an earthwork and made a stand against the cornish we meant merely to go back to him and give him news but when i found you as good as wedded i had to do what i could while i could and i have done it  you have my noble and true champion said she kissing him  humph quoth hereward laughing do not tempt me by being too grateful it is hard enough to gather honey like the bees for other folks to eat what if i kept you myself now i have got you  hereward  o there is no fear pretty lady i have other things to think of than making love to youand one is how we are to get to our ships and moreover past marazion town  and hard work they had to get thither the country was soon roused and up in arms and it was only by wandering a three days circuit through bogs and moors till the ponies were utterly tired out and left behind the bulkier part of the dowry being left behind with them that they made their appearance on the shore of mounts bay hereward leading the princess in triumph upon hannibals horse  after which they all sailed away for ireland and there like young beichan     prepared another wedding     with all their hearts so full of glee  and this is the episode of the cornish princess as told by leofric of bourne the cunning minstrel and warlike priest     chapter vi  how hereward was wrecked upon the flanders shore   hereward had drunk his share at sigtrygs wedding he had helped to harry the lands of obrodar till as king ranald had threatened there was not a suckingpig left in ivark and the poor folk died of famine as they did about every seven years he had burst says the chronicler through the irish camp with a chosen band of berserkers slain obrodar in his tent brought off his warhorn as a trophy and cut his way back to the danish armya feat in which the two siwards were grievously wounded and had in all things shown himself a daring and crafty captain as careless of his own life as of other folks  then a great homesickness had seized him he would go back and see the old house and the cattlepastures and the meres and fens of his boyhood he would see his widowed mother perhaps her heart was softened to him by now as his was toward her and if not he could show her that he could do without her that others thought him a fine fellow if she did not hereward knew that he had won honor and glory for himself that his name was in the mouths of all warriors and searovers round the coasts as the most likely young champion of the time able to rival if he had the opportunity the prowess of harold hardraade himself yes he would go and see his mother he would be kind if she was kind if she were not he would boast and swagger as he was but too apt to do that he should go back at the risk of his life that any one who found him on english ground might kill him and that many would certainly try to kill him he knew very well but that only gave special zest to the adventure  martin lightfoot heard this news with joy  i have no more to do here said he i have searched and asked far and wide for the man i want and he is not on the irish shores some say he is gone to the orkneys some to denmark never mind i shall find him before i die  and for whom art looking  for one thord gunlaugsson my father  and what wantest with him  to put this through his brain and he showed his axe  thy fathers brain  look you lord a man owes his father naught and his mother all at least so hold i man that is of woman born say all the world and they say right now if any man hang up that mother by hands and feet and flog her to death is not he that is of that mother born bound to revenge her upon any man and all the more if that man had first his wicked will of that poor mother considering that last lord i do not know but what i am bound to avenge my mothers shame upon the man even if he had never killed her no lord you need not try to talk this out of my head it has been there nigh twenty years and i say it over to myself every night before i sleep lest i should forget the one thing which i must do before i die find him i will and find him i shall if there be justice in heaven above  so hereward asked ranald for ships and got at once two good vessels as payment for his doughty deeds  one he christened the garpike from her narrow build and long beak and the other the otter because he said whatever she grappled she would never let go till she heard the bones crack they were excellent new snekrs nearly eighty feet long each with double banks for twelve oars a side in the waist which was open save a fighting gangway along the sides with high poop and forecastle decks and with one large sail apiece embroidered by sigtrygs princess and the other ladies with a huge white bear which hereward had chosen as his ensign  as for men there were fifty fellows as desperate as hereward himself to take service with him for that or any other quest so they ballasted their ships with great pebbles stowed under the thwarts to be used as ammunition in case of boarding and over them the barrels of ale and pork and meal well covered with tarpaulins they stowed in the cabins fore and aft their weaponsswords spears axes bows chests of arrowheads leather bags of bowstrings mailshirts and helmets and fine clothes for holidays and fighting days they hung their shields after the old fashion outboard along the gunwale and a right gay show they made and so rowed out of waterford harbor amid the tears of the ladies and the cheers of the men  but as it befell the voyage did not prosper hereward found his vessels undermanned and had to sail northward for fresh hands he got none in dublin for they were all gone to the welsh marches to help earl alfgar and king griffin so he went on through the hebrides intending of course to plunder as he went but there he got but little booty and lost several men so he went on again to the orkneys to try for fresh hands from the norse earl hereof but there befell a fresh mishap they were followed by a whale which they made sure was a witchwhale and boded more ill luck and accordingly they were struck by a storm in the pentland frith and the poor garpike went on shore on hoy and was left there forever and a day her crew being hardly saved and very little of her cargo  however the otter was now not only manned but over manned and hereward had to leave a dozen stout fellows in kirkwall and sail southward again singing cheerily to his men     lightly the longsnake     leaps after tempests     gayly the sungleam     glows after rain     in labor and daring     lies luck for all mortals     foul winds and foul witchwives     fray women alone  but their mishaps were not over yet they were hardly out of stronsay frith when they saw the witchwhale again following them up rolling and spouting and breaching in most uncanny wise some said that they saw a gray woman on his back and they knewpossibly from the look of the sky but certainly from the whales behaviorthat there was more heavy weather yet coming from the northward  from that day forward the whale never left them nor the wild weather neither they were beaten out of all reckoning once they thought they saw low land to the eastward but what or where who could tell and as for making it the wind which had blown hard from northeast backed against the sun and blew from west from which as well as from the witchwhale they expected another gale from north and round to northeast  the men grew sulky and fearful some were for trying to run the witch down and break her back as did frithiof in like case when hunted by a whale with two hags upon his backan excellent recipe in such cases but somewhat difficult in a heavy sea others said that there was a doomed man on board and proposed to cast lots till they found him out and cast him into the sea as a sacrifice to aegir the wavegod but hereward scouted that as unmanly and cowardly and sang     with blood of my bold ones     with bale of my comrades     thinks aegir brinethirsty     his throat he can slake     though salt spray shrillsounding     sweep in swansflights above us     true heroes trothplighted     together well die  at last after many days their strength was all but worn out they had long since given over rowing and contented themselves with running under a closereefed canvas whithersoever the storm should choose at night a sea broke over them and would have swamped the otter had she not been the best of seaboats but she only rolled the lee shields into the water and out again shook herself and went on nevertheless there were three men on the poop when the sea came in who were not there when it went out  wet and wild dawned that morning showing naught but gray sea and gray air then sang hereward    cheerly my seacocks    crow for the daydawn    weary and wet are we    water beladen    wetter our comrades    whelmed by the witchwhale    us aegir granted    grudging to gondul    doomed to die dryshod    daring the foe  whereat the hearts of the men were much cheered  all of a sudden as is the wont of gales at dawn the clouds rose tore up into ribbons and with a fierce black shower or two blew clean away disclosing a bright blue sky a green rolling sea and a few miles off to leeward a pale yellow line seen only as they topped a wave but seen only too well to keep the ship off shore was impossible and as they drifted nearer and nearer the line of sandhills rose uglier and more formidable through the gray spray of the surf  we shall die on shore but not dryshod said martin do any of you knights of the tarbrush know whether we are going to be drowned in christian waters i should like a mass or two for my soul and shall die the happier within sight of a churchtower  one dune is as like another as one pea we may be anywhere between the texel and cap gris nez but i think nearer the latter than the former  so much the worse for us said another if we had gone ashore among those frieslanders we should have been only knocked on the head outright but if we fall among the frenchmen we shall be clapt in prison strong and tortured till we find ransom  i dont see that said martin we can all be drowned if we like i suppose  drowned we need not be if we be men said the old sailingmaster to hereward the tide is full high and that gives us one chance for our lives keep her head straight and row like fiends when we are once in the surf and then beach her up high and dry and take what befalls after  and what was likely to befall was ugly enough then as centuries after all wrecks and wrecked men were public prey shipwrecked mariners were liable to be sold as slaves and the petty counts of the french and flemish shores were but too likely to extract ransom by prison and torture as guy earl of penthieu would have done so at least william duke of normandy hinted by harold godwinsson had not william for his own politic ends begged the release of the shipwrecked earl  already they had been seen from the beach the country folk who were prowling about the shore after the waifs of the storm deserted jetsom and lagend and crowded to meet the richer prize which was coming in flotsom to become jetsom in its turn  axemen and bowmen put on your harness and be ready but neither strike nor shoot till i give the word we must land peaceably if we can if not we will die fighting  so said hereward and took the rudder into his own hand now then as she rushed into the breakers pull together rowers all and with a will  the men yelled and sprang from the thwarts as they tugged at the oars the sea boiled past them surged into the waist blinded them with spray she grazed the sand once twice thrice leaping forward gallantly each time and then pressed by a huge wave drove high and dry upon the beach as the oars snapt right and left and the men tumbled over each other in heaps  the peasants swarmed down like flies to a carcass but they recoiled as there rose over the forecastle bulwarks not the broad hats of peaceful buscarles but peaked helmets round red shields and glittering axes they drew back and one or two arrows flew from the crowd into the ship but at herewards command no arrows were shot in answer  bale her out quietly and let us show these fellows that we are not afraid of them that is the best chance of peace  at this moment a mounted party came down between the sandhills it might be some twenty strong before them rode a boy on a jennet and by him a clerk as he seemed upon a mule they stopped to talk with the peasants and then to consult among themselves suddenly the boy turned from his party and galloping down the shore while the clerk called after him in vain reined up his horse fetlock deep in water within ten yards of the ships bows  yield yourselves he shouted in french as he brandished a hunting spear yield yourselves or die  hereward looked at him smiling as he sat there keeping the head of his frightened horse toward the ship with hand and heel his long locks streaming in the wind his face full of courage and command and of honesty and sweetness withal and thought that he had never seen so fair a lad  and who art thou thou pretty bold boy asked hereward in french  i said he haughtily enough as resenting herewards familiar thou am arnulf grandson and heir of baldwin marquis of flanders and lord of this land and to his grace i call on you to surrender yourselves  hereward looked not only with interest but respect upon the grandson of one of the most famous and prosperous of northern potentates the descendant of the mighty charlemagne himself he turned and told the men who the boy was  it would be a good trick quoth one to catch that young whelp and keep him as a hostage  here is what will have him on board before he can turn said another as he made a running noose in a rope  quiet men am i master in this ship or you  hereward saluted the lad courteously verily the blood of baldwin of the iron arm has not degenerated i am happy to behold so noble a son of so noble a race  and who are you who speak french so well and yet by your dress are neither french nor fleming  i am harold naemansson the viking and these my men i am here sailing peaceably for england as for yieldingmine yield to no living man but die as we are weapon in hand i have heard of your grandfather that he is a just man and a bountiful therefore take this message to him young sir if he have wars toward i and my men will fight for him with all our might and earn hospitality and ransom with our only treasure which is our swords but if he be at peace then let him bid us go in peace for we are vikings and must fight or rot and die  you are vikings cried the boy pressing his horse into the foam so eagerly that the men mistaking his intent had to be represt again by hereward you are vikings then come on shore and welcome you shall be my friends you shall be my brothers i will answer to my grandfather i have longed to see vikings i long to be a viking myself  by the hammer of thor cried the old master and thou wouldst make a bonny one my lad  hereward hesitated delighted with the boy but by no means sure of his power to protect them  but the boy rode back to his companions who had by this time ridden cautiously down to the sea and talked and gesticulated eagerly  then the clerk rode down and talked with hereward  are you christians shouted he before he would adventure himself near the ship  christians we are sir clerk and dare do no harm to a man of god  the clerk rode nearer his handsome palfrey furred cloak rich gloves and boots moreover his air of command showed that he was no common man  i said he am the abbot of st bertin of sithiu and tutor of yonder prince i can bring down at a word against you the châtelain of st omer with all his knights besides knights and menatarms of my own but i am a man of peace and not of war and would have no blood shed if i can help it  then make peace said hereward your lord may kill us if he will or have us for his guests if he will if he does the first we shall kill each of us a few of his men before we die if the latter we shall kill a few of his foes if you be a man of god you will counsel him accordingly  alas alas said the abbot with a shudder that ever since adams fall sinful man should talk of nothing but slaying and being slain not knowing that his soul is slain already by sin and that a worse death awaits him hereafter than that death of the body of which he makes so light  a very good sermon my lord abbot to listen to next sunday morning but we are hungry and wet and desperate just now and if you do not settle this matter for us our blood will be on your headand may be your own likewise  the abbot rode out of the water faster than he had ridden in and a fresh consultation ensued after which the boy with a warning gesture to his companions turned and galloped away through the sandhills  he is gone to his grandfather himself i verily believe quoth hereward  they waited for some two hours unmolested and true to their policy of seeming recklessness shifted and dried themselves as well as they could ate what provisions were unspoilt by the salt water and broaching the last barrel of ale drank healths to each other and to the flemings on shore  at last down rode with the boy a noblelooking man and behind him more knights and menatarms he announced himself as manasses châtelain of st omer and repeated the demand to surrender  there is no need for it said hereward we are already that young princes guests he has said that we shall be his friends and brothers he has said that he will answer to his grandfather the great marquis whom i and mine shall be proud to serve i claim the word of a descendant of charlemagne  and you shall have it cried the boy châtelain abbot these men are mine they shall come with me and lodge in st bertin  heaven forefend murmured the abbot  they will be safe at least within your ramparts whispered the châtelain  and they shall tell me about the sea have i not told you how i long for vikings how i will have vikings of my own and sail the seas with them like my uncle robert and go to spain and fight the moors and to constantinople and marry the kaisers daughter come he cried to hereward come on shore and he that touches you or your ship touches me  sir châtelain and my lord abbot said hereward you see that viking though i be i am no barbarous heathen but a frenchspeaking gentleman like yourselves it had been easy for me had i not been a man of honor to have cast a rope as my sailors would have had me do over that young boys fair head and haled him on board to answer for my life with his own but i loved him and trusted him as i would an angel out of heaven and i trust him still to him and him only will i yield myself on condition that i and my men shall keep all our arms and treasure and enter his service to fight his foes and his grandfathers wheresoever they will by land or sea  fair sir said the abbot pirate though you call yourself you speak so courtly and clerkly that i too am inclined to trust you and if my young lord will have it so into st bertin i will receive you till our lord the marquis shall give orders about you and yours  so promises were given all round and hereward explained the matter to the men without whose advice for they were all as free as himself he could not act  needs must grunted they as they packed up each his little valuables  then hereward sheathed his sword and leaping from the bow came up to the boy  put your hands between his fair sir said the châtelain  that is not the manner of vikings  and he took the boys right hand and grasped it in the plain english fashion  there is the hand of an honest man come down men and take this young lords hand and serve him in the wars as i will do  one by one the men came down and each took arnulfs hand and shook it till the lads face grew red but none of them bowed or made obeisance they looked the boy full in the face and as they stepped back stared round upon the ring of armed men with a smile and something of a swagger  these are they who bow to no man and call no man master whispered the abbot  and so they were and so are their descendants of scotland and northumbria unto this very day  the boy sprang from his horse and walked among them and round them in delight he admired and handled their longhandled double axes their short seabows of horn and deersinew their red danish jerkins their blue seacloaks fastened on the shoulder with rich brooches and the gold and silver bracelets on their wrists he wondered at their long shaggy beards and still more at the blue patterns with which the english among them hereward especially were tattooed on throat and arm and knee  yes you are vikingsjust such as my uncle robert tells me of  hereward knew well the exploits of robert le frison in spain and greece i trust that your noble uncle he asked is well he was one of us poor seacocks and sailed the swans path gallantly till he became a mighty prince here is a man here who was with your noble uncle in byzant  and he thrust forward the old master  the boys delight knew no bounds he should tell him all about that in st bertin  then he rode back to the ship and round and round her for the tide by that time had left her high and dry and wondered at her long snakelike lines and carven stem and stern  tell me about this ship let me go on board of her i have never seen a ship inland at mons there and even here there are only heavy ugly busses and little fishingboats no you must be all hungry and tired we will go to st bertin at once and you shall be feasted royally hearken villains shouted he to the peasants this ship belongs to the fair sir heremy guest and friend and if any man dares to steal from her a stave or a nail i will have his thiefs hand cut off  the ship fair lord said hereward is yours not mine you should build twenty more after her pattern and man them with such lads as these and then go down to      miklagard and spanialand      that lie so far on the lee o  as did your noble uncle before you  and so they marched inland after the boy had dismounted one of his men and put hereward on the horse  you gentlemen of the sea can ride as well as sail said the châtelain as he remarked with some surprise herewards perfect seat and hand  we should soon learn to fly likewise laughed hereward if there were any booty to be picked up in the clouds there overhead and he rode on by arnulfs side as the lad questioned him about the sea and nothing else  ah my boy said hereward at last look there and let those be vikings who must  and he pointed to the rich pastures broken by strips of cornland and snug farms which stretched between the sea and the great forest of flanders  what do you mean  but hereward was silent it was so like his own native fens for a moment there came over him the longing for a home to settle down in such a fair fat land and call good acres his own and marry and beget stalwart sons to till the old estate when he could till no more might not that be a better lifeat least a happier onethan restless homeless aimless adventure and now just as he had had a hope of peacea hope of seeing his own land his own folk perhaps of making peace with his mother and his kingthe very waves would not let him rest but sped him forth a stormtossed waif to begin life anew fighting he cared not whom or why in a strange land  so he was silent and sad withal  what does he mean asked the boy of the abbot  he seems a wise man let him answer for himself  the boy asked once more  lad lad said hereward waking as from a dream if you be heir to such a fair land as that thank god for it and pray to him that you may rule it justly and keep it in peace as they say your grandfather and your father do and leave glory and fame and the vikings bloody trade to those who have neither father nor mother wife nor land but live like the wolf of the wood from one meal to the next  i thank you for those words sir harold said the good abbot while the boy went on abashed and hereward himself was startled at his own saying and rode silent till they crossed the drawbridge of st bertin and entered that ancient fortress so strong that it was the hidingplace in war time for all the treasures of the country and so sacred withal that no woman dead or alive was allowed to defile it by her presence so that the wife of baldwin the bold ancestor of arnulf wishing to lie by her husband had to remove his corpse from st bertin to the abbey of blandigni where the counts of flanders lay in glory for many a generation  the pirates entered not without gloomy distrust the gates of that consecrated fortress while the monks in their turn were and with some reason considerably frightened when they were asked to entertain as guests forty norse rovers loudly did the elder among them bewail in latin lest their guests should understand too much the present weakness of their monastery where st bertin was left to defend himself and his monks all alone against the wicked world outside far different had been their case some hundred and seventy years before then st valeri and st riquier of ponthieu transported thither from their own restingplaces in france for fear of the invading northmen had joined their suffrages and merits to those of st bertin with such success that the abbey had never been defiled by the foot of the heathen but alas the saints that is their bodies after a while became homesick and st valeri appearing in a dream to hugh capet bade him bring them back to france in spite of arnulf count of those parts who wished much to retain so valuable an addition to his household gods  but in vain hugh capet was a man who took few denials with knights and menatarms he came and count arnulf had to send home the holy corpses with all humility and leave st bertin all alone  whereon st valeri appeared in a dream to hugh capet and said unto him because thou hast zealously done what i commanded thou and thy successors shall reign in the kingdom of france to everlasting generations footnote histoire des comtes de flandre par e le glay e gestis ss richarii et walerici  however there was no refusing the grandson and heir of count baldwin and the hearts of the monks were comforted by hearing that hereward was a good christian and that most of his crew had been at least baptized the abbot therefore took courage and admitted them into the hospice with solemn warnings as to the doom which they might expect if they took the value of a horsenail from the patrimony of the blessed saint was he less powerful or less careful of his own honor than st lieven of holthem who not more than fifty years before had struck stoneblind four soldiers of the emperor henrys who had dared after warning to plunder the altar footnote ibid let them remember too the fate of their own forefathers the heathens of the north and the check which one hundred and seventy years before they had received under those very walls they had exterminated the people of walcheren they had taken prisoner count regnier they had burnt ghent bruges and st omer itself close by they had left naught between the scheldt and the somme save stark corpses and blackened ruins what could withstand them till they dared to lift audacious hands against the heavenly lord who sleeps there in sithiu then they poured down in vain over the heiligveld innumerable as the locusts poor monks strong in the protection of the holy bertin sallied out and smote them hip and thigh singing their psalms the while the ditches of the fortress were filled with unbaptized corpses the piles of vinetwigs which they lighted to burn down the gates turned their flames into the norsemens faces at the bidding of st bertin and they fled from that temporal fire to descend into that which is eternal while the gates of the pit were too narrow for the multitude of their miscreant souls footnote this gallant feat was performed in the a d 891  so the norsemen heard and feared and only cast longing eyes at the gold and tapestries of the altars when they went in to mass  for the good abbot gaining courage still further had pointed out to hereward and his men that it had been surely by the merits and suffrages of the blessed st bertin that they had escaped a watery grave  hereward and his men for their part were not inclined to deny the theory that they had miraculously escaped from the accident of the tide being high they knew full well and that st bertin should have done them the service was probable enough he of course was lord and master in his own country and very probably a few miles out to sea likewise  so hereward assured the abbot that he had no mind to eat st bertins bread or accept his favors without paying honestly for them and after mass he took from his shoulders a handsome silk cloak the only one he had with a great scotch cairngorm brooch and bade them buckle it on the shoulders of the great image of st bertin  at which st bertin was so pleased being like many saints male and female somewhat proud after their death of the finery which they despised during life that he appeared that night to a certain monk and told him that if hereward would continue duly to honor him the blessed st bertin and his monks at that place he would in his turn insure him victory in all his battles by land and sea  after which hereward stayed quietly in the abbey certain days and young arnulf in spite of all remonstrances from the abbot would never leave his side till he had heard from him and from his men as much of their adventures as they thought it prudent to relate     chapter vii  how hereward went to the war at guisnes   the dominion of baldwin of lillebaldwin the debonairmarquis of flanders and just then the greatest potentate in europe after the kaiser of germany and the kaiser of constantinople extended from the somme to the scheldt including thus much territory which now belongs to france his forefathers had ruled there ever since the days of the foresters of charlemagne who held the vast forests against the heathens of the fens and of that famous baldwin brasdeferwho when the foul fiend rose out of the scheldt and tried to drag him down tried cold steel upon him being a practical man and made his ghostly adversary feel so sorely the weight of the iron arm that he retired into his native mudor even lower still  he like a daring knight as he was ran off with his so some say early love judith daughter of charles the bald of france a descendant of charlemagne himself married up to ethelwulf of england and thus stepmother of alfred the greatafter his death behaving alas for her not over wisely or well she had verified the saying      nous revenons toujours      À nos premiers amours  and ran away with baldwin  charles furious that one of his earls a mere lieutenant and creature should dare to marry a daughter of charlemagnes house would have attacked him with horse and foot fire and sword had not baldwin been the only man who could defend his northern frontier against the heathen norsemen  the pope as charles was his good friend fulminated against baldwin the excommunication destined for him who stole a widow for his wife and all his accomplices  baldwin and judith went straight to rome and told their story to the pope  he honest man wrote to charles the bald a letter which still remainsalike merciful sentimental and politic with its usual ingrained element of what we now call from the old monkish word cantare cant of baldwins horrible wickedness there is no doubt of his repentance in all matters short of amendment of life by giving up the fair judith still less but the pope has another motive for so acting he fears lest baldwin under the weight of charless wrath and indignation should make alliance with the normans enemies of god and the holy church and thus an occasion arise of peril and scandal for the people of god whom charles ought to rule c c which if it happened it would be worse for them and for charless own soul  to which very sensible and humane missive times and creeds being considered charles answered after pouting and sulking by making baldwin bona fide king of all between somme and scheldt and leaving him to raise a royal race from judith the wicked and the fair  this all happened about a d 863 two hundred years after there ruled over that same land baldwin the debonair as marquis of the flamands  baldwin had had his troubles he had fought the count of holland he had fought the emperor of germany during which war he had burnt the cathedral of nimeguen and did other unrighteous and unwise things and had been beaten after all  baldwin had had his troubles and had deserved them but he had had his glories and had deserved them likewise he had cut the fossé neuf or new dike which parted artois from flanders he had so beautified the cathedral of lille that he was called baldwin of lille to his dying day he had married adela the queen countess daughter of the king of france he had become tutor of philip the young king and more or less thereby regent of the north of france and had fulfilled his office wisely and well he had married his eldest son baldwin the good to the terrible sorceress richilda heiress of hainault wherefore the bridegroom was named baldwin of mons he had married one of his daughters matilda to william of normandy afterwards the conqueror and another judith to tosti godwinsson the son of the great earl godwin of england she afterwards married welf duke of bavaria whereby it may be the blood of baldwin of flanders runs in the veins of queen victoria  and thus there were few potentates of the north more feared and respected than baldwin the goodnatured earl of flanders  but one sore thorn in the side he had which other despots after him shared with him and with even worse success in extracting itnamely the valiant men of scaldmariland which we now call holland of them hereafter at the moment of herewards arrival he was troubled with a lesser thorn the count of guisnes who would not pay him up certain dues and otherwise acknowledge his sovereignty  therefore when the châtelain of st omer sent him word to bruges that a strange viking had landed with his crew calling himself harold naemansson and offering to take service with him he returned for answer that the said harold might make proof of his faith and prowess upon the said count in which if he acquitted himself like a good knight baldwin would have further dealings with him  so the châtelain of st omer with all his knights and menatarms and hereward with his seacocks marched northwest up to guisnes with little arnulf cantering alongside in high glee for it was the first war that he had ever seen  and they came to the castle of guisnes and summoned the count by trumpet and herald to pay or fight  whereon the count preferring the latter certain knights of his came forth and challenged the knights of st omer to fight them man to man whereon there was the usual splintering of lances and slipping up of horses and hewing at heads and shoulders so well defended in mail that no one was much hurt the archers and arbalisters meanwhile amused themselves with shooting at the castle walls out of which they chipped several small pieces of stone and when they were all tired they drew off on both sides and went in to dinner  at which herewards men who were accustomed to a more serious fashion of fighting stood by mightily amused and vowing it was as pretty a play as ever they saw in their lives  the next day the same comedy was repeated  let me go in against those knights sir châtelain asked hereward who felt the lust of battle tingling in him from head to heel and try if i cannot do somewhat towards deciding all this if we fight no faster than we did yesterday our beards will be grown down to our knees before we take guisnes  let my viking go cried arnulf let me see him fight as if he had been a pet gamecock or bulldog  you can break a lance fine sir if it please you said the châtelain  i break more than lances quoth hereward as he cantered off  you said he to his men draw round hither to the left and when i drive the frenchmen to the right make a run for it and get between them and the castle gate and we will try the danish axe against their horses legs  then hereward spurred his horse shouting a bear a bear and dashed into the press and therein did mightily like any turpin or roland till he saw lie on the ground close to the castle gate one of the châtelains knights with four guisnes knights around him then at those knights he rode and slew them every one and mounted that wounded knight on his own horse and led him across the field though the archers shot sore at him from the wall and when the press of knights rode at him his danish men got between them and the castle and made a stand to cover him then the guisnes knights rode at them scornfully crying  what footpad churls have we here who fancy they can face horsed knights  but they did not know the stuff of the danish men who all shouted a bear a bear and turned the lances points with their targets and hewed off the horses heads and would have hewed off the riders likewise crying that the bear must be fed had not hereward bidden them give quarter according to the civilized fashion of france and flanders whereon all the knights who were not taken rode right and left and let them pass through in peace with several prisoners and him whom hereward had rescued  at which little arnulf was as proud as if he had done it himself and the châtelain sent word to baldwin that the newcomer was a prudhomme of no common merit while the heart of the count of guisnes became as water and his knights both those who were captives and those who were not complained indignantly of the unchivalrous trick of the daneshow villanous for men on foot not only to face knights but to bring them down to their own standing ground by basely cutting off their horses heads  to which hereward answered that he knew the rules of chivalry as well as any of them but he was hired not to joust at a tournament but to make the count of guisnes pay his lord baldwin and make him pay he would  the next day he bade his men sit still and look on and leave him to himself and when the usual monomachy began he singled out the burliest and boldest knight whom he saw rode up to him lance point in air and courteously asked him to come and be killed in fair fight the knight being says the chronicler magnificent in valor of soul and counsel of war and held to be as a lion in fortitude throughout the army and seeing that hereward was by no means a large or heavy man replied as courteously that he should have great pleasure in trying to kill hereward on which they rode some hundred yards out of the press calling out that they were to be left alone by both sides for it was an honorable duel and turning their horses charged  after which act they found themselves and their horses all four in a row sitting on their hindquarters on the ground amid the fragments of their lances  well ridden shouted they both at once as they leaped up laughing and drew their swords  after which they hammered away at each other merrily in the devils smithy the sparks flew and the iron rang and all men stood still to see that gallant fight  so they watched and cheered till hereward struck his man such a blow under the ear that he dropped and lay like a log  i think i can carry you quoth hereward and picking him up he threw him over his shoulder and walked toward his men  a bear a bear shouted they in delight laughing at the likeness between herewards attitude and that of a bear waddling off on his hind legs with his prey in his arms  he should have killed his bullock outright before he went to carry him look there  and the knight awaking from his swoon struggled violently says leofric to escape  but hereward though the smaller was the stronger man and crushing him in his arms walked on steadily  knights to the rescue hoibricht is taken shouted they of guisnes galloping towards him  a bear a bear to me biornssons to me vikings all shouted hereward and the danes leapt up and ran toward him axe in hand  the châtelains knights rode up likewise and so it befell that hereward carried his prisoner safe into camp  and who are you gallant knight asked he of his prisoner  hoibricht nephew of eustace count of guisnes  so i suppose you will be ransomed till thenarmorer  and the hapless hoibricht found himself chained and fettered and sent off to herewards tent under the custody of martin lightfoot  the next day says the chronicler the count of guisnes stupefied with grief at the loss of his nephew sent the due honor and service to his prince besides gifts and hostages  and so ended the troubles of baldwin and eustace of guisnes     chapter viii  how a fair lady exercised the mechanical art to win herewards love   the fair torfrida sat in an upper room of her mothers house in st omer alternately looking out of the window and at a book of mechanics in the garden outside the wryneck as is his fashion in may was calling pipipi among the gooseberry bushes till the cobwalls rang again in the book was a latin recipe for drying the poor wryneck and using him as a philtre which should compel the love of any person desired mechanics it must be understood in those days were considered as identical with mathematics and those again with astrology and magic so that the old chronicler who says that torfrida was skilled in the mechanic art uses the word in the same sense as does the author of the history of ramsey who tells us how a certain holy bishop of st dunstans party riding down to corfe through the forest saw the wicked queenmother elfrida her who had st edward stabbed at corfe gate exercising her mechanic art under a great tree in plain english performing heathen incantations and how when she saw that she was discovered she tempted him to deadly sin but when she found him proof against allurement she had him into her bower and there the enchantress and her ladies slew him by thrusting redhot bodkins under his arms so that the blessed man was martyred without any sign of wound of all which let every man believe as much as he list  torfrida had had peculiar opportunities of learning mechanics the fairest and richest damsel in st omer she had been left early by her father an orphan to the care of a superstitious mother and of a learned uncle the abbot of st bertin her mother was a provençale one of those arlesiennes whose dark greek beauty still shines like diamonds set in jet in the doorways of the quaint old city gay enough in her youth she had like a true southern woman taken to superstition in her old age and spent her days in the churches leaving torfrida to do and learn what she would her nurse moreover was a lapp woman carried off in some pirating foray and skilled in all the sorceries for which the lapps were famed throughout the north her uncle partly from goodnature partly from a pious hope that she might enter religion and leave her wealth to the church had made her his pupil and taught her the mysteries of books and she had proved to be a strangely apt scholar grammar rhetoric latin prose and poetry such as were taught in those days she mastered ere she was grown up then she fell upon romance and charlemagne and his paladins the heroes of troy alexander and his generals peopled her imagination she had heard too of the great necromancer virgilius for into such the middle age transformed the poet and her fancy already excited by her lapp nurses occult science she began eagerly to court forbidden lore  forbidden indeed magic was by the church in public but as a reality not as an imposture those whose consciences were tough and their faith weak had little scruple in applying to a witch and asking help from the powers below when the saints above were slack to hear them churchmen even were bold enough to learn the mysteries of nature algebra judicial astrology and the occult powers of herbs stones and animals from the mussulman doctors of cordova and seville and like pope gerbert mingle science and magic in a fashion excusable enough in days when true inductive science did not exist  nature had her miraculous powershow far good how far evil who could tell the belief that god was the sole maker and ruler of the universe was confused and darkened by the crossbelief that the material world had fallen under the dominion of satan and his demons that millions of spirits good and evil in every degree exercised continually powers over crops and cattle mines and wells storms and lightning health and disease riches honors and royalties too were under the command of the powers of darkness for that generation which was but too apt to take its bible in hand upside down had somehow a firm faith in the word of the devil and believed devoutly his somewhat startling assertion that the kingdoms of the world were his and the glory of them for to him they were delivered and to whomsoever he would he gave them while it had a proportionally weak faith in our lords answer that they were to worship and serve the lord god alone how far these powers extended how far they might be counteracted how far lawfully employed were questions which exercised the minds of men and produced a voluminous literature for several centuries till the search died out for very weariness of failure at the end of the seventeenth century  the abbot of st bertin therefore did not hesitate to keep in his private library more than one volume which he would not have willingly lent to the simple monks under his charge nor to torfrida either had she not acquired so complete a command over the good old man that he could deny her nothing  so she read of gerbert pope silvester ii who had died only a generation back how to quote william of malmesbury he learned at seville till he surpassed ptolemy with the astrolabe alcandrus in astronomy and julius firmicus in judicial astrology how he learned what the singing and flight of birds portended and acquired the art of calling up spirits from hell and in short whateverhurtful or healthfulhuman curiosity had discovered besides the lawful sciences of arithmetic and astronomy music and geometry how he acquired from the saracens the abacus a counting table how he escaped from the moslem magician his tutor by making a compact with the foul fiend and putting himself beyond the power of magic by hanging himself under a wooden bridge so as to touch neither earth nor water how he taught robert king of france and otto the kaiser how he made an hydraulic organ which played tunes by steam which stood even then in the cathedral of rheims how he discovered in the campus martius at rome wondrous treasures and a golden king and queen golden courtiers and guards all lighted by a single carbuncle and guarded by a boy with a bent bow who when gerberts servant stole a golden knife shot an arrow at that carbuncle and all was darkness and yells of demons  all this torfrida had read and read too how gerberts brazen head had told him that he should be pope and not die till he had sung mass at jerusalem and how both had come truethe latter in mockery for he was stricken with deadly sickness in rome as he sang mass at the church called jerusalem and died horribly tearing himself in pieces  which terrible warning had as little effect on torfrida as other terrible warnings have on young folk who are minded to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil  so torfrida beguiled her lonely life in that dull town looking out over dreary flats and muddy dikes by a whole dreamworld of fantastic imaginations and was ripe and ready for any wild deed which her wild brain might suggest  pure she was all the while generous and noblehearted and with a deep and sincere longingas one soul in ten thousand hasafter knowledge for its own sake but ambitious exceedingly and that not of monastic sanctity she laughed to scorn the notion of a nunnery and laughed to scorn equally the notion of marrying any knight however much of a prudhomme whom she had yet seen her uncle and marquis baldwin could have between them compelled her as an orphan heiress to marry whom they liked but torfrida had as yet bullied the abbot and coaxed the count successfully lances had been splintered helmets split and more than one life lost in her honor but she had only as the best safeguard she could devise given some hint of encouragement to one ascelin a tall knight of st valeri the most renowned bully of those parts by bestowing on him a scrap of ribbon and bidding him keep it against all comers by this means she insured the personal chastisement of all other youths who dared to lift their eyes to her while she by no means bound herself to her spadassin of st valeri it was all very brutal but so was the time and what better could a poor lady do in days when no mans life or womans honor was safe unlessas too many were forced to doshe retired into a cloister and got from the church that peace which this world certainly could not give and happily dared not take away  the arrival of hereward and his men had of course stirred the great current of her life and indeed that of st omer usually as stagnant as that of the dikes round its wall who the unknown champion wasfor his name of naemansson showed that he was concealing something at leastwhence he had come and what had been his previous exploits busied all the gossips of the town would he and his men rise and plunder the abbey was not the châtelain mad in leaving young arnulf with him all day madder still in taking him out to battle against the count of guisnes he might be a spythe avantcourrier of some great invading force he was come to spy out the nakedness of the land and would shortly vanish to return with harold hardraade of norway or sweyn of denmark and all their hosts nay was he not harold hardraade himself in disguise and so forth all which torfrida heard and thought within herself that be he who he might she should like to look on him again  then came the news how the very first day that he had gone out against the count of guisnes he had gallantly rescued a wounded man a day or two after came fresh news of some doughty deed and then another and another and when hereward returned after a weeks victorious fighting all st omer was in the street to stare at him  then torfrida heard enough and had it been possible more than enough of hereward and his prowess  and when they came riding in the great marquis at the head of them all with robert le frison on one side of him and on the other hereward looking as fresh as flowers in may she looked down on him out of her little lattice in the gable and loved him once and for all with all her heart and soul  and hereward looked up at her and her dark blue eyes and dark raven locks and thought her the fairest thing that he had ever seen and asked who she might be and heard and as he heard he forgot all about the sultans daughter and the princess of constantinople and the fairy of brocheliaunde and all the other pretty birds which were still in the bush about the wide world and thought for many a day of naught but the pretty bird which he heldso conceited was he of his own powers of winning herthere safe in hand in st omer  so he cast about to see her and to win her love and she cast about to see him and win his love but neither saw the other for a while and it might have been better for one of them had they never seen the other again  if torfrida could have foreseen and foreseen and foreseenwhy if she were true woman she would have done exactly what she did and taken the bitter with the sweet the unknown with the known as we all must do in life unless we wish to live and die alone     chapter ix  how hereward went to the war in scaldmariland   it has been shown how the count of guisnes had been a thorn in the side of baldwin of lille and how that thorn was drawn out by hereward but a far sharper thorn in his side and one which had troubled many a count before and was destined to trouble others afterward was those unruly hollanders or frisians who dwelt in scaldmariland the land of the meres of the scheldt beyond the vast forests of flanders in morasses and alluvial islands whose names it is impossible now to verify so much has the land changed both by inundations and by embankments by the brute forces of nature and the noble triumphs of art dwelt a folk poor savage living mostly as in caesars time in huts raised above the sea on piles or mounds of earth often without cattle or seedfield half savage half heathen but free free with the divine instinct of freedom and all the selfhelp and energy which spring thereout  they were a mongrel race and as most mongrel races are when sprung from parents not too far apart in blood a strong race the remnant of those old frisians and batavians who had defied and all but successfully resisted the power of rome mingled with fresh crosses of teutonic blood from frank sueve saxon and the other german tribes who after the fall of the roman empire had swept across the land  their able modern historian has well likened the struggle between civilis and the romans to that between william the silent and the spaniard it was without doubt the foreshadow of their whole history they were distinguished above most european races for sturdy independence and what generally accompanies it sturdy common sense they could not understand why they should obey foreign frank rulers whether set over them by dagobert or by charlemagne they could not understand why they were to pay tithes to foreign frank priests who had forced on them at the swords point a religion which they only half believed and only half understood many a truly holy man preached to them to the best of his powers but the cross of st boniface had too often to follow the sword of charles martel and for every frisian who was converted another was killed  free frisians nevertheless they remained at least in name and in their statutebook as long as the wind blows out of the clouds and the world stands the feudal system never took root in their soil footnote motley rise of the dutch republic  if a frank count was to govern them he must govern according to their own laws again and again they rebelled even against that seemingly light rule again and again they brought down on themselves the wrath of their nominal sovereigns the counts of flanders then of the kaisers of germany and in the thirteenth century of the inquisition itself then a crusade was preached against them as stadings heretics who paid no tithes illused monks and nuns and worshipped or were said to worship a black cat and the foul fiend among the meres and fens conrad of marpurg the brutal director of st elizabeth of hungary burnt them at his wicked will extirpating it may be heresy but not the spirit of the race that crushed down and seemingly enslaved during the middle age under count dirk and his descendants still lived destined at last to conquer they were a people who had determined to see for themselves and act for themselves in the universe in which they found themselves and moreover a necessary corollary of such a resolution to fight to the death against any one who interfered with them in so doing  again and again therefore the indomitable spirit rose founding free towns with charters and guilds embanking the streams draining the meres fighting each other and the neighboring princes till in their last great struggle against the pope and spain they rose once and for all     heated hot with burning fears     and bathed in baths of hissing tears     and battered with the strokes of doom         to shape and use  as the great protestant dutch republic  a noble errand it had been for such a man as hereward to help those men toward freedom instead of helping frank counts to enslave themmen of his own blood with laws and customs like those of his own anglodanes living in a land so exactly like his own that every mere and fen and wood reminded him of the scenes of his boyhood the very names of the two lands were alikeholland the hollow landthe one of england the other of flanders  but all this was hidden from hereward to do as he would be done by was a lesson which he had never been taught if men had invaded his land he would have cried like the frisians whom he was going to enslave i am free as long as the wind blows out of the clouds and died where he stood but that was not the least reason why he should not invade any other mans land and try whether or not he too would die where he stood to him these frieslanders were simply savages probably heathens who would not obey their lawful lord who was a gentleman and a christian besides renown and possibly a little plunder might be got by beating them into obedience he knew not what he did and knew not likewise that as he had done to others so would it be done to him  baldwin had at that time made over his troublesome hollanders to his younger son robert the viking whom little arnulf longed to imitate  florent count of holland and vassal of the great marquis had just died leaving a pretty young widow to whom the hollanders had no mind to pay one stiver more than they were forced all the isles of zeeland and the counties of eonham and alost were doing that which was right in the sight of their own eyes and finding themselves none the worse thereforthough the countess gertrude doubtless could buy fewer silks of greece or gems of italy but to such a distressed lady a champion could not long be wanting and robert after having been driven out of spain by the moors with fearful loss and in a second attempt wrecked with all his fleet as soon as he got out of port resolved to tempt the main no more and leave the swans path for that of the fat oxen and black drayhorses of holland  so he rushed to avenge the wrongs of the countess gertrude and his father whose goodnatured good sense foresaw that the fiery robert would raise storms upon his pathhappily for his old age he did not foresee the worstlet him go with his blessing  so robert gathered to him valiant ruffians as many as he could find and when he heard of the viking who had brought eustace of guisnes to reason it seemed to him that he was a man who would do his work so when the great marquis came down to st omer to receive the homage of count eustace of guisnes robert came thither too and saw hereward  you have done us good service harold naemansson as it pleases you to be called said baldwin smiling but some mans son you are if ever i saw a gallant knight earlborn by his looks as well as his deeds  hereward bowed  and for me said robert naemansson or earls son here is my vikings welcome to all vikings like myself and he held out his hand  hereward took it  you failed in galicia beausire only because your foes were a hundred to one you will not fail where you are going if as i hear they are but ten to one  robert laughed vain and gratified  then you know where i have been and where i am going  why not as you know well we vikings are all brothers and all know each others counsel from ship to ship and port to port  then the two young men looked each other in the face and each saw that the other was a man who would suit him  skall to the viking cried robert aping as was his fancy the norse rovers slang will you come with me to holland  you must ask my young lord there and he pointed to arnulf i am his man now by all laws of honor  a flush of jealousy passed over roberts face he haplessly for himself thought that he had a grievance  the rights of primogenituredroits dainessewere not respected in the family of the baldwins as they should have been had prudence and common sense had their way  no sacred or divine right is conferred by the fact of a mans being the firstborn son if scripture be scripture the lords anointed was usually rather a younger son of talent and virtue one born not according to the flesh but according to the spirit like david and solomon and so it was in other realms besides flanders during the middle age the father handed on the workfor ruling was hard work in those daysto the son most able to do it therefore we can believe lambert of aschaffenbourg when he says that in count baldwins family for many ages he who pleased his father most took his fathers name and was hereditary prince of all flanders while the other brothers led an inglorious life of vassalage to him  but we can conceive likewise that such a method would give rise to intrigues envyings calumnies murders fratracidal civil wars and all the train of miseries which for some years after this history made infamous the house of baldwin as they did many another noble house till they were stopped by the gradual adoption of the rational rule of primogeniture  so robert who might have been a daring and useful friend to his brother had he been forced to take for granted from birth that he was nobody and his brother everybodyas do all younger sons of english noblemen to their infinite benefitheld himself to be an injured man for life because his father called his firstborn baldwin and promised him the successionwhich indeed he had worthily deserved according to the laws of mammon and this world by bringing into the family such an heiress as richilda and such a dowry as mons  but robert who thought himself as good as his brotherthough he was not such save in valornursed black envy in his heart hard it was to him to hear his elder brother called baldwin of mons when he himself had not a foot of land of his own harder still to hear him called baldwin the good when he felt in himself no title whatsoever to that epithet hardest of all to see a beautiful boy grow up as heir both of flanders and of hainault  had he foreseen whither that envy would have led him had he foreseen the hideous and fratracidal day of february 22d 1071 and that fair boys golden locks rolling in dust and bloodthe wild viking would have crushed the growing snake within his bosom for he was a knight and a gentleman but it was hidden from his eyes he had to dree his weirdto commit great sins do great deeds and die in his bed mighty and honored having children to his hearts desire and leaving the rest of his substance to his babes heaven help him and the like of him  but he turned to young arnulf  give me your man boy  arnulf pouted he wanted to keep his viking for himself and said so  he is to teach me to go leding as the norsemen call it like you  robert laughed a hint at his piratical attempts pleased his vanity all the more because they had been signal failures  lend him me then my pretty nephew for a month or two till he has conquered these friesland frogs for me and then if thou wilt go leding with him  i hope you may never come back thought robert to himself but he did not say it  let the knight go quoth baldwin  let me go with him then  no by all saints i cannot have thee poked through with a friesland pike or rotted with a friesland ague  arnulf pouted still  abbot what hast thou been at with the boy he thinks of naught but blood and wounds instead of books and prayers  he is gone mad after thisthis knight  the abbot said hereward knows by hearing of his ears that i bid him bide at home and try to govern lands in peace like his father and you sir marquis  eh  the abbot told honestly what had passed between hereward and the lad as they rode to st bertin  baldwin was silent thinking and smiling jollily as was the wont of the debonair  you are a man of sense beausire come with me said he at last  and he hereward and robert went into an inner room  sit down on the settle by me  it is too great an honor  nonsense man if i be who i am i know enough of men to know that i need not be ashamed of having you as benchfellow sit down  hereward obeyed of course  tell me who you are  hereward looked out of the corner of his eyes smiling and perplexed  tell me and robert who you are man and be done with it i believe i know already i have asked far and wide of chapmen and merchants and wandering knights and pirate rascalslike yourself  and you found that i was a pirate rascal  i found a pirate rascal who met you in ireland three years since and will swear that if you have one gray eye and one blue  as he has quoth robert  that i am a wolfs head and a robber of priests and an esau on the face of the earth every mans hand against me and minefor i never take but what i giveagainst every man  that you are the son of my old friend leofric of chester and the hottesthearted shrewdestheaded hardesthanded berserker in the north seas you killed gilbert of ghents bear siward digres cousin dont deny it  dont hang me or send me to the westminster miracleworker to be hanged and i will confess  i every man is welcome who comes hither with a bold hand and a strong heart the refuge for the destitute they call flanders i suppose because i am too goodnatured to turn rogues out so do no harm to mine and mine shall do no harm to you  baldwins words were true he found houseroom for everybody helped everybody against everybody else as will be seen and yet quarrelled with nobodyat least in his old ageby the mere virtue of good naturewhich blessed is the man who possesseth  so hereward went off to exterminate the wicked hollanders and avenge the wrongs of the countess gertrude     chapter x  how hereward won the magic armor   torfrida had special opportunities of hearing about hereward for young arnulf was to her a pet and almost a fosterbrother and gladly escaped from the convent to tell her the news  he had now had his first taste of the royal game of war he had seen hereward fight by day and heard him tell stories over the campfire by night herewards beauty herewards prowess herewards songs herewards strange adventures and wanderings were forever in the young boys mouth and he spent hours in helping torfrida to guess who the great unknown might be and then went back to hereward and artlessly told him of his beautiful friend and how they had talked of him and of nothing else and in a week or two hereward knew all about torfrida and torfrida knewwhat filled her heart with joythat hereward was bound to no ladylove and owned so he had told arnulf no mistress save the sword on his thigh  whereby there had grown up in the hearts of both the man and the maid a curiosity which easily became the parent of love  but when baldwin the great marquis came to st omer to receive the homage of eustace of guisnes young arnulf had run into torfridas chamber in great anxiety would his grandfather approve of what he had done would he allow his new friendship with the unknown  what care i said torfrida but if your friend wishes to have the marquiss favor he would be wise to trust him at least so far as to tell his name  i have told him so i have told him that you would tell him so  i have you been talking to him about me  why not  that is not well done arnulf to talk of ladies to men whom they do not know  arnulf looked up puzzled and pained for she spoke haughtily  i know naught of your new friend he may be a lowborn man for anything that i can tell  he is not he is as noble as i am everything he says and doesevery lookshows it  you are youngas you have shown by talking of me to him but i have given you my advice and she moved languidly away let him tell your grandfather who he is or remain suspected  the boy went away sadly  early the next morning he burst into torfridas room as she was dressing her hair  how now are these manners for the heir of flanders  he has told all  he has and she started and dropt her comb  pick up that comb girl you need not go away i have no secrets with young gentlemen  i thought you would be glad to hear  i what can i want in the matter save that your grandfather should be satisfied that you are entertaining a man worthy to be your guest  and he is worthy he has told my grandfather who he is  but not you  no they say i must not know yet but this i know that they welcomed him when he told them as if he had been an earls son and that he is going with my uncle robert against the frieslanders  and if he be an earls son how comes he here wandering with rough seamen and hiding his honest name he must have done something of which he is ashamed  i shall tell you nothing said arnulf pouting  what care i i can find out by art magic if i like  i dont believe all that can you find out for instance what he has on his throat  a beard  but what is under that beard  a gôitre  you are laughing at me  of course i am as i shall at any one who challenges me to find out anything so silly and so unfit  i shall go  go then for she knew very well that he would come back again  nurse said torfrida to the old lapp woman when they were alone find out for me what is the name of this strange champion and what he has beneath his beard  beneath his beard  some scar i suppose or secret mark i must know you will find out for your torfrida will you not nurse  i will make a charm that will bring him to you were all the icebergs of quenland between you and him and then you can see for yourself  no no no not yet nurse and torfrida smiled only find me out that one thing that i must know  and yet why she wanted to know she could not tell herself  the old woman came back to her ere she went to bed  i have found it out all and more i know where to get scarlet toadstools and i put the juice in his mens ale they are laughing and roaring now merrymad every one of them  but not he  no no he is with the marquis but in madness comes out truth and that long hooknosed bodyvarlet of his has told us all  and she told torfrida who hereward was and the secret mark  there is a cross upon his throat beneath his chin pricked in after their english fashion  torfrida started  thenthen the spell will not work upon him the holy cross will turn it off  it must be a great cross and a holy one that will turn off my charms said the old hag with a sneer whatever it may do against yours but on the back of his handthat will be a mark to know him bythere is pricked a beara white bear that he slew and she told the story of the fairy bear which torfrida duly stored up in her heart  so he has the cross on his throat thought torfrida to herself well if it keep off my charm it will keep off others that is one comfort and one knows not what fairies or witches or evil creatures he may meet with in the forests and the fens  the discovery of herewards rank did not doubtless lessen torfridas fancy for him she was ambitious enough and proud enough of her own lineage to be full glad that her heart had strayed awayas it must needs stray somewhereto the son of the third greatest man in england as for his being an outlaw that mattered little he might be inlawed and rich and powerful any day in those uncertain topsyturvy times and for the present his being a wolfs head only made him the more interesting to her women like to pity their lovers sometimesmay all good beings reward them for itthey love merely because they pity and torfrida found it pleasant to pity the insolent young coxcomb who certainly never dreamed of pitying himself  when hereward went home that night he found the abbey of st bertin in horrible confusion his men were grouped outside the gate chattering like monkeys the porter and the monks from inside entreating them vainly to come in and go to bed quietly  but they would not they vowed and swore that a great gulf had opened all down the road and that one step more would tumble them in headlong they manifested the most affectionate solicitude for the monks warning them on their lives not to step across the threshold or they would be swallowed as martin who was the maddest of the lot phrased it with korah dathan and abiram in vain hereward stormed assured them that the supposed abyss was nothing but the gutter proved the fact by kicking martin over it the men determined to believe their own eyes and after a while fell asleep in heaps in the roadside and lay there till morning when they woke declaring as did the monks that they had been all bewitched they knew notand happily the lower orders both in england and on the continent do not yet knowthe potent virtues of that strange fungus with which lapps and samoiedes have it is said practised wonders for centuries past  the worst of the matter was that martin lightfoot who had drank most of the poison and had always been dreamy and uncanny in spite of his shrewdness and humor had from that day forward something very like a bee in his bonnet  but before count robert and hereward could collect sufficient troops for the invasion of holland another chance of being slain in fight arose too tempting to be overlooked namely the annual tournament at pont de larche above rouen where all the noblest knights of normandy would assemble to win their honor and ladies love by hewing at each others sinful bodies thither too the best knights of flanders must needs go and with them hereward though no knight he was allowed in flanders as he had been in scotland to take his place among that honorable company for though he still refused the honor of knighthood on the ground that he had as yet done no deed deserving thereof he was held to have deserved it again and again and all the more from his modesty in declining it  so away they all went to pont de larche a right gallant meinie and torfrida watched them go from the lattice window  and when they had passed down the street tramping and jingling and caracoling young arnulf ran into the house with eyes full of tears because he was not allowed to go likewise and with a message for torfrida from no other than hereward  i was to tell you this and no more that if he meets your favor in the field he that wears it will have hard work to keep it  torfrida turned pale as ashes first with wild delight and then with wild fear  hadoes he know whosir ascelin  he knows well enough why not every one knows are you afraid that he is not a match for that great bullock  afraid who said i was afraid sir ascelin is no bullock either but a courteous and gallant knight  you are as pale as death and so  never mind what i am said she putting her hands over his eyes and kissing him again and again as a vent for her joy  the next few days seemed years for length but she could wait she was sure of him now she needed no charms perhaps thought she as she looked in the glass i was my own charm and indeed she had every fair right to say so  at last news came  she was sitting over her books her mother as usual was praying in the churches when the old lapp nurse came in a knight was at the door his name he said was siward the white and he came from hereward  from hereward he was at least alive he might be wounded though and she rushed out of the chamber into the hall looking never more beautiful her color heightened by the quick beating of her heart her dark hair worn loose and long after the fashion of those days streaming around her and behind her  a handsome young man stood in the doorway armed from head to foot  you are siward herewards nephew  he bowed assent she took him by the hands and after the fashion of those days kissed him on the small space on either cheek which was left bare between the nosepiece and the chainmail  you are welcome hereward isis alive  alive and gay and all the more gay at being able to send to the lady torfrida by me something which was once hers and now is hers once more  and he drew from his bosom the ribbon of the knight of st valeri  she almost snatched it from his hand in her delight at recovering her favor  howwheredid he get this  he saw it in the thick of the tournament on the helm of a knight who he knew had vowed to maim him or take his life and wishing to give him a chance of fulfilling his vow rode him down horse and man the knights norman friends attacked us in force and we flemings with hereward at our head beat them off and overthrew so many that we are almost all horsed at the normans expense three more knights with their horses fell before herewards lance  and what of this favor  he sends it to its owner let her say what shall be done with it  torfrida was on the point of saying he has won it let him wear it for my sake but she paused she longed to see hereward face to face to speak to him if but one word if she allowed him to wear the favor she must at least have the pleasure of giving it with her own hands and she paused  and he is killed  who hereward  sir ascelin  only bruised but he shall be killed if you will  god forbid  then said siward mistaking her meaning all i have to tell hereward is it seems that he has wasted his blow he will return therefore to the knight of st valeri his horse and if the lady torfrida chooses the favor which he has taken by mistake from its rightful owner and he set his teeth and could not prevent stamping on the ground in evident passion there was a tone too of deep disappointment in his voice which made torfrida look keenly at him why should herewards nephew feel so deeply about that favor and as she lookedcould that man be the youth siward young he was but surely thirty years old at least his face could hardly be seen hidden by helmet and nosepiece above and mailed up to the mouth below but his long mustache was that of a grown man his vast breadth of shoulder his hard hand his sturdy limbsthese surely belonged not to the slim youth whom she had seen from her lattice riding at herewards side and as she looked she saw upon his hand the bear of which her nurse had told her  you are deceiving me and she turned first deadly pale and then crimson youyou are hereward himself  i pardon me my lady ten minutes ago i should have been glad enough to have been hereward now i am thankful enough that i am only siward and not hereward who wins for himself contempt by overthrowing a knight more fortunate than he and he bowed and turned away to go  hereward hereward and in her passion she seized him by both his hands i know you i know that device upon your hand at last at last my heromy idol how i have longed for this moment how i have toiled for it and not in vain good heavens what am i saying and she tried in her turn to escape from herewards mailed arms  then you do not care for that man  for him here take my favor wear it before all the world and guard it as you only can and let them all know that torfrida is your love  and with hands trembling with passion she bound the ribbon round his helm  yes i am hereward he almost shouted the berserker the brainhewer the landthief the seathief the feeder of wolf and ravenaoi ere my beard was grown i was a match for giants how much more now that i am a man whom ladies love many a champion has quailed before my very glance how much more now that i wear torfridas gift aoi  torfrida had often heard that wild battlecry of aoi of which the early minstrels were so fondwith which the great poet who wrote the song of roland ends every paragraph which has now fallen displaced by our modern hurrah to be merely a sailors call or hunters cry but she shuddered as she heard it close to her ears and saw from the flashing eye and dilated nostril the temper of the man on whom she had thrown herself so utterly she laid her hand upon his lips  silence silence for pitys sake remember that you are in a maidens house and think of her good fame  hereward collected himself instantly and then holding her at arms length gazed upon her i was mad a moment but is it not enough to make me mad to look at you  do not look at me so i cannot bear it said she hanging down her head you forget that i am a poor weak girl  ah we are rough wooers we searovers we cannot pay glozing french compliments like your knights here who fawn on a damsel with soft words in the hall and will kiss the dust off their queens feet and die for a hair of their goddesss eyebrow and then if they catch her in the forest show themselves as very ruffians as if they were paynim moors we are rough lady we english but those who trust us find us true  and i can trust you she asked still trembling  on gods cross there round your neck and he took her crucifix and kissed it you only i love you only i will love and you will i love in all honesty before the angels of heaven till we be wedded man and wife who but a fool would soil the flower which he means to wear before all the world  i knew hereward was noble i knew i had not trusted him in vain  i kept faith and honor with the princess of cornwall when i had her at my will and shall i not keep faith and honor with you  the princess of cornwall asked torfrida  do not be jealous fair queen i brought her safe to her betrothed and wedded she is long ago i will tell you that story some day and nowi must go  not yet not yet i have something toto show you  she motioned him to go up the narrow stairs or rather ladder which led to the upper floor and then led him into her chamber  a ladys chamber was then in days when privacy was little cared for her usual reception room and the bed which stood in an alcove was the common seat of her and her guests but torfrida did not ask him to sit down she led the way onward towards a door beyond  hereward followed glancing with awe at the books parchments and strange instruments which lay on the table and the floor  the old lapp nurse sat in the window sewing busily she looked up and smiled meaningly but as she saw torfrida unlock the further door with one of the keys which hung at her girdle she croaked out  too fast too fast trust lightly and repent heavily  trust once and for all or never trust at all said torfrida as she opened the door  hereward saw within rich dresses hung on perches round the wall and chests barred and padlocked  these are treasures said she which many a knight and nobleman has coveted by cunning by flattery by threats of force even have they tried to win what lies hereand torfrida herself too for the sake of her wealth but thanks to the abbot my uncle torfrida is still her own mistress and mistress of the wealth which her forefathers won by sea and land far away in the east all here is mineand if you be but true to me all mine is yours lift the lid for me it is too heavy for my arms  hereward did so and saw within golden cups and bracelets horns of ivory and silver bags of coin and among them a mail shirt and helmet on which he fixed at once silent and greedy eyes  she looked at his face askance and smiled yes these are more to herewards taste than gold and jewels and he shall have them he shall have them as a proof that if torfrida has set her love upon a worthy knight she is at least worthy of him and does not demand without being able to give in return  and she took out the armor and held it up to him  this is the work of dwarfs or enchanters this was not forged by mortal man it must have come out of some old cavern or dragons hoard said hereward in astonishment at the extreme delicacy and slightness of the mailrings and the richness of the gold and silver with which both hauberk and helm were inlaid  enchanted it is they say but its maker who can tell my ancestor won it and by the side of charles martel listen and i will tell you how  you have heard of fair provence where i spent my youth the land of the sunny south the land of the fig and the olive the mulberry and the rose the tulip and the anemone and all rich fruits and fair flowersthe land where every city is piled with temples and theatres and towers as high as heaven which the old romans built with their enchantments and tormented the blessed martyrs therein  heavens how beautiful you are cried hereward as her voice shaped itself into a song and her eyes flashed at the remembrance of her southern home  torfrida was not altogether angry at finding that he was thinking of her and not of her words  peace and listen you know how the paynim held that landthe saracens to whom mahound taught all the wisdom of solomonas they teach us in turn she added in a lower voice  and how charles and his paladins charles martel and charlemagne were perpetually confounded in the legends of the time drove them out and conquered the country again for god and his mother  i have heard but he did not take his eyes off her face  they were in the theatre at arles the saracens where the blessed martyr st trophimus had died in torments they had set up there their idol of mahound and turned the place into a fortress charles burnt it over their heads you seei have seenthe blackened walls the bloodstained marbles to this day then they fled into the plain and there they turned and fought under montmajeur by the hermits cell they fought a summers day till they were all slain there was an emir among them black as a raven clad in magic armor all lances turned from it all swords shivered on it he rode through the press without a wound while every stroke of his scymitar shore off a head of horse or man charles himself rode at him and smote him with his hammer they heard the blow in avignon full thirty miles away the flame flashed out from the magic armor a fathoms length blinding all around and when they recovered their sight the enchanter was far away in the battle killing as he went  then charles cried who will stop that devil whom no steel can wound help us o blessed martyr st trophimus and save the soldiers of the cross from shame  then cried torfrid my forefather what use in crying to st trophimus he could not help himself when the paynim burnt him and how can he help us a tough arm is worth a score of martyrs here  and he rode at that emir and gript him in his arms they both fell and rolled together on the ground but torfrid never loosed his hold till he had crushed out his unbaptized soul and sent it to join mahound in hell  then he took his armor and brought it home in triumph but after a while he fell sick of a fever and the blessed st trophimus appeared to him and told him that it was a punishment for his blasphemy in the battle so he repented and vowed to serve the saint all his life on which he was healed instantly and fell to religion and went back to montmajeur and there he was a hermit in the cave under the rock and tended the graves hewn in the living stone where his old comrades the paladins who were slain sleep side by side round the church of the holy cross but the armor he left here and he laid a curse upon it that whosoever of his descendants should lose that armor in fight should die childless without a son to wield a sword and therefore it is that none of his ancestors valiant as they have been have dared to put this harness on their backs  and so ended a story which torfrida believed utterly and hereward likewise  and now hereward mine dare you wear that magic armor and face old torfrids curse  what dare i not  think if you lose it in you your race must end  let it end i accept the curse  and he put the armor on  but he trembled as he did it atheism and superstition go too often hand in hand and godless as he was sceptical of providence itself and much more of the help of saint or angel still the curse of the old warrior like the malice of a witch or a demon was to him a thing possible probable and formidable  she looked at him in pride and exultation  it is yoursthe invulnerable harness wear it in the forefront of the battle and if weapon wound you through it may i as punishment for my lie suffer the same upon my tender bodya wound for every wound of yours my knight footnote volo enim in meo tale quid nunc perpeti corpore semel quicquid eas ferrei vel e metallo excederet  and after that they sat side by side and talked of love with all honor and honesty never heeding the old hag who crooned to herself in her barbarian tongue     quick thaw long frost     quick joy long pain     soon found soon lost     you will take your gift again     chapter xi  how the hollanders took hereward for a magician   of this weary holland war which dragged itself on campaign after campaign for several years what need to tell there was doubtless the due amount of murder plunder burning and worse and the final event was certain from the beginning it was a struggle between civilized and disciplined men armed to the teeth well furnished with ships and military engines against poor simple folk in felt coats stiffened with tar or turpentine or in very short jackets of hide says the chronicler who fought by threes two with a crooked lance and three darts each and between them a man with a sword or an axe who held his shield before those twoa very great multitude but in composition utterly undisciplined who came down to the seacoast with carts and wagons to carry off the spoils of the flemings and bade them all surrender at discretion and go home again after giving up count robert and hereward with the tribunes of the brigades to be put to death as valiant south sea islanders might have done and then found themselves as sheep to the slaughter before the cunning hereward whom they esteemed a magician on account of his craft and his invulnerable armor  so at least says leofrics paraphrast who tells long confused stories of battles and campaigns some of them without due regard to chronology for it is certain that the brave frisians could not on roberts first landing have feared lest they should be conquered by foreigners as they had heard the english were by the french because that event had not then happened  and so much for the war among the meres of scheldt     chapter xii  how hereward turned berserk   torfridas heart misgave her that first night as to the effects of her exceeding frankness her pride in the first place was somewhat wounded she had dreamed of a knight who would worship her as his queen hang on her smile die at her frown and she had meant to bring hereward to her feet as such a slave in boundless gratitude but had he not rather held his own and brought her to his feet by assuming her devotion as his right and if he assumed that how far could she trust him not to abuse his claim was he quite as perfect seen close as seen afar off and now that the intoxication of that meeting had passed off she began to remember more than one little fault which she would have gladly seen mended certain roughnesses of manner which contrasted unfavorably with the polish merely external though it was of the flemish and norman knights a boastful selfsufficiency too which bordered on the ludicrous at whiles even in her partial eyes which would be a matter of open laughter to the knights of the court besides if they laughed at him they would laugh at her for choosing him and then wounded vanity came in to help wounded pride and she sat over the cold embers till almost dawn of day her head between her hands musing sadly and half wishing that the irrevocable yesterday had never come  but when after a few months hereward returned from his first campaign in holland covered with glory and renown all smiles and beauty and health and goodhumor and gratitude for the magic armor which had preserved him unhurt then torfrida forgot all her fears and thought herself the happiest maid alive for fourandtwenty hours at least  and then came back and after that again and again the old fears gradually she found out that the sneers which she had heard at english barbarians were not altogether without ground  not only had her lovers life been passed among halfbrutal and wild adventurers but like the rest of his nation he had never felt the influence of that classic civilization without which good manners seem even to this day almost beyond the reach of the white man those among whom she had been brought up whether soldiers or clerks were probably no nobler or purer at heartshe would gladly have believed them far less sothan hereward but the merest varnish of roman civilization had given a charm to their manners a wideness of range to their thoughts which hereward had not  especially when he had taken too much to drinkwhich he did after the danish fashion far oftener than the rest of baldwins menhe grew rude boastful quarrelsome he would chant his own doughty deeds and gab as the norman word was in painful earnest while they gabbed only in sport and outvied each other in impossible fanfaronades simply to laugh down a fashion which was held inconsistent with the modesty of a true knight bitter it was to her to hear him announcing to the company not for the first or second time how he had slain the cornish giant whose height increased by a foot at least every time he was mentioned and then to hear him answered by some smart smoothshaven youth who with as much mimicry of his manner as he dared to assume boasted of having slain in araby a giant with two heads and taken out of his two mouths the two halves of the princess whom he was devouring which being joined together afterwards by the prayers of a holy hermit were delivered back safe and sound to her father the king of antioch and more bitter still to hear hereward angrily dispute the story unaware at least at first that he was being laughed at  then she grew sometimes cold sometimes contemptuous sometimes altogether fierce and shed bitter tears in secret when she was complimented on the modesty of her young savage  but she was a brave maiden and what was more she loved him with all her heart else why endure bitter words for his sake and she set herself to teach and train the wild outlaw into her ideal of a very perfect knight  she talked to him of modesty and humility the root of all virtues of chivalry and selfsacrifice of respect to the weak and mercy to the fallen of devotion to god and awe of his commandments she set before him the example of ancient heroes and philosophers of saints and martyrs and as much awed him by her learning as by the new world of higher and purer morality which was opened for the first time to the wandering viking  and he drank it all in taught by a woman who loved him he could listen to humiliating truths which he would have sneered at had they come from the lips of a hermit or a priest often he rebelled often he broke loose and made her angry and himself ashamed but the spell was on hima far surer as well as purer spell than any lovepotion of which foolish torfrida had ever dreamedthe only spell which can really civilize manthat of womans tact and womans purity  but there were relapses as was natural the wine at robert the frisons table was often too good and then herewards tongue was loosed and torfrida justly indignant and one evening there came a very serious relapse and out of which arose a strange adventure  for one day the great marquis sent for his son to bruges ere he set out for another campaign in holland and made him a great feast to which he invited torfrida and her mother for adela of france the queen countess had heard so much of torfridas beauty that she must needs have her as one of her bowermaidens and her mother who was an old friend of adelas of course was highly honored by such a promotion for her daughter  so they went to bruges and hereward and his men went of course and they feasted and harped and sang and the saying was fulfilled     tis merry in the hall     when beards wag all  but the only beard which wagged in that hall was herewards for the flemings like the normans prided themselves on their civilized and smoothshaven chins and laughed behind his back at hereward who prided himself on keeping his beautiful english beard with locks of gold which like his long golden hair were combed and curled daily after the fashion of the anglodanes  but herewards beard began to wag somewhat too fast as he sat by torfridas side when some knight near began to tell of a wonderful mare called swallow which was to be found in one of the islands of the scheldt and was famous through all the country round insinuating moreover that hereward might as well have brought that mare home with him as a trophy  hereward answered in his boasting vein that he would bring home that mare or aught else that he had a liking to  you will find it not so easy her owner they say is a mighty strong churl of a horsebreeder dirk hammerhand by name and as for cutting his throat that you must not do for he has been loyal to countess gertrude and sent her horses whenever she needed  one may pick a fair quarrel with him nevertheless  then you must bide such a buffet as you never abode before they say his arm has seven mens strength and whosoever visits him he challenges to give and take a blow but every man that has taken a blow as yet has never needed another  hereward will have need of his magic headpiece if he tries that adventure quoth another  ay retorted the first speaker but the helmet may stand the rap well enough and yet the brains inside be the worse  not a doubt i knew a man once who was so strong that he would shake a nut till the kernel went to powder and yet never break the shell  that is a lie quoth hereward and so it was and told purposely to make him expose himself  whereon high words followed which torfrida tried in vain to stop hereward was flushed with ire and scorn  magic armor forsooth cried he at last what care i for armor or for magic i will wager to youmy armor he was on the point of saying but he checked himself in timeany horse in my stable that i go in my shirt to scaldmariland and bring back that mare singlehanded  hark to the englishman he has turned berserk at last like his forefathers you will surely start in a pair of hose as well or the ladies will be shamed  and so forth till torfrida was purple with shame and wished herself fathoms deep and adela of france called sternly from the head of the table to ask what the wrangling meant  it is only the english berserker the lady torfridas champion said some one in his most courteous tone who is not yet as well acquainted with the customs of knighthood as that fair lady hopes to make him hereafter  torfridas champion asked adela in a tone of surprise if not scorn  if any knight quarrels with my hereward he quarrels with robert himself thundered count robert silence  and so the matter was hushed up  the banquet ended and they walked out into the garden to cool their heads and play at games and dance  torfrida avoided hereward but he with the foolish pertinacity of a man who knows he has had too much wine and yet pretends to himself that he has not would follow her and speak to her  she turned away more than once at last she was forced to speak to him  so you have made me a laughingstock to these knights you have scorned at my gifts you have saidand before these men toothat you need neither helm nor hauberk give me them back then berserker as you are and go sleep off your wine  that will i laughed hereward boisterously  you are tipsy said she and do not know what you say  you are angry and do not know what you say hearken proud lass i will take care of one thing and that is that you shall speak the truth  did i not say that you were tipsy  pish you said that i was a berserker and truth you shall speak for baresark i go tomorrow to the war and baresark i win that mare or die  that will be very fit for you  and the two turned haughtily from each other  ere torfrida went to bed that night there was a violent knocking angry as she was she was yet anxious enough to hurry out of her chamber and open the door herself  martin lightfoot stood there with a large leather case which he flung at her feet somewhat unceremoniously  there is some gear of yours said he as it clanged and rattled on the floor  what do you mean man  only that my master bid me say that he cares as little for his own life as you do and he turned away  she caught him by the arm  what is the meaning of this what is in this mail  you should know best if young folks cannot be content when they are well off they will go farther and fare worse says martin lightfoot and he slipt from her grasp and fled into the night  she took the mail to her room and opened it it contained the magic armor  all her anger was melted away she cried she blamed herself he would be killed his blood would be on her head she would have carried it back to him with her own hands she would have entreated him on her knees to take it back but how face the courtiers and how find him very probably too he was by that time hopelessly drunk and at that thought she drew herself into herself and trying to harden her heart again went to bed but not to sleep and bitterly she cried as she thought over the old hags croon     quick joy long pain     you will take your gift again  it might have been five oclock the next morning when the clarion rang down the street she sprang up and drest herself quickly but never more carefully or gayly she heard the tramp of horsehoofs he was moving afield early indeed should she go to the window to bid him farewell should she hide herself in just anger  she looked out stealthily through the blind of the little window in the gable there rode down the street robert le frison in full armor and behind him knight after knight a wall of shining steel but by his side rode one bareheaded his long yellow curls floating over his shoulders his boots had golden spurs a gilt belt held up his sword but his only dress was a silk shirt and silk hose he laughed and sang and made his horse caracol and tossed his lance in the air and caught it by the point like taillefer at hastings as he passed under the window  she threw open the blind careless of all appearances she would have called to him but the words choked her and what should she say  he looked up boldly and smiled  farewell fair lady mine drunk i was last night but not so drunk as to forget a promise  and he rode on while torfrida rushed away and broke into wild weeping     chapter xiii  how hereward won mare swallow   on a bench at the door of his highroofed wooden house sat dirk hammerhand the richest man in walcheren from within the house sounded the pleasant noise of slavewomen grinding and chatting at the handquern from without the pleasant noise of geese and fowls without number and as he sat and drank his ale and watched the herd of horses in the fen he thought himself a happy man and thanked his odin and thor that owing to his princely supplies of horses to countess gertrude robert the frison and his christian franks had not harried him to the bare walls as they would probably do ere all was over  as he looked at the horses some halfmile off he saw a strange stir among them they began whinnying and pawing round a fourfooted thing in the midst which might be a badger or a wolfthough both were very uncommon in that pleasant isle of walcheren but which plainly had no business there whereon he took up a mighty staff and strode over the fen to see  he found neither wolf nor badger but to his exceeding surprise a long lean man clothed in ragged horseskins whinnying and neighing exactly like a horse and then stooping to eat grass like one he advanced to do the first thing which came into his head namely to break the mans back with his staff and ask him afterwards who he might be but ere he could strike the man or horse kicked up with his hind legs in his face and then springing on to the said hind legs ran away with extraordinary swiftness some fifty yards and then went down on allfours and began grazing again  beest thou man or devil cried dirk somewhat frightened  the thing looked up the face at least was human  art thou a christian man asked it in bad frisian intermixed with snorts and neighs  whats that to thee growled dirk and began to wish a little that he was one having heard that the sign of the cross was of great virtue in driving away fiends  thou art not christian thou believest in thor and odin then there is hope  hope of what dirk was growing more and more frightened  of her my sister ah my sister can it be that i shall find thee at last after ten thousand miles and thirty years of woeful wandering  i have no mans sister here at least my wifes brother was killed  i speak not of a sister in a womans shape mine alaso woeful prince o more woeful princesseats the herb of the field somewhere in the shape of a mare as ugly as she was once beautiful but swifter than the swallow on the wing  ive none such here quoth dirk thoroughly frightened and glancing uneasily at mare swallow  you have not alas wretched me it was prophesied to me by the witch that i should find her in the field of one who worshipped the old gods for had she come across a holy priest she had been a woman again long ago whither must i wander afresh and the thing began weeping bitterly and then ate more grass  ithat isthou poor miserable creature said dirk half pitying half wishing to turn the subject leave off making a beast of thyself awhile and tell me who thou art  i have made no beast of myself most noble earl of the frisians for so you doubtless are i was made a beast ofa horse of by an enchanter of a certain land and my sister a mare  thou dost not say so quoth dirk who considered such an event quite possible  i was a prince of the county of alboronia which lies between cathay and the mountains of the moon as fair once as i am foul now and only less fair than my lost sister and by the enchantments of a cruel magician we became what we are  but thou art not a horse at all events  am i not thou knowest then more of me than i do of myselfand it ate more grass but hear the rest of my story my hapless sister was sold away with me to a merchant but i breaking loose from him fled until i bathed in a magic fountain at once i recovered my mans shape and was rejoicing therein when out of the fountain rose a fairy more beautiful than an elf and smiled upon me with love  she asked me my story and i told it and when it was told wretch she cried and coward who hast deserted thy sister in her need i would have loved thee and made thee immortal as myself but now thou shalt wander ugly and eating grass clothed in the horsehide which has just dropped from thy limbs till thou shalt find thy sister and bring her to bathe like thee in this magic well  all good spirits help us and you are really a prince  as surely cried the thing with a voice of sudden rapture as that mare is my sister and he rushed at mare swallow i see i see my mothers eyes my fathers nose  he must have been a chuckleheaded king that then grinned dirk to himself the mares nose is as big as a buckbasket but how can she be a princess manprince i mean she has a foal running by her here  a foal said the thing solemnly let me behold it alas alas my sister thy tyrants threat has come true that thou shouldst be his bride whether thou wouldst or not i see i see in the features of thy son his hated lineaments  why he must be as like a horse then as your father but this will not do master horseman i know that foals pedigree better than i do my own  man man simple though honest hast thou never heard of the skill of the enchanter of the east how they transform their victims at night back again into human shape and by day into the shape of beasts again  yeswelli know that  and do you not see how you are deluded every night doubt not that mare and foal take their human shape again and every night perhaps that foul enchanter visits in your fen perhaps in your very stable his wretched and perhaps unwilling bride  an enchanter in my stable that is an ugly guest but no ive been into the stables fifty times to see if that mare was safe mare was mare and colt was colt mr prince if i have eyes to see  and what are eyes against enchantments the moment you opened the door the spell was cast over them again you ought to thank your stars that no worse has happened yet that the enchanter in fleeing has not wrung your neck as he went out or cast a spell on you which will fire your barns lame your geese give your fowls the pip your horses the glanders your cattle the murrain your children the st vitus dance your wife the creeping palsy and yourself the chalkstones in all your fingers  the lord have mercy on me if the half of this be true i will turn christian i will send for a priest and be baptized tomorrow  o my sister my sister dost thou not know me dost thou answer my caresses with kicks or is thy heart as well as thy body so enchained by that cruel necromancer that thou preferest to be his and scornest thine own salvation leaving me to eat grass till i die  i say princei saywhat would you have a man to do i bought the mare honestly and i have kept her well she cant say aught against me on that score and whether she be princess or not im loath to part with her  keep her then and keep with her the curse of all the saints and angels look down ye holy saints and the thing poured out a long string of saints names and avenge this catholic princess kept in bestial durance by an unbaptized heathen may his  dont dont roared dirk and dont look at me like that for he feared the evil eye or ill brain you with my staff  fool if i have lost a horses figure i have not lost his swiftness ere thou couldst strike i should have run a mile and back to curse thee afresh and the thing ran round him and fell on allfours again and ate grass  mercy mercy and that is more than i ever asked yet of man but it is hard growled he that a man should lose his money because a rogue sells him a princess in disguise  then sell her again sell her as thou valuest thy life to the first christian man thou meetest and yet no what matters ere a month be over the seven years enchantment will have passed and she will return to her own shape with her son and vanish from thy farm leaving thee to vain repentance and so thou wilt both lose thy money and get her curse farewell and my malison abide with thee  and the thing without another word ran right away neighing as it went leaving dirk in a state of abject terror  he went home he cursed the mare he cursed the man who sold her he cursed the day he saw her he cursed the day he was born he told his story with exaggerations and confusions in plenty to all in the house and terror fell on them likewise no one that evening dare go down into the fen to drive the horses up and dirk got very drunk went to bed and trembled there all night as did the rest of the household expecting the enchanter to enter on a flaming firedrake at every howl of the wind  the next morning as dirk was going about his business with a doleful face casting stealthy glances at the fen to see if the mysterious mare was still there and a chance of his money still left a man rode up to the door  he was poorly clothed with a long rusty sword by his side a broad felt hat long boots and a haversack behind his saddle showed him to be a traveller seemingly a horsedealer for there followed him tied head and tail a brace of sorry nags  heaven save all here quoth he making the sign of the cross can any good christian give me a drink of milk  ale if thou wilt said dirk but what art thou and whence  on any other day he would have tried to coax his guest into trying a buffet with him for his horse and clothes but this morning his heart was heavy with the thought of the enchanted mare and he welcomed the chance of selling her to the stranger  we are not very fond of strangers about here since these flemings have been harrying our borders if thou art a spy it will be worse for thee  i am neither spy nor fleming but a poor servant of the lord bishop of utrechts buying a garron or two for his lordships priests as for these flemings may st john baptist save from them both me and you do you know of any man who has horses to sell hereabouts  there are horses in the fen yonder quoth dirk who knew that churchmen were likely to give a liberal price and pay in good silver  i saw them as i rode up and a fine lot they are but of too good a stamp for my short purse or for my holy masters ridinga fat priest likes a quiet nag my master  humph well if quietness is what you need there is a mare down there a child might ride her with a thread of wool but as for priceand she has a colt too running by her  ah quoth the horseman well your walcheren folk make good milk thats certain a colt by her thats awkward my lord does not like young horses and it would be troublesome too to take the thing along with me  the less anxious the dealer seemed to buy the more anxious grew dirk to sell but he concealed his anxiety and let the stranger turn away thanking him for his drink  i say he called after him you might look at her as you ride past the herd  the stranger assented and they went down into the fen and looked over the precious mare whose feats were afterwards sung by many an english fireside or in the forest beneath the hollins green by such as robin hood and his merry men the ugliest as well as the swiftest of mares she was say the old chroniclers and it was not till the stranger had looked twice at her that he forgot her great chuckle head greyhoundflanks and drooping hindquarters and began to see the great length of those same quartersthe thighs let down into the hocks the arched loin the extraordinary girth through the saddle the sloping shoulder the long arms the flat knees the large wellset hoofs and all the other points which showed her strength and speed and justified her fame  she might carry a big man like you through the mud said he carelessly but as for pace one cannot expect that with such a chuckle head and if one rode her through a town the boys would call after one all head and no tail why i cant see her tail for her quarters it is so ill set on  ill set on or none said dirk testily dont go to speak against her pace till you have seen it here lass  dirk was in his heart rather afraid of the princess but he was comforted when she came up to him like a dog  shes as sensible as a woman said he and then grumbled to himself may be she knows i mean to part with her  lend me your saddle said he to the stranger  the stranger did so and dirk mounting galloped her in a ring there was no doubt of her powers as soon as she began to move  i hope you wont remember this against me madam said dirk as soon as he got out of the strangers hearing i cant do less than sell you to a christian and certainly i have been as good a master to you as if id known who you were but if you wish to stay with me youve only to kick me off and say so and im yours to command  well she can gallop a bit said the stranger as dirk pulled her up and dismounted but an ugly brute she is nevertheless and such a one as i should not care to ride for i am a gay man among the ladies however what is your price  dirk named twice as much as he would have taken  half that you mean and the usual haggle began  tell thee what said dirk at last i am a man who has his fancies and this shall be her price half thy bid and a box on the ear  the demon of covetousness had entered dirks heart what if he got the money brained or at least disabled the stranger and so had a chance of selling the mare a second time to some fresh comer  thou art a strange fellow quoth the horsedealer but so be it  dirk chuckled he does not know thought he that he has to do with dirk hammerhand and he clenched his fist in anticipation of his rough joke  there quoth the stranger counting out the money carefully is thy coin and thereis thy box on the ear  and with a blow which rattled over the fen he felled dirk hammerhand to the ground  he lay senseless for a moment and then looked wildly round his jaw was broken  villain groaned he it was i who was to give the buffet not thou  art mad asked the stranger as he coolly picked up the coins which dirk had scattered in his fall it is the sellers business to take and the buyers to give  and while dirk roared for help in vain he leapt on mare swallow and rode off shouting  aha dirk hammerhand so you thought to knock a hole in my skull as you have done to many a better man than yourself he is a lucky man who never meets his match dirk i shall give your love to the enchanted prince my faithful servingman whom they call martin lightfoot  dirk cursed the day he was born instead of the mare and colt he had got the two wretched garrons which the stranger had left and a face which made him so tender of his own teeth that he never again offered to try a buffet with a stranger     chapter xiv  how hereward rode into bruges like a beggarman   the spring and summer had passed and the autumn was almost over when great news came to the court of bruges where torfrida was now a bowermaiden  the hollanders had been beaten till they submitted at least for the present there was peace at least for the present through all the isles of scheldt and more than all the lovely countess gertrude had resolved to reward her champion by giving him her hand and the guardianship of her lands and the infant son  and hereward  from him or of him there was no word that he was alive and fighting was all the messenger could say  then robert came back to bruges with a gallant retinue leading home his bride and there met him his father and mother and his brother of mons and richilda the beautiful and terrible sorceresswho had not yet stained her soul with those fearful crimes which she had expiated by fearful penances in after years when young arnoul the son for whom she had sold her soul lay dead through the very crimes by which she had meant to make him a mighty prince and torfrida went out with them to meet count robert and looked for hereward till her eyes were ready to fall out of her head but hereward was not with them  he must be left behind commanding the army thought she but he might have sent one word  there was a great feast that day of course and torfrida sat thereat but she could not eat nevertheless she was too proud to let the knights know what was in her heart so she chatted and laughed as gayly as the rest watching always for any word of hereward but none mentioned his name  the feast was long the ladies did not rise till nigh bedtime and then the men drank on  they went up to the queencountesss chamber where a solemn undressing of that royal lady usually took place  the etiquette was this the queencountess sat in her chair of state in the midst till her shoes were taken off and her hair dressed for the night right and left of her according to their degrees sat the other great ladies and behind each of them where they could find places the maidens  it was torfridas turn to take off the royal shoes and she advanced into the middle of the semicircle slippers in hand  stop there said the countessqueen  whereat torfrida stopped very much frightened  countesses and ladies said the mistress there are in provence and the south what i wish there were here in flanderscourts of love at which all offenders against the sacred laws of venus and cupid are tried by an assembly of their peers and punished according to their deserts  torfrida turned scarlet  i know not why we countesses and ladies should have less knowledge of the laws of love than those gayer dames of the south whose blood runsto judge by her dark hairin the veins of yon fair maid  there was a silence torfrida was the most beautiful woman in the room more beautiful than even richilda the terrible and therefore there were few but were glad to see heras it seemedin trouble  torfridas mother began whimpering and praying to six or seven saints at once but nobody marked herpossibly not even the saints being preoccupied with torfrida  i hear fair maidfor that you are that i will do you the justice to confessthat you are old enough to be married this four years since  torfrida stood like a stone frightened out of her wits plentiful as they were  why are you not married  there was of course no answer  i hear that knights have fought for you lost their lives for you  i did not bid them gasped torfrida longing that the floor would open and swallow up the queencountess and all her kin and followers as it did for the enemies of the blessed saint dunstan while he was arguing with them in an upper room at calne  and that the knight of st valeri to whom you gave your favor now lies languishing of wounds got in your cause  ii did not bid him fight gasped torfrida now wishing that the floor would open and swallow up herself  and that he who overthrew the knight of st valerito whom you gave that favor and more  i gave him nothing a maiden might not give cried torfrida so fiercely that the queencountess recoiled somewhat  i never said that you did girl your love you gave him can you deny that  torfrida laughed bitterly her southern blood was rising  i put my love out to nurse instead of weaning it as many a maiden has done before me when my love cried for hunger and cold i took it back again to my own bosom and whether it has lived or died there is no ones matter but my own  hunger and cold i hear that him to whom you gave your love you drove out to the cold bidding him go fight in his bare shirt if he wished to win your love  i did not he angered mehe and torfrida found herself in the act of accusing hereward  she stopped instantly  what more majesty if this be true what more may not be true of such a one as i i submit myself to your royal grace  she has confessed what punishment ladies does she deserve or rather what punishment would her cousins of provence inflict did we send her southward to be judged by their courts of love  one lady said one thing one another some spoke cruelly some worse than cruelly for they were coarse ages the ages of faith and ladies said things then in open company which gentlemen would be ashamed to say in private now  marry her to a fool said richilda at last bitterly  that is too common a misfortune answered the lady of france if we did no more to her she might grow as proud as her betters  adela knew that her daughterinlaw considered her husband a fool and was somewhat of the same opinion though she hated richilda  no said she we will do more we will marry her to the first man who enters the castle  torfrida looked at her mistress to see if she were mad but the countessqueen was serene and sane then torfridas southern heat and northern courage burst forth  youmarrymeto said she slowly with eyes so fierce and lips so vivid that richilda herself quailed  there was a noise of shouting and laughing in the court below which made all turn and listen  the next moment a servingman came in puzzled and inclined to laugh  may it please your majesty here is the strangest adventure there is ridden into the castleyard a beggarman with scarce a shirt to his back on a great ugly mare with a foal running by her and a fool behind him carrying lance and shield and he says that he is come to fight any knight of the court ragged as he stands for the fairest lady in the court be she who she may if she have not a wedded husband already  and what says my lord marquis  that it is a fair challenge and a good adventure and that fight he shall if any man will answer his defiance  and i say tell my lord the marquis that fight he shall not for he shall have the fairest maiden in this court for the trouble of carrying her away and that i adela of france will give her to him so let that beggar dismount and be brought up hither to me  there was silence again torfrida looked round her once more to see whether or not she was dreaming and whether there was one human being to whom she could appeal her mother sat praying and weeping in a corner torfrida looked at her with one glance of scorn which she confessed and repented with bitter tears many a year after in a foreign land and then turned to bay with the spirit of her old paladin ancestor who choked the emir at mont majeur  married to a beggar it was a strange accident and an ugly one and a great cruelty and wrong but it was not impossible hardly improbable in days when the caprice of the strong created accidents and when cruelty and wrong went for nothing even with very kindly honest folk so torfrida faced the danger as she would have faced that of a kicking horse or a flooded ford and like the nutbrown bride       she pulled out a little penknife        that was both keen and sharp  and considered that the beggarman could wear no armor and that she wore none either for if she succeeded in slaying that beggarman she might need to slay herself after to avoid beingaccording to the fashion of those daysburnt alive  so when the arras was drawn back and that beggarman came into the room instead of shrieking fainting hiding or turning she made three steps straight toward him looking him in the face like a wildcat at bay then she threw up her arms and fell upon his neck  it was hereward himself filthy ragged but hereward  his shirt was brown with gore and torn with wounds and through its rents showed more than one hardly healed scar his hair and beard was all in elflocks and one heavy cut across the head had shorn not only hair but brainpan very close moreover any nose save that of love might have required perfume  but hereward it was and regardless of all beholders she lay upon his neck and never stirred nor spoke  i call you to witness ladies cried the queencountess that i am guiltless she has given herself to this beggarman of her own free will what say you and she turned to torfridas mother  torfridas mother only prayed and whimpered  countesses and ladies said the queencountess there will he two weddings tomorrow the first will be that of my son robert and my pretty lady gertrude here the second will be that of my pretty torfrida and hereward  and the second bride said the countess gertrude rising and taking torfrida in her arms will be ten times prettier than the first there sir i have done all you asked of me now go and wash yourself                                       hereward said torfrida a week after and did you really never change your shirt all that time  never i kept my promise  but it must have been very nasty  well i bathed now and then  but it must have been very cold  i am warm enough now  but did you never comb your hair neither  well i wont say that travellers find strange bedfellows but i had half a mind never to do it at all just to spite you  and what matter would it have been to me  o none it is only a danish fashion we have of keeping clean  clean you were dirty enough when you came home how silly you were if you had sent me but one word  you would have fancied me beaten and scolded me all over again i know your ways now torfrida     chapter xv  how earl tosti godwinsson came to st omer   the winter passed in sweet madness and for the first time in her life torfrida regretted the lengthening of the days and the flowering of the primroses and the return of the now needless wryneck for they warned her that hereward must forth again to the wars in scaldmariland which had broken out again as was to be expected as soon as count robert and his bride had turned their backs  and hereward likewise for the first time in his life was loath to go to war he was doubtless rich enough in this worlds goods torfrida herself was rich and seems to have had the disposal of her own property for her mother is not mentioned in connection therewith hereward seems to have dwelt in her house at st omer as long as he remained in flanders he had probably amassed some treasure of his own by the simple but then most aristocratic method of plunder he had too probably grants of land in holland from the frison the rents whereof were not paid as regularly as might be moreover as magister militum master of the knights he had it is likely pay as well as honor and he approved himself worthy of his good fortune he kept forty gallant housecarles in his hall all the winter and torfrida and her lasses made and mended their clothes he gave large gifts to the abbey of st bertin and had masses sung for the souls of all whom he had slain according to a rough list which he furnished bidding the monks not to be chary of two or three masses extra at times as his memory was short and he might have sent more souls to purgatory than he had recollected he gave great alms at his door to all the poor he befriended especially all shipwrecked and needy mariners feeding and clothing them and begging their freedom as a gift from baldwin he feasted the knights of the neighborhood who since his baresark campaign had all vowed him the most gallant of warriors and since his accession of wealth the most courteous of gentlemen and so all went merrily as it is written as long as thou doest well unto thyself men will speak well of thee  so he would have fain stayed at home at st omer but he was roberts man and his good friend likewise and to the wars he must go forth once more and for eight or nine weary months torfrida was alone but very happy for a certain reason of her own  at last the short november days came round and a joyful woman was fair torfrida when martin lightfoot ran into the hall and throwing himself down on the rushes like a dog announced that hereward and his men would be home before noon and then fell fast asleep  there was bustling to and fro of her and her maids decking of the hall in the best hangings strewing of fresh rushes to the dislodgement of martin setting out of square tables and stoops and mugs thereon cooking of victuals broaching of casks and above all for herewards self heating of much water and setting out in the inner chamber of the great bathtub and bathsheet which was the special delight of a hero fresh from the war  and by midday the streets of st omer rang with clank and tramp and trumpetblare and in marched hereward and all his men and swung round through the gateway into the court where torfrida stood to welcome them as fair as day a silver stirrupcup in her hand and while the men were taking off their harness and dressing their horses she and hereward went in together and either took such joy of the other that a years parting was forgot in a minutes meeting  now cried she in a tone half of triumph half of tenderness look there  a cradle and a baby  your baby  is it a boy asked hereward who saw in his minds eye a thing which would grow and broaden at his knee year by year and learn from him to ride to shoot to fight happy for him if he does not learn worse from me thought hereward with a sudden movement of humility and contrition which was surely marked in heaven for torfrida marked it on earth  but she mistook its meaning  do not be vexed it is a girl  never mind as if it was a calamity over which he was bound to comfort the mother if she is half as beautiful as you look at this moment what splintering of lances there will be about her how jolly to see the lads hewing at each other while our daughter sits in the pavilion as queen of love  torfrida laughed you think of nothing but fighting bear of the north seas  every one to his trade well yes i am glad that it is a girl  i thought you seemed vexed why did you cross yourself  because i thought to myself how unfit i was to bring up a boy to be such a knight asas you would have him how likely i was ere all was over to make him as great a ruffian as myself  hereward hereward and she threw her arms round his neck for the tenth time blessed be you for those words those are the fears which never come true for they bring down from heaven the grace of god to guard the humble and contrite heart from that which it fears  ah torfrida i wish i were as good as you  nowmy joy and my life my hero and my scaldi have great news for you as well as a little baby news from england  you and a baby over and above are worth all england to me  but listen edward the king is dead  then there is one fool less on earth and one saint more i suppose in heaven  and harold godwinsson is king in his stead and he has married your niece aldytha and sworn friendship with her brothers  i expected no less well every dog has his day  and his will be a short one william of normandy has sworn to drive him out  then he will do it and so the poor little swanneck is packed into a convent that the houses of godwin and leofric may rush into each others arms and perish together fools fools fools i will hear no more of such a mad world my queen tell me about your sweet self what is all this to me am i not a wolfs head and a landless man  o my king have not the stars told me that you will be an earl and a ruler of men when all your foes are wolves heads as you are now and the weird is coming true already tosti godwinsson is in the town at this moment an outlaw and a wolfs head himself  hereward laughed a great laugh  aha every man to his right place at last tell me about that for it will amuse me i have heard naught of him since he sent the king his hereford thralls arms and legs in the picklebarrels to show him he said that there was plenty of cold meat on his royal demesnes  you have not heard then how he murdered in his own chamber at york gamel ormsson and ulf dolfinsson  that poor little lad well a gracious youth was tosti ever since he went to kill his brother harold with teeth and claws like a wolf and as he grows in years he grows in grace but what said ulfs father and the gospatricks  dolfin and young gospatrick were i know not where but old gospatrick came down to westminster to demand law for his grandnephews blood  a silly thing of the old thane to walk into the wolfs den  and so he found he was stabbed there three days after christmastide and men say that queen edith did it for love of tosti her brother then dolfin and young gospatrick took to the sea and away to scotland and so tosti rid himself of all the good blood in the north except young waltheof siwardsson whose turn i fear will come next  how comes he here then  the northern men rose at that killed his servant at york took all his treasures and marched down to northampton plundering and burning they would have marched on london town if harold had not met them there from the king there they cried out against tosti and all his taxes and his murders and his changing canutes laws and would have young morcar for their earl a tyrant they would not endure free they were born and bred they said and free they would live and die harold must needs do justice even on his own brother  especially when he knows that that brother is his worst foe  harold is a better man than you take him for my hereward but be that as it may morcar is earl and tosti outlawed and here in st omer with wife and child  my nephew earl of northumbria as i might have been if i had been a wiser man  if you had you would never have found me  true my queen they say heaven tempers the wind to the shorn lamb but it tempers it too sometimes to the hobbled ass and so it has done by me and so the rogues have fallen out and honest men may come by their own for as the northern men have done by one brother so will the eastern men do by the other let harold see how many of those fat lincolnshire manors which he has seized into his own hands he holds by this day twelve months but what is all this to me my queen while you and i can kiss and laugh the world to scorn  this to you beloved that great as you are torfrida must have you greater still and out of all this coil and confusion you may win something if you be wise  sweet lips be still and let us love instead of plotting  and this tooyou shall not stop my mouththat harold godwinsson has sent a letter to you  harold godwinsson is my very good lord sneered hereward  and this it said with such praises and courtesies concerning you as made thy wifes heart beat high with pride if hereward leofricsson will come home to england he shall have his rights in law again and his manors in lincolnshire and a thanesship in east anglia and manors for his menatarms and if that be not enough he shall have an earldom as soon as there is one to give  and what says to that torfrida herewards queen  you will not be angry if i answered the letter for you  if you answered it one wayno if anotheryes  torfrida trembled then she looked hereward full in the face with her keen clear eyes  now shall i see whether i have given myself to hereward in vain body and soul or whether i have trained him to be my true and perfect knight  you answered then said hereward thus  say on said she turning her face away again  hereward leofricsson tells harold godwinsson that he is his equal and not his man and that he will never put his hands between the hands of a son of godwin an etheling born a king of the house of cerdic outlawed him from his right and none but an etheling born shall give him his right again  i said it i said it those were my very words and torfrida burst into tears while hereward kissed her almost fawned upon her calling her his queen his sagawife his guardian angel  i was sorely tempted sobbed she sorely to see you rich and proud upon your own lands an earl may bemay be i thought at whiles a king but it could not be it did not stand with honor my heronot with honor  not with honor get me gay garments out of the chest and let us go in royally and royally feast my jolly riders  stay awhile said she kissing his head as she combed and curled his long golden locks and her own raven ones hardly more beautiful fell over them and mingled with them stay awhile my pride there is another spell in the wind stirred up by devil or witchwife and it comes from tosti godwinsson  tosti the coldmeat butcher what has he to say to me  thisif hereward will come with me to william of normandy and help us against harold the perjured then will william do for him all that harold would have done and more beside  and what answered torfrida  it was not so said to me that i could answer i had it by a sidewind through the countess judith footnote tostis wife earl baldwins daughter sister of matilda william the conquerors wife  and she had it from her sister matilda  and she of course from duke william himself  and what would you have answered if you had answered pretty one  nay i know not i cannot be always queen you must be king sometimes  torfrida did not say that this latter offer had been a much sorer temptation than the former  and has not the baseborn frenchman enough knights of his own that he needs the help of an outlaw like me  he asks for help from all the ends of the earth he has sent that lanfranc to the pope and there is talk of a sacred banner and a crusade against england  the monks are with him then said hereward that is one more count in their score but i am no monk i have shorn many a crown but i have kept my own hair as yet you see  i do see said she playing with his locks butbut he wants you he has sent for angevins poitevins bretons flemingspromising lands rank money what not tosti is recruiting for him here in flanders now he will soon be off to the orkneys i suspect or to sweyn in denmark after vikings  here has baldwin promised him men  what could the good old man do he could not refuse his own soninlaw this at least i know that a messenger has gone off to scotland to gilbert of ghent to bring or send any bold flemings who may prefer fat england to lean scotland  lands rank money eh so he intends that the war should pay itselfout of english purses what answer would you have me make to that wife mine  the duke is a terrible man what if he conquers and conquer he will  is that written in your stars  it is i fear and if he have the popes blessing and the popes bannerdare we resist the holy father  holy stepfather you mean for a stepfather he seems to prove to merry england but do you really believe that an old man down in italy can make a bit of rag conquer by saying a few prayers at it if i am to believe in a magic flag give me harold hardraades landcyda at least with harold and his norsemen behind it  williams french are as good as those norsemen man for man and horsed withal hereward  that may be said he half testily with a curse on the tanners grandson and his french popinjays and our englishmen are as good as any two norsemen as the norse themselves say he could not divine and torfrida hardly liked to explain to him the glamour which the duke of normandy had cast over her as the representative of chivalry learning civilization a new and nobler life for men than the world had yet seen one which seemed to connect the young races of europe with the wisdom of the ancients and the magic glories of old imperial rome  you are not fair to that man said she after a while hereward hereward have i not told you how though body be strong mind is stronger that is what that man knows and therefore he has prospered therefore his realms are full of wise scholars and thriving schools and fair minsters and his men are sober and wise and learned like clerks  and false like clerks as he is himself schoolcraft and honesty never went yet together torfrida  not in me  you are not a clerk you are a woman and more you are an elf a goddess there is none like you but hearken to me this man is false all the world knows it  he promises they say to govern england justly as king edwards heir according to the old laws and liberties of the realm  of course if he does not come as the old monks heir how does he come at all if he does not promise ourtheir i mean for i am no englishmanlaws and liberties who will join him but his riders and hirelings will not fight for nothing they must be paid with english land and english land they will have for they will be his men whoever else are not they will be his darlings his housecarles his hawks to sit on his fist and fly at his game and english bones will be picked clean to feed them and you would have me help to do that torfrida is that the honor of which you spoke so boldly to harold godwinsson  torfrida was silent to have brought hereward under the influence of william was an old dream of hers and yet she was proud at the dream being broken thus and so she said  you are right it is better for youit is better than to be williams darling and the greatest earl in his courtto feel that you are still an englishman promise me but one thing that you will make no fierce or desperate answer to the duke  and why not answer the tanner as he deserves  because my art and my heart too tells me that your fortunes and his are linked together i have studied my tables but they would not answer then i cast lots in virgilius  and what found you there asked he anxiously  i opened at the lines    pacem me exanimis et martis sorte peremptis    oratis equidem et vivis concedere vellem  and what means that  that you may have to pray him to pity the slain and have for answer that their lands may be yours if you will but make peace with him at least do not break hopelessly with that man above all never use that word concerning him which you used just now the word which he never forgives remember what he did to them of alençon when they hung raw hides over the wall and cried plenty of work for the tanner  let him pick out the prisoners eyes and chop off their hands and shoot them into the town from mangonelshe must go far and thrive well ere i give him a chance of doing that by me  hereward hereward my own boast not but fear god who knows in such a world as this to what end we may come night after night i am haunted with spectres eyeless handless  this is cold comfort for a man just out of hard fighting in the aguefens  she threw her arms round him and held him as if she would never let him go  when you die i die and you will not die you will be great and glorious and your name will be sung by scald and minstrel through many a land far and wide only be not rash be not highminded promise me to answer this man wisely the more crafty he is the more crafty must you be likewise  let us tell this mighty hero then said herewardtrying to laugh away her fears and perhaps his ownthat while he has the holy father on his side he can need no help from a poor sinful worm like me  hereward hereward  why is there aught about hides in that  i wanti want an answer which may not cut off all hope in case of the worst  then let us say boldly on the day that william is king of all england hereward will come and put his hands between his and be his man  that message was sent to william at rouen he laughed  it is a fair challenge from a valiant man the day shall come when i will claim it  tosti and hereward passed that winter in st omer living in the same street passing each other day by day and never spoke a word one to the other  robert the frison heard of it and tried to persuade hereward  let him purge himself of the murder of ulf the boy son of my friend dolfin and after that of gamel son of orm and after that again of gospatrick my fathers friend whom his sister slew for his sake and then an honest man may talk with him were he not my good lords brotherinlaw as he is mores the pity i would challenge him to fight à loutrance with any weapons he might choose  heaven protect him in that case quoth robert the frison  as it is i will keep the peace and i will see that my men keep the peace though there are scarborough and bamborough lads among them who long to cut his throat upon the streets but more i will not do  so tosti sulked through the winter at st omer and then went off to get help from sweyn of denmark and failing that from harold hardraade of norway but how he sped there must be read in the words of a cunninger sagaman than this chronicler even in those of the icelandic homer snorro sturleson     chapter xvi  how hereward was asked to slay an old comrade   in those days hereward went into bruges to marquis baldwin about his business and as he walked in bruges street he met an old friend gilbert of ghent  he had grown somewhat stouter and somewhat grayer in the last ten years but he was as hearty as ever and as honest according to his own notions of honesty  he shook hereward by both hands clapt him on the back swore with many oaths that he had heard of his fame in all lands that he always said that he would turn out a champion and a gallant knight and had said it long before he killed the bear as for killing it it was no more than he expected and nothing to what hereward had done since and would do yet  wherefrom hereward opined that gilbert had need of him  they chatted on hereward asking after old friends and sometimes after old foes whom he had long since forgiven for though he always avenged an injury he never bore malice for one a distinction less common now than then when a mans honor as well as his safety depended on his striking again when he was struck  and how is little alftruda big she must be now asked he at last  the fiend fly away with heror rather would that he had flown away with her before ever i saw the troublesome little jade big she is grown into the most beautiful lass that ever was seenwhich is what a young fellow like you cares for and more trouble to me than all my money which is what an old fellow like me cares for it is partly about her that i am over here now fool that i was ever to let an etheliza footnote a princess of the royal blood of cerdic and therefore of edward the confessor into my house and gilbert swore a great deal  how was she an etheliza asked hereward who cared nothing about the matter and how came she into your house i never could understand that any more than how the bear came there  ah as to the bear i have my secrets which i tell no one he is dead and buried thanks to you  and i sleep on his skin every night  you do my little champion well warm is the bed that is well earned but as for hersee here and ill tell you she was gospatricks ward and kinswomanhow i do not rightly know but this i know that she comes from uchtred the earl whom canute slew and that she is heir to great estates in northumberland  gospatrick that fought at dunsinane  yes not the old thane his uncle whom tosti has murdered but gospatrick king malcolms cousin dolfins father well she was his ward he gave me her to keep for he wanted her out of harms waythe lass having a bonny dower lands and moneytill he could marry her up to one of his sons i took her of course i was not going to do other mens work for naught so i would have married her up to my poor boy if he had but lived but he would not live as you know then i would have married her to you and made you my heir i tell you honestly if you had not flown off like a hotheaded young springald as you were then  you were very kind but how is she an etheliza  etheliza twice over her father was of high blood among those saxons and if not are not all the gospatricks ethelings their grandmother uchtreds wife was ethelred evilcounsels daughter king edward of londons sister and i have heard that this girls grandfather was their sonbut died youngor was killed with his father who cares  not i quoth hereward  wellhe wants to marry her to dolfin his eldest son  why dolfin had a wife when i was at dunsinane  but she is dead since and young ulf her son murdered by tosti last winter  i know  whereon gospatrick sends to me for the girl and her dowry what was i to do give her up little it is lad that i ever gave up after i had it once in my grip or i should be a poorer man than i am now have and hold is my rule what should i do what i did i was coming hither on business of my own so i put her on board ship and half her dowerwhere the other half is i know and man must draw me with wild horses before he finds outand came here to my kinsman baldwin to see if he had any proper young fellow to whom we might marry the lass and so go shares in her money and the family connection could a man do more wisely  impossible quoth hereward  but see how a wise man is lost by fortune when i come here whom should i find but dolfin himself the dog had scent of my plan all the way from dolfinston there by peebles he hunts me out the hungry scotch wolf rides for leith takes ship and is here to meet me having accused me before baldwin as a robber and ravisher and offers to prove his right to the jade on my body in single combat  the villain quoth hereward there is no modesty left on earth nor prudence either to come here where he might have stumbled on tosti who murdered his son and i would surely do the like by him himself lucky for him that tosti is off to norway on his own errand  modesty and prudence none nowadays young sire nor justice either i think for when baldwin hears us bothand i told my story as cannily as i couldhe tells me that he is very sorry for an old vassal and kinsman and so forthbut i must either disgorge or fight  then fight quoth hereward  per se aut per campioneemthats the old law you know  not a doubt of it  look you hereward i am no coward nor a clumsy man of my hands  he is either fool or liar who says so  but see i find it hard work to hold my own in scotland now folks dont like me or trust me i cant say why  how unreasonable quoth hereward  and if i kill this youth and so have a bloodfeud with gospatrick i have a hornets nest about my ears not only he and his sonswho are masters of scotch northumberland footnote between tweed and forth but all his cousins king malcolm and donaldbain and for aught i know harold and the godwinssons if he bid them take up the quarrel and beside that dolfin is a big man if you cross scot and saxon you breed a very big man if you cross again with a dane or a norseman you breed a giant his grandfather was a scots prince his grandmother an english etheliza his mother a norse princess as you knowand how big he is you should remember he weighs half as much again as i and twice as much as you  butchers count by weight and knights by courage quoth hereward  very well for you who are young and active but i take him to be a better man than that ogre of cornwall whom they say you killed  what care i let him be twice as good id try him  ah i knew you were the old hereward still now hearken to me be my champion you owe me a service lad fight that man challenge him in open field kill him as you are sure to do claim the lass and win herand then we will part her dower and though it is little that i care for young lasses fancies to tell you truth she never favored any man but you  hereward started at the snare which had been laid for him and then fell into a very great laughter  my most dear and generous host you are the wiser the older you grow a plan worthy of solomon you are rid of sieur dolfin without any blame to yourself  just so  while i win the lass and living here in flanders am tolerably safe from any bloodfeud of the gospatricks  just so  perfect but there is only one small hindrance to the plan and that isthat i am married already  gilbert stopped short and swore a great oath  but he said after a while does that matter so much after all  very little indeed as all the world knows if one has money enough and power enough  and you have both they say  but still more unhappily my money is my wifes  peste  and more unhappily still i am so foolishly fond of her that i would sooner have her in her smock than any other woman with half england for a dower  then i suppose i must look out for another champion  or save yourself the trouble by beingjust as a changean honest man  i believe you are right said gilbert laughing but it is hard to begin so late in life  and after one has had so little practice  aha thou art the same merry dog of a hereward come along but could we not poison this dolfin after all  to which proposal hereward gave no encouragement  and now my très beausire may i ask you in return what business brings you to flanders  have i not told you  no but i have guessed gilbert of ghent is on his way to william of normandy  well why not  why notcertainly and has brought out of scotland a few gallant gentlemen and stout housecarles of my acquaintance  gilbert laughed  you may well say that to tell you the truth we have flitted bag and baggage i dont believe that we have left a dog behind  so you intend to colonize in england as the learned clerks would call it to settle to own land and enter like the jews of old into goodly houses which you builded not farms which you tilled not wells which you digged not and orchards which you planted not  why what a clerk you are that sounds like scripture  and so it is i heard it in a french priests sermon which he preached here in st omer a sunday or two back exhorting all good catholics in the popes name to enter upon the barbarous land of england tainted with the sin of simon magus and expel thence the heretical priests and so forth promising them that they should have free leave to cut long thongs out of other mens hides  gilbert chuckled  you laugh the priest did not for after sermon i went up to him and told him how i was an englishman and an outlaw and a desperate man who feared neither saint nor devil and if i heard such talk as that again in st omer i would so shave the speakers crown that he should never need razor to his dying day  and what is that to me said gilbert in an uneasy halfdefiant tone for herewards tone had been more than halfdefiant  this that there are certain broad lands in england which were my fathers and are now my nephews and my mothers and some which should by right be mine and i advise you as a friend not to make entry on those lands lest hereward in turn make entry on you and who is he that will deliver you out of my hand  god and his saints alone thou fiend out of the pit quoth gilbert laughing but he was growing warm and began to tutoyer hereward  i am in earnest gilbert of ghent my good friend of old time  i know thee well enough man why in the name of all glory and plunder art thou not coming with us they say william has offered thee the earldom of northumberland  he has not and if he has it is not his to give and if it were it is by right neither mine nor my nephews but waltheof siwardssons now hearken unto me and settle it in your mind thou and william both that your quarrel is against none but harold and the godwinssons and their men of wessex but that if you go to cross the watling street and meddle with the free danes who are none of harolds men  stay harold has large manors in lincolnshire and so has edith his sister and what of them sir hereward  that the man who touches them even though the men on them may fight on harolds side had better have put his head into a hornets nest unjustly were they seized from their true owners by harold and his fathers and the holders of them will owe no service to him a day longer than they can help but will if he fall demand an earl of their own race or fight to the death  best make young waltheof earl then  best keep thy foot out of them and the foot of any man for whom thou carest now good by friends we are and friends let us be  ah that thou wert coming to england  i bide my time come i may when i see fit but whether i come as friend or foe depends on that of which i have given thee fair warning  so they parted for the time  it will be seen hereafter how gilbert took his own advice about young waltheof but did not take herewards advice about the lincoln manors  in baldwins hall that day hereward met dolfin and when the magnificent young scot sprang to him embraced him talked over old passages complimented him on his fame lamented that he himself had won no such honors in the field hereward felt much more inclined to fight for him than against him  presently the ladies entered from the bower inside the hall a buzz of expectation rose from all the knights and alftrudas name was whispered round  she came in and hereward saw at the first glance that gilbert had for once in his life spoken truth so beautiful a girl he had never beheld and as she swept down toward him he for one moment forgot torfrida and stood spellbound like the rest  her eye caught his if his face showed recognition hers showed none the remembrance of their early friendship of her deliverance from the monster had plainly passed away  fickle ungrateful things these women thought hereward  she passed him close and as she did so she turned her head and looked him full in the face one moment haughty and cold  so you could not wait for me said she in a quiet whisper and went on straight to dolfin who stood trembling with expectation and delight  she put her hand into his  here stands my champion said she  say here kneels your slave cried the scot dropping to the pavement a true highland knee whereon forth shrieked a bagpipe and dolfins minstrel sang in most melodious gaelic     strong as a horses hock       shaggy as a stags brisket     is the knee of the young torrentleaper       the pride of the house of crinan     it bent not to macbeth the accursed       it bends not even to malcolm the anointed     but it bends like a harebellwho shall blame it       before the breath of beauty  which magnificent effusion being interpreted by hereward for the instruction of the ladies procured for the redheaded bard more than one handsome gift  a sturdy voice arose out of the crowd  the fair lady my lord count and knights all will need no champion as far as i am concerned when one sees so fair a pair together what can a knight say in the name of all knighthood but that the heavens have made them for each other and that it were sin and shame to sunder them  the voice was that of gilbert of ghent who making a virtue of necessity walked up to the pair his weatherbeaten countenance wreathed into what were meant for paternal smiles  why did you not say as much in scotland and save me all this trouble pertinently asked the plainspoken scot  my lord prince you owe me a debt for my caution without it the poor lady had never known the whole fervency of your love or these noble knights and yourself the whole evenness of count baldwins justice  alftruda turned her head away half contemptuously and as she did so she let her hand drop listlessly from dolfins grasp and drew back to the other ladies  a suspicion crossed herewards mind did she really love the prince did those strange words of hers mean that she had not yet forgotten hereward himself  however he said to himself that it was no concern of his as it certainly was not went home to torfrida told her everything that had happened laughed over it with her and then forgot alftruda dolfin and gilbert in the prospect of a great campaign in holland     chapter xvii  how hereward took the news from stanford brigg and hastings   after that news came thick and fast  news of all the fowl of heaven flocking to the feast of the great god that they might eat the flesh of kings and captains and mighty men and horses and them that sit on them and the flesh of all men both bond and free  news from rome how england when conquered was to be held as a fief of st peter and spiritually as well as temporarily enslaved news how the gonfanon of st peter and a ring with a bit of st peter himself enclosed therein had come to rouen to go before the norman host as the ark went before that of israel  then news from the north how tosti had been to sweyn and bid him come back and win the country again as canute his uncle had done and how the cautious dane had answered that he was a much smaller man than canute and had enough to hold his own against the norsemen and could not afford to throw for such high stakes as his mighty uncle  then how tosti had been to norway to harold hardraade and asked him why he had been fighting fifteen years for denmark when england lay open to him and how harold of norway had agreed to come and how he had levied one half of the ablebodied men in norway and how he was gathering a mighty fleet at solundir in the mouth of the sogne fiord of all this hereward was well informed for tosti came back again to st omer and talked big but hereward and he had no dealings with each other but at last when tosti tried to entice some of herewards men to sail with him hereward sent him word that if he met him he would kill him in the streets  then tosti who though he wanted not for courage knew that he was no match for hereward went off to bruges leaving his wife and family behind gathered sixty ships at ostend went off to the isle of wight and forced the landsfolk to give him money and food and then harold of englands fleet which was watching the coast against the normans drove him away and he sailed off north full of black rage against his brother harold and all englishmen and burned plundered and murdered along the coast of lincolnshire out of brute spite to the danes who had expelled him  then came news how he had got into the humber how earl edwin and his northumbrians had driven him out and how he went off to scotland to meet harold of norway and how he had put his hands between harolds and become his man  and all the while the norman camp at st pierresurdive grew and grew and all was ready if the wind would but change  and so hereward looked on helpless and saw these two great stormclouds growingone from north and one from southto burst upon his native land  two invasions at the same moment of time and these no mere viking raids for plunder but deliberate attempts at conquest and colonization by the two most famous captains of the age what if both succeeded what if the two stormclouds swept across england each on its own path and met in the midst to hurl their lightnings into each other a fight between william of normandy and harold of norway on some moorland in merciait would be a battle of giants a sight at which odin and the gods of valhalla would rise from their seats and throw away the meadhorn to stare down on the deeds of heroes scarcely less mighty than themselves would that neither might win would that they would destroy and devour till there was none left of frenchmen or of norwegians  so sang hereward after his heathen fashion and his housecarles applauded the song but torfrida shuddered  and what will become of the poor english in the mean time  they have brought it on themselves said hereward bitterly instead of giving the crown to the man who should have had itto sweyn of denmarkthey let godwin put it on the head of a drivelling monk and as they sowed so will they reap  but herewards own soul was black within him to see these mighty events passing as it were within reach of his hand and he unable to take his share in themfor what share could he take that of tosti godwinsson against his own nephews that of harold godwinsson the usurper that of the tanners grandson against any man ah that he had been in england ah that he had been where he might have beenwhere he ought to have been but for his own follyhigh in power in his native landperhaps a great earl perhaps commander of all the armies of the danelagh and bitterly he cursed his youthful sins as he rode to and fro almost daily to the port of calais asking for news and getting often only too much  for now came news that the norsemen had landed in humber that edwin and morcar were beaten at york that hardraade and tosti were masters of the north  and with that news that by the virtue of the relics of st valeri which had been brought out of their shrine to frighten the demons of the storm and by the intercession of the blessed st michael patron of normandy the winds had changed and williams whole armament had crossed the channel landed upon an undefended shore and fortified themselves at pevensey and hastings  and then followed a fortnight of silence and torturing suspense  hereward could hardly eat drink sleep or speak he answered torfridas consolations curtly and angrily till she betook herself to silent caresses as to a sick animal but she loved him all the better for his sullenness for it showed that his english heart was wakening again sound and strong  at last news came he was down as usual at the port a ship had just come in from the northward a man just landed stood on the beach gesticulating and calling in an unknown tongue to the bystanders who laughed at him and seemed inclined to misuse him  hereward galloped down the beach  out of the way villains why man you are a norseman  norseman am i earl thord gunlaugsson is my name and news i bring for the countess judith as the french call her that shall turn her golden hair to snowyea and all fair lasses hair from lindesness to loffoden  is the earl dead  and harold sigurdsson  hereward sat silent appalled for tosti he cared not but harold sigurdsson harold hardraade harold the viking harold the varanger harold the lionslayer harold of constantinople the bravest among champions the wisest among kings the cunningest among minstrels the darling of the vikings of the north the one man whom hereward had taken for his pattern and his ideal the one man under whose banner he would have been proud to fightthe earth seemed empty if harold hardraade were gone  thord gunlaugsson cried he at last or whatever be thy name if thou hast lied to me i will draw thee with wild horses  would god that i did lie i saw him fall with an arrow through his throat then jarl tosti took the landravager and held it up till he died then eystein orre took it coming up hot from the ships and then he died likewise then they all died we would take no quarter we threw off our mail and fought baresark till all were dead together footnote for the details of this battle see skorro sturleson or the admirable description in bulwers harold  how camest thou then hither  styrkar the marshal escaped in the night and i with him and a few more and styrkar bade me bring the news to flanders to the countess while he took it to olaf haroldsson who lay off in the ships  and thou shalt take it martin get this man a horse a horse ye villains and a good one on your lives  and tosti is dead  dead like a hero harold offered him quarteroffered him his earldom they say even in the midst of battle but he would not take it he said he was the sigurdssons man now and true man he would be  harold offered himwhat art babbling about who fought you  harold godwinsson the king  where  at stanford brigg by york town  harold godwinsson slew harold sigurdsson after this wolves may eat lions  the godwinsson is a gallant fighter and a wise general or i had not been here now  get on thy horse man said he scornfully and impatiently and gallop if thou canst  i have ridden many a mile in ireland earl and have not forgotten my seat  thou hast hast thou said martin thou art thord gunlaugsson of waterford  that am i how knowest thou me man  i am of waterford thou hadst a slave lass once i think mew they called her mew her skin it was so white  whats that to thee asked thord turning on him savagely  why i meant no harm i saw her at waterford when i was a boy and thought her a fair lass enough that is all  and martin dropped into the rear by this time they were at the gates of st omer  as they rode side by side hereward got more details of the fight  i knew it would fall out so i foretold it said thord i had a dream i saw us come to english land and fight and i saw the banners floating and before the english army was a great witchwife and rode upon a wolf and he had a corpse in his bloody jaws and when he had eaten one up she threw him another till he had swallowed all  did she throw him thine asked martin who ran holding by the stirrup  that did she and eaten i saw myself yet here i am alive  then thy dreams were naught  i do not know that the wolf may have me yet  i fear thou art fey footnote prophesying his own death  what the devil is it to thee if i be  naught but be comforted i am a necromancer and this i know by my art that the weapon that will slay thee was never forged in flanders here  there was another man had a dream said thord turning from martin angrily he was standing in the kings ship and he saw a great witchwife with a fork and a trough stand on the island and he saw a fowl on every ships stem a raven or else an eagle and he heard the witchwife sing an evil song  by this time they were in st omer  hereward rode straight to the countess judiths house he never had entered it yet and was likely to be attacked if he entered it now but when the door was opened he thrust in with so earnest and sad a face that the servants let him pass but not without growling and motions as of getting their weapons  i come in peace my men i come in peace this is no time for brawls where is the steward or one of the countesss ladies tell her madam that hereward waits her commands and entreats her in the name of st mary and all saints to vouchsafe him one word in private  the lady hurried into the bower the next moment judith hurried out into the hall her fair face blanched her fair eyes wide with terror  hereward fell on his knee  what is this it must be bad news if you bring it  madam the grave covers all feuds earl tosti was a very valiant hero and would to god that we had been friends  she did not hear the end of the sentence but fell back with a shriek into the womens arms  hereward told them all that they needed to know of that fratricidal strife and then to thord gunlaugsson  have you any token that this is true mind what i warned you if you lied  this have i earl and ladies and he drew from his bosom a reliquary ulf the marshal took this off his neck and bade me give it to none but his lady therefore with your pardon sir earl i did not tell you that i had it not knowing whether you were an honest man  thou hast done well and an honest man thou shall find me come home and i will feed thee at my own table for i have been a searover and a viking myself  they left the reliquary with the ladies and went  see to this good man martin  that will i as the apple of my eye  and hereward went into torfridas room  i have news news  so have i  harold hardraade is slain and tosti too  where how  harold godwinsson slew them by york  brother has slain brother o god that died on cross murmured torfrida when will men look to thee and have mercy on their own souls but hereward i have newsnews more terrible by far it came an hour ago i have been dreading your coming back  say on if harold hardraade is dead no worse can happen  but harold godwinsson is dead  dead who next william of normandy the world seems coming to an end as the monks say it will soon footnote there was a general rumor abroad that the end of the world was at hand that the one thousand years of prophecy had expired  a great battle has been fought at a place they call heathfield  close by hastings close to the landingplace harold must have flown thither back from york what a captain the man is after all  was he is dead and all the godwinssons and england lost  if torfrida had feared the effect of her news her heart was lightened at once as hereward answered haughtily  england lost sussex is not england nor wessex either any more than harold was king thereof england lost let the tanner try to cross the watling street and he will find out that he has another stamp of englishmen to deal with  hereward hereward do not be unjust to the dead men saythe normans saythat they fought like heroes  i never doubted that but it makes me madas it does all eastern and northern mento hear these wessex churls and godwinssons calling themselves all england  torfrida shook her head to her as to most foreigners wessex and the southeast counties were england the most civilized the most norman the seat of royalty having all the prestige of law and order and wealth and she was shrewd enough to see that as it was the part of england which had most sympathy with norman civilization it was the very part where the norman could most easily gain and keep his hold the event proved that torfrida was right but all she said was it is dangerously near to france at least  it is that i would sooner see 100000 french north of the humber than 10000 in kent and sussex where he can hurry over supplies and men every week it is the startingpoint for him if he means to conquer england piecemeal  and he does  and he shall not and hereward started up and walked to and fro if all the godwinssons be dead there are leofricssons left i trust and siwards kin and the gospatricks in northumbria ah where were my nephews in the battle not killed too i trust  they were not in the battle  not with their new brotherinlaw much he has gained by throwing away the swanneck like a base hound as he was and marrying my pretty niece but where were they  no man knows clearly they followed him down as far as london and then lingered about the city meaning no man can tell what but we shall hearand i fear hear too muchbefore a week is over  heavens this is madness indeed this is the way to be eaten up one by one neither to do the thing nor leave it alone if i had been there if i had been there  you would have saved england my hero and torfrida believed her own words  i dont say that besides i say that england is not lost but there were but two things to do either to have sent to william at once and offered him the crown if he would but guarantee the danish laws and liberties to all north of the watling street and if he would fall on the godwinssons themselves by fair means or foul and send their heads to william  or what  or have marched down after him with every man they could muster and thrown themselves on the frenchmans flank in the battle or between him and the sea cutting him off from france oro that i had but been there what things could i have done and now these two wretched boys have fooled away their only chance  some say that they hoped for the crown themselves  whichnot both vain babies and hereward laughed bitterly i suppose one will murder the other next in order to make himself the stronger by being the sole rival to the tanner the midden cock sole rival to the eagle boy waltheof will set up his claim next i presume as siwards son and then gospatrick as ethelred evilcounsels greatgrandson and so forth and so forth till they all eat each other up and the tanners grandson eats the last what care i tell me about the battle my lady if you know aught that is more to my way than their statecraft  and torfrida told him all she knew of the great fight on heathfield downwhich men call senlacand the battle of hastings and as she told it in her wild eloquent fashion herewards face reddened and his eyes kindled and when she told of the last struggle round the dragon footnote i have dared to differ from the excellent authorities who say that the standard was that of a fighting man because the bayeux tapestry represents the last struggle as in front of a dragon standard which must beas is to be expectedthe old standard of wessex the standard of english royalty that harold had also a fighting man standard and that it was sent by william to the pope there is no reason to doubt but if the bayeux tapestry be correct the fury of the fight for the standard would be explained it would be a fight for the very symbol of king edwards dynasty standard of harolds mighty figure in the front of all hewing with his great doubleheaded axe and then rolling in gore and agony an arrow in his eye of the last rally of the men of kent of gurth the last defender of the standard falling by williams sword the standard hurled to the ground and the popish gonfanon planted in its placethen herewards eyes for the first and last time for many a year were flushed with noble tears and springing up he cried honor to the godwinssons honor to the southern men honor to all true english hearts why was i not there to go with them to valhalla  torfrida caught him round the neck because you are here my hero to free your country from her tyrants and win yourself immortal fame  fool that i am i verily believe i am crying  those tears said she as she kissed them away are more precious to torfrida than the spoils of a hundred fights for they tell me that hereward still loves his country still honors virtue even in a foe  and thus torfridawhether from womans sentiment of pity or from a womans instinctive abhorrence of villany and wronghad become there and then an englishwoman of the english as she proved by strange deeds and sufferings for many a year  where is that norseman martin asked hereward that night ere he went to bed i want to hear more of poor hardraade  you cant speak to him now master he is sound asleep this two hours and warm enough i will warrant  where  in the great green bed with blue curtains just above the kitchen  what nonsense is this  the bed where you and i shall lie some day and the kitchen which we shall be sent down to to turn our own spits unless we mend our manners mightily  hereward looked at the man madness glared in his eyes unmistakably  you have killed him  and buried him cheating the priests  villain cried hereward seizing him  take your hands off my throat master he was only my father  hereward stood shocked and puzzled after all the man was nomansman and would not be missed and martin lightfoot letting alone his madness was as a third hand and foot to him all day long  so all he said was i hope you have buried him well and safely  you may walk your bloodhound over his grave tomorrow without finding him  and where he lay hereward never knew but from that night martin got a trick of stroking and patting his little axe and talking to it as if it had been alive     chapter xviii  how earl godwins widow came to st omer   it would be vain to attempt even a sketch of the reports which came to flanders from england during the next two years or of the conversation which ensued thereon between baldwin and his courtiers or hereward and torfrida two reports out of three were doubtless false and two conversations out of three founded on those false reports  it is best therefore to interrupt the thread of the story by some small sketch of the state of england after the battle of hastings that so we may at least guess at the tenor of hereward and torfridas counsels  william had as yet conquered little more than the south of england hardly indeed all that for herefordshire worcestershire and the neighboring parts which had belonged to sweyn harolds brother were still insecure and the noble old city of exeter confident in her roman walls did not yield till two years after in ad 1068  north of his conquered territory mercia stretched almost across england from chester to the wash governed by edwin and morcar the two fair grandsons of leofric the great earl and sons of alfgar edwin called himself earl of mercia and held the danish burghs on the extreme northwest the roman city of chester was his while on the extreme southeast as domesday book testifies morcar held large lands round bourne and throughout the south of lincolnshire besides calling himself the earl of northumbria the young men seemed the darlings of the halfdanish northmen chester coventry derby nottingham leicester stamford a chain of fortified towns stretching across england were at their command blethyn prince of north wales was their nephew  northumbria likewise was not yet in williams hands indeed it was in no mans hands since the free danes north of the humber had expelled tosti harolds brother putting morcar in his place and helped that brother to slay him at stanford brigg morcar instead of residing in his earldom of northumbria had made one oswulf his deputy but he had rivals enough there was gospatrick claiming through his grandfather uchtred and strong in the protection of his cousin malcolm king of scotland there was young waltheof the forest thief who had been born to siward biorn in his old age just after the battle of dunsinane a fine and gallant young man destined to a swift and sad end  william sent to the northumbrians one copsi a thane of mark and worth as his procurator to expel oswulf oswulf and the landfolk answered by killing copsi and doing every man that which was right in his own eyes  william determined to propitiate the young earls perhaps he intended to govern the centre and north of england through them as feudal vassals and hoped meanwhile to pay his norman conquerors sufficiently out of the forfeited lands of harold and those who had fought by his side at hastings it was not his policy to make himself much less to call himself the conqueror of england he claimed to be its legitimate sovereign deriving from his cousin edward the confessor and whosoever would acknowledge him as such had neither right nor cause to fear therefore he sent for the young earls he courted waltheof and more really loved him he promised edwin his daughter in marriage some say it was constance afterwards married to alan fergant of brittany but it may also have been the beautiful adelaide who none knew why early gave up the world and died in a convent be that as it may the two young people saw each and loved each other at rouen whither william took waltheof edwin and his brother as honored guests in name in reality as hostages likewise  with the same rational and prudent policy william respected the fallen royal families both of harold and of edward at least he warred not against women and the wealth and influence of the great english ladies was enormous edith sister of harold and widow of the confessor lived in wealth and honor at winchester gyda harolds mother retained exeter and her land aldytha footnote see her history told as none other can tell it in bulwers harold or elfgiva sister of edwin and morcar niece of hereward and widow first of griffin of wales and then of harold lived rich and safe in chester godiva the countess owned so antiquarians say manors from cheshire to lincolnshire which would be now yearly worth the income of a great duke agatha the hungarian widow of edmund the outlaw dwelt at romsey in hampshire under williams care her son edward etheling the rightful heir of england was treated by william not only with courtesy but with affection and allowed to rebel when he did rebel with impunity for the descendant of rollo the heathen viking had become a civilized chivalrous christian knight his mighty forefather would have split the ethelings skull with his own axe a frank king would have shaved the young mans head and immersed him in a monastery an eastern sultan would have thrust out his eyes or strangled him at once but william however cruel however unscrupulous had a knightly heart and somewhat of a christian conscience and his conduct to his only lawful rival is a noble trait amid many sins  so far all went well till william went back to france to be likened not as his ancestors to the gods of valhalla or the barbarous and destroying viking of mythic ages but to caesar pompey vespasian and the civilized and civilizing heroes of classic rome  but while he sat at the easter feast at fécamp displaying to franks flemings and bretons as well as to his own normans the treasures of edwards palace at westminster and more english wealth than could be found in the whole estate of gaul while he sat there in his glory with his young dupes edwin morcar and waltheof by his side having sent harolds banner in triumph to the pope as a token that he had conquered the church as well as the nation of england and having founded abbeys as thankofferings to him who had seemed to prosper him in his great crime at that very hour the handwriting was on the wall unseen by man and he and his policy and his race were weighed in the balance and found wanting  for now broke out in england that wrongdoing which endured as long as she was a mere appanage and foreign farm of norman kings whose hearts and homes were across the seas in france fitzosbern and odo the warriorprelate williams halfbrother had been left as his regents in england little do they seem to have cared for williams promise to the english people that they were to be ruled still by the laws of edward the confessor and that where a grant of land was made to a norman he was to hold it as the englishman had done before him with no heavier burdens on himself but with no heavier burdens on the poor folk who tilled the land for him oppression began lawlessness and violence men were illtreated on the highways and womenwhat was worsein their own homes and the regents abetted the illdoers it seems says a most impartial historian footnote the late sir f palgrave as if the normans released from all authority all restraint all fear of retaliation determined to reduce the english nation to servitude and drive them to despair  in the latter attempt they succeeded but too soon in the former they succeeded at last but they paid dearly for their success  hot young englishmen began to emigrate some went to the court of constantinople to join the varanger guard and have their chance of a polotaswarf like harold hardraade some went to scotland to malcolm canmore and brooded over return and revenge but harolds sons went to their fathers cousin to sweynswendsweno ulfsson and called on him to come and reconquer england in the name of his uncle canute the great and many an englishman went with them  these things gospatrick watched as earl so far as he could make any one obey him in the utter subversion of all order of the lands between forth and tyne and he determined to flee ere evil befell him to his cousin malcolm canmore taking with him marlesweyn of lincolnshire who had fought it is said by harolds side at hastings and young waltheof of york but moreover having a head and being indeed as his final success showed a man of ability and courage he determined on a stroke of policy which had incalculable aftereffects on the history of scotland he persuaded agatha the hungarian margaret and christina her daughters and edgar the etheling himself to flee with him to scotland how he contrived to send them messages to romsey far south in hampshire how they contrived to escape to the humber and thence up to the forth this is a romance in itself of which the chroniclers have left hardly a hint but the thing was done and at st margarets hope as tradition tells the scottish king met and claimed as his unwilling bride that fair and holy maiden who was destined to soften his fierce passions to civilize and purify his people and to becomeif all had their just duesthe true patron saint of scotland  malcolm canmore promised a mighty army sweyn a mighty fleet and meanwhile eustace of boulogne the confessors brotherinlaw himself a norman rebelled at the head of the downtrodden men of kent and the welshmen were harrying herefordshire with fire and sword in revenge for norman ravages  but as yet the storm did not burst william returned and with him something like order he conquered exeter he destroyed churches and towns to make his new forest he brought over his queen matilda with pomp and great glory and with her the bayeux tapestry which she had wrought with her own hands and meanwhile sweyn ulfsson was too busy threatening olaf haroldsson the new king of norway to sail for england and the sons of king harold of england had to seek help from the irish danes and ravaging the country round bristol be beaten off by the valiant burghers with heavy loss  so the storm did not burst and need not have burst it may be at all had william kept his plighted word but he would not give his fair daughter to edwin his norman nobles doubtless looked upon such an alliance as debasing to a civilized lady in their eyes the englishman was a barbarian and though the norman might well marry the englishwoman if she had beauty or wealth it was a dangerous precedent to allow the englishman to marry the norman woman and that woman a princess beside there were those who coveted edwins broad lands roger de montgomery who already it is probable held part of them as earl of shrewsbury had no wish to see edwin the soninlaw of his sovereign be the cause what it may william faltered and refused and edwin and morcar left the court of westminster in wrath waltheof followed them having discoveredwhat he was weak enough continually to forget againthe treachery of the norman the young earls went off one midlandward one northward the people saw their wrongs in those of their earls and the rebellion burst forth at once the welsh under blethyn and the cumbrians under malcolm and donaldbain giving their help in the struggle  it was the year 1069 a more evil year for england than even the year of hastings  the rebellion was crushed in a few months the great general marched steadily north taking the boroughs one by one storming massacring young and old burning sometimes whole towns and leaving as he went on a new portent a norman donjontill then all but unseen in englandas a place of safety for his garrisons at oxford sacked horribly and all but destroyed at warwick destroyed utterly at nottingham at stafford at shrewsbury at cambridge on the huge barrow which overhangs the fen and at york itself which had opened its gates trembling to the great norman strategist at each doomed free borough rose a castle with its tall square tower within its bailey around and all the appliances of that ancient roman science of fortification of which the danes as well as the saxons knew nothing their struggle had only helped to tighten their bonds and what wonder there was among them neither unity nor plan nor governing mind and will herewards words had come true the only man save gospatrick who had a head in england was harold godwinsson and he lay in waltham abbey while the monks sang masses for his soul  edwin morcar and waltheof trembled before a genius superior to their owna genius indeed which had not its equal then in christendom they came in and begged grace of the king they got it but edwins earldom was forfeited and he and his brother became from thenceforth desperate men  malcolm of scotland trembled likewise and asked for peace the clans it is said rejoiced thereat having no wish for a war which could buy them neither spoil nor land malcolm sent ambassadors to william and took that oath of fealty to the basileus of britain which more than one scottish king and kinglet had taken beforewith the secret proviso which during the middle ages seems to have been thoroughly understood in such cases by both parties that he should be williams man just as long as william could compel him to be so and no longer  then came cruel and unjust confiscations ednoth the standardbearer had fallen at bristol fighting for william against the haroldssons yet all his lands were given away to normans edwin and morcars lands were parted likewise andto specify cases which bear especially on the history of herewardoger the briton got many of morcars manors round bourne and gilbert of ghent many belonging to marlesweyn about lincoln city and so did that valiant and crafty knight find his legs once more on other mens ground and reappears in monkish story as the most devout and pious earl gilbert of ghent  what followed hereward heard not from flying rumors but from one who had seen and known and judged of all footnote for gydas coming to st omer that year see ordericus vitalis  for one day about this time hereward was riding out of the gate of st omer when the porter appealed to him begging for admittance were some twenty women and a clerk or two and they must needs see the châtelain the châtelain was away what should he do  hereward looked at the party and saw to his surprise that they were englishwomen and two of them women of rank to judge from the rich materials of their travelstained and tattered garments the ladies rode on sorry country garrons plainly hired from the peasants who drove them the rest of the women had walked and weary and footsore enough they were  you are surely englishwomen asked he of the foremost as he lifted his cap  the lady bowed assent beneath a heavy veil  then you are my guests let them pass in and hereward threw himself off his horse and took the ladys bridle  stay she said with an accent half wessex half danish i seek the countess judith if it will please you to tell me where she lives  the countess judith lady lives no longer in st omer since her husbands death she lives with her mother at bruges  the lady made a gesture of disappointment  it were best for you therefore to accept my hospitality till such time as i can send you and your ladies on to bruges  i must first know who it is who offers me hospitality  this was said so proudly that hereward answered proudly enough in return  i am hereward leofricsson whom his foes call hereward the outlaw and his friends hereward the master of knights  she started and threw her veil hack looking intently at him he for his part gave but one glance and then cried  mother of heaven you are the great countess  yes i was that woman once if all be not a dream i am now i know not what seeking hospitalityif i can believe my eyes and earsof godivas son  and from godivas son you shall have it as though you were godivas self god so deal with my mother madam as i will deal with you  his fathers wit and his mothers beauty said the great countess looking upon him too too like my own lost harold  not so my lady i am a dwarf compared to him and hereward led the garron on by the bridle keeping his cap in hand while all wondered who the dame could be before whom hereward the champion would so abase himself  leofrics son does me too much honor he has forgotten in his chivalry that i am godwins widow  i have not forgotten that you are sprakalegs daughter and niece of canute king of kings neither have i forgotten that you are an english lady in times in which all english folk are one and all old english feuds are wiped away  in english blood ah if these last words of yours were true as you perhaps might make them true england might be saved even yet  saved  if there were one man in it who cared for aught but himself  hereward was silent and thoughtful  he had sent martin back to his house to tell torfrida to prepare bath and food for the countess gyda with all her train was coming to be her guest and when they entered the court torfrida stood ready  is this your lady asked gyda as hereward lifted her from her horse  i am his lady and your servant said torfrida bowing  child child bow not to me talk not of servants to a wretched slave who only longs to crawl into some hole and die forgetting all she was and all she had  and the great countess reeled with weariness and woe and fell upon torfridas neck  a tall veiled lady next her helped to support her and between them they almost carried her through the hall and into torfridas best guestchamber  and there they gave her wine and comforted her and let her weep awhile in peace  the second lady had unveiled herself displaying a beauty which was still brilliant in spite of sorrow hunger the stains of travel and more than forty years of life  she must be gunhilda guessed torfrida to herself and not amiss  she offered gyda a bath which she accepted eagerly like a true dane  i have not washed for weeks not since we sat starving on the flatholme there in the severn sea i have become as foul as my own fortunes and why not it is all of a piece why should not beggars beg unwashed  but when torfrida offered gunhilda the bath she declined  i have done lady with such carnal vanities what use in cleansing that body which is itself unclean and whitening the outside of this sepulchre if i can but cleanse my soul fit for my heavenly bridegroom the body may becomeas it must at lastfood for worms  she will needs enter religion poor child said gyda and what wonder  i have chosen the better part and it shall not be taken from me  taken taken hark to her she means to mock me the proud nun with that same taken  god forbid mother  then why say taken to me from whom all is takenhusband sons wealth land renown powerpower which i loved wretch that i was as well as husband and as sons ah god the girl is right better to rot in the convent than writhe in the world better never to have had than to have had and lost  amen said gunhilda blessed are the barren and they that never gave suck saith the lord  no not so cried torfrida better countess to have had and lost than never to have had at all the glutton was right swine as he was when he said that not even heaven could take from him the dinners he had eaten how much more we if we say not even heaven can take from us the love wherewith we have loved will not our souls be richer thereby through all eternity  in purgatory asked gunhilda  in purgatory or where else you will i love my love and though my love prove false he has been true though he trample me under foot he has held me in his bosom though he kill me he has lived for me  what i have had will still be mine when that which i have shall fail me  and you would buy short joy with lasting woe  that would i like a brave mans child i saythe present is mine and i will enjoy it as greedily as a child let the morrow take thought for the things of itselfcountess your bath is ready  nineteen years after when the great conqueror lay tossing with agony and remorse upon his dying bed haunted by the ghosts of his victims the clerks of st saviours in bruges city were putting up a leaden tablet which remains they say unto this very day to the memory of one whose gentle soul had gently passed away charitable to the poor kind and agreeable to her attendants courteous to strangers and only severe to herself gunhilda had lingered on in a world of war and crime and had gone it may be to meet torfrida beyond the grave and there finish their doubtful argument  the countess was served with food in torfridas chamber hereward and his wife refused to sit and waited on her standing  i wish to show these saucy flemings said he that an english princess is a princess still in the eyes of one more nobly born than any of them  but after she had eaten she made torfrida sit before her on the bed and hereward likewise and began to talk eagerly as one who had not unburdened her mind for many weeks and eloquently too as became sprakalegs daughter and godwins wife  she told them how she had fled from the storm of exeter with a troop of women who dreaded the brutalities of the normans footnote to do william justice he would not allow his men to enter the city while they were bloodhot and so prevented as far as he could the excesses which gyda had feared how they had wandered up through devon found fishers boats at watchet in somersetshire and gone off to the little desert island of the flatholme in hopes of there meeting with the irish fleet which her sons edmund and godwin were bringing against the west of england how the fleet had never come and they had starved for many days and how she had bribed a passing merchantman to take her and her wretched train to the land of baldwin the débonnaire who might have pity on her for the sake of his daughter judith and tosti her husband who died in his sins  and at his name her tears began to flow afresh fallen in his overweening pridelike sweyn like harold like herself  the time was when i would not weep if i could i would not for a year lady after senlac i sat like a stone i hardened my heart like a wall of brass against god and man then there upon the flatholme feeding on shellfish listening to the wail of the seafowl looking outside  the wan water for the sails which never came my heart broke down in a moment and i heard a voice crying there is no help in man go thou to god and i answered that were a beggars trick to go to god in need when i went not to him in plenty no without god i planned and without him i must fail without him i went into the battle and without him i must bide the brunt and at best can he give me back my sons and i hardened my heart again like a stone and shed no tear till i saw your fair face this day  and now she said turning sharply on hereward what do you do here do you not know that your nephews lands are parted between grooms from angers and scullions from normandy  so much the worse for both them and the grooms  sir  you forget lady that i am an outlaw  but do you not know that your mothers lands are seized likewise  she will take refuge with her grandsons who are as i hear again on good terms with their new master showing thereby a most laudable and christian spirit of forgiveness  on good terms do you not know then that they are fighting again outlaws and desperate at the frenchmans treachery do you not know that they have been driven out of york after defending the city street by street house by house do you not know that there is not an old man or a child in arms left in york and that your nephews and the few fighting men who were left went down the humber in boats and north to scotland to gospatrick and waltheof do you not know that your mother is left aloneat bourne or god knows whereto endure at the hands of norman ruffians what thousands more endure  hereward made no answer but played with his dagger  and do you not know that england is ready to burst into a blaze if there be one man wise enough to put the live coal into the right place that sweyn ulffson his kinsman or osbern his brother will surely land there within the year with a mighty host and that if there be one man in england of wit enough and knowledge enough of war to lead the armies of england the frenchman may be driven into the seais there any here who understands english  none but ourselves  and canutes nephew sit on canutes throne  hereward still played with his dagger  not the sons of harold then asked he after a while  never i promise you thati countess gyda their grandmother  why promise me of all men o great lady  becausei will tell you after but this i say my curse on the grandson of mine who shall try to seize that fatal crown which cost the life of my fairest my noblest my wisest my bravest  hereward bowed his head as if consenting to the praise of harold but he knew who spoke and he was thinking within himself her curse may be on him who shall seize and yet not on him to whom it is given  all that they young and unskilful lads have a right to ask is their fathers earldoms and their fathers lands edwin and morcar would keep their earldoms as of right it is a pity that there is no lady of the house of godwin whom we could honor by offering her to one of your nephews in return for their nobleness in giving aldytha to my harold but this foolish girl here refuses to wed  and is past forty thought hereward to himself  however some plan to join the families more closely together might be thought of one of the young earls might marry judith here footnote tostis widow daughter of baldwin of flanders waltheof would have northumbria in right of his father and ought to be well contentfor although she is somewhat older than he she is peerlessly beautifulto marry your niece aldytha footnote harolds widow  and gospatrick  gospatrick she said with a halfsneer will be as sure as he is able to get something worth having for himself out of any medley let him have scotch northumbria if he claim it he is a dane and our work will be to make a danish england once and forever  but what of sweyns gallant holders and housecarles who are to help to do this mighty deed  senlac left gaps enough among the noblemen of the south which they can fill up in the place of the french scum who now riot over wessex and if that should not suffice what higher honor for me or for my daughter the queendowager than to devote our lands to the heroes who have won them back for us  hereward hoped inwardly that gyda would be as good as her word for her greedy grasp had gathered to itself before the battle of hastings no less than sixandthirty thousand acres of good english soil  i have always heard said he bowing that if the lady gyda had been born a man england would have had another allseeing and alldaring statesman and earl godwin a rival instead of a helpmate now i believe what i have heard  but torfrida looked sadly at the countess there was something pitiable in the sight of a woman ruined bereaved seemingly hopeless portioning out the very land from which she was a fugitive unable to restrain the passion for intrigue which had been the toil and the bane of her sad and splendid life  and now she went on surely some kind saint brought me even on my first landing to you of all living men  doubtless the blessed st bertin beneath whose shadow we repose here in peace said hereward somewhat dryly  i will go barefoot to his altar tomorrow and offer my last jewel said gunhilda  you said gyda without noticing her daughter are above all men the man who is needed and she began praising herewards valor his fame his eloquence his skill as a general and engineer and when he suggested smiling that he was an exile and an outlaw she insisted that he was all the fitter from that very fact he had no enemies among the nobles he had been mixed up in none of the civil wars and blood feuds of the last fifteen years he was known only as that which he was the ablest captain of his daythe only man who could cope with william the only man whom all parties in england would alike obey  and so with flattery as well as with truth she persuaded if not hereward at least torfrida that he was the man destined to free england once more and that an earldomanything which he chose to askwould be the sure reward of his assistance  torfrida said hereward that night kiss me well for you will not kiss me again for a while  what  i am going to england tomorrow  alone  alone i and martin to spy out the land and a dozen or so of housecarles to take care of the ship in harbor  but you have promised to fight the viscount of pinkney  i will be back again in time for him not a wordi must go to england or go mad  but countess gyda who will squire her to bruges  you and the rest of my men you must tell her all she has a womans heart and will understand and tell baldwin i shall be back within the month if i am alive on land or water  hereward hereward the french will kill you  not while i have your armor on peace little fool are you actually afraid for hereward at last  o heavens when am i not afraid for you and she cried herself to sleep upon his bosom but she knew that it was the right and knightly and christian thing to do  two days after a long ship ran out of calais and sailed away north and east     chapter xix  how hereward cleared bourne of frenchmen   it may have been well a week after that hereward rode from the direction of boston with martin running at his heels  as hereward rode along the summer wold the summer sun sank low till just before it went down he came to an island of small enclosed fields high banks elmtrees and a farm inside one of those most ancient holdings of the south and east counts still to be distinguished by their huge banks and dikes full of hedgerow timber from the more modern cornlands outside which were in herewards time mostly common pasturelands  this should be azerdun said he and there inside as i live stands azer getting in his crops but who has he with him  with the old man were some halfdozen men of his own rank some helping the serfs with might and main one or two standing on the top of the banks as if on the lookout but all armed capàpie  his friends are helping him to get them in quoth martin for fear of the rascally normans a pleasant and peaceable country we have come back to  and a very strong fortress are they holding said hereward against either norman horsemen or norman arrows how to dislodge those six fellows without six times their number i do not see it is well to recollect that  and so he did and turned to use again and again in after years the strategetic capabilities of an oldfashioned english farm  hereward spurred his horse up to the nearest gate and was instantly confronted by a little fairhaired man as broad as he was tall who heaved up a long twybill or double axe and bade him across the gate go to a certain place  little winter little winter my chuck my darling my mad fellow my brotherinarms my brother in robbery and murder are you grown so honest in your old age that you will not know hereward the wolfshead  hereward shrieked the doughty little man i took you for an accursed norman in those outlandish clothes and lifting up no little voice he shouted  hereward is back and martin lightfoot at his heels  the gate was thrown open and hereward all but pulled off his horse he was clapped on the back turned round and round admired from head to foot shouted at by old companions of his boyhood naughty young housecarles of his old troop now settled down into honest thriving yeomen hard working and hard fighting who had heard again and again with pride of his doughty doings over sea there was winter and gwenoch and gery herewards cousinancestor it may be of the ancient and honorable house of that name and of those parts and duti and outi the two valiant twins and ulfard the white and others some of whose names and those of their sons still stand in domesdaybook  and what asked hereward after the first congratulations were over of my mother what of the folk at bourne  all looked each at the other and were silent  you are too late young lord said azer  too late  the normanazer called him what most men called him thenhas given it to a man of gilbert of ghentshis butler groom cook for aught i know  to gilberts man and my mother  god help your mother and your young brother too we only know that three days ago some fiveandtwenty french marched into the place  and you did not stop them  young sir who are we to stop an army we have enough to keep our own gilbert let alone the villain ivo of spalding can send a hundred men down on us in fourandtwenty hours  then i said hereward in a voice of thunder will find the way to send two hundred down on him and turning his horse from the gate he rode away furiously towards bourne  he turned back as suddenly and galloped into the field  lads old comrades will you stand by me if i need you will you follow hereward as hundreds have followed him already if he will only go before  we will we will  i shall be back ere morning what you have to do i will tell you then  stop and eat but for a quarter of an hour  then hereward swore a great oath by oak and ash and thorn that he would neither eat bread nor drink water while there was a norman left in bourne  a little ale then if no water said azer  hereward laughed and rode away  you will not go singlehanded against all those ruffians shouted the old man after him saddle lads and go with him some of you for very shames sake  but when they galloped after hereward he sent them back he did not know yet he said what he would do better that they should gather their forces and see what men they could afford him in case of open battle and he rode swiftly on  when he came within the lands of bourne it was dark  so much the better thought hereward i have no wish to see the old place till i have somewhat cleaned it out  he rode slowly into the long street between the overhanging gables at the upper end he could see the high garden walls of his mothers house and rising over them the great hall its narrow windows all ablaze with light with a bitter growl he rode on trying to recollect a house where he could safely lodge martin pointed one out  old viking surturbrand the housecarle did live there and maybe lives there still  we will try and martin knocked at the door  the wicket was opened but not the door and through the wicket window a surly voice asked who was there  who lives here  perry son of surturbrand who art thou who askest  an honest gentleman and his servant looking for a nights lodging  this is no place for honest folk  as for that we dont wish to be more honest than you would have us but lodging we will pay for freely and well  we want none of your money and the wicket was shut  martin pulled out his axe and drove the panel in  what are you doing we shall rouse the town said hereward  let be these are no french but honest english and like one all the better for a little horseplay  what didst do that for asked the surly voice again were it not for those rascal frenchmen up above i would come out and split thy skull for thee  if there be frenchmen up above said martin in a voice of feigned terror take us in for the love of the virgin and all the saints or murdered we shall be ere morning light  you have no call to stay in the town man unless you like  hereward rode close to the wicket and said in a low voice i am a nobleman of flanders good sir and a sworn foe to all french my horse is weary and cannot make a step forward and if you be a christian man you will take me in and let me go off safe ere morning light  from flanders and the man turned and seemed to consult those within at length the door was slowly opened and perry appeared his double axe over his shoulder  if you be from flanders come in for mercy but be quick ere those frenchmen get wind of you  hereward went in five or six men were standing round the long table upon which they had just laid down their double axes and javelins more than one countenance hereward recognized at once over the peatfire in the chimneycorner sat a very old man his hands upon his knees as he warmed his bare feet at the embers he started up at the noise and hereward saw at once that it was old surturbrand and that he was blind  who is it is hereward come asked he with the dull dreamy voice of age  not hereward father said some one but a knight from flanders  the old man dropped his head upon his breast again with a querulous whine while herewards heart beat high at hearing his own name at all events he was among friends and approaching the table he unbuckled his sword and laid it down among the other weapons at least said he i shall have no need of thee as long as i am here among honest men  what shall i do with my masters horse asked martin he cant stand in the street to be stolen by drunken french horseboys  bring him in at the front door and out at the back said perry fine times these when a man dare not open his own yardgate  you seem to be all besieged here said hereward how is this  besieged we are said the man and then partly to turn the subject off will it please you to eat noble sir  hereward ate and drank while his hosts eyed him not without some lingering suspicion but still with admiration and some respect his splendid armor and weapons as well as the golden locks which fell far below his shoulders and conveniently hid a face which he did not wish yet to have recognized showed him to be a man of the highest rank while the palm of his small hand as hard and bony as any woodmans proclaimed him to be no novice of a fighting man the strong flemish accent which both he and martin lightfoot had assumed prevented the honest englishmen from piercing his disguise they watched him while he in turn watched them struck by their uneasy looks and sullen silence  we are a dull company said he after a while courteously enough we used to be told in flanders that there were none such stout drinkers and none such jolly singers as you gallant men of the danelagh here  dull times make dull company said one and no offence to you sir knight  are you such a stranger asked perry that you do not know what has happened in this town during the last three days  no good i will warrant if you have frenchmen in it  why was not hereward here wailed the old man in the corner it never would have happened if he had been in the town  what asked hereward trying to command himself  what has happened said perry makes a free englishmans blood boil to tell of here sir knight three days ago comes in this frenchman with some twenty ruffians of his own and more of one tailleboiss too to see him safe says that this new king this baseborn frenchman has given away all earl morcars lands and that bourne is his kills a man or two upsets the women gets drunk ruffles and roisters breaks into my ladys bower calling her to give up her keys and when she gives them will have all her jewels too she faces them like a brave princess and two of the hounds lay hold of her and say that she shall ride through bourne as she rode through coventry the boy godwinhe that was the great earls godson our last hope the last of our housedraws sword on them and he a boy of sixteen summers kills them both out of hand the rest set on him cut his head off and there it sticks on the gable spike of the hall to this hour and do you ask after that why free englishmen are dull company  and our turn will come next growled somebody the turn will go all round no mans life or land wife or daughters will be safe soon for these accursed frenchmen unless as the old man says hereward comes back  once again the old man wailed out of the chimneycorner why did they ever send hereward away i warned the good earl i warned my good lady many a time to let him sow his wild oats and be done with them or they might need him some day when they could not find him he was a lad he was a lad and again he whined and sank into silence  hereward heard all this dryeyed hardening his heart into a great resolve this is a dark story said he calmly and it would behoove me as a gentleman to succor this distressed lady did i but know how tell me what i can do now and i will do it  your health cried one you speak like a true knight  and he looks the man to keep his word ill warrant him spoke another  he does said perry shaking his head but if anything could have been done sir be sure we would have done it but all our armed men are scattered up and down the country each taking care as is natural of his own cattle and his own women there are not ten menatarms in bourne this night and what is worse sir as you know who seem to have known war as well as me there is no man to lead them  here hereward was on the point of saying and what if i led youon the point too of discovering himself but he stopped short  was it fair to involve this little knot of gallant fellows in what might be a hopeless struggle and have all bourne burned over their heads ere morning by the ruffian frenchmen no his mothers quarrel was his own private quarrel he would go alone and see the strength of the enemy and after that may be he would raise the country on them orand half a dozen plans suggested themselves to his crafty brain as he sat brooding and scheming then as always utterly selfconfident  he was startled by a burst of noise outsidemusic laughter and shouts  there said perry bitterly are those frenchmen dancing and singing in the hall with my lord godwins head above them and curses bitter and deep went round the room they sat sullen and silent it may be for an hour or more only moving when at some fresh outbreak of revelry the old man started from his doze and asked if that was hereward coming  and who is this hereward of whom you speak said hereward at last  we thought you might know him sir knight if you come from flanders as you say you do said three or four voices in a surprised and surly tone  certainly i know such a man if he be hereward the wolfshead hereward the outlaw as they call him and a good soldier he is though he be not yet made a knight and married too to a rich and fair lady i served under this hereward a few months ago in the friesland war and know no man whom i would sooner follow  nor i neither chimed in martin lightfoot from the other end of the table  nor we cried all the menatarms at once each vying with the other in extravagant stories of their heros prowess and in asking the knight of flanders whether they were true or not  to avoid offending them hereward was forced to confess to a great many deeds which he had never done but he was right glad to find that his fame had reached his native place and that he could count on the men if he needed them  but who is this hereward said he that he should have to do with your town here  half a dozen voices at once told him his own story  i always heard said he dryly that that gentleman was of some very noble kin and i will surely tell him all that has befallen here as soon as i return to flanders  at last they grew sleepy and the men went out and brought in bundles of sweet rush and spread them against the wall and prepared to lie down each his weapon by his side and when they were lain down hereward beckoned to him perry and martin lightfoot and went out into the back yard under the pretence of seeing to his horse  perry surturbrandsson said he you seem to be an honest man as we in foreign parts hold all the danelagh to be now it is fixed in my mind to go up and my servant to your hall and see what those french upstarts are about will you trust me to go without my fleeing back here if i am found out or in any way bringing you to harm by mixing you up in my private matters and will you if i do not come back keep for your own the horse which is in your stable and give moreover this purse and this ring to your lady if you can find means to see her face to face and say thus to herthat he that sent that purse and ring may be found if he be alive at st omer or with baldwin count of flanders and that if he be dead as he is like enough to be his trade being naught but war she will still find at st omer a home and wealth and friends till these evil times be overpast  as hereward had spoken with some slight emotion he had dropped unawares his assumed flemish accent and had spoken in broad burly lincolnshire and therefore it was that perry who had been staring at him by the moonlight all the while said when he was done tremblingly  either you are hereward or you are his fetch you speak like hereward you look like hereward just what hereward would be now you are you are my lord and you cannot deny it  perry if you know me speak of me to no living soul save to your lady my mother and let me and my servingman go free out of your yardgate if i ask you before morning to open it again to me you will know that there is not a frenchman left in the hall of bourne  perry threw his arms around him and embraced him silently  get me only said hereward some long womans gear and black mantle if you can to cover this bright armor of mine  perry went off in silence as one stunnedbrought the mantle and let them out of the yardgate in ten minutes more the two slipping in by wellknown paths stood under the gable of the great hall not a soul was stirring outside the serfs were all cowering in their huts like so many rabbits in their burrows listening in fear to the revelry of their new tyrants the night was dark but not so dark but that hereward could see between him and the sky his brothers long locks floating in the breeze  that i must have down at least said he in a low voice  then here is wherewithal said martin lightfoot as he stumbled over something the drunken villains have left the ladder in the yard  hereward got up the ladder took down the head and wrapped it in the cloak and ere he did so kissed the cold forehead how he had hated that boy well at least he had never wilfully harmed himor the boy him either for that matter and now he had died like a man killing his foe he was of the true old blood after all and hereward felt that he would have given all that he had save his wife or his swordhand to have that boy alive again to pet him and train him and teach him to fight at his side  then he slipped round to one of the narrow unshuttered windows and looked in the hall was in a wasteful blaze of lighta whole months candles burning in one night the table was covered with all his fathers choicest plate the wine was running waste upon the floor the men were lolling at the table in every stage of drunkenness the loose women campfollowers and such like almost as drunk as their masters and at the table head most drunk of all sat in earl leofrics seat the new lord of bourne  hereward could scarce believe his eyes he was none other than gilbert of ghents stout flemish cook whom he had seen many a time in scotland hereward turned from the window in disgust but looked again as he heard words which roused his anger still more  for in the open space nearest the door stood a gleeman a dancing harping foulmouthed fellow who was showing off apes tricks jesting against the english and shuffling about in mockeries of english dancing at some particularly coarse jest of his the new lord of bourne burst into a roar of admiration  ask what thou wilt fellow and thou shalt have it thou wilt find me a better master to thee than ever was morcar the english barbarian  the scoundrel say the old chroniclers made a request concerning herewards family which cannot be printed here  hereward ground his teeth if thou livest till morning light said he i will not  the last brutality awoke some better feeling in one of the girlsa large coarse fleming who sat by the new lords side fine words said she scornfully enough for the sweepings of norman and flemish kennels you forget that you left one of this very leofrics sons behind in flanders who would besom all out if he was here before the mornings dawn  hereward cried the cook striking her down with a drunken blow the scoundrel who stole the money which the frisians sent to count baldwin and gave it to his own troops we are safe enough from him at all events he dare not show his face on this side the alps for fear of the gallows  hereward had heard enough he slipped down from the window to martin and led him round the house  now then down with the ladder quick and dash in the door i go in stay thou outside if any man passes me see that he pass not thee  martin chuckled a ghostly laugh as he helped the ladder down in another moment the door was burst in and hereward stood upon the threshold he gave one warshouthis own terrible nameand then rushed forward as he passed the gleeman he gave him one stroke across the loins the wretch fell shrieking  and then began a murder grim and great they fought with alecups with knives with benches but drunken and unarmed they were hewn down like sheep fourteen normans says the chronicler were in the hall when hereward burst in when the sun rose there were fourteen heads upon the gable escape had been impossible martin had laid the ladder across the door and the few who escaped the masters terrible sword stumbled over it to be brained by the mans not less terrible axe  then hereward took up his brothers head and went in to his mother  the women in the bower opened to him they had seen all that passed from the gallery above which as usual hidden by a curtain enabled the women to watch unseen what passed in the hall below  the lady godiva sat crouched together all but alonefor her bowermaidens had fled or been carried off long sinceupon a low stool beside a long dark thing covered with a pall so utterly crushed was she that she did not even lift up her head as hereward entered  he placed his ghastly burden reverently beneath the pall and then went and knelt before his mother  for a while neither spoke a word then the lady godiva suddenly drew back her hood and dropping on her knees threw her arms round herewards neck and wept till she could weep no more  blessed strong arms sobbed she at last around me to feel something left in the world to protect me something left in the world which loves me  you forgive me mother  you forgive me it was i i who was in faulti who should have cherished you my strongest my bravest my noblestnow my all  no it was all my fault and on my head is all this misery if i had been here as i ought to have been all this might have never happened  you would only have been murdered too no thank god you were away or god would have taken you with the rest his arm is bared against me and his face turned away from me all in vain in vain vain to have washed my hands in innocency and worshipped him night and day vain to have builded minsters in his honor and heaped the shrines of his saints with gold vain to have fed the hungry and clothed the naked and washed the feet of his poor that i might atone for my own sins and the sins of my house this is his answer he has taken me up and dashed me down and naught is left but like job to abhor myself and repent in dust and ashesof i know not what  god has not deserted you see he has sent you me said hereward wondering to find himself of all men on earth preaching consolation  yes i have you hold me love me let me feel that one thing loves me upon earth i want love i must have it and if god and his mother and all the saints refuse their love i must turn to the creature and ask it to love me but for a day  for ever mother  you will not leave me  if i do i come back to finish what i have begun  more blood o god hereward not that let us return good for evil let us take up our crosses let us humble ourselves under gods hand and flee into some convent and there die praying for our country and our kin  men must work while women pray i will take you to a minsterto peterborough  no not to peterborough  but my uncle brand is abbot there they tell me now this four years and that rogue herluin prior in his place  he is dyingdying of a broken heart like me and the frenchman has given his abbey to one thorold the tyrant of malmesburya frenchman like himself no take me where i shall never see a french face take me to crowlandand him with mewhere i shall see naught but english faces and hear english chants and die a free englishwoman under st guthlacs wings  ah said hereward bitterly st guthlac is a right englishman and will have some sort of fellowfeeling for us while st peter of course is somewhat too fond of rome and those italian monks wellblood is thicker than water so i hardly blame the blessed apostle  do not talk so hereward  much the saints have done for us mother that we are to be so very respectful to their high mightinesses i fear if this frenchman goes on with his plan of thrusting his monks into our abbeys i shall have to do more even for st guthlac than ever he did for me do not say more mother this night has made hereward a new man now prepareand she knew what he meantand gather all your treasures and we will start for crowland tomorrow afternoon     chapter xx  how hereward was made a knight after the fashion of the english   a wild night was that in bourne all the folk free and unfree man and woman out on the streets asking the meaning of those terrible shrieks followed by a more terrible silence  at last hereward strode down from the hall his drawn sword in his hand  silence good folks and hearken to me once for all there is not a frenchman left alive in bourne if you be the men i take you for there shall not be one left alive between wash and humber silence again as a fierce cry of rage and joy arose and men rushed forward to take him by the hand women to embrace him this is no time for compliments good folks but for quick wit and quick blows for the law we fight if we do fight and by the law we must work fight or not where is the lawman of the town  i was lawman last night to see such law done as there is left said perry but you are lawman now do as you will we will obey you  you shall be our lawman shouted many voices  i who am i outoflaw and a wolfshead  we will put you back into your lawwe will give you your lands in full husting  never mind a husting on my behalf let us have a husting if we have one for a better end than that now men of bourne i have put the coal in the bush dare you blow the fire till the forest is aflame from south to north i have fought a dozen of frenchmen dare you fight taillebois and gilbert of ghent with william duke of normandy at their back or will you take me here as i stand and give me up to them as an outlaw and a robber to feed the crows outside the gates of lincoln do it if you will it will be the wiser plan my friends give me up to be judged and hanged and so purge yourselves of the villanous murder of gilberts cookyour late lord and master  lord and master we are free men shouted the holders or yeomen gentlemen we hold our lands from god and the sun  you are our lord shouted the socmen or tenants who but you we will follow if you will lead  hereward is come home cried a feeble voice behind let me come to him let me feel him  and through the crowd supported by two ladies tottered the mighty form of surturbrand the blind viking  hereward is come cried he as he folded his masters son in his arms hoi he is wet with blood hoi he smells of blood hoi the ravens will grow fat now for hereward is come home  some would have led the old man away but he thrust them off fiercely  hoi come wolf hoi come kite hoi come erne from off the fen you followed us and we fed you well when swend forkbeard brought us over the sea follow us now and we will feed you better still with the mongrel frenchers who scoff at the tongue of their forefathers and would rob their nearest kinsman of land and lass hoi swends men hoi canutes men vikings sons seacocks sons berserkers sons all split up the wararrow and send it round and the curse of odin on every man that will not pass it on a warking tomorrow and hildurs game next day that the old surturbrand may fall like a freeholder axe in hand and not die like a cow in the straw which the frenchman has spared him  all men were silent as the old vikings voice cracked and feeble when he began gathered strength from rage till it rang through the still nightair like a trumpetblast  the silence was broken by a long wild cry from the forest which made the women start and catch their children closer to them it was the howl of a wolf  hark to the witchs horse hark to the son of fenris how he calls for meat are ye your fathers sons ye men of bourne they never let the gray beast call in vain  hereward saw his opportunity and seized it there were those in the crowd he well knew as there must needs be in all crowds who wished themselves well out of the business who shrank from the thought of facing the norman barons much more the norman king who were ready enough had the tide of feeling begun to ebb of blaming hereward for rashness even though they might not have gone so far as to give him up to the normans who would have advised some sort of compromise pacifying halfmeasure or other weak plan for escaping present danger by delivering themselves over to future destruction but three out of four there were good men and true the savage chant of the old barbarian might have startled them somewhat for they were tolerably orthodox christian folk but there was sense as well as spirit in its savageness and they growled applause as he ceased but hereward heard and cried  the viking is right so speaks the spirit of our fathers and we must show ourselves their true sons send round the wararrow and death to the man who does not pass it on better die bravely together than falter and part company to be hunted down one by one by men who will never forgive us as long as we have an acre of land for them to seize perry son of surturbrand you are the lawman put it to the vote  send round the wararrow shouted perry himself and if there was a man or two who shrank from the proposal they found it prudent to shout as loudly as did the rest  ere the morning light the wararrow was split into four splinters and carried out to the four airts through all kesteven if the splinter were put into the housefathers hand he must send it on at once to the next freemans house if he were away it was stuck into his housedoor or into his great chair by the fireside and woe to him if on his return he sent it not on likewise all through kesteven went that night the arrowsplinters and with them the whisper hereward is come again and before midday there were fifty wellarmed men in the old campingfield outside the town and hereward haranguing them in words of fire  a chill came over them nevertheless when he told them that he must return at once to flanders  but it must be he said he had promised his good lord and sovereign baldwin of flanders and his word of honor he must keep two visits he must pay ere he went and then to sea but within the year if he were alive on ground he would return and with him ships and men it might be with sweyn and all the power of denmark  only let them hold their own till the danes should come and all would be well and whenever he came back he would set a light to three farms that stood upon a hill whence they could be seen far and wide over the bruneswold and over all the fen and then all men might know for sure that hereward was come again  and nineandforty of them says the chronicler he chose to guard bourne seemingly the lands which had been his nephew morcars till he should come back and take them for himself godivas lands of witham toft and mainthorpe gery his cousin should hold till his return and send what he could off them to his mother at crowland  then they went down to the water and took barge and laid the corpse therein and godiva and hereward sat at the dead lads head and winter steered the boat and gwenoch took the strokeoar  and they rowed away for crowland by many a mere and many an ea through narrow reaches of clear brown glassy water between the darkgreen alders between the palegreen reeds where the coot clanked and the bittern boomed and the sedgebird not content with its own sweet song mocked the song of all the birds around and then out into the broad lagoons where hung motionless high overhead hawk beyond hawk buzzard beyond buzzard kite beyond kite as far as eye could see into the air as they rowed on whirred up the great skeins of wild fowl innumerable with a cry as of all the bells of crowland or all the hounds of bruneswold and clear above all the noise sounded the wild whistle of the curlews and the trumpetnote of the great white swan out of the reeds like an arrow shot the peregrine singled one luckless mallard from the flock caught him up struck him stone dead with one blow of his terrible heel and swept his prey with him into the reeds again  death death death said lady godiva as the feathers fluttered down into the boat and rested on the dead boys pall war among man and beast war on earth war in air war in the water beneath as a great pike rolled at his bait sending a shoal of white fish flying along the surface and war says holy writ in heaven above o thou who didst die to destroy death when will it all be over  and thus they glided on from stream to stream until they came to the sacred isle of the inheritance of the lord the soil of st mary and st bartholomew the most holy sanctuary of st guthlac and his monks the minster most free from worldly servitude the special almshouse of the most illustrious kings the sole place of refuge for any one in all tribulations the perpetual abode of the saints the possession of religious men especially set apart by the common council of the kingdom by reason of the frequent miracles of the most holy confessor an ever fruitful mother of camphire in the vineyards of engedi and by reason of the privileges granted by the kings a city of grace and safety to all who repent  as they drew near they passed every minute some fishers log canoe in which worked with net or line the criminal who had saved his life by fleeing to st guthlac and becoming his man henceforth the slave who had fled from his masters cruelty and here and there in those evil days the master who had fled from the cruelty of normans who would have done to him as he had done to others but all old grudges were put away there they had sought the peace of st guthlac and therefore they must keep his peace and get their living from the fish of the five rivers within the bounds whereof was peace as of their own quiet streams for the abbot and st guthlac were the only lords thereof and neither summoner nor sheriff of the king nor armed force of knight or earl could enter there  at last they came to crowland minstera vast range of highpeaked buildings founded on piles of oak and hazel driven into the fenitself built almost entirely of timber from the bruneswold barns granaries stables workshops strangers hallfit for the boundless hospitality of crowlandinfirmary refectory dormitory library abbots lodgings cloisters and above the great minster towering up a steep pile half wood half stone with narrow roundheaded windows and leaden roofs and above all the great wooden tower from which on high days chimed out the melody of the seven famous bells which had not their like in english land guthlac bartholomew and bettelm were the names of the biggest turketul and tatwin of the middle and pega and bega of the smallest so says ingulf who saw them a few years after pouring down on his own head in streams of melted metal outside the minster walls were the cottages of the corodiers or laboring folk and beyond them again the natural park of grass dotted with mighty oaks and ashes and beyond all those cornlands of inexhaustible fertility broken up by the good abbot egelric some hundred years before from which in times of dearth the monks of crowland fed the people of all the neighboring fens  they went into the great courtyard all men were quiet yet all men were busy baking and brewing carpentering and tailoring in the workshops reading and writing in the cloister praying and singing in the church and teaching the children in the schoolhouse only the ancient sempectssome near upon a hundred and fifty years oldwandered where they would or basked against a sunny wall like autumn flies with each a young monk to guide him and listen to his tattle of old days for said the laws of turketul the good nothing disagreeable about the affairs of the monastery shall be mentioned in their presence no person shall presume in any way to offend them but with the greatest peace and tranquillity they shall await their end  so while the world outside raged and fought and conquered and plundered they within the holy isle kept up some sort of order and justice and usefulness and love to god and man and about the yards among the feet of the monks hopped the sacred ravens descendants of those who brought back the gloves at st guthlacs bidding and overhead under all the eaves built the sacred swallows the descendants of those who sat and sang upon st guthlacs shoulders and when men marvelled thereat he the holy man replied know that they who live the holy life draw nearer to the birds of the air even as they do to the angels in heaven  and lady godiva called for old abbot ulfketyl the good and brave and fell upon his neck and told him all her tale and ulfketyl wept upon her neck for they were old and faithful friends  and they passed into the dark cool church where in the crypt under the high altar lay the thumb of st bartholomew which old abbot turketul used to carry about that he might cross himself with it in times of danger tempest and lightning and some of the hair of st mary queen of heaven in a box of gold and a bone of st leodegar of aquitaine and some few remains too of the holy bodies of st guthlac and of st bettelm his servant and st tatwin who steered him to crowland and st egbert his confessor and st cissa the anchorite and of the most holy virgin st etheldreda and many more but little of them remained since sigtryg and bagsacs heathen danes had heaped them pellmell on the floor and burned the church over them and the bodies of the slaughtered monks  the plunder which was taken from crowland on that evil day lay and lies still with the plunder of peterborough and many a minster more at the bottom of the nene at huntingdon bridge but it had been more than replaced by the piety of the danish kings and nobles and above the twelve white bearskins which lay at the twelve altars blazed in the light of many a wax candle gold and jewels inferior only to those of peterborough and coventry  and there in the nave they buried the lad godwin with chant and dirge and when the funeral was done hereward went up toward the high altar and bade winter and gwenoch come with him and there he knelt and vowed a vow to god and st guthlac and the lady torfrida his true love never to leave from slaying while there was a frenchman left alive on english ground  and godiva and ulfketyl heard his vow and shuddered but they dared not stop him for they too had english hearts  and winter and gwenoch heard it and repeated it word for word  then he kissed his mother and called winter and gwenoch and went forth he would be back again he said on the third day  then those three went to peterborough and asked for abbot brand and the monks let them in for the fame of their deed had passed through the forest and all the french had fled  and old brand lay back in his great armchair his legs all muffled up in furs for he could get no heat and by him stood herluin the prior and wondered when he would die and thorold take his place and they should drive out the old gregorian chants from the choir and have the new norman chants of robert of fécamp and bring in frenchroman customs in all things and rule the english boors with a rod of iron  and old brand knew all that was in his heart and looked up like a patient ox beneath the butchers axe and said have patience with me brother herluin and i will die as soon as i can and go where there is neither french nor english jew nor gentile bond or free but all are alike in the eyes of him who made them  but when he saw hereward come in he cast the mufflers off him and sprang up from his chair and was young and strong in a moment and for a moment  and he threw his arms round hereward and wept upon his neck as his mother had done and hereward wept upon his neck though he had not wept upon his mothers  then brand held him at arms length or thought he held him for he was leaning on hereward and tottering all the while and extolled him as the champion the warrior the stay of his house the avenger of his kin the hero of whom he had always prophesied that his kin would need him and that then he would not fail  but hereward answered him modestly and mildly  speak not so to me and of me uncle brand i am a very foolish vain sinful man who have come through great adventures i know not how to great and strange happiness and now again to great and strange sorrows and to an adventure greater and stranger than all that has befallen me from my youth up until now therefore make me not proud uncle brand but keep me modest and lowly as befits all true knights and penitent sinners for they tell me that god resists the proud and giveth grace to the humble and i have that to do which do i cannot unless god and his saints give me grace from this day forth  brand looked at him astonished and then turned to herluin  did i not tell thee prior this is the lad whom you called graceless and a savage and see since he has been in foreign lands and seen the ways of knights he talks as clerkly as a frenchman and as piously as any monk  the lord hereward said herluin has doubtless learned much from the manners of our nation which he would not have learned in england i rejoice to see him returned so christian and so courtly a knight  the lord hereward prior herluin has learnt one thing in his travelsto know somewhat of men and the hearts of men and to deal with them as they deserve of him they tell me that one thorold of malmesburythorold of fécamp the minstrel he that made the song of rowlandthat he desires this abbey  i have so heard my lord  then i commandi hereward lord of bournethat this abbey be held against him and all frenchmen in the name of swend ulfsson king of england and of me and he that admits a frenchman therein i will shave his crown for him so well that he shall never need razor more this i tell thee and this i shall tell your monks before i go and unless you obey the same my dream will be fulfilled and you will see goldenbregh in a light low and burning yourselves in the midst thereof  swend ulfsson swend of denmark what words are these cried brand  you will know within six months uncle  i shall know better things my boy before six months are out  uncle uncle do not say that  why not if this mortal life be at best a prison and a grave what is it worth now to an englishman  more than ever for never had an englishman such a chance of showing english mettle and winning renown for the english name uncle you must do something for me and my comrades ere we go  well boy  make us knights  knights lad i thought you had been a belted knight this dozen years  i might have been made a knight by many after the french fashion many a year agone i might have been knight when i slew the white bear ladies have prayed me to be knighted again and again since something kept me from it perhaps with a glance at herluin i wanted to show that an english squire could be the rival and the leader of french and flemish knights  and thou hast shown it brave lad said brand clapping his great hands  perhaps i longed to do some mighty deed at last which would give me a right to go to the bravest knight in all christendom and say give me the accolade then thou only art worthy to knight as good a man as thyself  pride and vainglory said brand shaking his head  but now i am of a sounder mind i see now why i was kept from being knightedtill i had done a deed worthy of a true knight till i had mightily avenged the wronged and mightily succored the oppressed till i had purged my soul of my enmity against my own kin and could go out into the world a new man with my mothers blessing on my head  but not of the robbery of st peter said herluin the french monk wanted not for moral courageno french monk did in those days and he proved it by those words  do not anger the lad prior now too above all times when his heart is softened toward the lord  he has not angered me the man is right here lord abbot and sir prior is a chain of gold won in the wars it is worth fifty times the sixteen pence which i stole and which i repaid double let st peter take it for the sins of me and my two comrades and forgive and now sir prior i do to thee what i never did for mortal man i kneel and ask thy forgiveness kneel winter kneel gwenoch and hereward knelt  herluin was of double mind he longed to keep hereward out of st peters grace he longed to see hereward dead at his feet not because of any personal hatred but because he foresaw in him a terrible foe to the norman cause but he wished too to involve abbot brand as much as possible in herewards rebellions and misdeeds and above all in the masteroffence of knighting him for for that end he saw hereward was come moreover he was touched with the sudden frankness and humility of the famous champion so he answered mildly  verily thou hast a knightly soul may god and st peter so forgive thee and thy companions as i forgive thee freely and from my heart  now cried hereward a boon a boon knight me and these my fellows uncle brand this day  brand was old and weak and looked at herluin  i know said hereward that the french look on us english monkmade knights as spurious and adulterine unworthy of the name of knight but i holdand what churchman will gainsay methat it is nobler to receive sword and belt from a man of god than from a man of blood like ones self the fittest to consecrate the soldier of an earthly king is the soldier of christ the king of kings footnote almost word for word from the life of hereward  he speaks well said herluin abbot grant him his boon  who celebrates high mass tomorrow  wilton the priest the monk of ely said herluin aloud and a very dangerous and stubborn englishman added he to himself  good then this night you shall watch in the church tomorrow after the gospel the thing shall be done as you will  that night two messengers knights of the abbot galloped from peterborough one to ivo taillebois at spalding to tell him that hereward was at peterborough and that he must try to cut him off upon the egelrics road the causeway which one of the many abbots egelric had made some thirty years before through deeping fen to spalding at an enormous expense of labor and of timber the other knight rode south along the roman road to london to tell king william of the rising of kesteven and all the evil deeds of hereward and of brand  and old brand slept quietly in his bed little thinking on what errands his prior had sent his knights  hereward and his comrades watched that night in st peters church oppressed with weariness of body and awe of mind they heard the monks drone out their chants through the misty gloom they confessed the sinsand they were manyof their past wild lives they had to summon up within themselves courage and strength henceforth to live not for themselves but for the fatherland which they hoped to save they prayed to all the heavenly powers of that pantheon which then stood between man and god to help them in the coming struggle but ere the morning dawned they were nodding unused to any long strain of mind  suddenly hereward started and sprang up with a cry of fire  what where cried his comrades and the monks who ran up  the minster is full of flame no use too late you cannot put it out it must burn  you have been dreaming said one  i have not said hereward is it lammas night  what a question it is the vigil of the nativity of st peter and st paul  thank heaven i thought my old lammas nights dream was coming true at last  herluin heard and knew what he meant  after which hereward was silent filled with many thoughts  the next morning before the high mass those three brave men walked up to the altar laid thereon their belts and swords and then knelt humbly at the foot of the steps till the gospel was finished  then came down from the altar wilton of ely and laid on each mans bare neck the bare blade and bade him take back his sword in the name of god and of st peter and st paul and use it like a true knight for a terror and punishment to evildoers and a defence for women and orphans and the poor and the oppressed and the monks the servants of god  and then the monks girded each man with his belt and sword once more and after mass was sung they rose and went forth each feeling himselfand surely not in vaina better man  at least this is certain that hereward would say to his dying day how he had often proved that none would fight so well as those who had received their sword from gods knights the monks and therefore he would have in after years almost all his companions knighted by the monks and brought into ely with him that same good custom which he had learnt at peterborough and kept it up as long as he held the isle  so says the chronicler leofric the minstrel and priest  it was late when they got back to crowland the good abbot received them with a troubled face  as i feared my lord you have been too hot and hasty the french have raised the country against you  i have raised it against them my lord but we have news that sir frederick  and who may he be  a very terrible goliath of these french old and crafty a brother of old earl warrenne of norfolk whom god confound and he has sworn to have your life and has gathered knights and menatarms at lynn in norfolk  very good i will visit him as i go home lord abbot not a word of this to any soul  i tremble for thee thou young david  one cannot live forever my lord farewell  a week after a boatman brought news to crowland how sir frederick was sitting in his inn at lynn when there came in one with a sword and said i am hereward i was told that thou didst desire greatly to see me therefore i am come being a courteous knight and therewith smote off his head and when the knights and others would have stopped him he cut his way through them killing some three or four at each stroke himself unhurt for he was clothed from head to foot in magic armor and whosoever smote it their swords melted in their hands and so gaining the door he vanished in a great cloud of seafowl that cried forever hereward is come home again  and after that the fenmen said to each other that all the birds upon the meres cried nothing save hereward is come home again  and so already surrounded with myth and mystery hereward flashed into the fens and out again like the lightning brand destroying as he passed and the hearts of all the french were turned to water and the land had peace from its tyrants for many days     chapter xxi  how ivo taillebois marched out of spalding town   a proud man was ivo taillebois as he rode next morning out of spalding town with hawk on fist and hound at heel and a dozen menatarms at his back who would on due or undue cause shown hunt men while he hunted game  an adventurer from anjou brutal ignorant and profligatelowborn too for his own men whispered behind his back that he was no more than his name hinted a woodcutters son he still had his deserts valiant he was cunning and skilled in war he and his troop of angevine ruttiers had fought like tigers by williams side at hastings and he had been rewarded with many a manor which had been earl algars and should now have been earl edwins or morcars or it may be herewards own  a fat land and fair said he to himself and after i have hanged a few more of these barbarians a peaceful fief enough to hand down to the lawful heirs of my body if i had one i must marry blessed virgin this it is to serve and honor your gracious majesty as i have always done according to my poor humility who would have thought that ivo taillebois would ever rise so high in life as to be looking out for a wifeand that a lady too  then thought he over the peerless beauties of the lady lucia edwin and morcars sister almost as fair as that hapless aunt of hersfirst married though that story is now denied to the wild griffin prince of snowdon and then to his conqueror and by complicity murderer harold the hapless king eddeva faira eddeva pulcra stands her name in domesdaybook even now known even to her norman conquerors as the beauty of her time as godiva her mother had been before her scarcely less beautiful was lucia as ivo had seen her at williams court half captive and half guest and he longed for her love her he could not i have her fathers lands quoth he what more reasonable than to have the daughter too and have her i will unless the mamzer in his present merciful and politic mood makes a countess of her and marries her up to some norman coxcomb with a long pedigreeinvented the year before last if he does throw away his daughter on that earl edwin in his fancy for petting and patting these savages into good humor he is not likely to throw away edwins sister on a taillebois well i must put a spoke in edwins wheel it will not be difficult to make him or morcar or both of them traitors we must have a rebellion in these parts i will talk about it to gilbert of ghent we must make these savages desperate and william furious or he will be soon giving them back their lands beside asking them to court and then how are valiant knights like us who have won england for him to be paid for their trouble no no we must have a rebellion and a confiscation and then when english lasses are going cheap perhaps the lady lucia may fall to my share  and ivo taillebois kept his word and without difficulty for he had many to help him to drive the english to desperation and get a pretext for seizing their lands was the game which the normans played and but too well  as he rode out of spalding town a man was being hanged on the gallows there permanently provided  that was so common a sight that ivo would not have stopped had not a priest who was comforting the criminal ran forward and almost thrown himself under the horses feet  mercy good my lord in the name of god and all his saints  ivo went to ride on  mercy and he laid hands on ivos bridle if he took a few pike out of your mere remember that the mere was his and his fathers before him and do not send a sorely tempted soul out of the world for a paltry pike  and where am i to get fish for lent sir priest if every rascal nets my waters because his father did so before him take your hand off my bridle or par le splendeur dex ivo thought it fine to use king williams favorite oath i will hew it off  the priest looked at him with something of honest english fierceness in his eyes and dropping the bridle muttered to himself in latin the bloodthirsty and deceitful man shall not live out half his days nevertheless my trust shall be in thee o lord  what art muttering beast go home to thy wife wife was by no means the word which ivo used and make the most of her before i rout out thee and thy fellowcanons and put in good monks from normandy in the place of your drunken english swine hang him shouted he as the bystanders fell on their knees before the tyrant crouching in terror every woman for her husband every man for wife and daughter and hearken you fenfrogs all who touches pike or eel swimming or wading fowl within these meres of mine without my leave i will hang him as i hanged this manas i hanged four brothers in a row on wrokesham bridge but yesterday  go to wrokesham bridge and see shouted a shrill cracked voice from behind the crowd  all looked round and more than one of ivos men set up a yell the hangman loudest of all  thats he the heron again catch him stop him shoot him  but that was not so easy as ivo pushed his horse through the crowd careless of whom he crushed he saw a long lean figure flying through the air seven feet aloft with his heels higher than his head on the further side of a deep broad ditch and on the nearer side of the same one of his best men lying stark with a cloven skull  go to wrokesham shrieked the lean man as he rose and showed a ridiculously long nose neck and legsa type still not uncommon in the fensa quilted leather coat a doublebladed axe slung over his shoulder by a thong a round shield at his back and a pole three times as long as himself which he dragged after him like an unwieldy tail  the heron the heron shouted the english  follow him men heron or hawk shouted ivo galloping his horse up to the ditch and stopping short at fifteen feet of water  shoot some one where are the bows gone  the heron was gone two hundred yards running in spite of his pole at a wonderful pace before a bow could be brought to bear he seemed to expect an arrow for he stopped glanced his eye round threw himself flat on his face with his shield not over his body but over his bare legs sprang up as the shaft stuck in the ground beside him ran on planted his pole in the next dike and flew over it  in a few minutes he was beyond pursuit and ivo turned breathless with rage to ask who he was  alas sir he is the man who set free the four men at wrokesham bridge last night  set free are they not hanged and dead  wewe dared not tell you but he came upon us  singlehanded you cowards  sir he is not a man but a witch or a devil he asked us what we did there one of our men laughed at his long neck and legs and called him heron heron i am says he and strike like a heron right at the eyes and with that he cuts the man over the face with his axe and laid him dead and then another and another  till you all ran away villains  we gave back a stepno more and he freed one of those four and he again the rest and then they all set on us and went to hang us in their own stead  when there were ten of you i thought  sir as we told you he is no mortal man but a fiend  beasts fools well i have hanged this one at least growled ivo and then rode sullenly on  who is this fellow cried he to the trembling english  wulfric raher wulfric the heron of wrokesham in norfolk  aha and i hold a manor of his said ivo to himself look you villains this fellow is in league with you  a burst of abject denial followed since the frenchsince sir frederick as they call him drove him out of his wrokesham lands he wanders the country as you see today here but heaven only knows where he will be tomorrow  and finds of course a friend everywhere now march and a string of threats and curses followed  it was hard to see why wulfric should not have found friends as he was simply a small holder or squire driven out of house and land and turned adrift on the wide world for the offence of having fought in harolds army at the battle of hastings but to give him food or shelter was in norman eyes an act of rebellion against the rightful king william and ivo rode on boiling over with righteous indignation along the narrow drove which led toward deeping  a pretty lass came along the drove driving a few sheep before her and spinning as she walked  whose lass are you shouted ivo  the abbot of crowlands please your lordship said she trembling  much too pretty to belong to monks chuck her up behind you one of you  the shrieking and struggling girl was mounted behind a horseman and bound and ivo rode on  a woman ran out of a turfhut on the drove side attracted by the girls cries it was her mother  my lass give me my lass for the love of st mary and all saints and she clung to ivos bridle  he struck her down and rode on over her  a man cutting sedges in a punt in the lode alongside looked up at the girls shrieks and leapt on shore scythe in hand  father father cried she  ill rid thee lass or die for it said he as he sprang up the drovedike and swept right and left at the horses legs  the men recoiled one horse went down lamed for life another staggered backwards into the further lode and was drowned but an arrow went through the brave serfs heart and ivo rode on cursing more bitterly than ever and comforted himself by flying his hawks at a covey of patridges  soon a group came along the drove which promised fresh sport to the manhunters but as the foremost person came up ivo stopped in wonder at the shout of  ivo ivo taillebois halt and have a care the english are risen and we are all dead men  the words were spoken in french and in french ivo answered laughing  thou art not a dead man yet it seems sir robert art going on pilgrimage to jerusalem that thou comest in this fashion or dost mean to return to anjou as bare as thou camest out of it  for sir robert had like edgar in shakespears lear reserved himself a blanket else had we all been shamed  but very little more did either he his lady and his three children wear as they trudged along the drove in even poorer case than that     robert of coningsby    who came out of normandy    with his wife tiffany    and his maid maupas    and his dog hardigras  for the love of heaven and all chivalry joke me no jokes sir ivo but give me and mine clothes and food the barbarians rose on us last nightwith azer the ruffian who owned my lands at their head and drove us out into the night as we are bidding us carry the news to you for your turn would come next there are forty or more of them in west deeping now and coming eastward they say to visit you and what is more than all hereward is come again  hereward cried ivo who knew that name well  whereon sir robert told him the terrible tragedy of bourne  mount the lady on a horse and wrap her in my cloak get that dead villains clothes for sir robert as we go back put your horses heads about and ride for spalding  what shall we do with the lass  we cannot be burdened with the jade she has cost us two good horses already leave her in the road bound as she is and let us see if st guthlac her master will come and untie her  so they rode back coming from deeping two hours after azer and his men found the girl on the road dead  another count in the long score quoth azer but when in two hours more they came to spalding town they found all the folk upon the street shouting and praising the host of heaven there was not a frenchman left in the town  for when ivo returned home ere yet sir robert and his family were well clothed and fed there galloped into spalding from the north sir ascelin nephew and man of thorold wouldbe abbot of peterborough and one of the garrison of lincoln which was then held by herewards old friend gilbert of ghent  not bad news i hope cried ivo as ascelin clanked into the hall we have enough of our own here is all kesteven as the barbarians call it risen and they are murdering us right and left  worse news than that ivo taillebois sir or sieur ascelin was loath to call him being himself a man of family and fashion and holding the nouveaux venus in deep contemptworse news than that the north has risen again and proclaimed prince edgar king  a king of words what care i or you as long as the mamzer god bless him is a king of deeds  they have done their deeds though too gospatrick and marlesweyn are back out of scotland they attacked robert de comines footnote ancestor of the comyns of scotland at durham and burnt him in his own house there was but one of his men got out of durham to tell the news and now they have marched on york and all the chiefs they say have joined themarchill the thane and edwin and morcar and waltheof too the young traitors  blessed virgin cried ivo thou art indeed gracious to thy most unworthy knight  what do you mean  you will see some day now i will tell you but one word when fools make hay wise men can build ricks this rebellionif it had not come of itself i would have roused it we wanted it to cure william of this just and benevolent policy of his which would have ended in sending us back to france as poor as we left it now what am i expected to do what says gilbert of ghent the wise man of licnicwhat the pest do you call that outlandish place which no civilized lips can pronounce  licniccole replied ascelin who like the rest of the french never could manage to say lincoln he says march to me and with me to join the king at york  then he says well these fat acres will be none the leaner if i leave the english slaves to crop them for six months men arm and horse sir robert of deeping then arm and horse yourselves we march north in half an hour bag and baggage scrip and scrippage you are all bachelors like me and travel light so off with yousir ascelin you will eat and drink  that will i  quick then butler and after that pack up the englishmans platechest which we inherited by right of fistthe only plate and the only titledeeds i ever possessed  now sir ascelinas the three knights the lady and the poor children ate their fastestlisten to me the art of war lies in this one nutshellto put the greatest number of men into one place at one time and let all other places shift to strike swiftly and strike heavily that is the rule of our liege lord king william and by it he will conquer england or the world if he will and while he does that he shall never say that ivo taillebois stayed at home to guard his own manors while he could join his king and win all the manors of england once and for all  pardieu whatever men may say of thy lineage or thy virtues they cannot deny thisthat thou art a most wise and valiant captain  that am i quoth taillebois too much pleased with the praise to care about being tutoyé by younger men as for my lineage my lord the king has a fellowfeeling for upstarts and the woodmans grandson may very well serve the tanners now men is the litter ready for the lady and children i am sorry to rattle you about thus madame but war has no courtesies and march i must  and so the french went out of spalding town  dont be in a hurry to thank your saints shouted ivo to his victims i shall be back this day three months and then you shall see a row of gibbets all the way from here to deeping and an englishman hanging on every one     chapter xxii  how hereward sailed foe england once and for all   so hereward fought the viscount of pinkney who had the usual luck which befell those who crossed swords with him and plotted meanwhile with gyda and the countess judith abbot egelsin sent them news from king sweyn in denmark soon judith and tostis two sons went themselves to sweyn and helped the plot and the fitting out of the armament news they had from england in plenty by messengers from queen matilda to the sister who was intriguing to dethrone her husband and by private messengers from durham and from york  baldwin the débonnaire marquis had not lived to see this fruit of his long efforts to please everybody he had gone to his rest the year before and now there ruled in bruges his son baldwin the good count palatine as he styled himself and his wife richilda the lady of hainault  they probably cared as little for the success of their sister matilda as they did for that of their sister judith and followed outbaldwin at leastthe great marquiss plan of making flanders a retreat for the fugitives of all the countries round  at least if as seems sweyns fleet made the coast of flanders its rendezvous and base of operations against king william baldwin offered no resistance  so the messengers came and the plots went on great was the delight of hereward and the ladies when they heard of the taking of durham and york but bitter their surprise and rage when they heard that gospatrick and the confederates had proclaimed edgar atheling king  fools they will ruin all cried gyda do they expect swend ulfsson who never moved a finger yet unless he saw that it would pay him within the hour to spend blood and treasure in putting that puppet boy upon the throne instead of himself  calm yourself great countess said hereward with a smile the man who puts him on the throne will find it very easy to take him off again when he needs  pish said gyda he must put him on the throne first and how will he do that will the men of the danelagh much less the northumbrians ever rally round an atheling of cerdics house they are raising a wessex army in northumbria a southern army in the north there is no real loyalty there toward the atheling not even the tie of kin as there would be to swend the boy is a mere stalkinghorse behind which each of these greedy chiefs expects to get back his own lands and if they can get them back by any other means well and good mark my words sir hereward that cunning frenchman will treat with them one by one and betray them one by one till there is none left  how far gyda was right will be seen hereafter but a less practised diplomat than the great countess might have speculated reasonably on such an event  at least let this be said that when historians have complained of the treachery of king swend ulfsson and his danes they have forgotten certain broad and simple facts  swend sailed for england to take a kingdom which he believed to be his by right which he had formerly demanded of william when he arrived there he found himself a mere catspaw for recovering that kingdom for an incapable boy whom he believed to have no right to the throne at all  then came darker news as ivo had foreseen and as ivo had done his best to bring about william dashed on york and drove out the confederates with terrible slaughter profaned the churches plundered the town gospatrick and the earls retreated to durham the atheling more cautious to scotland  then came a strange story worthy of the grown children who in those old times bore the hearts of boys with the ferocity and intellect of men  a great fog fell on the frenchmen as they struggled over the durham moors the doomed city was close beneath them they heard wear roaring in his wooded gorge but a darkness as of egypt lay upon them neither rose any from his place  then the frenchmen cried this darkness is from st cuthbert himself we have invaded his holy soil who has not heard how none who offend st cuthbert ever went unpunished how palsy blindness madness fall on those who dare to violate his sanctuary  and the french turned and fled from before the face of st cuthbert and william went down to winchester angry and sad and then went off to gloucestershire and huntedfor whatever befell he still would huntin the forest of dean  and still swend and his danes had not sailed and hereward walked to and fro in his house impatiently and bided his time  in july baldwin died arnoul the boy was count of flanders and richilda his sorceressmother ruled the land in his name she began to oppress the flemings not those of french flanders round st omer but those of flemish flanders toward the north they threatened to send for robert the frison to right them  hereward was perplexed he was robert the frisons friend and old soldier richilda was torfridas friend so was still more the boy arnoul which party should he take neither if he could help it and he longed to be safe out of the land  and at last his time came martin lightfoot ran in breathless to tell how the sails of a mighty fleet were visible from the dunes  here cried hereward what are the fools doing down here wandering into the very jaws of the wolf how will they land here they were to have gone straight to the lincolnshire coast god grant this mistake be not the first of dozens  hereward went into torfridas bower  this is an evil business the danes are here where they have no business instead of being off scheldtmouth as i entreated them but go we must or be forever shamed now true wife are you ready dare you leave home and kin and friends once and for all to go you know not whither with one who may be a gory corpse by this day week  i dare said she  so they went down to calais by night with torfridas mother and all their jewels and all they had in the world and their housecarles went with them forty men tried and trained who had vowed to follow hereward round the world and there were two long ships ready and twenty good mariners in each so when the danes made the south foreland the next morning they were aware of two gallant ships bearing down on them with a great white bear embroidered on their sails  a proud man was hereward that day as he sailed into the midst of the danish fleet and up to the royal ships and shouted i am hereward the berserker and i come to take service under my rightful lord sweyn king of england  come on board then we know you well and right glad we are to have hereward with us  and hereward laid his ships bow upon the quarter of the royal ship to lay alongside was impossible for fear of breaking oars and came on board  and thou art hereward asked a tall and noble warrior  i am and thou art swend ulfsson the king  i am earl osbiorn his brother  then where is the king  he is in denmark and i command his fleet and with me are canute and harold sweyns sons and earls and bishops enough for all england  this was spoken in a somewhat haughty tone in answer to the look of surprise and disappointment which hereward had unawares allowed to pass over his face  thou art better than none said hereward now hearken osbiorn the earl had swend been here i would have put my hand between his and said in my own name and that of all the men in kesteven and the fens swends men we are to live and die but now as it is i say for me and them thy men we are to live and die as long as thou art true to us  true to you i will be said osbiorn  be it so said hereward true we shall be whatever betide now whither goes earl osbiorn and all his great meinie  we purpose to try dover  you will not take it the frenchman has strengthened it with one of his accursed keeps and without batteringengines you may sit before it a month  what if i asked you to go in thither yourself and try the mettle and the luck which they say never failed hereward yet  i should say that it was a childs trick to throw away against a paltry stone wall the life of a man who was ready to raise for you in lincolnshire and cambridgeshire five times as many men as you will lose in taking dover  hereward is right said more than one earl we shall need him in his own country  if you are wise to that country you yourselves will go it is ready to receive you this is ready to oppose you you are attacking the frenchman at his strongest point instead of his weakest did i not send again and again entreating you to cross from scheldtmouth to the wash and send me word that i might come and raise the fenmen for you and then we would all go north together  i have heard ere now said earl osbiorn haughtily that hereward though he be a valiant viking is more fond of giving advice than of taking it  hereward was about to answer very fiercely if he had no one would have thought any harm in those plainspoken times but he was wise and restrained himself remembering that torfrida was there all but alone in the midst of a fleet of savage men and that beside he had a great deed to do and must do it as he could so he answered  osbiorn the earl has not it seems heard this of hereward that because he is accustomed to command he is also accustomed to obey what thou wilt do do and bid me do he that quarrels with his captain cuts his own throat and his fellows too  wisely spoken said the earls and hereward went back to his ship  torfrida said he bitterly the game is lost before it is begun  god forbid my beloved what words are these  swendfool that he is with his overcautionalways the samehas let the prize slip from between his fingers he has sent osbiorn instead of himself  but why is that so terrible a mistake  we do not want a fleet of vikings in england to plunder the french and english alike we want a king a king a king and hereward stamped with rage and instead of a king we have this osbiornall men know him greedy and false and weakheaded here he is going to be beaten off at dover and then i suppose at the next port and so forth till the whole season is wasted and the ships and men lost by driblets pray for us to god and his saints torfrida you who are nearer to heaven than i for we never needed it more  and osbiorn went in tried to take dover and was beaten off with heavy loss  then the earls bade him take herewards advice but he would not  so he went round the foreland and tried sandwichas if landing there he would have been safe in marching on london in the teeth of the élite of normandy  but he was beaten off there with more loss then too late he took herewards adviceor rather half of itand sailed north but only to commit more follies  he dared not enter the thames he would not go on to the wash but he went into the orwell and attacked ipswich plundering right and left instead of proclaiming king sweyn and calling the danish folk around him the danish folk of suffolk rose and like valiant men beat him off while hereward lay outside the river mouth his soul within him black with disappointment rage and shame he would not go in he would not fight against his own countrymen he would not help to turn the whole plan into a marauding raid and he told earl osbiorn so so fiercely that his life would have been in danger had not the force of his arm been as much feared as the force of his name was needed  at last they came to yarmouth osbiorn would needs land there and try norwich  hereward was nigh desperate but he hit upon a plan let osbiorn do so if he would he himself would sail round to the wash raise the fenmen and march eastward at their head through norfolk to meet him osbiorn himself could not refuse so rational a proposal all the earls and bishops approved loudly and away hereward went to the wash his heart wellnigh broken foreseeing nothing but evil     chapter xxiii  how hereward gathered an army   the voyage round the norfolk coast was rough and wild torfrida was ill the little girl was ill the poor old mother was so ill that she could not even say her prayers packed uncomfortably under the awning on the poop torfrida looked on from beneath it upon the rolling waterwaste with a heart full of gloomy forebodings and a brain whirling with wild fancies the wreaths of cloud were gray witches hurrying on with the ship to work her woe the low red stormdawn was streaked with blood the water which gurgled all night under the lee was alive with hoarse voices and again and again she started from fitful slumber to clasp the child closer to her or look up for comfort to the sturdy figure of her husband as he stood like a tower of strength steering and commanding the long night through  yes on him she could depend on his courage on his skill and as for his love had she not that utterly and what more did woman need  but she was going she scarce knew whither and she scarce knew for what at least on a fearful adventure which might have a fearful end she looked at the fair child and reproached herself for a moment at the poor old mother whining and mumbling her soft southern heart quite broken by the wild chill northern seabreeze and reproached herself still more but was it not her duty him she loved and his she was and him she must follow over sea and land till death and if possible beyond death again forever for his sake she would slave for his sake she would be strong if ever there rose in her a homesickness a regret for leaving flanders and much more for that sunnier south where she was born he at least should never be saddened or weakened by one hint of her sadness and weakness and so it befell that by the time they made the coast she had as the old chronicler says altogether conquered all womanly softness  and yet she shuddered at the dreary mudcreek into which they ran their ships at the dreary flats on which they landed shivering swept over by the keen northeast wind a lonely land and within she knew not what of danger it might be of hideous death  but she would be strong and when they were all landed men arms baggage and had pitched the tents which the wise hereward had brought with them she rose up like a queen and took her little one by the hand and went among the men and spoke  housecarles and mariners you are following a great captain upon a great adventure how great he is you know as well as i i have given him myself my wealth and all i have and have followed him i know not whither because i trust him utterly men trust him as i trust him and follow him to the death  that will we  and men i am here among you a weak woman trying to be brave for his sakeand for yours be true to me too as i have been true to you for your sake have i worked hard day and night for many a year for you i have baked and brewed and cooked like any poor churls wife is there a garment on your backs which my hands have not mended is there a wound on your limbs which my hands have not salved o if torfrida has been true to you promise me this day that you will be true men to her and hers that ifwhich heaven forbidaught should befall him and me you will protect this my poor old mother and this my child who has grown up among you alla lamb brought up within the lions den look at her men and promise me on the faith of valiant soldiers that you will be lions on her behalf if she shall ever need you promise me that if you have but one more stroke left to strike on earth you will strike it to defend the daughter of hereward and torfrida from cruelty and shame  the men answered by a shout which rolled along the fen and startled the wildfowl up from faroff pools they crowded round their lady they kissed her hands they bent down and kissed their little playmate and sworeone by god and his apostles and the next by odin and thorthat she should be a daughter to each and every one of them as long as they could grip steel in hand  then says the chronicler hereward sent on spies to see whether the frenchmen were in the land and how folks fared at holbeach spalding and bourne  the two young siwards as knowing the country and the folk pushed forward and with them martin lightfoot to bring back news  martin ran back all the way from holbeach the very first day with right good news there was not a frenchman in the town neither was there they said in spalding ivo taillebois was still away at the wars and long might he stay  so forward they marched and everywhere the landsfolk were tilling the ground in peace and when they saw that stout array they hurried out to meet the troops and burdened them with food and ale and all they needed  and at holbeach and at spalding hereward split up the wararrow and sent it through kesteven and south into the cambridge fens calling on all men to arm and come to him at bourne in the name of waltheof and morcar the earls  and at every farm and town he blew the warhorn and summoned every man who could bear arms to be ready against the coming of the danish host from norwich and so through all the fens came true what the wildfowl said upon the meres that hereward was come again  and when he came to bourne all men were tilling in peace the terror of hereward had fallen on the frenchmen and no man had dared to enter on his inheritance or to set a french foot over the threshold of that ghastly hall over the gable whereof still grinned the fourteen heads on the floor whereof still spread the dark stains of blood  only geri dwelt in a corner of the house and with him leofric the unlucky once a roistering housecarle of herewards youth now a monk of crowland and a deacon whom lady godiva had sent thither that he might take care of her poor and there geri and leofric had kept house and told sagas to each other over the beechlog fire night after night for all leofrics study was says the chronicler to gather together for the edification of his hearers all the acts of giants and warriors out of the fables of the ancients or from faithful report and commit them to writing that he might keep england in mind thereof which leofric was afterwards ordained priest probably in ely by bishop egelwin of durham and was herewards chaplain for many a year  then hereward as he had promised set fire to the three farms close to the bruneswold and all his outlawed friends lurking in the forest knew by that signal that hereward was come again so they cleansed out the old house though they did not take down the heads from off the gable and torfrida went about it and about it and confessed that england was after all a pleasant place enough and they were as happy it may be for a week or two as ever they had been in their lives  and now said torfrida while you see to your army i must be doing for i am a lady now and mistress of great estates so i must be seeing to the poor  but you cannot speak their tongue  can i not do you think that in the face of coming to england and fighting here and plotting here and being may be an earls countess i have not made martin lightfoot teach me your english tongue till i can speak it as well as you i kept that hidden as a surprise for you that you might find out when you most needed how torfrida loved you  as if i had not found out already o woman woman i verily believe that god made you alone and left the devil to make us butchers of men  meanwhile went round through all the fens and north into the bruneswold and away again to lincoln and merry sherwood that hereward was come again and gilbert of ghent keeping lincoln castle for the conqueror was perplexed in mind and looked well to gates and bars and sentinels for hereward sent him at once a message that forasmuch as he had forgotten his warning in bruges street and put a rascal cook into his mothers manors he should ride odins horse on the highest ash in the bruneswold  on which gilbert of ghent inquiring what odins horse might be and finding it to signify the ashtree whereon as sacred to odin thieves were hanged by danes and norse made answer  that he gilbert had not put his cook into bourne nor otherwise harmed hereward or his that bourne had been seized by the king himself together with earl morcars lands in those parts as all men knew that the said cook so pleased the king with a dish of stewed eelpout which he served up to him at cambridge and which the king had never eaten before that the king begged the said cook of him gilbert and took him away and that after so he heard the said cook had begged the said manors of bourne of the king without the knowledge or consent of him gilbert that he therefore knew naught of the matter that if hereward meant to keep the kings peace he might live in bourne till doomsday for aught he gilbert cared but that if he and his men meant to break the kings peace and attack lincoln city he gilbert would nail their skins to the door of lincoln cathedral as they used to do by the heathen danes in old time and that therefore they now understood each other  at which hereward laughed and said that they had done that for many a year  and now poured into bourne from every side brave men and truesome great holders dispossessed of their land some the sons of holders who were not yet dispossessed some morcars men some edwins who had been turned out by the king  to him came guenoch and alutus grogan foremost in all valor and fortitude tall and large and ready for work and with them their three nephews godwin gille so called because he was not inferior to that godwin guthlacsson who is preached much in the fables of the ancients and douti and outi footnote named in domesdaybook   the twins alike in face and manners and godric the knight of corby nephew of the count of warwick and tosti of davenesse his kinsman and azer vass whose father had possessed lincoln tower and leofwin moue footnote probably the leofwin who had lands in bournethat is the scythe so called because when he was mowing all alone and twenty country folk set on him with pitchforks and javelins he slew and wounded almost every one sweeping his scythe among them as one that moweth and wluncus the blackface so called because he once blackened his face with coal and came unknown among the enemy and slew ten of them with one lance and turbertin a greatnephew surely a mistake of earl edwin and leofwin prat perhaps the ancestor of the ancient and honorable house of pratt of ryston so called from his praet or craft because he had oft escaped cunningly when taken by the enemy having more than once killed his keepers and the steward of drayton and thurkill the outlaw herewards cook and oger herewards kinsman and winter and linach two very famous ones and ranald the butler of ramsey abbeyhe was the standardbearer and wulfric the black and wulfric the white and hugh the norman a priest and wulfard his brother and tosti and godwin of rothwell and alsin and hekill and hugh the breton who was herewards chaplain and whishaw his brother a magnificent knight which two came with him from flanders and so forthnames merely of whom naught is known save in a few cases from domesdaybook the manors which they held but honor to their very names honor to the last heroes of the old english race  these valiant gentlemen with the housecarles whom more or fewer they would bring with them constituted a formidable force as after years proved well but having got his men herewards first care was doubtless to teach them that art of war of which they like true englishmen knew nothing  the art of war has changed little if at all by the introduction of gunpowder the campaigns of hannibal and caesar succeeded by the same tactics as those of frederic or wellington and so as far as we can judge did those of the mastergeneral of his age william of normandy  but of those tactics the english knew nothing their armies were little more than tumultuous levies in which men marched and fought under local leaders often divided by local jealousies the commissariats of the armies seem to have been so worthless that they had to plunder friends as well as foes as they went along and with plunder came every sort of excess as when the northern men marching down to meet harold godwinsson and demand young edwin as their earl laid waste seemingly out of mere brute wantonness the country round northampton which must have been in edwins earldom or at least in that of his brother morcar and even the local leaders were not overwell obeyed the reckless spirit of personal independence especially among the anglodanes prevented anything like discipline or organized movement of masses and made every battle degenerate into a confusion of single combats  but hereward had learned that art of war which enabled the norman to crush piecemeal with inferior numbers the vast but straggling levies of the english his men mostly outlaws and homeless kept together by the pressure from without and free from local jealousies resembled rather an army of professional soldiers than a country posse comitatus and to the discipline which he instilled into them to his ability in marching and manoeuvring troops to his care for their food and for their transport possibly also to his training them in that art of fighting on horseback in which the men of wessex if not the anglodanes of the east are said to have been quite unskilledin short to all that he had learned as a mercenary under robert the frison and among the highly civilized warriors of flanders and normandy must be attributed the fact that he and his little army defied for years the utmost efforts of the normans appearing and disappearing with such strange swiftness and conquering against such strange odds as enshrouded the guerilla captain in an atmosphere of myth and wonder only to be accounted for in the mind of normans as well as english by the supernatural counsels of his sorceress wife  but hereward grew anxious and more anxious as days and weeks went on and yet there was no news of osbiorn and his danes at norwich time was precious he had to march his little army to the wash and then transport it by boatsno easy matterto lynn in norfolk as his nearest point of attack and as the time went on earl warren and ralph de guader would have gathered their forces between him and the danes and a landing at lynn might become impossible meanwhile there were bruits of great doings in the north of lincolnshire young earl waltheof was said to be there and edgar the atheling with him but what it portended no man knew morcar was said to have raised the centre of mercia and to be near stafford edwin to have raised the welsh and to be at chester with alfgiva his sister harold godwinssons widow and hereward sent spies along the roman watling streetthe only road then toward the northwest of englandand spies northward along the roman road to lincoln but the former met the french in force near stafford and came back much faster than they went and the latter stumbled on gilbert of ghent riding out of lincoln to sleaford and had to flee into the fens and came back much slower than they went  at last news came for into bourne stalked wulfric the heron with axe and bow and leapingpole on shoulder and an evil tale he brought  the danes had been beaten utterly at norwich ralph de guader and his frenchmen had fought like lions they had killed many danes in the assault on the castle they had sallied out on them as they recoiled and driven them into the river drowning many more the danes had gone down the yare again and out to sea northward no man knew whither he the heron prowling about the fenlands of norfolk to pick off straggling frenchmen and looking out for the danes had heard all the news from the landsfolk he had watched the danish fleet along the shore as far as blakeney but when they came to the isle they stood out to sea right northwest he the heron believed that they were gone for humber mouth  after a while he had heard how hereward was come again and sent round the wararrow and thought that a landless man could be in no better company wherefore he had taken boat and come across the deep fen and there he was if they had need of him  need of you said hereward who had heard of the deed at wrokesham bridge need of a hundred like you but this is bitter news  and he went in to ask counsel of torfrida ready to weep with rage he had disappointed deceived his men he had drawn them into a snare he had promised that the danes should come how should he look them in the face  look them in the face do that at oncenowwithout losing a moment call them together and tell them all if their hearts are staunch you may do great things without the traitor earl if their hearts fail them you would have done nothing with them worthy of yourself had you had norway as well as denmark at your back at least be true with them as your only chance of keeping them true to you  wise wise wife said hereward and went out and called his band together and told them every word and all that had passed since he left calais straits  and now i have deceived you and entrapped you and i have no right to be your captain more he that will depart in peace let him depart before the frenchmen close in on us on every side and swallow us up at one mouthful  not a man answered  i say it again he that will depart let him depart  they stood thoughtful  ranald the monk of ramsey drove the whitebear banner firm into the earth tucked up his monks frock and threw his long axe over his shoulder as if preparing for action  winter spoke at last  if all go there are two men here who stay and fight by herewards side as long as there is a frenchman left on english soil for they have sworn an oath to heaven and to st peter and that oath will they keep what say you gwenoch knighted with us at peterborough  gwenoch stepped to herewards side  none shall go shouted a dozen voices with hereward we will live and die let him lead us to lincoln to stafford where he will we can save england for ourselves without the help of danes  it is well for one at least of you gentlemen that you are in this pleasant mind quoth ranald the monk  well for all of us thou valiant purveyor of beef and beer  well for one for the first man that had turned to go i would have brained him with this axe  and now gallant gentlemen said hereward we must take new counsel as our old has failed whither shall we go for stay here eating up the country we must not do  they say that waltheof is in lindsay raising the landsfolk let us go and join him  we can at least find what he means to do there can be no better counsel let us march only we must keep clear of lincoln as yet i hear that gilbert has a strong garrison there and we are not strong enough yet to force it  so they rode north and up the roman road toward lincoln sending out spies as they went and soon they had news of waltheofnews too that he was between them and lincoln  then the sooner we are with him the better for he will find himself in trouble ere long if old gilbert gets news of him so run your best footmen for forward we must get  and as they came up the roman road they were aware of a great press of men in front of them and hard fighting toward  some of the english would have spurred forward at once but hereward held them back with loud reproaches  will you forget all i have told you in the first skirmish like so many dogs when they see a bull keep together for five minutes more the pot will not be cool before we get our sup of it i verily believe that it is waltheof and that gilbert has caught him already  as he spoke one part of the combatants broke up and fled right and left and a knight in full armor galloped furiously down the road right at them followed by two or three more  here comes some one very valiant or very much afeared said hereward as the horseman rode right upon him shouting  i am the king  the king roared hereward and dropping his lance spurred his horse forward kicking his feet clear of the stirrups he caught the knight round the neck dragged him over his horses tail and fell with him to the ground  the armor clashed the sparks flew from the old gray roman flints and hereward rolling over once rose and knelt upon his prisoner  william of normandy yield or die  the knight lay still and stark  ride on roared hereward from the ground ride at them and strike hard you will soon find out which is which this booty i must pick for myself what are you at roared he after his knights spread off the road and keep your line as i told you and dont override each other curse the hotheaded fools the normans will scatter them like sparrows run on menatarms to stop the french if we are broken and dont forget guisnes field and the horses legs now king are you come to life yet  you have killed him quoth leofric the deacon whom hereward had beckoned to stop with him  i hope not lend me a knife he is a much slighter man than i fancied said hereward as they got his helmet off  and when it was off both started and stared for they had uncovered not the beetling brow roman nose and firm curved lip of the ulysses of the middle age but the face of a fair lad with long strawcolored hair and soft blue eyes staring into vacancy  who are you shouted hereward saying very bad words who come here aping the name of king  mother christina margaret waltheof earl moaned the lad raising his head and letting it fall again  it is the atheling cried leofric  hereward rose and stood over the boy  ah what was i doing to handle him so tenderly i took him for the mamzer and thought of a kings ransom  do you call that tenderly you have nigh pulled the boys head off  would that i had ah went on hereward apostrophizing the unconscious athelingah that i had broken that white neck once and for all to have sent thee feet foremost to winchester to lie by thy grandfathers and greatgrandfathers and then to tell norman william that he must fight it out henceforth not with a straw malkin like thee which the very crows are not afraid to perch on but with a cock of a very different hacklesweyn ulfsson king of denmark  and hereward drew brainbiter  for mercys sake you will not harm the lad  if i were a wise man now and hardhearted as wise men should be i shouldi should and he played the point of the sword backwards and forwards nearer and nearer to the lads throat  master master cried leofric clinging to his knees by all the saints what would the blessed virgin say to such a deed  well i suppose you are right and i fear what my lady at home might say and we must not do anything to vex her you know well let us do it handsomely if we must do it get water somewhere in his helmet no you need not linger i will not cut his throat before you come back  leofric went off in search of water and hereward knelt with the athelings head on his knee and on his lip a sneer at all things in heaven and earth to have that lad stand between him and all his projects and to be forced for honors sake to let him stand  but soon his men returned seemingly in high glee and other knights with them  hey lads said he i aimed at the falcon and shot the goose here is edgar atheling prisoner shall we put him to ransom  he has no money and malcolm of scotland is much too wise to lend him any said some one and some more rough jokes passed  do you know sirs that he who lies there is your king asked a very tall and noblelooking knight  that do we not said hereward sharply there is no king in england this day as far as i know and there will be none north of the watling street till he be chosen in full husting and anointed at york as well as winchester or london we have had one king made for us in the last forty years and we intend to make the next ourselves  and who art thou who talkest so bold of kingmaking  and who art thou who askest so bold who i am  i am waltheof siwardsson the earl and yon is my army behind me  and i am hereward leofricsson the outlaw and yon is my army behind me  if the two champions had flown at each others throats and their armies had followed their example simply as dogs fly at each other they know not why no one would have been astonished in those unhappy times  but it fell not out upon that wise for waltheof leaping from his horse pulled off his helmet and seizing hereward by both hands cried  blessed is the day which sees again in england hereward who has upheld throughout all lands and seas the honor of english chivalry  and blessed is the day in which hereward meets the head of the house of siward where he should be at the head of his own men in his own earldom when i saw my friend thy brother osbiorn brought into the camp at dunsinane with all his wounds in front i wept a young mans tears and said there ends the glory of the whitebears house but this day i say the whitebears blood is risen from the grave in waltheof siwardsson who with his single axe kept the gate of york against all the army of the french and who shall keep against them all england if he will be as wise as he is brave  was hereward honest in his words hardly so he wished to be honest as he looked upon that magnificent young man he hoped and trusted that his words were true but he gave a second look at the face and whispered to himself weak weak he will be led by priests perhaps by william himself i must be courteous but confide i must not  the men stood round and looked with admiration on the two most splendid englishmen then alive hereward had taken off his helmet likewise and the contrast between the two was as striking as the completeness of each of them in his own style of beauty it was the contrast between the slowhound and the deerhound each alike high bred but the former short sturdy cheerful and sagacious the latter tall stately melancholy and not overwise withal  waltheof was a full head and shoulders taller than herewardone of the tallest men of his generation and of a strength which would have been gigantic but for the too great length of neck and limb which made him loose and slow in body as he was somewhat loose and slow in mind an old mans child although that old man was as one of the old giants there was a vein of weakness in him which showed in the arched eyebrow the sleepy pale blue eye the small soft mouth the lazy voice the narrow and lofty brain over a shallow brow his face was not that of a warrior but of a saint in a painted window and to his own place he went and became a saint in his due time but that he could outgeneral william that he could even manage gospatrick and his intrigues hereward expected as little as that his own nephews edwin and morcar could do it  i have to thank you noble sir said waltheof languidly for sending your knights to our rescue when we were really hard besteadi fear much by our own fault had they told me whose men they were i should not have spoken to you so roughly as i fear i did  there is no offence let englishmen speak their minds as long as english land is above sea but how did you get into trouble and with whom  waltheof told him how he was going round the country raising forces in the name of the atheling when as they were straggling along the roman road gilbert of ghent had dashed out on them from a wood cut their line in two driven waltheof one way and the atheling another and that the atheling had only escaped by riding as they saw for his life  well done old gilbert laughed hereward you must beware my lord earl how you venture within reach of that old bears paw  bear by the by sir hereward asked waltheof whose thoughts ran loosely right and left why is it that you carry the white bear on your banner  do you not know your house ought to have a bloodfeud against me i slew your greatuncle or cousin or some other kinsman at gilberts house in scotland long ago and since then i sleep on his skin every night and carry his picture in my banner all day  bloodfeuds are solemn things said waltheof frowning karl killed my grandfather aldred at the battle of settrington and his four sons are with the army at york now  for the love of all saints and of england do not think of avenging that every man must now put away old grudges and remember that he has but one foewilliam and his frenchmen  very nobly spoken but those sons of karland i think you said you had killed a kinsman of mine  it was a bear lord earl a great white bear cannot you understand a jest or are you going to take up the quarrels of all white bears that are slain between here and iceland you will end by burning crowland minster then for there are twelve of your kinsmens skins there which canute gave forty years ago  burn crowland minster st guthlac and all saints forbid said waltheof crossing himself devoutly  are you a monkmonger into the bargain as well as a dolt a bad prospect for us if you are said hereward to himself  ah my dear lord king said waltheof and you are recovering  somewhat said the lad sitting up under the care of this kind knight  he is a monk sir atheling and not a knight said hereward our fenmen can wear a mailshirt as easily as a frock and handle a twybill as neatly as a breviary  waltheof shook his head it is contrary to the canons of holy church  so are many things that are done in england just now need has no master now sir earl and sir atheling what are you going to do  neither of them it seemed very well knew they would go to york if they could get there and join gospatrick and marlesweyn and certainly it was the most reasonable thing to be done  but if you mean to get to york you must march after another fashion than this said hereward see sir earl why you were broken by gilbert and why you will be broken again if this order holds if you march your men along one of these old roman streetsby st mary these romans had more wits than we for we have spoilt the roads they left us and never made a new one of our own  they were heathens and enchantersand waltheof crossed himself  and conquered the world wellif you march along one of these streets you must ride as i rode when i came up to you you must not let your knights go first and your menatarms straggle after in a tail a mile long like a scratch pack of hounds all sizes but except each others you must keep your footmen on the high street and make your knights ride in two bodies right and left upon the wold to protect their flanks and baggage  but the knights wont as gentlemen they have a right to the best ground  then they may go towhither they will go if the french come upon them if they are on the flanks and you are attacked then they can charge in right and left on the enemys flank while the footmen make a stand to cover the wagons  yesthat is very good i believe that is your french fashion  it is the fashion of commonsense like all things which succeed  but you see the knights would not submit to ride in the mire  then you must make them what else have they horses for while honester men than they trudge on foot  make them said waltheof with a shrug and a smile they are all free gentlemen like ourselves  and like ourselves will come to utter ruin because every one of them must needs go his own way  i am glad said waltheof as they rode along that you called this my earldom i hold it to be mine of course in right of my father but the landsfolks you know gave it to your nephew morcar  i care not to whom it is given i care for the man who is on it to raise these landsfolk and make them fight you are here therefore you are earl  yes the powers that be are ordained by god  you must not strain that text too far lord earl for the only power that is whom i see in englandworse luck for itis william the mamzer  so i have often thought  you have as i feared to himself the pike will have you next gudgeon  he has with him the holy father at rome and therefore the blessed apostle st peter of course and is a man right in the sight of heaven who resists them i only say it but where a man looks to the salvation of his own soul he must needs think thereof seriously at least  o are you at that thought hereward tout est perdu the question is earl said he aloud simply this how many men can you raise off this shire  i have raisednot so many as i could wish harold and ediths men have joined me fairly well but your nephew morcars  i can command them i have half of them here already  thenthen we may raise the rest  that depends my lord earl for whom we fight  for whomi do not understand  whether we fight for that lad child edgar or for sweyn of denmark the rightful king of england  sweyn of denmark who should be the rightful king but the heir of the blessed st edward  blessed old fool he has done harm to us enough on earth without leaving his secondcousins aunts malkins to harm us after he is in heaven  sir hereward sir hereward i fear thou art not as good a christian as so good a knight should be  christian or not i am as good a one as my neighbors i am leofrics son leofric put harthacanute on the throne and your father who was a man helped him you know what has befallen england since we danes left the danish stock at godwins bidding and put our necks under the yoke of wessex monks and monkmongers you may follow your fathers track or not as you like i shall follow my fathers and fight for sweyn ulfsson and no man else  and i said waltheof shall follow the anointed of the lord  the anointed of gospatrick and two or three boys said hereward knights turn your horses heads right about face all we are going back to the bruneswold to live and die free danes  and to waltheofs astonishment who had never before seen discipline the knights wheeled round the menatarms followed them and waltheof and the atheling were left to themselves on lincoln heath     chapter xxiv  how archbishop aldred died of sorrow   in the tragedies of the next few months hereward took no part but they must be looked at near in order to understand somewhat of the men who were afterwards mixed up with him for weal or woe  when william went back to the south the confederates child edgar the atheling gospatrick and their friends had come south again from durham it was undignified a confession of weakness if a norman had likened them to mice coming out when the cat went away none could blame him but so they did and osbiorn and his danes landing in humbermouth were met says the anglosaxon chronicle by child edgar and earl waltheof and marlesweyn and earl gospatrick with the men of northumberland riding and marching joyfully with an immense army not having the spirit of prophecy or foreseeing those things which were coming on the earth  to them repaired edwin and morcar the two young earls arkill and karl the great thanes or at least the four sons of karlfor accounts differand what few else of the northern nobility tosti had left unmurdered  the men of northumberland received the danes with open arms they would besiege york they would storm the new norman keep they would proclaim edgar king at york  in that keep sat two men one of whom knew his own mind the other did not one was william malet knight one of the heroes of hastings a noble norman and châtelain of york castle the other was archbishop aldred  aldred seems to have been a man like too many morepious and virtuous and harmless enough and not without worldly prudence but his prudence was of that sort which will surely swim with the stream and honor the powers that be if they be but prosperous enough for after all if success be not god it is like enough to him in some mens eyes to do instead so archbishop aldred had crowned harold godwinsson when harolds star was in the ascendant  and who but archbishop aldred should crown william when his star had cast harolds down from heaven he would have crowned satanas himself had he only proved himself king de factoas he asserts himself to be de jureof this wicked world  so aldred who had not only crowned william but supported his power north of humber by all means lawful sat in york keep and looked at william malet wondering what he would do  malet would hold it to the last as for the new keep it was surely impregnable the old wallsthe roman walls on which had floated the flag of constantine the greatwere surely strong enough to keep out men without batteringrams balistas or artillery  of any kind what mattered osbiorns two hundred and forty ships and their crews of some ten or fifteen thousand men what mattered the tens of thousands of northern men with gospatrick at their head let them rage and rob round the walls a messenger had galloped in from william in the forest of dean to tell malet to hold out to the last he had galloped out again bearing for answer that the normans could hold york for a year  but the archbishops heart misgave him as from north and south at once came up the dark masses of two mighty armies broke up into columns and surged against every gate of the city at the same time they had no batteringtrain to breach the ancient walls but they hadand none knew it better than aldredhundreds of friends inside who would throw open to them the gates  one gate he could command from the castle tower his face turned pale as he saw a mob of armed townsmen rushing down the street towards it a furious scuffle with the french guards and then through the gateway the open champaign beyond and a gleaming wave of axes helms and spears pouring in and up the street  the traitors he almost shrieked as he turned and ran down the ladder to tell malet below  malet was firm but pale as aldred  we must fight to the last said he as he hurried down commanding his men to sally at once en masse and clear the city  the mistake was fatal the french were entangled in the narrow streets the houses shut to them were opened to the english and danes and overwhelmed from above as well as in front the greater part of the norman garrison perished in the first fight the remnant were shut up in the castle the danes and english seized the houses round and shot from the windows at every loophole and embrasure where a norman showed himself  shoot fire upon the houses said malet  you will not burn york o god is it come to this  and why not york town or york minster or rome itself with the pope inside it rather than yield to barbarians  archbishop aldred went into his room and lay down on his bed outside was the roar of the battle and soon louder and louder the roar of flame this was the end of his timeserving and kingmaking and he said many prayers and beat his breast and then called to his chaplain for blankets for he was very cold i have slain my own sheep he moaned slain my own sheep  his chaplain hapt him up in bed and looked out of the window at the fight there was no lull neither was there any great advantage on either side only from the southward he could see fresh bodies of danes coming across the plain  the carcass is here and the eagles are gathered together fetch me the holy sacrament chaplain and god be merciful to an unfaithful shepherd  the chaplain went  i have slain my own sheep moaned the archbishop i have given them up to the wolvesgiven my own minster and all the treasures of the saints andandi am very cold  when the chaplain came back with the blessed sacrament archbishop aldred was more than cold for he was already dead and stiff  but william malet would not yield he and his normans fought day after day with the energy of despair they asked leave to put forth the body of the archbishop and young waltheof who was a pious man insisted that leave should be given  so the archbishops coffin was thrust forth of the castlegate and the monks from the abbey came and bore it away and buried it in the cathedral church  and then the fight went on day after day and more and more houses burned till york was all aflame on the eighth day the minster was in a light low over archbishop aldreds newmade grave all was burntminster churches old roman palaces and all the glories of constantine the great and the mythic past  the besiegers hewing and hammering gate after gate had now won all but the keep itself then malets heart failed him a wife he had and children and for their sake he turned coward and fled by night with a few menatarms across the burning ruins  then into what once was york the confederate earls and thanes marched in triumph and proclaimed edgar kinga king of dust and ashes  and where were edwin and morcar the meanwhile it is not told were they struggling against william at stafford or helping edric the wild and his welshmen to besiege chester probably they were aiding the insurrectionif not at these two points still at some other of their great earldoms of mercia and chester they seemed to triumph for a while during the autumn of 1069 the greater part of england seemed lost to william many normans packed up their plunder and went back to france and those whose hearts were too stout to return showed no mercy to the english even as william showed none to crush the heart of the people by massacres and mutilations and devastations was the only hope of the invader and thoroughly he did his work whenever he had a chance     chapter xxv  how hereward found a wiser man in england than himself   there have been certain men so great that he who describes them in words much more pretends to analyze their inmost feelings must be a very great man himself or incur the accusation of presumption and such a great man was william of normandyone of those unfathomable masterpersonages who must not be rashly dragged on any stage the genius of a bulwer in attempting to draw him took care with a wise modesty not to draw him in too much detailto confess always that there was much beneath and behind in williams character which none even of his contemporaries could guess and still more modest than bulwer is this chronicler bound to be  but one may fancy for once in a way what williams thoughts were when they brought him the evil news of york for we know what his acts were and he acted up to his thoughts  hunting he was they say in the forest of dean when first he heard that all england north of the watling street had broken loose and that he was king of only half the isle  did heas when hunting in the forest of rouen he got the news of harolds coronationplay with his bow stringing and unstringing it nervously till he had made up his mighty mind then did he go home to his lodge and there spread on the rough oak board a parchment map of england which no child would deign to learn from now but was then good enough to guide armies to victory because the eyes of a great general looked upon it  as he pored over the map by the light of bogdeal torch or rush candle what would he see upon it  three separate blazes of insurrection from northwest to east along the watling street  at chester edric the wild thane who according to domesdaybook had lost vast lands in shropshire algitha harolds widow and blethwallon and all his welshthe white mantles swarming along chester streets not as usually to tear and ravage like the wildcats of their own rocks but fast friends by blood of algitha once their queen on penmaenmawr footnote see the admirable description of the tragedy of penmaenmawr in bulwers harold edwin the young earl algithas brother herewards nephewhe must be with them too if he were a man  eastward round stafford and the centre of mercia another blaze of furious english valor morcar edwins brother must be there as their earl if he too was a man  then in the fens and kesteven what meant this news that hereward of st omer was come again and an army with him that he was levying war on all frenchmen in the name of sweyn king of denmark and of england he is an outlaw a desperado a boastful swashbuckler thought william it may be to himself he found out in after years that he had mistaken his man  and north at york in the rear of those three insurrections lay gospatrick waltheof and marlesweyn with the northumbrian host durham was lost and comyn burnt therein but york so boasted william malet could hold out for a year he should not need to hold out for so long  and last and worst of all hung on the eastern coast the mighty fleet of sweyn who claimed england as his of right the foe whom he had part feared ever since he set foot on english soil a collision with whom had been inevitable all along was come at last but where would he strike his blow  william knew it may be that the danes had been defeated at norwich he knew doubt it not for his spies told him everything that they had purposed entering the wash to prevent a junction between them and hereward was impossible he must prevent a junction between them and edwin and morcars men  he determined it seemsfor he did itto cut the english line in two and marched upon stafford as its centre  so it seems for all records of these campaigns are fragmentary confused contradictory the normans fought and had no time to write history the english beaten and crushed died and left no sign the only chroniclers of the time are monks and little could ordericus vitalis or florence of worcester or he of peterborough faithful as he was who filled up the sad pages of the anglosaxon chroniclelittle could they see or understand of the masterly strategy which was conquering all england for norman monks in order that they following the army like black ravens might feast themselves upon the prey which others won for them to them the death of an abbot the squabbles of a monastery the journey of a prelate to rome are more important than the manoeuvres which decided the life and freedom of tens of thousands  so all we know is that william fell upon morcars men at stafford and smote them with a great destruction rolling the fugitives west and east toward edwin perhaps at chester certainly toward hereward in the fens  at stafford met him the fugitives from york malet his wife and children with the dreadful news that the danes had joined gospatrick and that york was lost  william burst into fiendish fury he accused the wretched men of treason he cut off their hands thrust out their eyes threw malet into prison and stormed on north  he lay at pontefract for three weeks the bridges over the aire were broken down but at last he crossed and marched on york  no man opposed him the danes were gone down to the humber gospatrick and waltheofs hearts had failed them and they had retired before the great captain  florence of worcester says that william bought earl osbiorn off giving him much money and leave to forage for his fleet along the coast and that osbiorn was outlawed on his return to denmark  doubtless william would have so done if he could doubtless the angry and disappointed english raised such accusations against the earl believing them to be true but is not the simpler cause of osbiorns conduct to be found in this plain fact he had sailed from denmark to put sweyn his brother on the throne he found on his arrival that gospatrick and waltheof had seized it in the name of edgar atheling what had he to do more in england save what he didgo out into the humber and winter safely there waiting till sweyn should come with reinforcements in the spring  then william had his revenge he destroyed in the language of scripture the life of the land far and wide the farms were burnt over their owners heads the growing crops upon the ground the horses were houghed the cattle driven off while of human death and misery there was no end yorkshire and much of the neighboring counties lay waste for the next nine years it did not recover itself fully till several generations after  the danes had boasted that they would keep their yule at york william kept his yule there instead he sent to winchester for the regalia of the confessor and in the midst of the blackened ruins while the english for miles around wandered starving in the snows feeding on carrion on rats and mice and at last upon each others corpses he sat in his royal robes and gave away the lands of edwin and morcar to his liegemen and thus like the romans from whom he derived both his strategy and his civilization he made a solitude and called it peace  he did not give away waltheofs lands and only part of gospatricks he wanted gospatrick he loved waltheof and wanted him likewise  therefore through the desert which he himself had made he forced his way up to the tees a second time over snowcovered moors and this time st cuthbert had sent no fog being satisfied presumably with williams orthodox attachment to st peter and rome so the conqueror treated quietly with waltheof and gospatrick who lay at durham  gospatrick got back his ancestral earldom from tees to tyne and paid down for it much hard money and treasure bought it in fact he said  waltheof got back his earldom and much of morcars from the fens to the tees was to be his province and then to the astonishment alike of normans and english and it may be of himself he married judith the conquerors niece and became once more williams loved and trusted friendor slave  it seems inexplicable at first sight inexplicable save as an instance of that fascination which the strong sometimes exercise over the weak  then william turned southwest edwin wild edric the dispossessed thane of shropshire and the wilder blethwallon and his welshmen were still harrying and slaying they had just attacked shrewsbury william would come upon them by a way they thought not of  so over the backbone of england by way probably of halifax or huddersfield through pathless moors and bogs down towards the plains of lancashire and cheshire he pushed over and on his soldiers from the plains of sunny france could not face the cold the rain the bogs the hideous gorges the valiant peasantsstill the finest and shrewdest race of men in all englandwho set upon them in wooded glens or rolled stones on them from the limestone crags they prayed to be dismissed to go home  cowards might go back said william he should go on if he could not ride he would walk whoever lagged he would be foremost and cheered by his example the army at last debouched upon the cheshire flats  then he fell upon edwin as he had fallen upon morcar he drove the wild welsh through the pass of mold and up into their native hills he laid all waste with fire and sword for many a mile as domesdaybook testifies to this day he strengthened the walls of chester and trampled out the last embers of rebellion he went down south to salisbury king of england once again  why did he not push on at once against the one rebellion left alightthat of hereward and his fenmen  it may be that he understood him and them it may be that he meant to treat with sweyn as he had done if the story be true with osbiorn it is more likely that he could do no more that his army after so swift and long a campaign required rest it may be that the time of service of many of his mercenaries was expired be that as it may he mustered them at old sarumthe roman british burgh which still stands on the down side and rewarded them according to their deserts from the lands of the conquered english  how soon hereward knew all this or how he passed the winter of 107071 we cannot tell but to him it must have been a winter of bitter perplexity  it was impossible to get information from edwin and news from york was almost as impossible to get for gilbert of ghent stood between him and it  he felt himself now pent in all but trapped since he had set foot last in england ugly things had risen up on which he had calculated too littlenamely norman castles a whole ring of them in norfolk and suffolk cut him off from the south a castle at cambridge closed the south end of the fens another at bedford the western end while lincoln castle to the north cut him off from york  his men did not see the difficulty and wanted him to march towards york and clear all lindsay and right up to the humber  gladly would he have done so when he heard that the danes were wintering in the humber  but how can we take lincoln castle without artillery or even a batteringram  let us march past it then and leave it behind  ah my sons said hereward laughing sadly do you suppose that the mamzer spends his timeand englishmens life and laborin heaping up those great stone mountains that you and i may walk past them they are put there just to prevent our walking past unless we choose to have the garrison sallying out to attack our rear and cut us off from home and carry off our women into the bargain when our backs are turned  the english swore and declared that they had never thought of that  no we drink too much ale this side of the channel to think of thator of anything beside  but said leofwin prat if we have no artillery we can make some  spoken like yourself good comrade if we only knew how  i know said torfrida i have read of such things in books of the ancients and i have watched them making continuallyi little knew why or that i should ever turn engineer  what is there that you do not know cried they all at once and torfrida actually showed herself a fair practical engineer  but where was iron to come from iron for catapult springs iron for ram heads iron for bolts and bars  torfrida said here ward yon are wise can you use the diviningrod  why my knight  because there might be iron ore in the wolds and if you could find it by the rod we might get it up and smelt it  torfrida said humbly that she would try and walked with the diviningrod between her pretty fingers for many a mile in wood and wold wherever the ground looked red and rusty but she never found any iron  we must take the tires off the cartwheels said leofwin prat  but how will the carts do without for we shall want them if we march  in provence where i was born the wheels of the carts are made out of one round piece of wood could we not cut out wheels like them asked torfrida  you are the wise woman as usual said hereward  torfrida burst into a violent flood of tears no one knew why  there came over her a vision of the creaking carts and the little sleek oxen dovecolored and doveeyed with their canvas mantles tied neatly on to keep off heat and flies lounging on with their light load of vine and olive twigs beneath the blazing southern sun when should she see the sun once more she looked up at the brown branches overhead howling in the december gale and down at the brown fen below dying into mist and darkness as the low december sun died down and it seemed as if her life was dying down with it there would be no more sun and no more summers for her upon this earth  none certainly for her poor old mother her southern blood was chilling more and more beneath the bitter sky of kesteven the fall of the leaf had brought with it rheumatism ague an many miseries cunning old leechwives treated the french lady with tonics mugwort and bogbean and good wine enow but like david of old she got no heat and before yuletide came she had prayed herself safely out of this world and into the world to come and torfridas heart was the more light when she saw her go  she was absorbed utterly in hereward and his plots she lived for nothing else  and clung to them all the more fiercely the more desperate they seemed  so that small band of gallant men labored on waiting for the danes and trying to make artillery and take lincoln keep and all the whileso unequal is fortune when god so willsthroughout the southern weald from hastings to hindhead every copse glared with charcoalheaps every glen was burrowed with iron diggings every hammerpond stamped and gurgled night and day smelting and forging english iron wherewith the frenchmen might slay englishmen  williamthough perhaps he knew it not himselfhad in securing sussex and surrey secured the then great ironfield of england and an unlimited supply of weapons and to that circumstance it may be as much as to any other the success of his campaigns may be due  it must have been in one of these december days that a handful of knights came through the bruneswold mud and blood bespattered urging on tired horses as men desperate and foredone and the foremost of them all when he saw hereward at the gate of bourne leaped down and threw his arms round his neck and burst into bitter weeping  hereward i know you though you know me not i am your nephew morcar algarsson and all is lost  as the winter ran on other fugitives came in mostly of rank and family at last edwin himself came young and fair like morcar he who should have been the conquerors soninlaw for whom his truelove pined as he pined in vain where were sweyn and his danes whither should they go till he came  to ely answered hereward  whether or not it was his wit which first seized on the military capabilities of ely is not told leofric the deacon who is likely to know best says that there were men there already holding theirs out against william and that they sent for hereward but it is not clear from his words whether they were fugitives or merely bold abbot thurstan and his monks  it is but probable nevertheless that hereward as the only man among the fugitives who ever showed any ability whatsoever and who was also the only leader save morcar connected with the fen conceived the famous camp of refuge and made it a formidable fact be that as it may edwin and morcar went to ely and there joined them a count tosti according to leofric unknown to history a siward barn or the boy who had been dispossessed of lands in lincolnshire  and other valiant and noble gentlementhe last wrecks of the english aristocracy and there they sat in abbot thurstans hall and waited for sweyn and the danes  but the worst jobs messenger who during that evil winter and spring came into the fen was bishop egelwin of durham he it was most probably who brought the news of yorkshire laid waste with fire and sword he it was most certainly who brought the worse news still that gospatrick and waltheof were gone over to the king he was at durham seemingly when he saw that and fled for his life ere evil overtook him for to yield to william that brave bishop had no mind  but when hereward heard that waltheof was married to the conquerors niece he smote his hands together and cursed him and the mother who bore him to siward the stout  could thy father rise from his grave he would split thy craven head in the very lap of the frenchwoman  a hard lap will he find it hereward said torfrida i know herwanton false and vain heaven grant he do not rue the day he ever saw her  heaven grant he may rue it would that her bosom were knives and fishhooks like that of the statue in the fairytale see what he has done for us he is earl not only of his own lands but he has taken poor morcars too and half his earldom he is earl of huntingdon of cambridge they sayof this ground on which we stand what right have i here now how can i call on a single man to arm as i could in morcars name i am an outlaw here and a robber and so is every man with me and do you think that william did not know that he saw well enough what he was doing when he set up that great brainless idol as earl again he wanted to split up the danish folk and he has done it the northumbrians will stick to waltheof they think him a mighty hero because he held yorkgate alone with his own axe against all the french  well that was a gallant deed  pish we are all gallant men we english it is not courage that we want it is brains so the yorkshire and lindsay men and the nottingham men too will go with waltheof and round here and all through the fens every coward every prudent man evenevery man who likes to be within the law and feel his head safe on his shouldersno blame to himwill draw each from me for fear of this new earl and leave us to end as a handful of outlaws i see it all as william sees it all he is wise enough the mamzer and so is his father belial to whom he will go home some day yes torfrida he went on after a pause more gently but in a tone of exquisite sadness you were right as you always are i am no match for that man i see it now  i never said that only  only you told me again and again that he was the wisest man on earth  and yet for that very reason i bade you win glory without end by defying the wisest man on earth  and do you bid me do it still  god knows what i bid said torfrida bursting into tears let me go pray for i never needed it more  hereward watched her kneeling as he sat moody all but desperate then he glided to her side and said gently  teach me how to pray torfrida i can say a pater or an ave but that does not comfort a mans heart as far as i could ever find teach me to pray as you and my mother do  and she put her arms round the wild mans neck and tried to teach him like a little child     chapter xxvi  how hereward fulfilled his words to the prior of the golden borough   in the course of that winter died good abbot brand hereward went over to see him and found him mumbling to himself texts of isaiah and confessing the sins of his people  woe to the vineyard that bringeth forth wild grapes woe to those that join house to house and field to fieldlike us and the godwinssons and every man that could till we stood alone in the land many houses great and fair shall be without inhabitants it is all foretold in holy writ hereward my son woe to those who rise early to fill themselves with strong drink and the tabret and harp are in their feasts but they regard not the works of the lord therefore my people are gone into captivity because they have no knowledge ah those frenchmen have knowledge and too much of it while we have brains filled with ale instead of justice therefore hell hath enlarged herself and opened her mouth without measure and all go down into it one by one and dost thou think thou shalt escape hereward thou stouthearted  i neither know nor care but this i know that whithersoever i go i shall go sword in hand  they that take the sword shall perish by the sword said brand and blessed hereward and died  a week after came news that thorold of malmesbury was coming to take the abbey of peterborough and had got as far as stamford with a right royal train  then hereward sent abbot thorold word that if he or his frenchmen put foot into peterborough he hereward would burn it over their heads and that if he rode a mile beyond stamford town he should walk back into it barefoot in his shirt  whereon thorold abode at stamford and kept up his spirits by singing the songs of rolandwhich some say he himself composed  a week after that and the danes were come  a mighty fleet with sweyn ulfsson at their head went up the ouse toward ely another with osbiorn at their head having joined them off the mouth of the humber sailed it seems up the nene all the chivalry of denmark and ireland was come and with it all the chivalry and the unchivalry of the baltic shores vikings from jomsburg and arkona gottlanders from wisby and with them savages from esthonia finns from Äland letts who still offered in the forests of rugen human victims to the fourheaded swantowit foul hordes in sheepskins and primeval filth who might have been scented from hunstanton cliff ever since their ships had rounded the skaw  hereward hurried to them with all his men he was anxious of course to prevent their plundering the landsfolk as they wentand that the savages from the baltic shore would certainly do if they could however reasonable the danes orkneymen and irish ostmen might be  food of course they must take where they could find it but outrages were not a necessary though a too common adjunct to the process of emptying a farmers granaries  he found the danes in a dangerous mood sulky and disgusted as they had good right to be they had gone to the humber and found nothing but ruin the land waste the french holding both the shores of the humber and osbiorn cowering in humbermouth hardly able to feed his men they had come to conquer england and nothing was left for them to conquer but a few peatbogs then they would have what there was in them every one knew that gold grew up in england out of the ground wherever a monk put his foot and they would plunder crowland their forefathers had done it and had fared none the worse english gold they would have if they could not get fat english manors  no not crowland said hereward any place but crowland endowed and honored by canute the greatcrowland whose abbot was a danish nobleman whose monks were danes to a man of their own flesh and blood canutes soul would rise up in valhalla and curse them if they took the value of a penny from st guthlac st guthlac was their good friend he would send them bread meat ale all they needed but woe to the man who set foot upon his ground  hereward sent off messengers to crowland warning all to be ready to escape into the fens and entreating ulfketyl to empty his storehouses into his barges and send food to the danes ere a day was past and ulfketyl worked hard and well till a string of barges wound its way through the fens laden with beeves and bread and alebarrels in plenty and with monks too who welcomed the danes as their brethren talked to them in their own tongue blessed them in st guthlacs name as the saviors of england and went home again chanting so sweetly their thanks to heaven for their safety that the wild vikings were awed and agreed that st guthlacs men were wise folk and openhearted and that it was a shame to do them harm  but plunder they must have  and plunder you shall have said hereward as a sudden thought struck him i will show you the way to the golden boroughthe richest minster in england and all the treasures of the golden borough shall be yours if you will treat englishmen as friends and spare the people of the fens  it was a great crime in the eyes of men of that time a great crime taken simply in herewards own eyes but necessity knows no law something the danes must have and ought to have and st peters gold was better in their purses than in that of thorold and his french monks  so he led them across the fens and side rivers till they came into the old nene which men call catwater and muscal now  as he passed nomanslandhirne and the mouth of the crowland river he trembled and trusted that the danes did not know that they were within three miles of st guthlacs sanctuary but they went on ignorant and up the muscal till they saw st peters towers on the wooded rise and behind them the great forest which now is milton park  there were two parties in peterborough minster a smaller faction of stouthearted english a larger one who favored william and the french customs with prior herluin at their head herluin wanted not for foresight and he knew that evil was coming on him he knew that the danes were in the fen he knew that hereward was with them he knew that they had come to crowland hereward could never mean to let them sack it peterborough must be their point and herluin set his teeth like a bold man determined to abide the worst and barred and barricaded every gate and door  that night a hapless churchwarden ywar was his name might have been seen galloping through milton and castor hanglands and on by barnack quarries over southorpe heath with saddlebags of huge size stuffed with gospels massrobes cassocks and other garments and such other small things as he could carry away and he came before day to stamford where abbot thorold lay at his ease in his inn with his hommes darmes asleep in the hall  and the churchwarden knocked them up and drew abbot thorolds curtains with a face such as his who       drew priams curtains in the dead of night    and would have told him half his troy was burned  and told abbot thorold that the monks of peterborough had sent him and that unless he saddled and rode his best that night with his meinie of menatarms his golden borough would be even as troy town by morning light  a moi hommes darmes shouted thorold as he used to shout whenever he wanted to scourge his wretched english monks at malmesbury into some french fashion  the men leaped up and poured in growling  take me this monk and kick him into the street for waking me with such news  but gracious lord the outlaws will surely burn peterborough and folks said that you were a mighty man of war  so i am but if i were roland oliver and turpin rolled into one how am i to fight hereward and the danes with forty menatarms answer me that thou dunderheaded english porker kick him out  and ywar was kicked into the cold while thorold raged up and down his chamber in mantle and slippers wringing his hands over the treasure of the golden borough snatched from his fingers just as he was closing them upon it  that night the monks of peterborough prayed in the minster till the long hours passed into the short the poor corrodiers and other servants of the monastery fled from the town outside into the milton woods the monks prayed on inside till an hour after matin when the first flush of the summers dawn began to show in the northeastern sky they heard mingling with their own chant another chant which peterborough had not heard since it was medehampstead three hundred years agothe terrible yuchheysaasaasaathe warsong of the vikings of the north  their chant stopped of itself with blanched faces and trembling knees they fled regardless of all discipline up into the minster tower and from the leads looked out northeastward on the fen  the first rays of the summer sun were just streaming over the vast sheet of emerald and glittering upon the winding river and on a winding line too seemingly endless of scarlet coats and shields black hulls gilded poops and vanes and beakheads and the flash and foam of innumerable oars  and nearer and louder came the oarroll like thunder working up from the northeast and mingled with it that grim yet laughing heysaa which bespoke in its very note the revelry of slaughter  the ships had all their sails on deck but as they came nearer the monks could see the banners of the two foremost vessels  the one was the red and white of the terrible dannebrog the other the scarcely less terrible white bear of hereward  he will burn the minster he has vowed to do it as a child he vowed and he must do it in this very minster the fiend entered into him and possessed him and to this minster has the fiend brought him back to do his will satan my brethren having a special spite as must needs be against st peter rock and pillar of the holy church chose out and inspired this man even from his mothers womb that he might be the foe and robber of st peter and the hater of all who like my humility honor him and strive to bring this english land into due obedience to that blessed apostle bring forth the relics my brethren bring forth above all things those filings of st peters own chainsthe special glory of our monastery and perhaps its safeguard this day  some such bombast would any monk of those days have talked in like case and yet so strange a thing is man he might have been withal like herluin a shrewd and valiant man  they brought out all the relics they brought out the filings themselves in a box of gold they held them out over the walls at the ships and called on all the saints to whom they belonged but they stopped that line of scarlet black and gold as much as their spiritual descendants stop the lavastream of vesuvius when they hold out similar matters at them with a hope unchanged by the experience of eight hundred years the heysaa rose louder and nearer the danes were coming and they came  and all the while a thousand skylarks rose from off the fen and chanted their own chant aloft as if appealing to heaven against that which mans greed and mans rage and mans superstition had made of this fair earth of god  the relics had been brought out but as they would not work the only thing to be done was to put them back again and hide them safe lest they should bow down like bel and stoop like nebo and be carried like them into captivity themselves being worth a very large sum of money in the eyes of the more christian part of the danish host  then to hide the treasures as well as they could which says the anglosaxon chronicle they hid somewhere in the steeple  the danes were landing now the shout which they gave as they leaped on shore made the hearts of the poor monks sink low would they be murdered as well as robbed perhaps notprobably not hereward would see to that and some wanted to capitulate  herluin would not hear of it they were safe enough st peters relic might not have worked a miracle on the spot but it must have done something st peter had been appealed to on his honor and on his honor he must surely take the matter up at all events the walls and gates were strong and the danes had no artillery let them howl and rage round the holy place till abbot thorold and the frenchmen of the country rose and drove them to their ships  in that last thought the cunning norman was not so far wrong the danes pushed up through the little town and to the minster gates but entrance was impossible and they prowled round and round like raging wolves about a winter steading but found no crack of entry  prior herluin grew bold and coming to the leads of the gateway tower looked over cautiously and holding up a certain most sacred emblemnot to be profaned in these pagescursed them in the name of his whole pantheon  aha herluin are you there asked a short square man in gay armor have you forgotten the peatstack outside bolldyke gate and how you bade light it under me thirty years since  thou art winter and the prior uttered what would be considered from any but a churchmans lips a blasphemous and bloodthirsty curse but which was as their writings sufficiently testify merely one of the lawful weapons or arts of those christians who were forbidden to fightthe other weapon or art being that of lying  aha that goes like rain off a ducks back to one who has been a minster scholar in his time you danes ostmen down if you shoot at that man ill cut your heads off he is the oldest foe i have in the world and the only one who ever hit me without my hitting him again and nobody shall touch him but me so down bows i say  the daneshumorous all of themsaw that there was a jest toward and perhaps some earnest too and joined in jeering the prior  herluin had ducked his head behind the parapet not from cowardice but simply because he had on no mail and might be shot any moment but when he heard winter forbid them to touch him he lifted up his head and gave his old pupil as good as he brought  with his sharp swift norman priests tongue he sneered he jeered he scolded he argued and then threatened suddenly changing his tone in words of real eloquence he appealed to the superstitions of his hearers he threatened them with supernatural vengeance  some of them began to slink away frightened st peter was an ill man to have a blood feud with  winter stood laughing and jeering again for full ten minutes at last i asked and you have not answered have you forgotten the peatstack outside bolldyke gate for if you have hereward has not he has piled it against the gate and it should be burnt through by this time go and see  herluin disappeared with a curse  now you seacocks said winter springing up well to the bolldyke gate and all start fair  the bolldyke gate was on fire and more so were the suburbs there was no time to save them as hereward would gladly have done for the sake of the poor corrodiers they must goon to the bolldyke gate who cared to put out flames behind him with all the treasures of golden borough before him in a few minutes all the town was alight in a few minutes more the monastery likewise  a fire is detestable enough at all times but most detestable by day at night it is customary a work of darkness which lights up the dark picturesque magnificent with a fitness tartarean and diabolic but under a glaring sun amid green fields and blue skies all its wickedness is revealed without its beauty you see its works and little more the flame is hardly noticed all that is seen is a canker eating up gods works cracking the bones of its preyfor that horrible cracking is uglier than all stagescene glarescruelly and shamelessly under the very eye of the great honest kindly sun  and that felt hereward as he saw peterborough burn he could not put his thoughts into words as men of this day can so much the better for him perhaps but he felt all the more intenselyas did men of his daythe things he could not speak all he said was aside to winter  it is a dark job i wish it had been done in the dark and winter knew what he meant  then the men rushed into the bolldyke gate while hereward and winter stood and looked with their men whom they kept close together waiting their commands the danes and their allies cared not for the great glowing heap of peat they cared not for each other hardly for themselves they rushed into the gap they thrust the glowing heap inward through the gateway with their lances they thrust each other down into it and trampled over them to fall themselves rising scorched and withered and yet struggling on toward the gold of the golden borough one savage lett caught another round the waist and hurled him bodily into the fire crying in his wild tongue  you will make a good steppingstone for me  that is not fair quoth hereward and clove him to the chine  it was wild work but the golden borough was won  we must in now and save the monks said hereward and dashed over the embers  he was only just in time in the midst of the great court were all the monks huddled together like a flock of sheep some kneeling most weeping bitterly after the fashion of monks  only herluin stood in front of them at bay a lofty crucifix in his hand he had no mind to weep but with a face of calm and bitter wrath he preferred words of peace and entreaty they were what the time needed therefore they should be given tomorrow he would write to bishop egelsin to excommunicate with bell book and candle to the lowest pit of tartarus all who had done the deed  but today he spoke them fair however his fair speeches profited little not being understood by a horde of letts and finns who howled and bayed at him and tried to tear the crucifix from his hands but feared the white christ  they were already gaining courage from their own yells in a moment more blood would have been shed and then a general massacre must have ensued  hereward saw it and shouting after me herewards men a bear a bear swung letts and finns right and left like cornsheaves and stood face to face with herluin  an angry finn smote him on the hindhead full with a stone axe he staggered and then looked round and laughed  fool hast thou not heard that herewards armor was forged by dwarfs in the mountainbowels off and hunt for gold or it will be all gone  the finn who was astonished at getting no more from his blow than a few sparks and expected instant death in return took the hint and vanished jabbering as did his fellows  now herluin the frenchman said hereward  now hereward the robber of saints said herluin  it was a fine sight the soldier and the churchman the englishman and the frenchman the man of the then world and the man of the then church pitted fairly face to face  hereward tried for one moment to stare down herluin but those terrible eyeglances before which vikings had quailed turned off harmless from the more terrible glance of the man who believed himself backed by the maker of the universe and all the hierarchy of heaven  a sharp unlovely face it was though like many a great churchmans face of those days it was neither thin nor haggard but rather round sleek of a puffy and unwholesome paleness but there was a thin lip above a broad square jaw which showed that herluin was neither fool nor coward  a robber and a child of belial thou hast been from thy cradle  and a robber and a child of belial thou art now dare thy last iniquity and slay the servants of st peter on st peters altar with thy worthy comrades the heathen saracens footnote the danes were continually mistaken by norman churchmen for saracens and the saracens considered to be idolaters a maumee or idol means a mahomet and set up mahound with them in the holy place  hereward laughed so jolly a laugh that the prior was taken aback  slay st peters rats i kill men not monks there shall not a hair of your head be touched  here herewards men march these traitors and their french prior safe out of the walls and into milton woods to look after their poor corrodiers and comfort their souls after they have ruined their bodies by their treason  out of this place i stir not here i am and here i will live or die as st peter shall send aid  but as he spoke he was precipitated rudely forward and hurried almost into herewards arms the whole body of monks when they heard herewards words cared to hear no more but desperate between fear and joy rushed forward bearing away their prior in the midst  so go the rats out of peterborough and so is my dream fulfilled now for the treasure and then to ely  but herluin burst himself clear of the frantic mob of monks and turned back on hereward  thou wast dubbed knight in that church  i know it man and that church and the relics of the saints in it are safe therefore hereward gives his word  thatbut not that only if thou art a true knight as thou holdest englishman  hereward growled savagely and made an ugly step toward herluin that was a point which he would not have questioned  then behave as a knight and save saveas the monks dragged him awaysave the hospice there are womenladies there shouted he as he was borne off  they never met again on earth but both comforted themselves in after years that two old enemies last deed in common had been one of mercy  hereward uttered a cry of horror if the wild letts even the jomsburgers had got in all was lost he rushed to the door it was not yet burst but a bench swung by strong arms was battering it in fast  winter geri siwards to me herewards men stand back fellows here are friends here inside if you do not ill cut you down  but in vain the door was burst and in poured the savage mob hereward unable to stop them headed them or pretended to do so with five or six of his own men round him and went into the hall  on the rushes lay some halfdozen grooms they were butchered instantly simply because they were there hereward saw but could not prevent he ran as hard as he could to the foot of the wooden stair which led to the upper floor  guard the stairfoot winter and he ran up  two women cowered upon the floor shrieking and praying with hands clasped over their heads he saw that the arms of one of them were of the most exquisite whiteness and judging her to be the lady bent over her lady you are safe i will protect you i am hereward  she sprang up and threw herself with a scream into his arms  hereward hereward save me i am  alftruda said hereward  it was alftruda if possible more beautiful than ever  i have got you she cried i am safe now take me awayout of this horrible place take me into the woodsanywhere only do not let me be burnt herestifled like a rat give me air give me water and she clung to him so madly that hereward as he held her in his arms and gazed on her extraordinary beauty forgot torfrida for the second time  but there was no time to indulge in evil thoughts even had any crossed his mind he caught her in his arms and commanding the maid to follow hurried down the stair  winter and the siwards were defending the foot with swinging blades the savages were howling round like curs about a bull and when hereward appeared above with the women there was a loud yell of rage and envy  he should not have the women to himselfthey would share the plunder equallywas shouted in half a dozen barbarous dialects  have you left any valuables in the chamber whispered he to alftruda  yes jewelsrobes let them have all only save me  let me pass roared hereward there is rich booty in the room above and you may have it as these ladies ransom them you do not touch back i say let me pass  and he rushed forward winter and the housecarles formed round him and the women and hurried down the hall while the savages hurried up the ladder to quarrel over their spoil  they were out in the courtyard and safe for the moment but whither should he take her  to earl osbiorn said one of the siwards but how to find him  there is bishop christiern and the bishop was caught and stopped  this is an evil days work sir hereward  then help to mend it by taking care of these ladies like a man of god and he explained the case  you may come safely with me my poor lambs said the bishop i am glad to find something to do fit for a churchman to me my housecarles  but they were all off plundering  we will stand by you and the ladies and see you safe down to the ships said winter and so they went off  hereward would gladly have gone with them as alftruda piteously entreated him but he heard his name called on every side in angry tones  who wants hereward  earl osbiornhere he is  those scoundrel monks have hidden all the altar furniture if you wish to save them from being tortured to death you had best find it  hereward ran with him into the cathedral it was a hideous sight torn books and vestments broken tabernacle work foul savages swarming in and out of every dark aisle and cloister like wolves in search of prey five or six ruffians aloft upon the rood screen one tearing the golden crown from the head of the crucifix another the golden footstool from its feet footnote the crucifix was probably of the greek pattern in which the figure stood upon a flat slab projecting from the cross  as hereward came up crucifix and man fell together crashing upon the pavement amid shouts of brutal laughter  he hurried past them shuddering into the choir the altar was bare the golden pallium which covered it gone  it may be in the crypt below i suppose the monks keep their relics there said osbiorn  no not there do not touch the relics would you have the curse of all the saints stay i know an old hidingplace it may be there up into the steeple with me  and in a chamber in the steeple they found the golden pall and treasures countless and wonderful  we had better keep the knowledge of this to ourselves awhile said earl osbiorn looking with greedy eyes on a heap of wealth such as he had never beheld before  not we hereward is a man of his word and we will share and share alike and he turned and went down the narrow winding stair  earl osbiorn gave one look at his turned back an evil spirit of covetousness came over him and he smote hereward full and strong upon the hindhead  the sword turned upon the magic helm and the sparks flashed out bright and wide  earl osbiorn shrunk back appalled and trembling  aha said hereward without looking round i never thought there would be loose stones in the roof here up here vikings berserker and seacocks all here jutlanders jomsburgers letts finns witches sons and devils sons all here cried he while osbiorn profited by that moment to thrust an especially brilliant jewel into his boot here is gold here is the dwarfs work come up and take your polotaswarf you would not get a richer out of the kaisers treasury here wolves and ravens eat gold drink gold roll in gold and know that hereward is a man of his word and pays his soldiers wages royally  they rushed up the narrow stair trampling each other to death and thrust hereward and the earl choking into a corner the room was so full for a few moments that some died in it hereward and osbiorn protected by their strong armor forced their way to the narrow window and breathed through it looking out upon the sea of flame below  that was an unlucky blow said hereward that fell upon my head  very unlucky i saw it coming but had no time to warn you why do you hold my wrist  mens daggers are apt to get loose at such times as these  what do you mean and earl osbiorn went from him and into the now thinning press soon only a few remained to search by the glare of the flames for what their fellows might have overlooked  now the play is played out said hereward we may as well go down and to our ships  some drunken ruffians would have burnt the church for mere mischief but osbiorn as well as hereward stopped that and gradually they got the men down to the ships some drunk some struggling under plunder some cursing and quarrelling because nothing had fallen to their lot it was a hideous scene but one to which hereward as well as osbiorn was too well accustomed to see aught in it save an hours inevitable trouble in getting the men on board  the monks had all fled only leofwin the long was left and he lay sick in the infirmary whether he was burned therein or saved by herewards men is not told  and so was the golden borough sacked and burnt now then whither  the danes were to go to ely and join the army there hereward would march on to stamford secure that town if he could then to huntingdon to secure it likewise and on to ely afterwards  you will not leave me among these savages said alftruda  heaven forbid you shall come with me as far as stamford and then i will set you on your way  my way said alftruda in a bitter and hopeless tone  hereward mounted her on a good horse and rode beside her lookingand he well knew ita very perfect knight soon they began to talk what had brought alftruda to peterborough of all places on earth  a womans fortune because i am richand some say fairi am a puppet and a slave a prey i was going back to myto dolfin  have you been away from him then  what do you not know  how should i know lady  yes most true how should hereward know anything about alftruda but i will tell you maybe you may not care to hear  about you anything i have often longed to know howwhat you were doing  is it possible is there one human being left on earth who cares to hear about alftruda then listen you know when gospatrick fled to scotland his sons went with him young gospatrick waltheof footnote this waltheof gospatricksson must not be confounded with waltheof siwardsson the young earl he became a wild border chieftain then baron of atterdale and then gave atterdale to his sister queen ethelreda and turned monk and at last abbot of crowland crawling home poor fellow like many another to die in peace in the sanctuary of the danes and hedolfin ethelreda his girl went tooand she is to marry they say duncan malcolms eldest son by ingebiorg so gospatrick will find himself some day fatherinlaw of the king of scots  i will warrant him to find his nest well lined wherever he be but of yourself  i refused to go i could not face again that bleak black north besidebut that is no concern of herewards  hereward was on the point of saying can anything concern you and not be interesting to me  but she went on  i refused and  and he misused you asked he fiercely  better if he had better if he had tied me to his stirrup and scourged me along into scotland than have left me to new dangers and to old temptations  what temptations  alftruda did not answer but went on  he told me in his lofty scots fashion that i was free to do what i list that he had long since seen that i cared not for him and that he would find many a fairer lady in his own land  there he lied so you did not care for him he is a noble knight  what is that to me womens hearts are not to be bought and sold with their bodies as i was sold care for him i care for no creature upon earth once i cared for hereward like a silly child now i care not even for him  hereward was sorry to hear that men are vainer than women just as peacocks are vainer than peahens and hereward wasalas for hima specially vain man of course for him to fall in love with alftruda would have been a shameful sinhe would not have committed it for all the treasures of constantinople but it was a not unpleasant thought that alftruda should fall in love with him but he only said tenderly and courteously  alas poor lady  poor lady too true that last for whither am i going now back to that man once more  to dolfin  to my master like a runaway slave i went down south to queen matilda i knew her well and she was kind to me as she is to all things that breathe but now that gospatrick is come into the kings grace again and has bought the earldom of northumbria from tweed to tyne  bought the earldom  that has he and paid for it right heavily  traitor and fool he will not keep it seven years the frenchman will pick a quarrel with him and cheat him out of earldom and money too  the which william did within three years  may it be so but when he came into the kings grace he must needs demand me back in his sons name  what does dolfin want with you  his father wants my money and stipulated for it with the king and beside i suppose i am a pretty plaything enough still  you you are divine perfect dolfin is right how could a man who had once enjoyed you live without you  alftruda laugheda laugh full of meaning but what that meaning was hereward could not divine  so now she said what hereward has to do as a true and courteous knight is to give alftruda safe conduct and if he can a guard and to deliver her up loyally and knightly to his old friend and fellowwarrior dolfin gospatricksson earl of whatever he can lay hold of for the current month  are you in earnest  alftruda laughed one of her strange laughs looking straight before her indeed she had never looked hereward in the face during the whole ride  what are those open holes graves  they are barnack stonequarries which alfgar my brother gave to crowland  so that is pity i thought they had been graves and then you might have covered me up in one of them and left me to sleep in peace  what can i do for you alftruda my old playfellow alftruda whom i saved from the bear  if she had foreseen the second monster into whose jaws she was to fall she would have prayed you to hold that terrible hand of yours which never since men say has struck without victory and renown you won your first honor for my sake but who am i now that you should turn out of your glorious path for me  i will do anythinganything but why miscall this noble prince a monster  if he were fairer than st john more wise than solomon and more valiant than king william he is to me a monster for i loathe him and i know not why but do your duty as a knight sir convey the lawful wife to her lawful spouse  what cares an outlaw for law in a land where law is dead and gone i will do what iwhat you like come with me to torfrida at bourne and let me see the man who dares try to take you out of my hand  alftruda laughed again  no no i should interrupt the little doves in their nest beside the billing and cooing might make me envious and i alas who carry misery with me round the land might make your torfrida jealous  hereward was of the same opinion and rode silent and thoughtful through the great woods which are now the noble park of burghley  i have found it said he at last why not go to gilbert of ghent at lincoln  gilbert why should he befriend me  he will do that or anything else which is for his own profit  profit all the world seems determined to make profit out of me i presume you would if i had come with you to bourne  i do not doubt it this is a very wild sea to swim in and a man must be forgiven if he catches at every bit of drifttimber  selfishness selfishness everywhereand i suppose you expect to gain by sending me to gilbert of ghent  i shall gain nothing alftruda save the thought that you are not so far from mefrom usbut that we can hear of yousend succor to you if you need  alftruda was silent at last  and you think that gilbert would not be afraid of angering the king  he would not anger the king gilberts friendship is more important to william at this moment than that of a dozen gospatricks he holds lincoln town and with it the key of waltheofs earldom and things may happen alftrudai tell you but if you tell gilbert may herewards curse be on you  not that any mans curse save yours said she in so passionate a voice that a thrill of fire ran through hereward and he recollected her scoff at brugesso he could not wait for me and a storm of evil thoughts swept through him would to heaven said he to himself crushing them gallantly down i had never thought of lincoln but there is no other plan  but he did not tell alftruda as he meant to do that she might see him soon in lincoln castle as its conqueror and lord he half hoped that when that day came alftruda might be somewhere else  gilbert can say he went on steadying himself again that you feared to go north on account of the disturbed state of the country and that as you had given yourself up to him of your own accord he thought it wisest to detain you as a hostage for dolfins allegiance  he shall say so i will make him say so  so be it now here we are at stamford town and i must to my trade do you like to see fighting alftrudathe mans game the royal game the only game worth a thought on earth for you are like to see a little in the next ten minutes  i should like to see you fight they tell me none is so swift and terrible in the battle as hereward how can you be otherwise who slew the bearwhen we were two happy children together but shall i be safe  safe of course said hereward who longed peacocklike to show off his prowess before a lady who wasthere was no denying itfar more beautiful than even torfrida  but he had no opportunity to show off his prowess for as he galloped in over stamford bridge abbot thorold galloped out at the opposite end of the town through casterton and up the roman road to grantham  after whom hereward sent alftruda for he heard that thorold was going to gilbert at lincoln with a guard of knights bidding them do him no harm but say that hereward knew him to be a preux chevalier and lover of fair ladies that he had sent him a right fair one to bear him company to lincoln and hoped that he would sing to her on the way the song of roland  and alftruda who knew thorold went willingly since it could no better be  after which according to gaimar hereward tarried three days at stamford laying a heavy tribute on the burgesses for harboring thorold and his normans and also surprised at a drinkingbout a certain special enemy of his and chased him from room to room sword in hand till he took refuge shamefully in an outhouse and begged his life and when his knights came back from grantham he marched to bourne  the next night says leofric the deacon or rather the monk who paraphrased his saga in latin prosehereward saw in his dreams a man standing by him of inestimable beauty old of years terrible of countenance in all the raiment of his body more splendid than all things which he had ever seen or conceived in his mind who threatened him with a great club which he carried in his hand and with a fearful doom that he should take back to his church all that had been carried off the night before and have them restored utterly each in its place if he wished to provide for the salvation of his soul and escape on the spot a pitiable death but when awakened he was seized with a divine terror and restored in the same hour all that he took away and so departed going onward with all his men  so says leofric wishing as may be well believed to advance the glory of st peter and purge his masters name from the stain of sacrilege beside the monks of peterborough no doubt had no wish that the world should spy out their nakedness and become aware that the golden borough was stript of all its gold  nevertheless truth will out golden borough was golden borough no more the treasures were never restored they went to sea with the danes and were scattered far and wideto norway to ireland to denmark all the spoils says the anglosaxon chronicle which reached the latter country being the pallium and some of the shrines and crosses and many of the other treasures they brought to one of the kings towns and laid them up in the church but one night through their carelessness and drunkenness the church was burned with all that was therein thus was the minster of peterborough burned and pillaged may almighty god have pity on it in his great mercy  hereward when blamed for the deed said always that he did it because of his allegiance to the monastery rather than that the treasures gathered by danish monks should fall into the hands of the french robbers let them be given to their own danish kinsmen in payment for their help to english liberty  but some of the treasure at least he must have surely given back it so appeased the angry shade of st peter for on that night when marching past stamford they lost their way to whom when they had lost their way a certain wonder happened and a miracle if it can be said that such would be worked in favor of men of blood for while in the wild night and dark they wandered in the wood a huge wolf met them wagging his tail like a tame dog and went before them on a path and they taking the gray beast in the darkness for a white dog cheered on each other to follow him to his farm which ought to be hard by and in the silence of the midnight that they might see their way suddenly candles appeared burning and clinging to the lances of all the knightsnot very bright however but like those which the folk call candelae nympharumwills of the wisp but none could pull them off or altogether extinguish them or throw them from their hands and thus they saw their way and went on although astonished out of mind with the wolf leading them until day dawned and they saw to their great astonishment that he was a wolf and as they questioned among themselves about what had befallen the wolf and the candles disappeared and they came whither they had been minded beyond stamford townthanking god and wondering at what had happened  after which hereward took torfrida and his child and all he had and took ship at bardeney and went for ely which when earl warrenne heard he laid wait for him seemingly near southery but got nothing thereby according to leofric but the pleasure of giving and taking a great deal of bad language and after his men had refused reasonably enough to swim the ouse and attack hereward an arrow which hereward modicum se inclinans stooping forward says leofricwho probably saw the deedshot at him across the ouse as the earl stood cursing on the top of the dike which arrow flew so stout and strong that though it sprang back from earl warrennes hauberk it knocked him almost senseless off his horse and forced him to defer his purpose of avenging sir frederic his brother  after which hereward threw himself into ely and assumed by consent of all the command of the english who were therein     chapter xxvii  how they held a great meeting in the hall of ely   there sat round the hall of ely all the magnates of the east land and east sea the abbot on his high seat and on a seat higher than his prepared specially sweyn ulfsson king of denmark and england by them sat the bishops egelwin the englishman and christiern the dane osbiorn the young earls edwin and morcar and sweyns two sons and it may be the sons of tosti godwinsson and arkill the great thane and hereward himself below them were knights vikings captains great holders from denmark and the prior and inferior officers of ely minster and at the bottom of the misty hall on the other side of the column of blue vapor which went trembling up from the great heap of burning turf amidst were housecarles monks wild men from the baltic shores crowded together to hear what was done in that parliament of their betters  they spoke like free danes the betters from the upper end of the hall but every man as he chose they were in full thing in parliament as their forefathers had been wont to be for countless ages their house of lords and their house of commons were not yet defined from each other but they knew the rules of the house the courtesies of debate and by practice of free speech had educated themselves to bear and forbear like gentlemen  but the speaking was loud and earnest often angry that day what was to be done was the question before the house  that depended said sweyn the wise and prudent king on what could be done by the english to cooperate with them and what that was has been already told  when tosti godwinsson ye bishops earls knights and holders came to me five years ago and bade me come and take the kingdom of england i answered him that i had not wit enough to do the deeds which canute my uncle did and so sat still in peace i little thought that i should have lost in five years so much of those small wits which i confessed to that i should come after all to take england and find two kings in it already both more to the english mind than me while william the frenchman is king by the sword and edgar the englishman king by proclamation of danish earls and thanes there seems no room here for sweyn ulfsson  we will make room for you we will make a rid road from here to winchester shouted the holders and knights  it is too late what say you hereward leofricsson who go for a wise man among men  hereward rose and spoke gracefully earnestly eloquently but he could not deny sweyns plain words  sir hereward beats about the bush said earl osbiorn rising when hereward sat down none knows better than he that all is over earl edwin and earl morcar who should have helped us along watling street are here fugitives earl gospatrick and earl waltheof are williams men now soon to raise the landsfolk against us we had better go home before we have eaten up the monks of ely  then hereward rose again and without an openly insulting word poured forth his scorn and rage upon osbiorn why had he not kept to the agreement which he and countess gyda had made with him through tostis sons why had he wasted time and men from dover to norwich instead of coming straight into the fens and marching inland to succor morcar and edwin osbiorn had ruined the plan and he only if it was ruined  and who was i to obey hereward asked osbiorn fiercely  and who wert thou to disobey me asked sweyn in a terrible voice hereward is right we shall see what thou sayest to all this in full thing at home in denmark  then edwin rose entreating peace they were beaten the hand of god was against them why should they struggle any more or if they struggled on why should they involve the danes in their own ruin  then holder after holder rose and spoke rough danish common sense they had come hither to win england they had found it won already let them take what they had got from peterborough and go  then winter sprang up take the pay and sail off with it without having done the work that would be a noble tale to carry home to your fair wives in jutland i shall not call you niddering being a man of peace as all know whereat all laughed for the doughty little man had not a hands breadth on head or arm without its scar but if your ladies call you so you must have a shrewd answer to give beside knocking them down  sweyn spoke without rising the good knight forgets that this expedition has cost denmark already nigh as much as harold hardraades cost norway it is hard upon the danes if they are to go away emptyhanded as well as disappointed  the king has right cried hereward let them take the plunder of peterborough as pay for what they have done and what beside they would have done if osbiorn the earlnay men of england let us be justwhat they would have done if there had been heart and wit one mind and one purpose in england the danes have done their best they have shown themselves what they are our blood and kin i know that some talk of treason of bribes let us have no more such vain and foul suspicions they came as our friends and as our friends let them go and leave us to fight out our own quarrel to the last drop of blood  would god said sweyn thou wouldest go too thou good knight here earls and gentlemen of england sweyn ulfsson offers to every one of you who will come to denmark with him shelter and hospitality till better times shall come  then arose a mixed cry some would go some would not some of the danes took the proposal cordially some feared bringing among themselves men who would needs want land of which there was none to give if the english came they must go up the baltic and conquer fresh lands for themselves from heathen letts and finns  then hereward rose again and spoke so nobly and so well that all ears were charmed  they were englishmen and they would rather die in their own merry england than conquer new kingdoms in the cold northeast they were sworn the leaders of them to die or conquer fighting the accursed frenchman they were bound to st peter and to st guthlac and to st felix of ramsey and st etheldreda the holy virgin beneath whose roof they stood to defend against frenchmen the saints of england whom they despised and blasphemed whose servants they cast out thrust into prison and murdered that they might bring in frenchmen from normandy italians from the pope of rome sweyn ulfsson spoke as became him as a prudent and a generous prince the man who alone of all kings defied and fought the great hardraade till neither could fight more the true nephew of canute the king of kings and they thanked him but they would live and die englishmen  and every englishman shouted hereward has right we will live and die fighting the french  and sweyn ulfsson rose again and said with a great oath that if there had been three such men as hereward in england all would have gone well  hereward laughed thou art wrong for once wise king we have failed just because there were a dozen men in england as good as me every man wanting his own way and too many cooks have spoiled the broth what we wanted is not a dozen men like me but one like thee to take us all by the back of the neck and shake us soundly and say do that or die  and so after much talk the meeting broke up and when it broke up there came to hereward in the hall a noblelooking man of his own age and put his hand within his and said  do you not know me hereward leofricsson  i know thee not good knight more pity but by thy dress and carriage thou shouldest be a true vikings son  i am sigtryg ranaldsson now king of waterford and my wife said to me if there be treachery or faintheartedness remember thisthat hereward leofricsson slew the ogre and hannibal of gweek likewise and brought me safe to thee and therefore if thou provest false to him niddering thou art and no niddering is spouse of mine  thou art sigtryg ranaldsson cried hereward clasping him in his arms as the scenes of his wild youth rushed across his mind better is old wine than new and old friends likewise  and i and my five ships are thine to death let who will go back  they must go said hereward halfpeevishly sweyn has right and osbiorn too the game is played out sweep the chessmen off the board as earl ulf did by canute the king  and lost his life thereby i shall stand by and see thee play the last pawn  and lose thy life equally  what matter i heard thee sing     a beddeath a priest death     a straw death a cow death     such death likes not me  nor likes it me either hereward leofricsson  so the danes sailed away but sigtryg ranaldsson and his five ships remained  hereward went to the minster tower and watched the ouse flashing with countless oars northward toward southrey fen and when they were all out of sight he went back and lay down on his bed and weptonce and for all then he arose and went down into the hall to abbots and monks and earls and knights and was the boldest cheeriest wittiest of them all  they say quoth he to torfrida that night that some men have gray heads on green shoulders i have a gray heart in a green body  and my heart is growing very gray too said torfrida  certainly not thy head and he played with her raven locks  that may come too and too soon  for indeed they were in very evil case     chapter xxviii  how they fought at aldreth   when william heard that the danes were gone he marched on ely as on an easy prey  ivo taillebois came with him hungry after those spalding lands the rents whereof hereward had been taking for his men for now twelve months william de warrenne was there vowed to revenge the death of sir frederic his brother ralph guader was there flushed with his success at norwich and with them all the frenchmen of the east who had been either expelled from their lands or were in fear of expulsion  with them too was a great army of mercenaries ruffians from all france and flanders hired to fight for a certain term on the chance of plunder or of fiefs in land their brains were all aflame with the tales of inestimable riches hidden in ely there were there the jewels of all the monasteries round there were the treasures of all the fugitive english nobles there were therewhat was there not and they grumbled when william halted them and hutted them at cambridge and began to feel cautiously the strength of the placewhich must be strong or hereward and the english would not have made it their camp of refuge  perhaps he rode up to madingley windmill and saw fifteen miles away clear against the sky the long line of what seemed naught but a low upland park with the minster tower among the trees and between him and them a rich champaign of grass over which it was easy enough to march all the armies of europe and thought ely an easy place to take but men told him that between him and those trees lay a black abyss of mud and peat and reeds haddenham fen and smithy fen with the deep sullen west water or aldreche of the ouse winding through them the old roman road was sunk and gone long since under the bog whether by english neglect or whether as some think by actual and bodily sinking of the whole land the narrowest space between dry land and dry land was a full halfmile and how to cross that halfmile no man knew  what were the approaches on the west there were none beyond earith where now run the great washes of the bedford level was a howling wilderness of meres seas reedronds and floating alderbeds through which only the fenmen wandered with leapingpole and log canoe  what in the east the dry land neared the island on that side and it may be that william rowed round by burwell to fordham and soham and thought of attempting the island by way of barraway and saw beneath him a labyrinth of islands meres fens with the ouse now increased by the volume of the cam lying deep and broad between barraway and thetfordintheisle and saw too that a disaster in that labyrinth might be a destruction  so he determined on the near and straight path through long stratton and willingham down the old bridleway from willingham ploughed fieldevery village there and in the isle likewise had and has still its field or ancient clearing of ploughed landand then to try that terrible halfmile with the courage and wit of a general to whom human lives were as those of the gnats under the hedge  so all his host camped themselves in willingham field by the old earthwork which men now call belsars hills and down the bridleway poured countless men bearing timber and fagots cut from all the hills that they might bridge the black halfmile  they made a narrow firm path through the reeds and down to the brink of the ouse if brink it could be called where the water rising and falling a foot or two each tide covered the floating peat for many yards before it sunk into a brown depth of bottomless slime they would make a bottom for themselves by driving piles  the piles would not hold and they began to make a floating bridge with long beams says leofric and blownup cattlehides to float them  soon they made a floating sow and thrust it on before them as they worked across the stream for they were getting under shot from the island  meanwhile the besieged had not been idle they had thrown up says leofric a turf rampart on the island shore and antemuralia et propugnaculadoubtless overhanging hoardings or scaffolds through the floor of which they could shower down missiles and so they awaited the attack contenting themselves with gliding in and out of the reeds in their canoes and annoying the builders with arrows and crossbow bolts  at last the bridge was finished and the sow safe across the west water and thrust in as far as it would float among the reeds on the high tide they in the fort could touch it with a pole  the english would have destroyed it if they could but hereward bade them leave it alone he had watched all their work and made up his mind to the event  the rats have set a trap for themselves he said to his men and we shall be fools to break it up till the rats are safe inside  so there the huge sow lay black and silent showing nothing to the enemy but a side of strong plank covered with hide to prevent its being burned it lay there for three hours and hereward let it lie  he had never been so cheerful so confident play the man this day every one of you and ere nightfall you will have taught the norman once more the lesson of york he seems to have forgotten that it is me to remind him of it  and he looked to his bow and to his arrows and prepared to play the man himselfas was the fashion in those old days when a general proved his worth by hitting harder and more surely than any of his men  at last the army was in motion and willingham field opposite was like a crawling ants nest brigade after brigade moved down to the reed beds and the assault began  and now advanced along the causeway and along the bridge a dark column of men surmounted by glittering steel knights in complete mail footmen in leather coats and quilted jerkins at first orderly enough each under the banner of his lord but more and more mingled and crowded as they hurried forward each eager for his selfish share of the inestimable treasures of ely they pushed along the bridge the mass became more and more crowded men stumbled over each other and fell off into the mire and the water calling vainly for help while their comrades hurried on unheeding in the mad thirst for spoil  on they came in thousands and fresh thousands streamed out of the fields as if the whole army intended to pour itself into the isle at once  they are numberless said torfrida in a serious and astonished voice as she stood by herewards side  would they were said hereward let them come on thick and threefold the more their numbers the fatter will the fish below be before tomorrow morning look there already  and already the bridge was swaying and sinking beneath their weight the men in places were ankle deep in water they rushed on all the more eagerly and filled the sow and swarmed up to its roof  then what with its own weight what with the weight of the laden bridgewhich dragged upon it from behindthe huge sow began to tilt backwards and slide down the slimy bank  the men on the top tried vainly to keep their footing to hurl grapnels into the rampart to shoot off their quarrels and arrows  you must be quick frenchmen shouted hereward in derision if you mean to come on board here  the normans knew that well and as hereward spoke two panels in the front of the sow creaked on their hinges and dropped landward forming two drawbridges over which reeled to the attack a close body of knights mingled with soldiers bearing scaling ladders  they recoiled between the ends of the drawbridges and the foot of the rampart was some two fathoms depth of black ooze the catastrophe which hereward had foreseen was come and a shout of derision arose from the unseen defenders above  come onleap it like men send back for your horses knights and ride them at it like bold huntsmen  the front rank could not but rush on for the pressure behind forced them forward whether they would or not in a moment they were wallowing waist deep trampled on and disappearing under their struggling comrades who disappeared in their turn  look torfrida if they plant their scaling ladders it will be on a foundation of their comrades corpses  torfrida gave one glance through the openings of the hoarding upon the writhing mass below and turned away in horror the men were not so merciful down between the hoardingbeams rained stones javelins arrows increasing the agony and death the scaling ladders would not stand in the mire if they had stood a moment the struggles of the dying would have thrown them down and still fresh victims pressed on from behind shouting dex aie on to the gold of ely and still the sow under the weight slipped further and further back into the stream and the foul gulf widened between besiegers and besieged  at last one scaling ladder was planted upon the bodies of the dead and hooked firmly on the gunwale of the hoarding ere it could be hurled off again by the english it was so crowded with men that even herewards strength was insufficient to lift it off he stood at the top ready to hew down the first comer and he hewed him down  but the normans were not to be daunted man after man dropped dead from the ladder topman after man took his place sometimes two at a time sometimes scrambling over each others backs  the english even in the insolence of victory cheered them with honest admiration you are fellows worth fighting you french  so we are shouted a knight the first and last who crossed that parapet for thrusting hereward back with a blow of his swordhilt he staggered past him over the hoarding and fell on his knees  a dozen men were upon him but he was up again and shouting  to me menatarms a dade a dade but no man answered  yield quoth hereward  sir dade answered by a blow on herewards helmet which felled the chief to his knees and broke the sword into twenty splinters  well hit said hereward as he rose dont touch him men this is my quarrel now yield sir you have done enough for your honor it is madness to throw away your life  the knight looked round on the fierce ring of faces in the midst of which he stood alone  to none but hereward  hereward am i  ah said the knight had i but hit a little harder  you would have broke your sword into more splinters my armor is enchanted so yield like a reasonable and valiant man  what care i said the knight stepping on to the earthwork and sitting down quietly i vowed to st mary and king william that into ely i would get this day and in ely i am so i have done my work  and now you shall tasteas such a gallant knight deservesthe hospitality of ely  it was torfrida who spoke  my husbands prisoners are mine and i when i find them such prudhommes as you are have no lighter chains for them than that which a ladys bower can afford  sir dade was going to make an equally courteous answer when over and above the shouts and curses of the combatants rose a yell so keen so dreadful as made all hurry forward to the rampart  that which hereward had foreseen was come at last the bridge strained more and more by its living burden and by the falling tide had partednot at the ely end where the sliding of the sow took off the pressurebut at the end nearest the camp one sideway roll it gave and then turning over engulfed in that foul stream the flower of norman chivalry leaving a linea full quarter of a mile in lengthof wretches drowning in the dark water or more hideous still in the bottomless slime of peat and mud  thousands are said to have perished their armor and weapons were found at times by delvers and dikers for centuries after are found at times unto this day beneath the rich drained cornfields which now fill up that black halfmile or in the bed of the narrow brook to which the westwater robbed of its streams by the bedford level has dwindled down at last  william they say struck his tents and departed forthwith groaning from deep grief of heart and so ended the first battle of aldreth     chapter xxix  how sir dade brought news from ely   a month after the fight there came into the camp at cambridge riding on a good horse himself fat and wellliking none other than sir dade  boisterously he was received as one alive from the dead and questioned as to his adventures and sufferings  adventures i have had and strange ones but for sufferings instead of fettergalls i bring back as you see a new suit of clothes instead of an empty and starved stomach a surfeit from good victuals and good liquor and whereas i went into ely on foot i came out on a fast hackney  so into williams tent he went and there he told his tale  so dade my friend quoth the duke in high good humor for he loved dade you seem to have been in good company  never in better sire save in your presence of the earls and knights in ely all i can say is gods pity that they are rebels for more gallant and courteous knights or more perfect warriors never saw i neither in normandy nor at constantinople among the varangers themselves  eh and what are the names of these gallants for you have used your eyes and ears of course  edwin and morcar the earlstwo fine young lads  i know it go on and a shade passed over williams brow as he thought of his own falsehood and his fair constance weeping in vain for the fair bridegroom whom he had promised to her  siward barn as they call him the boy orgar and thurkill barn those are the knights egelwin bishop of durham is there too and besides them all and above them all hereward the like of that knight i may have seen his better saw i never  sir fool said earl warrenne who had not yetsmall blame to himforgotten his brothers death they have soused thy brains with their muddy ale till thou knowest not friend from foe what hast thou to come hither praising up to the kings majesty such an outlawed villain as that with whom no honest knight would keep company  if you earl warrenne ever found dade drunk or lying it is more than the king here has done  let him speak earl said william i have not an honester man in my camp and he speaks for my information not for yours  then for yours will i speak sir king these men treated me knightly and sent me away without ransom  they had an eye to their own profit it seems grumbled the earl  but force me they did to swear on the holy gospels that i should tell your majesty the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and i keep my oath quoth dade  go on then without fear or favor are there any other men of note in the island  no  are they in want of provisions  look how they have fattened me  what do they complain of  i will tell you sir king the monks like many more took fright at the coming over of our french men of god to set right all their filthy barbarous ways and that is why they threw ely open to the rebels  i will be even with the sots quoth william  however they think that danger blown over just now for they have a story among them which as my lord the king never heard before he may as well hear now  eh  how your majesty should have sent across the sea a whole shipload of french monks  that have i and will more till i reduce these swine into something like obedience to his holiness of rome  ah but your majesty has not heard how one bruman a valiant english knight was sailing on the sea and caught those monks whereon he tied a great sack to the ships head and cut the bottom out and made every one of those monks get into that sack and so fall through into the sea whereby he rid the monks of ely of their rivals  pish why tell me such an oldwives fable knight  because the monks believe that oldwives fable and are stouthearted and stiffnecked accordingly  the blood of martyrs is the seed of the church said williams chaplain a pupil and friend of lanfranc and if these men of belial drowned every man of god in normandy ten would spring up in their places to convert this benighted and besotted land of simonites and balaamites whose priests like the brutes which perish scruple not to defile themselves and the service of the altar with things which they impudently call their wives  we know that good chaplain quoth william impatiently he had enough of that language from lanfranc himself and moreover was thinking more of the isle of ely than of the celibacy of the clergy  well sir dade  so they have got together all their kin for among these monks every one is kin to a thane or knight or even an earl and there they are brother by brother cousin by cousin knee to knee and back to back like a pack of wolves and that in a hold which you will not enter yet awhile  does my friend dade doubt his dukes skill at last  sir dukesir king i mean now for king you are and deserve to bei know what you can do i remember how we took england at one blow on senlac field but see you here sir king  how will you take an island where four kings such as you if the world would hold four such at once could not stop one churl from ploughing the land or one birdcatcher from setting limetwigs  and what if i cannot stop the birdcatchers do they expect to lime frenchmen as easily as sparrows  sparrows it is not sparrows that i have been fattening on this last month i tell you sire i have seen wildfowl alone in that island enough to feed them all the year round i was there in the moultingtime and saw them takeone day one hundred one two hundred and once as i am a belted knight a thousand duck out of one single mere there is a wood there with herons sprawling about the treetopsi did not think there were so many in the worldand fish for lent and fridays in every puddle and leat pike and perch tench and eels on every oldwifes table while the knights think scorn of anything worse than smelts and burbot  splendeur dex quoth william who normanlike did not dislike a good dinner i must keep lent in ely before i die  then you had best make peace with the burboteating knights my lord  but have they fleshmeat  the isle is half of it a gardenricher land they say is none in these realms and i believe it but besides that there is a deerpark there with a thousand head in it red and fallow and plenty of swine in woods and sheep and cattle and if they fail there are plenty more to be got they know where  they know where do you sir knight asked william keenly  out of every little island in their fens for forty miles on end there are the herds fattening themselves on the richest pastures in the land and no man needing to herd them for they are all safe among dikes and meres  i will make my boats sweep their fens clear of every head  take care my lord king lest never a boat come back from that errand with their narrow flatbottomed punts cut out of a single log and their leapingpoles wherewith they fly over dikes of thirty feet in widththey can ambuscade in those reedbeds and alderbeds kill whom they will and then flee away through the marsh like so many horseflies and if not one trick have they left which they never try save when driven into a corner but from that may all saints save us  what then  firing the reeds  and destroying their own cover  true therefore they will only do it in despair  then to despair will i drive them and try their worst so these monks are as stout rebels as the earls  i only say what i saw at the halltable there dined each day maybe some fifty belted knights with every one a monk next to him and at the high table the abbot and the three earls and hereward and his lady and thurkill barn and behind each knight and each monk likewise hung against the wall lance and shield helmet and hauberk sword and axe  to monk as well as knight  as i am a knight myself and were as well used too for aught i saw the monks took turns with the knights as sentries and as foragers too and the knights themselves told me openly the monks were as good men as they  as wicked you mean groaned the chaplain o accursed and bloodthirsty race why does not the earth open and swallow you with korah dathan and abiram  they would not mind quoth dade they are born and bred in the bottomless pit already they would jump over or flounder out as they do to their own bogs every day  you speak irreverently my friend quoth william  ask those who are in camp and not me as for whither they went or how the english were not likely to tell me all i know is that i saw fresh cattle come every few days and fresh farms burnt too on the norfolk side there were farms burning last night only between here and cambridge ask your sentinels on the rechdike how that came about  i can answer that quoth a voice from the other end of the tent i was on the rechdike last night close down to the fenworse luck and shame for me  answer then quoth william with one of his horrible oaths glad to have some one on whom he could turn his rage and disappointment  there came seven men in a boat up from ely yestereven and five of them were monks they came up from burwell fen and plundered and burnt burwell town  and where were all you mighty men of war  ten of us ran down to stop them with richard earl osberns nephew at their head the villains got to the top of the rechdike and made a stand and before we could get to them  thy men had run of course  they were every one dead or wounded save richard and he was fighting singlehanded with an englishman while the other six stood around and looked on  then they fought fairly said william  as fairly to do them justice as if they had been frenchmen and not english churls as we came down along the dike a little man of them steps between the two and strikes down their swords as if they had been two reeds come cries he enough of this you are two prudhommes well matched and you can fight out this any other day and away he and his men go down the dikeend to the water  leaving richard safe  wounded a littlebut safe enough  and then  we followed them to the boat as hard as we could killed one with a javelin and caught another  knightly done and william swore an awful oath and worthy of valiant frenchmen these english set you the example of chivalry by letting your comrade fight his own battle fairly instead of setting on him all together and you repay them by hunting them down with darts because you dare not go within swordsstroke of better men than yourselves go i am ashamed of you no stay where is your prisoner for splendeur dex i will send him back safe and sound in return for dade to tell the knights of ely that if they know so well the courtesies of war william of rouen does too  the prisoner sire quoth the knight trembling isis  you have not murdered him  heaven forbid but  he broke his bonds and escaped  gnawed them through sire as we suppose and escaped through the mire in the dark after the fashion of these accursed frogs of girvians  but did he tell you naught ere he bade you good morning  he told as the names of all the seven he that beat down the swords was hereward himself  i thought as much when shall i have that fellow at my side  he that fought richard was one wenoch  i have heard of him  he that we slew was siward a monk  more shame to you  he that we took was azer the hardy a monk of nicolelicolethe normans could never say lincoln  and the rest were thurstan the younger leofric the deacon herewards minstrel and boter the traitor monk of st edmunds  and if i catch them quoth william i will make an abbot of every one of them  sire quoth the chaplain in a deprecating tone     chapter xxx  how hereward played the potter and how he cheated the king   they of ely were now much straitened being shut in both by land and water and what was to be done either by themselves or by the king they knew not would william simply starve them or at least inflict on them so perpetual a lentfor of fish there could be no lack even if they ate or drove away all the fowlas would tame down their proud spirits which a diet of fish and vegetables from some ludicrous theory of monastic physicians was supposed to do footnote the cornishthe stoutest tallest and most prolific race of the southlive on hardly anything else but fish and vegetables or was he gathering vast armies from they knew not whence to try once and for all another assault on the islandit might be from several points at once  they must send out a spy and find out news from the outer world if news were to be gotten but who would go  so asked the bishop and the abbot and the earls in council in the abbots lodging  torfrida was among them she was always among them now she was their alrunawife their vala their wise woman whose counsels all received as more than human  i will go said she rising up like a goddess on olympus i will cut off my hair and put on boys clothes and smirch myself brown with walnut leaves and i will go i can talk their french tongue i know their french ways and as for a story to cover my journey and my doings trust a womans wit to invent that  they looked at her with delight in her courage but with doubt  if williams french grooms got hold of you torfrida it would not be a little walnut brown which would hide you said hereward it is like you to offerworthy of you who have no peer  that she has not quoth churchmen and soldiers alike  butto send you would be to send herewards wrong half the right half of hereward is going and that is himself  uncle uncle said the young earls send winter geri leofwin prat any of your fellows but not yourself if we lose you we lose our head and our king  and all prayed hereward to let any man go rather than himself  i am going lords and knights and what hereward says he does it is one day to brandon it may be two days back for if i miscarryas i most likely shalli must come home round about on the fourth day you shall hear of me or from me come with me torfrida  and he strode out  he cropped his golden locks he cropped his golden beard and torfrida cried as she cropped them half with fear for him half for sorrow over his shorn glories  i am no samson my lady my strength lieth not in my locks now for some rascals clothesas little dirty as you can get me for fear of company  and hereward put on filthy garments and taking mare swallow with him got into a barge and went across the river to soham  he could not go down the great ouse and up the little ouse which was his easiest way for the french held all the river below the isle and beside to have come straight from ely might cause suspicion so he went down to fordham and crossed the lark at mildenhall and just before he got to mildenhall he met a potter carrying pots upon a pony  halt my stout fellow quoth he and put thy pots on my mares back  the man who wants them must fight for them quoth that stout churl raising a heavy staff  then here is he that will quoth hereward and jumping off his mare he twisted the staff out of the potters hands and knocked him down therewith  that will teach thee to know an englishman when thou seest him  i have met my master quoth the churl rubbing his head but dog does not eat dog and it is hard to be robbed by an englishman after being robbed a dozen times by the french  i will not rob thee there is a silver penny for thy pots and thy coatfor that i must have likewise and if thou tellest to mortal man aught about this i will find those who will cut thee to ribbons and if not then turn thy horses head and ride back to ely if thou canst cross the water and say what has befallen thee and thou wilt find there an abbot who will give thee another penny for thy news  so hereward took the pots and the potters claygreased coat and went on through mildenhall crying saith the chronicler after the manner of potters in the english tongue pots pots good pots and pans  but when he got through mildenhall and well into the rabbitwarrens he gave mare swallow a kick and went over the heath so fast northward that his pots danced such a dance as broke half of them before he got to brandon  never mind quoth he they will think that i have sold them and when he neared brandon he pulled up sorted his pots kept the whole ones threw the sherds at the rabbits and walked on into brandon solemnly leading the mare and crying pots  so semper marcida et deformis aspectulean and illlookingwas that famous mare says the chronicler that no one would suspect her splendid powers or take her for anything but a potters nag when she was caparisoned in proper character hereward felt thoroughly at home in his part as able to play the englishman which he was by rearing as the frenchman which he was by education he was full of heart and happy he enjoyed the keen fresh air of the warrens he enjoyed the ramble out of the isle in which he had been cooped up so long he enjoyed the fun of the thingdisguise stratagem adventure danger and so did the english who adored him none of herewards deeds is told so carefully and lovingly and none doubt it not was so often sung in after years by farmhouse hearths or in the outlaws lodge as this robin hood himself may have trolled out many a time in doggrel strain how hereward played the potter  and he came to brandon to the kings courtprobably weeting hall or castle from which william could command the streams of wissey and little ouse with all their fensand cast about for a nights lodging for it was dark  outside the town was a wretched cabin of mud and turfsuch a one as irish folk live in to this day and hereward said to himself this is bad enough to be good enough for me  so he knocked at the door and knocked till it was opened and a hideous old crone put out her head  who wants to see me at this time of night  any one would who had heard how beautiful you are do you want any pots  pots what have i to do with pots thou saucy fellow i thought it was some one wanting a charm and she shut the door  a charm thought hereward maybe she can tell me news if she be a witch they are shrewd souls these witches and know more than they tell but if i can get any news i care not if satan brings it in person  so he knocked again till the old woman looked out once more and bade him angrily be off  but i am belated here good dame and afraid of the french and i will give thee the best bit of clay on my mares backpotpanpansion crockjug or what thou wilt for a nights lodging  have you any little jarsjars no longer than my hand asked she for she used them in her trade and had broken one of late but to pay for one she had neither money nor mind so she agreed to let hereward sleep there for the value of two jars but what of that ugly brute of a horse of thine  she will do well enough in the turfshed  then thou must pay with a pannikin  ugh groaned hereward thou drivest a hard bargain for an englishwoman with a poor englishman  how knowest thou that i am english  so much the better if thou art not thought hereward and bargained with her for a pannikin against a lodging for the horse in the turfhouse and a bottle of bad hay  then he went in bringing his panniers with him with ostentatious care  thou canst sleep there on the rushes i have naught to give thee to eat  naught needs naught said hereward threw himself down on a bundle of rush and in a few minutes snored loudly  but he was never less asleep he looked round the whole cabin and he listened to every word  the devil as usual was a bad paymaster for the witchs cabin seemed only somewhat more miserable than that of other old women the floor was mud the rafters unceiled the stars shone through the turf roof the only hint of her trade was a hanging shelf on which stood five or six little earthen jars and a few packets of leaves a parchment scrawled with characters which the owner herself probably did not understand hung against the cob wall and a human skullprobably used only to frighten her patientsdangled from the rooftree  but in a corner stuck against the wall was something which chilled herewards blood a little a dried human hand which he knew must have been stolen off the gallows gripping in its fleshless fingers a candle which he knew was made of human fat that candle he knew duly lighted and carried would enable the witch to walk unseen into any house on earth yea through the court of king william himself while it drowned all men in preternatural slumber  hereward was very much frightened he believed as devoutly in the powers of a witch as did thenand does now for aught italian literature e permissu superiorum showsthe pope of rome  so he trembled on his rushes and wished himself safe through that adventure without being turned into a hare or a wolf  i would sooner be a wolf than a hare of course killing being more in my trade than being killed butwho comes here  and to the first old crone who sat winking her bleared eyes and warming her bleared hands over a little heap of peat in the middle of the cabin entered another crone if possible uglier  two of them if i am not roasted and eaten this night i am a lucky man  and hereward crossed himself devoutly and invoked st ethelfrida of ely st guthlac of crowland st felix of ramseyto whom he recollected he had been somewhat remiss but above all st peter of peterborough whose treasures he had given to the danes and he argued stoutly with st peter and with his own conscience that the means sanctify the end and that he had done it all for the best  if thou wilt help me out of this strait and the rest blessed apostle i will give theei will go to constantinople but what i will win ita golden table twice as fine as those villains carried off and one of the bourne manorswithamor toftor mainthorpewhichever pleases thee best in full fee and aand a  but while hereward was casting in his mind what gewgaw further might suffice to appease the apostle he was recalled to business and commonsense by hearing the two old hags talk to each other in french  his heart leapt for joy and he forgot st peter utterly  well how have you sped have you seen the king  no but ivo taillebois eh who the foul fiend have you lying there  only an english brute he cannot understand us talk on only dont wake the hog have you got the gold  never mind  then there was a grumbling and a quarrelling from which hereward understood that the gold was to be shared between them  but it is a bit of chain to cut it will spoil it  the other insisted and he heard them chop the gold chain in two  and is this all  i had work enough to get that he said no play no pay and he would give it me after the isle was taken but i told him my spirit was a jewish spirit that used to serve solomon the wise and he would not serve me much less come over the sea from normandy unless he smelt gold for he loved it like any jew  and what did you tell him then  that the king must go back to aldreth again for only from thence he would take the isle forand that was true enoughi dreamt i saw all the water of aldreth full of wolves clambering over into the island on each others backs  that means that some of them will be drowned  let them drown i left him to find out that part of the dream for himself then i told him how he must make another causeway bigger and stronger than the last and a tower on which i could stand and curse the english and i promised him to bring a storm right in the faces of the english so that they could neither fight nor see  but if the storm does not come  it will come i know the signs of the skywho betterand the weather will break up in a week therefore i told him he must begin his works at once before the rain came on and that we would go and ask the spirit of the well to tell us the fortunate day for attacking  that is my business said the other and my spirit likes the smell of gold as well as yours little you would have got from me if you had not given me half the chain  then the two rose  let us see whether the english hog is asleep  one of them came and listened to herewards breathing and put her hand upon his chest his hair stood on end a cold sweat came over him but he snored more loudly than ever  the two old crones went out satisfied then hereward rose and glided after them  they went down a meadow to a little well which hereward had marked as he rode thither hung round with bits of rag and flowers as similar holy wells are decorated in ireland to this day  he hid behind a hedge and watched them stooping over the well mumbling he knew not what of cantrips  then there was silence and a tinkling sound as of water  oncetwicethrice counted the witches nine times he counted the tinkling sound  the ninth daythe ninth day and the king shall take ely said one in a cracked scream rising and shaking her fist toward the isle  hereward was more than halfminded to have put his daggerthe only weapon which he hadinto the two old beldames on the spot but the fear of an outcry kept him still he had found out already so much that he was determined to find out more so tomorrow he would go up to the court itself and take what luck sent  he slipt back to the cabin and lay down again and as soon as he had seen the two old crones safe asleep fell asleep himself and was so tired that he lay till the sun was high  get up screamed the old dame at last kicking him or i shall make you give me another crock for a double nights rest  he paid his lodging put the panniers on the mare and went on crying pots  when he came to the outer gateway of the court he tied up the mare and carried the crockery in on his own back boldly the scullions saw him and called him into the kitchen to see his crockery without the least intention of paying for what they took  a man of rank belonging to the court came in and stared fixedly at hereward  you are mightily like that villain hereward man quoth he  anon asked hereward looking as stupid as he could  if it were not for his brown face and short hair he is as like the fellow as a churl can be to a knight  bring him into the hall quoth another and let us see if any man knows him  into the great hall he was brought and stared at by knights and squires he bent his knees rounded his shoulders and made himself look as mean as he could  ivo taillebois and earl warrenne came down and had a look at him  hereward said ivo i will warrant that little slouching cur is not he hereward must be half as big again if it be true that he can kill a man with one blow of his fist  you may try the truth of that for yourself some day thought hereward  does any one here talk english let us question the fellow said earl warrenne  hereward hereward who wants to know about that villain answered the potter as soon as he was asked in english would to heaven he were here and i could see some of you noble knights and earls paying him for me for i owe him more than ever i shall pay myself  what does he mean  he came out of the isle ten days ago nigh on to evening and drove off a cow of mine and four sheep which was all my living noble knights save these pots  and where is he since  in the isle my lords wellnigh starved and his folk falling away from him daily from hunger and aguefits i doubt if there be a hundred sound men left in ely  have you been in thither then villain  heaven forbid i in ely i in the wolfs den if i went in with naught but my skin they would have it off me before i got out again if your lordships would but come down and make an end of him once for all for he is a great tyrant and terrible and devours us poor folk like so many mites in cheese  take this babbler into the kitchen and feed him quoth earl warrenne and so the colloquy ended  into the kitchen again the potter went the kings luncheon was preparing and he listened to their chatter and picked up this at least which was valuable to himthat the witches story was true that a great attack would be made from aldreth that boats had been ordered up the river to cotinglade and pioneers and entrenching tools were to be sent on that day to the site of the old causeway  but soon he had to take care of himself earl warrennes commands to feed him were construed by the cookboys and scullions into a command to make him drunk likewise to make a laughingstock of an englishman was too tempting a jest to be resisted and hereward was drenched says the chronicler with wine and beer and sorely baited and badgered at last one rascal hit upon a notable plan  pluck out the english hogs hair and beard and put him blindfold in the midst of his pots and see what a smash we shall have  hereward pretended not to understand the words which were spoken in french but when they were interpreted to him he grew somewhat red about the ears  submit he would not but if he defended himself and made an uproar in the kings court he might very likely find himself riding odins horse before the hour was out however happily for him the wine and beer had made him stout of heart and when one fellow laid hold of his beard he resisted sturdily  the man struck him and that hard hereward hot of temper and careless of life struck him again right under the ear  the fellow dropped for dead  up leapt cookboys scullions lécheurs who hung about the kitchen to lécher lick the platters and all the foulmouthed rascality of a great mediaeval household and attacked hereward cum fureis et tridentibus with forks and fleshhooks  then was hereward aware of a great broach or spit before the fire and recollecting how he had used such a one as a boy against the monks of peterborough was minded to use it against the cooks of brandon which he did so heartily that in a few moments he had killed one and driven the others backward in a heap  but his case was hopeless he was soon overpowered by numbers from outside and dragged into the hall to receive judgment for the mortal crime of slaying a man within the precincts of the court  he kept up heart he knew that the king was there he knew that he should most likely get justice from the king if not he could but discover himself and so save his life for that the king would kill him knowingly he did not believe  so he went in boldly and willingly and up the hall where on the dais stood william the norman  william had finished his luncheon and was standing at the board side a page held water in a silver basin in which he was washing his hands two more knelt and laced his long boots for he was as always going ahunting  then hereward looked at the face of the great man and felt at once that it was the face of the greatest man whom he had ever met  i am not that mans match said he to himself perhaps it will all end in being his man and he my master  silence knaves said william and speak one of you at a time how came this  a likely story forsooth said he when he had heard a poor english potter comes into my court and murders my men under my very eyes for mere sport i do not believe you rascals you churl and he spoke through an english interpreter tell me your tale and justice you shall have or take as you deserve i am the king of england man and i know your tongue though i speak it not yet more pity  hereward fell on his knees  if you are indeed my lord the king then i am safe for there is justice in you at least so all men say and he told his tale manfully  splendeur dex but this is a far likelier story and i believe it hark you you ruffians here am i trying to conciliate these english by justice and mercy whenever they will let me and here are you outraging them and driving them mad and desperate just that you may get a handle against them and thus rob the poor wretches and drive them into the forest from the lowest to the highestfrom ivo taillebois there down to you cookboysyou are all at the same game and i will stop it the next time i hear of outrage to unarmed man or harmless woman i will hang that culprit were he odo my brother himself  this excellent speech was enforced with oaths so strange and terrible that ivo taillebois shook in his boots and the chaplain prayed fervently that the roof might not fall in on their heads  thou smilest man said william quickly to the kneeling hereward so thou understandest french  a few words only most gracious king which we potters pick up wandering everywhere with our wares said hereward speaking in french for so keen was williams eye that he thought it safer to play no tricks with him  nevertheless he made his french so execrable that the very scullions grinned in spite of their fear  look you said william you are no common churl you have fought too well for that let me see your arm  hereward drew up his sleeve  potters do not carry swordscars like those neither are they tattooed like english thanes hold up thy head man and let us see thy throat  hereward who had carefully hung down his head to prevent his throatpatterns being seen was forced to lift it up  aha so i expected more fair ladies work there is not this he who was said to be so like hereward very good put him in ward till i come back from hunting but do him no harm forand william fixed on hereward eyes of the most intense intelligencewere he hereward himself i should be right glad to see hereward safe and sound my man at last and earl of all between humber and the fens  but hereward did not rise at the bait with a face of stupid and ludicrous terror he made reply in broken french  have mercy mercy lord king make not that fiend earl over us even ivo taillebois there would be better than he send him to be earl over the imps in hell or over the wild welsh who are worse still but not over us good lord king whom he hath polled and peeled till we are  silence said william laughing as did all round him thou art a cunning rogue enough whoever thou art go into limbo and behave thyself till i come back  all saints send your grace good sport and thereby me a good deliverance quoth hereward who knew that his fate might depend on the temper in which william returned so he was thrust into an outhouse and there locked up  he sat on an empty barrel meditating on the chances of his submitting to the king after all when the door opened and in strode one with a drawn sword in one hand and a pair of legshackles in the other  hold out thy shins fellow thou art not going to sit at thine ease there like an abbot after killing one of us grooms and bringing the rest of us into disgrace hold out thy legs i say  nothing easier quoth hereward cheerfully and held out a leg but when the man stooped to put on the fetters he received a kick which sent him staggering  after which he recollected very little at least in this world for hereward cut off his head with his own sword  after which says the chronicler he broke away out of the house and over garden walls and palings hiding and running till he got to the front gate and leaped upon mare swallow  and none saw him save one unlucky groomboy who stood yelling and cursing in front of the mares head and went to seize the bridle  whereon between the imminent danger and the bad language herewards blood rose and he smote that unlucky groomboy but whether he slew him or not the chronicler had rather not say  then he shook up mare swallow  and rode for his life with knights and squires for the hue and cry was raised galloping at her heels  who then were astonished but those knights as they saw the ugly potters garron gaining on them length after length till she and her rider had left them far behind  who then was proud but hereward as the mare tucked her great thighs under her and swept on over heath and rabbit burrow over rush and fen sound ground and rotten all alike to that enormous stride to that keen bright eye which foresaw every footfall to that raking shoulder which picked her up again at every stagger  hereward laid the bridle on her neck and let her go fall she could not and tire she could not and he half wished she might go on forever where could a man be better than on a good horse with all the cares of this life blown away out of his brains by the keen air which rushed around his temples and he galloped on as cheery as a boy shouting at the rabbits as they scuttled from under his feet and laughing at the dottrel as they postured and anticked on the molehills  but think he must at last of how to get home for to go through mildenhall again would not be safe and he turned over the moors to icklingham and where he went after no man can tell  certainly not the chronicler for he tells how hereward got back by the isle of somersham which is all but impossible for somersham is in huntingdonshire many a mile on the opposite side of ely isle  and of all those knights that followed him none ever saw or heard sign of him save one and his horse came to a standstill in the aforesaid wood which the chronicler says was somersham and he rolled off his horse and lay breathless under a tree looking up at his horses heaving flanks and wagging tail and wondering how he should get out of that place before the english found him and made an end of him  then there came up to him a ragged churl and asked him who he was and offered to help him  for the sake of god and courtesy quoth hehis norman pride being wellnigh beat out of himif thou hast seen or heard anything of hereward good fellow tell me and i will repay thee well  as thou hast asked me for the sake of god and of courtesy sir knight i will tell thee i am hereward and in token thereof thou shalt give me up thy lance and sword and take instead this sword which i carried off from the kings court and promise me on the faith of a knight to bear it back to king william and tell him that hereward and he have met at last and that he had best beware of the day when they shall meet again  so that knight not having recovered his wind was fain to submit and go home a sadder and a wiser man and king william laughed a royal laugh and commanded his knights that they should in no wise harm hereward but take him alive and bring him in and they should have great rewards  which seemed to them more easily said than done     chapter xxxi  how they fought again at aldreth   hereward came back in fear and trembling after all he believed in the magic powers of the witch of brandon and he asked torfrida in his simplicity whether she was not cunning enough to defeat her spells by counter spells  torfrida smiled and shook her head  my knight i have long since given up such vanities let us not fight evil with evil but rather with good better are prayers than charms for the former are heard in heaven above and the latter only in the pit below let me and all the women of ely go rather in procession to st etheldredas well there above the fort at aldreth and pray st etheldreda to be with us when the day shall come and defend her own isle and the honor of us women who have taken refuge in her holy arms  so all the women of ely walked out barefoot to st etheldredas well with torfrida at their head clothed in sackcloth and with fetters on her wrists and waist and ankles which she vowed after the strange sudden earnest fashion of those times never to take off again till she saw the french host flee from aldreth before the face of st etheldreda so they prayed while hereward and his men worked at the forts below and when they came back and torfrida was washing her feet sore and bleeding from her pilgrimage hereward came in  you have murdered your poor soft feet and taken nothing thereby i fear  i have if i had walked on sharp razors all the way i would have done it gladly to know what i know now as i prayed i looked out over the fen and st etheldreda put a thought into my heart but it is so terrible a one that i fear to tell it to you and yet it seems our only chance  hereward threw himself at her feet and prayed her to tell at last she spoke as one half afraid of her own words  will the reeds burn hereward  hereward kissed her feet again and again calling her his prophetess his savior  burn yes like tinder in this march wind if the drought only holds pray that the drought may hold torfrida  there there say no more how hardhearted war makes even us women there help me to take off this rough sackcloth and dress myself again  meanwhile william had moved his army again to cambridge and on to willingham field and there he began to throw up those globos and montanas of which leofrics paraphraser talks but of which now no trace remains then he began to rebuild his causeway broader and stronger and commanded all the fishermen of the ouse to bring their boats to cotinglade and ferry over his materials among whom came hereward in his boat with head and beard shaven lest he should be known and worked diligently among the rest but the sun did not set that day without mischief for before hereward went off he finished his work by setting the whole on fire so that it was all burnt and some of the french killed and drowned  and so he went on with stratagems and ambushes till after seven days continual fighting they had hardly done one days work save four globos of wood in which they intended to put their artillery but on the eighth day they determined to attack the isle putting in the midst of them that pythoness woman on a high place where she might be safe freely to exercise her art  it was not hereward alone who had entreated torfrida to exercise her magic art in their behalf but she steadily refused and made good abbot thurstan support her refusal by a strict declaration that he would have no fiends games played in ely as long as he was abbot alive on land  torfrida meanwhile grew utterly wild her conscience smote her in spite of her belief that st etheldreda had inspired her at the terrible resource which she had hinted to her husband and which she knew well he would carry out with terrible success pictures of agony and death floated before her eyes and kept her awake at night she watched long hours in the church in prayer she fasted she disciplined her tender body with sharp pains she tried after the fashion of those times to atone for her sin if sin it was at last she had worked herself up into a religious frenzy she saw st etheldreda in the clouds towering over the isle menacing the french host with her virgin palmbranch she uttered wild prophecies of ruin and defeat to the french and then when her frenzy collapsed moaned secretly of ruin and defeat hereafter to themselves but she would be bold she would play her part she would encourage the heroes who looked to her as one inspired wiser and loftier than themselves  and so it befell that when the men marched down to haddenham that afternoon torfrida rode at their head on a white charger robed from throat to ankle in sackcloth her fetters clanking on her limbs but she called on the english to see in her the emblem of england captive yet unconquered and to break her fetters and the worse fetters of every woman in england who was the toy and slave of the brutal invaders and so fierce a triumph sparkled from her wild hawkeyes that the englishmen looked up to her weird beauty as to that of an inspired saint and when the normans came on to the assault there stood on a grassy mound behind the english fort a figure clothed in sackcloth barefooted and bareheaded with fetters shining on waist and wrist and ankleher long black locks streaming in the wind her long white arms stretched crosswise toward heaven in imitation of moses of old above the battle with amalek invoking st etheldreda and all the powers of heaven and chanting doom and defiance to the invaders  and the english looked on her and cried she is a prophetess we will surely do some great deed this day or die around her feet like heroes  and opposite to her upon the norman tower the old hag of brandon howled and gibbered with filthy gestures calling for the thunderstorm which did not come for all above the sky was cloudless blue  and the english saw and felt though they could not speak it dumb nation as they were the contrast between the spirit of cruelty and darkness and the spirit of freedom and light  so strong was the new bridge that william trusted himself upon it on horseback with ivo taillebois at his side  william doubted the powers of the witch and felt rather ashamed of his new helpmate but he was confident in his bridge and in the heavy artillery which he had placed in his four towers  ivo taillebois was utterly confident in his witch and in the bridge likewise  william waited for the rising of the tide and when the tide was near its height he commanded the artillery to open and clear the fort opposite of the english then with crash and twang the balistas and catapults went off and great stones and heavy lances hurtled through the air  back shouted torfrida raised almost to madness by fasting selftorture and religious frenzy out of yon fort every man why waste your lives under that artillery stand still this day and see how the saints of heaven shall fight for you  so utter was the reverence which she commanded for the moment that every man drew back and crowded round her feet outside the fort  the cowards are fleeing already let your men go sir king shouted taillebois  on to the assault strike for normandy shouted william  i fear much said he to himself that this is some stratagem of that herewards but conquered they must be  the evening breeze curled up the reach the great pike splashed out from the weedy shores and sent the whitefish flying in shoals into the low glare of the setting sun and heeded not stupid things the barges packed with mailed men which swarmed in the reeds on either side the bridge and began to push out into the river  the starlings swung in thousands round the reedronds looking to settle in their wonted place but dare not and rose and swung round again telling each other in their manifold pipings how all the reedronds teemed with mailed men and all above the sky was cloudless blue  and then came a trample a roll of many feet on the soft spongy peat a low murmur which rose into wild shouts of dex aie as a human tide poured along the causeway and past the witch of brandon heath  dex aie quoth william with a sneer debbles aie would fit better  if sire the powers above would have helped us we should have been happy enough tobut if they would not it is not our fault if we try below said ivo taillebois  william laughed it is well to have two strings to ones bow sir forward men forward shouted he riding out to the bridgeend under the tower  forward shouted ivo taillebois  forward shouted the hideous hag overhead the spirit of the well fights for you  fight for yourselves said william  there was twenty yards of deep clear water between frenchman and englishman only twenty yards not only the arrows and arblast quarrels but heavy handjavelins flew across every moment every now and then a man toppled forward and plunged into the blue depth among the eels and pike to find his comrades of the summer before then the stream was still once more the coots and waterhens swam in and out of the reeds and wondered what it was all about the waterlilies flapped upon the ripple as lonely as in the loneliest mere but their floats were soon broken their white cups stained with human gore  twenty yards of deep clear water and treasure inestimable to win by crossing it  they thrust out baulks canoes pontoons they crawled upon them like ants and thrust out more yet beyond heedless of their comrades who slipped and splashed and sank holding out vain hands to hands too busy to seize them and always the old witch jabbered overhead with her cantrips pointing mumming praying for the storm while all above the sky was cloudless blue  and always on the mound opposite while darts and quarrels whistled round her head stood torfrida pointing with outstretched scornful finger at the stragglers in the river and chanting loudly what the frenchmen could not tell but it made their hearts as it was meant to do melt like wax within them  they have a counter witch to yours ivo it seems and a fairer one i am afraid the devils especially if asmodeus be at hand are more likely to listen to her than to that old broomstickrider aloft  fair is that fair cause has sir king  a good argument for honest men but none for fiends what is the fair fiend pointing at so earnestly there  somewhat among the reeds hark to her now she is singing somewhat more like an angel than a fiend i will say for her  and torfridas bold song coming clear and sweet across the water rose louder and shriller till it almost drowned the jabbering of the witch  she sees more there than we do  i see it cried william smiting his hand upon his thigh par le splendeur dex she has been showing them where to fire the reeds and they have done it  a puff of smoke a wisp of flame and then another and another and a canoe shot out from the reeds on the french shore and glided into the reeds of the island  the reeds are on fire men have a care shouted ivo  silence fool frighten them once and they will leap like sheep into that gulf men right about draw offslowly and in order we will attack again tomorrow  the cool voice of the great captain arose too late a line of flame was leaping above the reed bed crackling and howling before the evening breeze the column on the causeway had seen their danger but too soon and fled but whither  a shower of arrows quarrels javelins fell upon the head of the column as it tried to face about and retreat confusing it more and more one arrow shot by no common aim went clean through williams shield and pinned it to the mailed flesh he could not stifle a cry of pain  you are wounded sire ride for your life it is worth that of a thousand of these churls and ivo seized williams bridle and dragged him in spite of himself through the cowering shrieking struggling crowd  on came the flames leaping and crackling laughing and shrieking like a live fiend the archers and slingers in the boats cowered before it and fell scorched corpses as it swept on it reached the causeway surged up recoiled from the mass of human beings then sprang over their heads and passed onwards girding them with flame  the reeds were burning around them the timbers of the bridge caught fire the peat and fagots smouldered beneath their feet they sprang from the burning footway and plunged into the fathomless bog covering their faces and eyes with scorched hands and then sank in the black gurgling slime  ivo dragged william on regardless of curses and prayers from his soldiery and they reached the shore just in time to see between them and the water a long black smouldering writhing line the morass to right and left which had been a minute before deep reed an open smutty pool dotted with boatsful of shrieking and cursing men and at the causewayend the tower with the flame climbing up its posts and the witch of brandon throwing herself desperately from the top and falling dead upon the embers a motionless heap of rags  fool that you are fool that i was cried the great king as he rolled off his horse at his tent door cursing with rage and pain  ivo taillebois sneaked off sent over to mildenhall for the second witch and hanged her as some small comfort to his soul neither did he forget to search the cabin till he found buried in a crock the bits of his own gold chain and various other treasures for which the wretched old women had bartered their souls all which he confiscated to his own use as a much injured man  the next day william withdrew his army the men refused to face again that bloodstained pass the english spells they said were stronger than theirs or than the daring of brave men let william take torfrida and burn her as she had burned them with reeds out of willingham fen then might they try to storm ely again  torfrida saw them turn flee die in agony her work was done her passion exhausted her selftorture and the mere weight of her fetters which she had sustained during her passion weighed her down she dropped senseless on the turf and lay in a trance for many hours  then she arose and casting off her fetters and her sackcloth was herself again but a sadder woman till her dying day     chapter xxxii  how king william took counsel of a churchman   if torfrida was exhausted so was hereward likewise he knew well that a repulse was not a defeat he knew well the indomitable persistence the boundless resources of the mastermind whom he defied and he knew well that another attempt would be made and then another tillthough it took seven years in the doingely would be won at last to hold out doggedly as long as he could was his plan to obtain the best terms he could for his comrades and he might obtain good terms at last william might be glad to pay a fair price in order to escape such a thorn in his side as the camp of refuge and might dealor at least promise to deal mercifully and generously with the last remnant of the english gentry for himself yield he would not when all was over he would flee to the sea with torfrida and his own housecarles and turn viking or go to sweyn ulfsson in denmark and die a free man  the english did not foresee these things their hearts were lifted up with their victory and they laughed at william and his french and drank torfridas health much too often for their own good hereward did not care to undeceive them but he could not help speaking his mind in the abbots chamber to thurstan egelwin and his nephews and to sigtryg ranaldsson who was still in ely not only because he had promised to stay there but because he could not get out if he would  blockaded they were utterly by land and water the isle furnished a fair supply of food and what was wanting they obtained by foraging but they had laid the land waste for so many miles round that their plundering raids brought them in less than of old and if they went far they fell in with the french and lost good men even though they were generally successful so provisions were running somewhat short and would run shorter still  moreover there was a great cause of anxiety bishop egelwin abbot thurstan and the monks of ely were in rebellion not only against king william but more or less against the pope of rome they might be excommunicated the minster lands might be taken away  bishop egelwin set his face like a flint he expected no mercy all he had ever done for the french was to warn robert comyn that if he stayed in durham evil would befall him but that was as little worth to him as it was to the said robert and no mercy he craved the less a man had the more fit he was for heaven he could but die and that he had known ever since he was a chanterboy whether he died in ely or in prison mattered little to him provided they did not refuse him the sacraments and that they would hardly do but call the duke of normandy his rightful sovereign he would not because he was notnor anybody else just now as far as he could see  valiant likewise was abbot thurstan for himself but he hadunlike bishop egelwin whose diocese had been given to a frenchmanan abbey monks and broad lands whereof he was father and steward and he must do what was best for the abbey and also what the monks would let him do for severe as was the discipline of a minster in time of peace yet in time of war when life and death were in question monks had ere now turned valiant from very fear like catos mouse and mutinied and so might the monks of ely  and edwin and morcar  no man knows what they said or thought perhaps no man cared much even in their own days no hint does any chronicler give of what manner of men they were or what manner of deeds they did fair gentle noble beloved even by william they are mere names and nothing more in history and it is to be supposed therefore that they were nothing more in fact the race of leofric and godiva had worn itself out  one night the confederates had sat late talking over the future more earnestly than usual edwin usually sad enough was especially sad that night  hereward jested with him tried to cheer him but he was silent would not drink and went away before the rest  the next morning he was gone and with him half a dozen of his private housecarles  hereward was terrified if defections once began they would be endless the camp would fall to pieces and every man among them would be hanged mutilated or imprisoned one by one helplessly they must stand or fall together  he went raging to morcar morcar knew naught of it on the faith and honor of a knight he knew naught only his brother had said to him a day or two before that he must see his betrothed before he died  he is gone to william then does he think to win her nowan outcast and a beggarwhen he was refused her with broad lands and a thousand men at his back fool see that thou play not the fool likewise nephew or  or what said morcar defiantly  or thou wilt go whither edwin is goneto betrayal and ruin  why so he has been kind enough to waltheof and gospatrick why not to edwin  because laughed hereward he wanted waltheof and he does not want you and edwin he can keep mercia quiet without your help northumbria and the fens he cannot without waltheofs they are a rougher set as you go east and north as you should know already and must have one of themselves over them to keep them in good humor for a while when he has used waltheof as his stalkinghorse long enough to build a castle every ten miles he will throw him away like a worn bowstring earl morcar nephew mine  morcar shook his head  in a week more he was gone likewise he came to william at brandon  you are come in at last young earl said william sternly you are come too late  i throw myself on your knightly faith said morcar but he had come in an angry and unlucky hour  how well have you kept your own twice a rebel that you should appeal to mine take him away  and hang him asked ivo taillebois  pish nothou old butcher put him in irons and send him into normandy  send him to roger de beaumont sire rogers son is safe in morcars castle at warwick so it is but fair that morcar should be safe in rogers  and to roger de beaumont he was sent while young roger was lord of warwick and all around that once was leofric and godivas  morcar lay in a norman keep till the day of williams death on his deathbed the tyrants heart smote him and he sent orders to release him for a few short days or hours he breathed free air again then rufus shut him up once more and forever  and that was the end of earl morcar  a few weeks after three men came to the camp at brandon and they brought a head to the king and when william looked upon it it was the head of edwin  the human heart must have burst up again in the tyrant as he looked on the fair face of him he had so loved and so wronged for they say he wept  the knights and earls stood round amazed and awed as they saw iron tears ran down plutos cheek  how came this here knaves thundered he at last  they told a rambling story how edwin always would needs go to winchester to see the queen for she would stand his friend and do him right and how they could not get to winchester for fear of the french and wandered in woods and wolds and how they were set upon and hunted and how edwin still was mad to go to winchester but when he could not he would go to blethwallon and his welsh and how earl randal of chester set upon them and how they got between a stream and the tideway of the dee and were cut off and how edwin would not yield and how then they slew him in selfdefence and randal let them bring the head to the king  this or something like it was their story but who could believe traitors where edwin wandered what he did during those months no man knows all that is known is three men brought his head to william and told some such tale and so the old nobility of england died up and down the ruts and shaughs like wounded birds and as of wounded birds none knew or cared how far they had run or how their broken bones had ached before they died  out of their own mouths they are condemned says holy writ thundered william hang them on high  and hanged on high they were on brandon heath  then the king turned on his courtiers glad to ease his own conscience by cursing them  this is your doing sirs if i had not listened to your base counsels edwin might have been now my faithful liegeman and my soninlaw and i had had one more englishman left in peace and one less sin upon my soul  and one less thorn in thy side quoth ivo taillebois  who spoke to thee ralph guader thou gavest me the counsel thou wilt answer it to god and his saints  that did i not it was earl roger because he wanted the mans shropshire lands  whereon high words ensued and the king gave the earl the lie in his teeth which the earl did not forget  i think said the rough shrewd voice of ivo that instead of crying over spilt milkfor milk the lad was and never would have grown to good beef had he lived to my age  who spoke to thee  no man and for that reason i spoke myself i have lands in spalding by your majestys grace and wish to enjoy them in peace having worked for them hard enoughand how can i do that as long as hereward sits in ely  splendeur dex said william them art right old butcher  so they laid their heads together to slay hereward and after they had talked awhile then spoke williams chaplain for the nonce an italian a friend and pupil of lanfranc of pavia an italian also then archbishop of canterbury scourging and imprisoning english monks in the south and he spoke like an italian of those times who knew the ways of rome  if his majesty will allow my humility to suggest  what thy humility is proud enough under the rose i will warrant but it has a roman wit under the rose likewise speak  that when the secular and carnal arm has failed as it is written footnote i do not laugh at holy scripture myself i only insert this as a specimen of the usual mediaeval canta name and a practice which are both derived not from puritans but from monkshe poureth contempt upon princes and letteth them wander out of the way in the wildernessor fens for the latin word and i doubt not the hebrew has both meanings  splendeur dex cried william bitterly that hath he done with a vengeance thou art right so far clerk  yet helpeth he the poor videlicet his church and the religious who are vowed to holy poverty out of misery videlicet the oppression of barbarous customs and maketh them households like a flock of sheep  they do that for themselves already here in england said william with a sneer at the fancied morals of the english monks and clergy footnote the alleged profligacy and sensuality of the english church before the conquest rests merely on a few violent and vague expressions of the norman monks who displaced them no facts as far as i can find have ever been alleged and without facts on the other side an impartial man will hold by the one fact which is certain that the church of england popish as it was was unfortunately for it not popish enough and from its insular freedom obnoxious to the church of rome and the ultramontane clergy of normandy and was therefore to be believed capableand therefore again accusedof any and every crime  but heaven and not the church does it for the true poor whom your majesty is bringing in to your endless glory  but what has all this to do with taking ely asked william impatiently i asked thee for reason and not sermons  this that it is in the power of the holy fatherand that power he would doubtless allow you as his dear son and most faithful servant to employ for yourself without sending to rome which might cause painful delaysto  it might seem strange that william taillebois guader warrenne shortspoken hardheaded hardswearing warriors could allow complacently a smooth churchman to dawdle on like this counting his periods on his fingers and seemingly never coming to the point  but they knew well that the churchman was a far cunninger as well as a more learned man than themselves they knew well that they could not hurry him and that they need not that he would make his point at last hunting it out step by step and letting them see how he got thither like a cunning hound they knew that if he spoke he had thought long and craftily till he had made up his mind and that therefore he would very probably make up their minds likewise it wasas usual in that agethe conquest not of a heavenly spirit though it boasted itself such but of a cultivated mind over brute flesh  they might have said all this aloud and yet the churchman would have gone on as he did where he left off with unaltered blandness of tone  to convert to other uses the goods of the churchto convert them to profane uses would i need not say be a sacrilege as horrible to heaven as impossible to so pious a monarch  ivo taillebois winced he had just stolen a manor from the monks of crowland and meant to keep it  church lands belonging to abbeys or sees whose abbots or bishops are contumaciously disobedient to the holy see or to their lawful monarch he being in the communion of the church and at peace with the said holy see if thereforeto come to that point at which my incapacity through the devious windings of my own simplicity has been tending but with halting steps from the moment that your majesty deigned to hear  put in the spur man said ivo tired at last and run the deer to soil  hurry no mans cattle especially thine own answered the churchman with so shrewd a wink and so cheery a voice that ivo when he recovered from his surprise cried  why thou art a good huntsman thyself i believe now  all things to all men if by any meansbut to return if your majesty should think fit to proclaim to the recalcitrants of ely that unless they submit themselves to your royal graceand to that of course of his holiness our fatherwithin a certain day you will convert to other usespremising to avoid scandal that those uses shall be for the benefit of holy churchall lands and manors of theirs lying without the precincts of the isle of elythose lands being as is known large and of great valuequid plura why burden your exalted intellect by detailing to you consequences which it has long ere now foreseen   quoth william who was as sharp as the italian and had seen it all i will make thee a bishop  spare to burden my weakness said the chaplain and slipt away into the shade  you will take his advice asked ivo  i will  then i shall see that torfrida burn at last  burn her and william swore  i promised my soldiers to burn the witch with reeds out of haddenham fen as she had burned them and i must keep my knightly word  william swore yet more ivo taillebois was a butcher and a churl  call me not butcher and churl too often lord king ere thou hast found whether thou needest me or not rough i may be false was i never  that thou wert not said william who needed taillebois much and feared him somewhat and remarked something meaning in his voice which made him calm himself diplomat as he was instantly but burn torfrida thou shalt not  well i care not i have seen a woman burnt ere now and had no fancy for the screeching beside they say she is a very fair dame and has a fair daughter too coming on and she may very well make a wife for a norman  marry her thyself  i shall have to kill hereward first  then do it and i will give thee his lands  i may have to kill others before hereward  you may  and so the matter dropped but william caught ivo alone after an hour and asked him what he meant  no pay no play lord king i have served thee well rough and smooth  thou hast and hast been well paid but if i have said aught hasty  pish majesty i am a plainspoken man and like a plainspoken master but instead of marrying torfrida or her daughter i have more mind to her niece who is younger and has no hereward to be killed first  her niece who  lucia as we call heredwin and morcars sisterherewards niece torfridas niece  no pay no play saidst thouso say i what meant you by having to kill others before hereward  beware of waltheof said ivo  waltheof pish this is one of thy inventions for making me hunt every englishman to death that thou mayest gnaw their bones  is it then this i say more beware of ralph guader  pish  pish on lord king etiquette was not yet discovered by norman barons and earls who thought themselves all but as good as their king gave him their advice when they thought fit and if he did not take it attacked him with all their meinie pish on but listen beware of roger  and what more  and give me lucia i want her i will have her  william laughed thou of all men to mix that ditchwater with that wine  they were mixed in thy blood lord king and thou art the better man for it so says the world old wine and old blood throw any lees to the bottom of the cask and we shall have a son worthy to ride behind  take care quoth william  the greatest captain upon earth  william laughed again like odins self  thou shalt have lucia for that word  and thou shalt have the plot ere it breaks as it will  to this have i come at last said william to himself as they parted to murder these english nobles to marry their daughters to my grooms heaven forgive me they have brought it upon themselves by contumacy to holy church  call my secretary some one  the italian reentered  the valiant and honorable and illustrious knight ivo taillebois lord of holland and kesteven weds lucia sister of the late earls edwin and morcar now with the queen and with her her manors you will prepare the papers  i am yours to death said ivo  to do you justice i think thou wert that already stayheresir priestdo you know any man who knows this torfrida  i do majesty said ivo there is one sir ascelin a man of gilberts in the camp  send for him  this torfrida said william haunts me  pray heaven she have not bewitched your majesty  tut i am too old a campaigner to take much harm by womans sharpshooting at fifteen score yards off beside a deep stream between no the woman has courageand beauty too you say  what of that o prince said the italian who more beautifulif report be truethan those lost women who dance nightly in the forests with venus and herodiasas it may be this torfrida has done many a time  you priests are apt to be hard upon poor women  the fox found that the grapes were sour said the italian laughing at himself and his cloth or at anything else by which he could curry favor  and this woman was no vulgar witch that sort of personage suits tailleboiss taste rather than herewards  hungry dogs eat dirty pudding said ivo pertinently  the woman believed herself in the right she believed that the saints of heaven were on her side i saw it in her attitude in her gestures perhaps she was right  sire said both bystanders in astonishment  i would fain see that woman and see her husband too they are folks after my own heart i would give them an earldom to win them  i hope that in that day you will allow your faithful servant ivo to retire to his ancestral manors in anjou for england will be too hot for him sire you know not this mana liar a bully a robber a swashbuckling ruffian who and ivo ran on with furious invective after the fashion of the normans who considered no name too bad for an english rebel  sir ascelin said william as ascelin came in you know hereward  ascelin bowed assent  are these things true which ivo alleges  the lord taillebois may know best what manner of man he is since he came into this english air which changes some folks mightily with a hardly disguised sneer at ivo but in flanders he was a very perfect knight beloved and honored of all men and especially of your fatherinlaw the great marquis  he is a friend of yours then  no man less i owe him more than one grudge though all in fair quarrel and one at least which can only be wiped out in blood  eh what  ascelin hesitated  tell me sir thundered william unless you have aught to be ashamed of  it is no shame as far as i know to confess that i was once a suitor as were all knights for miles round for the hand of the once peerless torfrida and no shame to confess that when hereward knew thereof he sought me out at a tournament and served me as he has served many a better man before and since  over thy horses croup eh said william  i am not a bad horseman as all know lord king but heaven save me and all i love from that hereward they say he has seven mens strength and i verily can testify to the truth thereof  that may be by enchantment interposed the italian  true sir priest this i know that he wears enchanted armor which torfrida gave him before she married him  enchantments again said the secretary  tell me now about torfrida said william  ascelin told him all about her not forgetting to saywhat according to the chronicler was a common reportthat she had compassed herewards love by magic arts she used to practise sorcery he said with her sorceress mistress richilda of hainault all men knew it arnoul richildas son was as a brother to her and after old baldwin died and baldwin of mons and richilda came to bruges torfrida was always with her while hereward was at the wars  the woman is a manifest and notorious witch said the secretary  it seems so indeed said william with something like a sigh and so were torfridas early follies visited on her as all early follies are but hereward you say is a good knight and true  doubtless even when he committed that great crime at peterborough  for which he and all his are duly excommunicated by the bishop said the secretary  he did a very courteous and honorable thing and ascelin told how he had saved alftruda and instead of putting her to ransom had sent her safe to gilbert  a very knightly deed he should be rewarded for it  why not burn the witch and reward him with alftruda instead since your majesty is in so gracious a humor said ivo  alftruda who is she ay i recollect her young dolfins wife why she has a husband already  ay but his holiness at rome can set that right what is there that he cannot do  there are limits i fear even to his power eh priest  what his holinesss powers as the viceroy of divinity on earth might be did he so choose it were irreverent to inquire but as he condescends to use that power only for the good of mankind he condescends like divinity to be bound by the very laws which he has promulgated for the benefit of his subjects and to make himself only a lifegiving sun when he might be a destructive thunderbolt  he is very kind and we all owe him thanks said ivo who had a confused notion that the pope might strike him dead with lightning but was goodnatured enough not to do so still he might think of this plan for they say that the lady is an old friend of herewards and not over fond of her scotch husband  that i know well said william  and besideif aught untoward should happen to dolfin and his kin  she might with her broad lands be a fine bait for hereward i see now do this by my command send a trusty monk into ely let him tell the monks that we have determined to seize all their outlying lands unless they surrender within the week and let him tell hereward by the faith and oath of william of normandy that if he will surrender himself to my grace he shall have his lands in bourne and a free pardon for himself and all his comrades  the men assented much against their will and went out on their errand  you have played me a scurvy trick sir said ascelin in advising the king to give the lady alftruda to hereward  what did you want her yourself on my honor i knew not of it but have patience you shall have her yet and all her lands if you will hear my counsel and keep it  but you would give her to hereward  and to you too it is a poor bait say these frogs of fenmen that will not take two pike running listen to me i must kill this hereward i hate him i cannot eat my meat for thinking of him kill him i must  and so must i  then we are both agreed let us work together and never mind if ones blood be old and the others new i am neither fool nor weakly as thou knowest  ascelin could not but assent  then here we must send the kings message but we must add to it  that is dangerous  so is war so is eating drinking so is everything but we must not let hereward come in we must drive him to despair make the messenger add but one wordthat the king exempts from the amnesty torfrida on account ofyou can put it into more scholarly shape than i can  on account of her abominable and notorious sorceries and demands that she shall be given up forthwith to the ecclesiastical power to be judged as she deserves  just so and then for a load of reeds out of haddenham fen  heaven forbid said ascelin who had loved her once would not perpetual imprisonment suffice  what care i that is the churchmens affair not ours but i fear we shall not get her even so hereward will flee with hermaybe escape to flanders or denmark he can escape through a ratshole if he will and then we are at peace i had sooner kill him and have done with it but out of the way he must be put  so they sent a monk in with the message and commanded him to tell the article about the lady torfrida not only to hereward but to the abbot and all the monks  a curt and fierce answer came back not from hereward but from torfrida herselfthat william of normandy was no knight himself or he would not offer a knight his life on condition of burning his lady  william swore horribly what is all this about they told himas much as they chose to tell him he was very wroth who was ivo taillebois to add to his message he had said that torfrida should not burn taillebois was stout for he had won the secretary over to his side meanwhile he had said nothing about burning he had merely supplied an oversight of the kings the woman as the secretary knew could not with all deference to his majesty be included in an amnesty she was liable to ecclesiastical censure and the ecclesiastical courts william might exercise his influence on them in all lawful ways and more remit her sentence even so far as to pardon her entirely if his merciful temper should so incline him but meanwhile what better could he ivo have done than to remind the monks of ely that she was a sorceress that she had committed grave crimes and was liable to punishment herself and they to punishment also as her shelterers and accomplices what he wanted was to bring over the monks and he believed that message had been a good stroke toward that as for hereward the king need not think of him he never would come in alive he had sworn an oath and he would keep it  and so the matter ended     chapter xxxiii  how the monks of ely did after their kind   williams bolt or rather inextinguishable greek fire could not have fallen into ely at a more propitious moment  hereward was away with a large body of men and many ships foraging in the northeastern fens he might not be back for a week  abbot thurstanfor what cause is not saidhad lost heart a little while before and fled to angerhale taking with him the ornaments and treasure of the church  hereward had discovered his flight with deadly fear but provisions he must have and forth he must go leaving ely in charge of half a dozen independent english gentlemen each of whom would needs have his own way just because it was his own  only torfrida he took and put her hand into the hand of ranald sigtrygsson and said thou true comrade and perfect knight as i did by thy wife do thou by mine if aught befall  and ranald swore first by the white christ and then by the head of sleipnir odins horse that he would stand by torfrida till the last and then if need was slay her  you will not need king ranald i can slay myself said she as she took the ostdanes hard honest hand  and hereward went seemingly by mepal or sutton then came the message and all men in ely knew it  torfrida stormed down to the monks in honest indignation to demand that they should send to william and purge her of the calumny she found the chapterdoor barred and bolted they were all gabbling inside like starlings on a foggy morning and would not let her in she hurried back to ranald fearing treason and foreseeing the effect of the message upon the monks  but what could ranald do to find out their counsels was impossible for him or any man in ely for the monks could talk latin and the men could not torfrida alone knew the sacred tongue  if torfrida could but listen at the keyhole wellall was fair in war and to the chapterhouse door she went guarded by ranald and some of his housecarles and listened with a beating heart she heard words now incomprehensible that men who most of them lived no better than their own serfs who could have no amount of wealth not even the hope of leaving that wealth to their childrenshould cling to wealthstruggle forge lie do anything for wealth to be used almost entirely not for themselves but for the honor and glory of the conventindicates an intensity of corporate feeling unknown in the outer world then or now  the monastery would be ruined without this manor without that wood without that stone quarry that fisherywhat would become of them  but mingled with those words were other words unfortunately more intelligible to this daythose of superstition  what would st etheldreda say how dare they provoke her wrath would she submit to lose her lands she might dowhat might she not do her bones would refuse ever to work a miracle again they had been but too slack in miracleworking for many years she might strike the isle with barrenness the minster with lightning she might send a flood up the fens she might  william the norman to do them justice those valiant monks feared not for he was man and could but kill the body but st etheldreda a virgin goddess with all the host of heaven to back hermight she not by intercession with powers still higher than her own destroy both body and soul in hell  we are betrayed they are going to send for the abbot from angerhale said torfrida at last reeling from the door all is lost  shall we burst open the door and kill them all asked ranald simply  no kingno they are gods men and we have blood enough on our souls  we can keep the gates lest any go out to the king  impossible they know the isle better than we and have a thousand arts  so all they could do was to wait in fear and trembling for herewards return and send martin lightfoot off to warn him wherever he might be  the monks remained perfectly quiet the organ droned the chants wailed as usual nothing interrupted the stated order of the services and in the hall each day they met the knights as cheerfully as ever greed and superstition had made cowards of themand now traitors  it was whispered that abbot thurstan had returned to the minster but no man saw him and so three or four days went on  martin found hereward after incredible labors and told him all clearly and shrewdly the mans manifest insanity only seemed to quicken his wit and increase his powers of bodily endurance  hereward was already on his way home and never did he and his good men row harder than they rowed that day back to sutton he landed and hurried on with half his men leaving the rest to disembark the booty he was anxious as to the temper of the monks he foresaw all that torfrida had foreseen and as for torfrida herself he was half mad ivo tailleboiss addition to williams message had had its due effect he vowed even deadlier hate against the norman than he had ever felt before he ascended the heights to sutton it was his shortest way to ely he could not see aldreth from thence but he could see willingham field and belsars hills round the corner of haddenham hill  the sun was setting long before they reached ely but just as he sank into the western fen winter stopped pointing was that the flash of arms there far away just below willingham town or was it the setting sun upon the ripple of some long water  there is not wind enough for such a ripple said one but ere they could satisfy themselves the sun was down and all the fen was gray  hereward was still more uneasy if that had been the flash of arms it must have come off a very large body of men moving in column and on the old straight road between cambridge and ely he hastened on his men but ere they were within sight of the minstertower they were aware of a horse galloping violently towards them through the dusk hereward called a halt he heard his own heart beat as he stopped the horse was pulled up short among them and a lad threw himself off  hereward thank god i am in time  the voice was the voice of torfrida  treason she gasped  i knew it  the french are in the island they have got aldreth the whole army is marching from cambridge the whole fleet is coming up from southrey and you have time  to burn ely over the monks heads men get bogwood out of yon cottage make yourselves torches and onward  then rose a babel of questions which torfrida answered as she could but she had nothing to tell clerks cunning she said bitterly was an overmatch for womans wit she had sent out a spy but he had not returned till an hour since then he came back breathless with the news that the french army was on the march from cambridge and that as he came over the water at alrech he found a party of french knights in the fort on the ely side talking peaceably with the monks on guard  she had run up to the borough hillwhich men call cherry hill at this dayand one look to the northeast had shown her the river swarming with ships she had rushed home put on mens clothes hid a few jewels in her bosom saddled swallow and ridden for her life thither  and king ranald  he and his men had gone desperately out towards haddenham with what english they could muster but all were in confusion some were getting the women and children into boats to hide them in the reeds others battering the minster gates vowing vengeance on the monks  then ranald will be cut off alas for the day that ever brought his brave heart hither  and when the men heard that a yell of fury and despair burst from all throats  should they go back to their boats  no onward cried hereward revenge first and safety after let us leave nothing for the accursed frenchmen but smoking ruins and then gather our comrades and cut our way back to the north  good counsel cried winter we know the roads and they do not and in such a dark night as is coming we can march out of the island without their being able to follow us a mile  they hurried on but stopped once more at the galloping of another horse  who comes friend or foe  alwyn son of orgar cried a voice under breath dont make such a noise men the french are within half a mile of you  then one traitor monk shall die ere i retreat cried hereward seizing him by the throat  for heavens sake hold cried torfrida seizing his arm you know not what he may have to say  i am no traitor hereward i have fought by your side as well as the best and if any but you had called alwyn  a curse on your boasting tell us the truth  the abbot has made peace with the king he would give up the island and st etheldreda should keep all her lands and honors i said what i could but who was i to resist the whole chapter could i alone brave st etheldredas wrath  alwyn the valiant afraid of a dead girl  blaspheme not hereward she may hear you at this moment look there and pointing up the monk cowered in terror as a meteor flashed through the sky  that is st etheldreda shooting at us eh then all i can say is she is a very bad marksman and the french are in the island  they are  then forward men for one halfhours pleasure and then to die like englishmen  on cried alwyn you cannot go on the king is at whichford at this moment with all his army half a mile off right across the road to ely  hereward grew berserk on men shouted he we shall kill a few frenchmen apiece before we die  hereward cried torfrida you shall not go on if you go i shall be taken and if i am taken i shall be burned and i cannot burni cannot i shall go mad with terror before i come to the stake i cannot go stript to my smock before those frenchmen i cannot be roasted piecemeal hereward take me away take me away or kill me now and here  he paused he had never seen torfrida thus overcome  let us flee the stars are against us god is against us let us hideescape abroad beg our bread go on pilgrimage to jerusalem togetherfor together it must be always but take me away  we will go back to the boats men said hereward  but they did not go they stood there irresolute looking towards ely  the sky was pitchy dark the minster roofs lying northeast were utterly invisible against the blackness  we may at least save some who escape out said hereward march on quickly to the left under the hill to the ploughfield  they did so  lie down men there are the french close on our right down among the bushes  and they heard the heavy tramp of men within a quarter of a mile  cover the mares eyes and hold her mouth lest she neigh said winter  hereward and torfrida lay side by side upon the heath she was shivering with cold and horror he laid his cloak over her put his arm round her  your stars did not foretell you this torfrida he spoke not bitterly but in utter sadness  she burst into an agony of weeping  my stars at least foretold me nothing but woe since first i saw your face  why did you marry me then asked he half angrily  because i loved you because i love you still  then you do not regret  never never never i am quite happyquite happy why not  a low murmur from the men made them look up they were near enough to the town to hearonly too much they heard the tramp of men shouts and yells then the shrill cries of women all dull and muffled the sounds came to them through the still night and they lay there spellbound as in a nightmare as men assisting at some horrible tragedy which they had no power to prevent then there was a glare and a wisp of smoke against the black sky and then a house began burning brightly and then another  this is the frenchmans faith  and all the while as the sack raged in the town below the minster stood above dark silent and safe the church had provided for herself by sacrificing the children beneath her fostering shadow  they waited nearly an hour but no fugitives came out  come men said hereward wearily we may as well to the boats  and so they went walking on like men in a dream as yet too stunned to realize to themselves the hopeless horror of their situation only hereward and torfrida saw it all looking back on the splendid pastthe splendid hopes for the future glory honor an earldom a free danish englandand this was all that was left  no it is not cried torfrida suddenly as if answering her own unspoken thoughts and his love is still left the gallows and the stake cannot take that away and she clung closer to her husbands side and he again to hers  they reached the shore and told their tale to their comrades whither now  to well to the wide mere said hereward  but their ships will hunt us out there  we shall need no hunting we must pick up the men at cissham you would not leave them to be murdered too as we have left the ely men  no they would go to well and then  the bruneswald and the merry greenwood said hereward  hey for the merry greenwood shouted leofric the deacon and the men in the sudden delight of finding any place any purpose answered with a lusty cheer  brave hearts said hereward we will live and die together like englishmen  we will we will viking  where shall we stow the mare asked geri the boats are full already  leave her to me on board torfrida  he got on board last leading the mare by the bridle  swim good lass said he as they pushed off and the good lass who had done it many a time before waded in and was soon swimming behind hereward turned and bent over the side in the darkness there was a strange gurgle a splash and a swirl he turned round and sat upright again they rowed on  that mare will never swim all the way to well said one  she will not need it said hereward  why cried torfrida feeling in the darkness she is loose what is this in your hand your dagger and wet  mare swallow is at the bottom of the reach we could never have got her to well  and you have cried a dozen voices  do you think that i would let a cursed frenchmanay even williams selfsay that he had bestridden herewards mare  none answered but torfrida as she laid her head upon her husbands bosom felt the great tears running down from his cheek on to her own  none spoke a word the men were awestricken there was something despairing and illomened in the deed and yet there was a savage grandeur in it which bound their savage hearts still closer to their chief  and so mare swallows bones lie somewhere in the peat unto this day  they got to well they sent out spies to find the men who had been wasting cissham with fire and sword and at last brought them in ill news as usual had travelled fast they had heard of the fall of ely and hidden themselves in a certain very small island which is called stimtench where thinking that the friends in search of them were frenchmen in pursuit they hid themselves among the high reeds there two of themone starkwolf by name the other broherhiding near each other thought that as they were monks it might conduce to their safety if they had shaven crowns and set to work with their swords to shave each others heads as well as they could but at last by their warcries and their speech recognizing each other they left off fighting and went after hereward  so jokes grimly enough leofric the deacon who must have seen them come in the next morning with bleeding coxcombs and could laugh over the thing in after years but he was in no humor for jesting in the days in which they lay at well nor was he in jesting humor when a week afterwards hunted by the normans from well and forced too take to meres and waterways known only to them and too shallow and narrow for the norman ships they found their way across into the old nene and so by thorney on toward crowland leaving peterborough far on the left for as they neared crowland they saw before them rowing slowly a barge full of men and as they neared that barge behold ail they who rowed were blind of both their eyes and all they who sat and guided them were maimed of both their hands and as they came alongside there was not a man in all that ghastly crew but was an ancient friend by whose side they had fought full many a day and with whom they had drunk deep full many a night they were the firstfruits of williams vengeance thrust into that boat to tell the rest of the fenmen what those had to expect who dared oppose the norman and they were going by some bystream to crowland to the sanctuary of the danish fenmen that they might cast themselves down before st guthlac and ask of him that mercy for their souls which the conqueror had denied to their bodies alas for them they were but a handful among hundreds perhaps thousands of mutilated cripples who swarmed all over england and especially in the north and east throughout the reign of the norman conquerors they told their comrades fate slaughtered in the first attack or hanged afterwards as rebels and traitors to a foreigner whom they had never seen and to whom they owed no fealty by law of god or man  and ranald sigtrygsson  none knew aught of him he never got home again to his irish princess  and the poor women asked torfrida  but she received no answer  and the men swore a great oath and kept it never to give quarter to a norman as long as there was one left on english ground  neither were the monks of ely in jesting humor when they came to count up the price of their own baseness they had as was in that day the cant of all cowardly english churchmen as well as of the more crafty normans obeyed the apostolic injunction to submit to the powers that be because they are ordained c but they found the hand of the powers that be a very heavy one forty knights were billeted on them at free quarters with all their men every morning the butler had to distribute to them food and pay in the great hall and in vain were their complaints of bad faith william meanwhile who loved money as well as he loved the tall deer had had 1000 another says 700 marks of them as the price of their churchs safety for the payment whereof if one authority is to be trusted they sold all the furniture of gold and silver crosses altars coffers covers chalices platters ewers urnets basons cups and saucers nay the idols themselves were not spared for beside that they sold a goodly image of our lady with her little son in a throne wrought with marvellous workmanship which elsegus the abbot had made likewise they stripped many images of holy virgins of much furniture of gold and silver footnote these details are from a story found in the isle of ely published by dr giles it seems a late composition probably of the sixteenth centuryand has manifest errors of fact but valeat quantum so that poor st etheldreda had no finery in which to appear on festivals and went in russet for many years after the which money according to another footnote stows annals they took as they had promised to picot the viscount at cambridge he weighed the money and finding it an ounce short accused them of cheating the king and sentenced them to pay 300 marks more after which the royal commissioners came plundered the abbey of all that was left and took away likewise a great mass of gold and silver found in wentworth wherewith the brethren meant to repair the altar vessels and also a notable cope which archbishop stigand gave which the church hath wanted to this day  thurstan the traitor abbot died in a few months egelwin the bishop of durham was taken in the abbey he was a bishop and they dared not kill him but he was a patriot and must have no mercy they accused him of stealing the treasures of durham which he had brought to ely for the service of his country and shut him up in abingdon a few months after the brave man was found starved and dead whether of his own will or enforced and so ended another patriot prelate but we do not read that the normans gave back the treasure to durham and so yielding an immense mass of booty and many a fair woman as the normans prey ended the camp of refuge and the glory of the isle of ely     chapter xxxiv  how hereward went to the greenwood   and now is hereward to the greenwood gone to be a bold outlaw and not only an outlaw himself but the father of all outlaws who held those forests for two hundred years from the fens to the scottish border utlages forestiers latrunculi robberlets sicarii cutthroats sauvages who prided themselves upon sleeping on the bare ground they were accursed by the conquerors and beloved by the conquered the norman viscount or sheriff commanded to hunt them from hundred to hundred with hue and cry horse and bloodhound the english yeoman left for them a keg of ale or a basket of loaves beneath the hollins green as sauce for their meal of nombles of the dere     for hart and hind and doe and roe     were in that forest great plentie  and    swannes and fesauntes they had full good       and foules of the rivere    there fayled never so lytell a byrde       that ever was bred on brere  with the same friendly yeoman that was a good felawe they would lodge by twos and threes during the sharp frosts of midwinter in the lonely farmhouse which stood in the field or forestclearing but for the greater part of the year their lodging was on the cold ground in the holly thickets or under the hanging rock or in a lodge of boughs  and then after a while the life which began in terror and despair and poverty and loss of land and kin became not only tolerable but pleasant bold men and hardy they cared less and less for    the thornie wayes the deep valleys    the snowe the frost the rayne    the colde the hete for dry or wete    we must lodge on the plaine    and us above none other roofe    but a brake bushe or twayne  and they found fair lasses too in time who like torfrida and maid marian would answer to their warnings against the outlaw life with the nutbrowne maid that    amonge the wylde dere such an archere        as men say that ye be    he may not fayle of good

themselves merry men and the forest the merry greenwood and sang with robin hood     a merrier man than i belyye     there lives not in christentie  they were coaxed back at times to civilized life they got their grace of the king and entered the kings service but the craving after the greenwood was upon them they dreaded and hated the four stone walls of a norman castle and like robin hood slipt back to the forest and the deer  gradually too law and order rose among them lawless as they were the instinct of discipline and selfgovernment side by side with that of personal independence which is the peculiar mark and peculiar strength of the english character who knows not how in the lytell geste of robin hood they shot at pluckbuffet the king among them disguised as an abbot and every man who missed the rosegarland his tackle he should tyne    and bere a buffet on his head      iwys ryght all bare    and all that fell on robyns lote      he smote them wonder sair    till robyn fayled of the garlonde      three fyngers and mair  then good gilbert bids him in his turn    stand forth and take his pay    if it be so sayd robyn      that may no better be    syr abbot i

in good humor strict rules fair play and equal justice for high and low this was the old outlaw spirit which has descended to their inlawed descendants and makes to this day the life and marrow of an english public school  one fixed idea the outlaw hadhatred of the invader if his herde were the kings deer his treasure was the earls purse and still oftener the purse of the foreign churchman norman or italian who had expelled the outlaws english cousins from their convents shamefully scourged and cruelly imprisoned them as the blessed archbishop lanfranc did at canterbury because they would not own allegiance to a french abbot or murdered them at the high altar as did the new abbot of glastonbury because they would not change their old gregorian chant for that of william of fécamp footnote see the anglosaxon chronicle  on these mitred tyrants the outlaw had no mercy as far as their purses were concerned their persons as consecrated were even to him sacred and inviolableat least from wounds and death and one may suppose hereward himself to have been the first author of the laws afterward attributed to robin hood as for robbing and reving beting and bynding free warren was allowed against the norman    thereof no fors said robyn       we shall do well enow     but look ye do no housbonde harme       that tilleth wyth his plough    no more ye shall no good yemàn       that

nottingham       hym holde in your mynde    robyn loved our dere ladye      for doubt of dedely synne    wolde he never do company harme      that any woman was ynne  and even so it was with hereward in the bruneswald if the old chroniclers leofric especially are to be believed  and now torfrida was astonished she had given way utterly at ely from womans fear and womans disappointment all was over all was lost what was left save to die  butand it was a new and unexpected fact to one of her excitable southern blood easily raised and easily depressedshe discovered that neither her husband nor winter nor geri nor wenoch nor ranald of ramsey nor even the romancing harping leofric thought that all was lost she argued it with them not to persuade them into base submission but to satisfy her own surprise  but what will you do  live in the greenwood  and what then  burn every town which a frenchman holds and kill every frenchman we meet  but what plan have you  who wants a plan as you call it while he has the green hollies overhead the dun deer on the lawn bow in his hand and sword by his side  but what will be the end of it all  we shall live till we die  but william is master of all england  what is that to us he is not our master  but he must be some day you will grow fewer and fewer his government will grow stronger and stronger  what is that to us when we are dead there will be brave yeomen in plenty to take our place you would not turn traitor  i never never i will live and die with you in your greenwood as you call it onlyi did not understand you english  torfrida did not she was discovering the fact which her nation have more than once discovered since that the stupid valor of the englishman never knows when it is beaten and sometimes by that selfsatisfied ignorance succeeds in not being beaten after all  so herewardif the chronicles speak truthassembled a formidable force wellnigh at last four hundred men winter geri wenoch grogan one of the azers of lincoln were still with him ranald the butler still carried his standard of duti and outi the famous brothers no more is heard a valiant matelgar takes their place alfric and sexwold and many another gallant fugitive cast up like scattered hounds at the sound of the wakes warhorn there were those among them says gaimar who scorned to fight singlehanded less than three normans as for hereward he would fight seven     les quatre oscist les treis fuirent     naffrez sanglant cil sen partirent     en plusurs lius issi avint     kencontre seit très bien se tuit     de seit hommes avait vertu

range they must have had for gallant sportsmen away south between the nene and welland stretched from stamford and peterborough the still vast forests of rockingham nigh twenty miles in length as the crow flies down beyond rockingham town and geddington chase to the west they had the range of the hunting counties dotted still in the more eastern part with innumerable copses and shaughs the remnants of the great forest out of which as out of rockinghamshire have been cut those fair parks and         handsome houses    where the wealthy nobles dwell  past which the lord of burleigh led his welsh bride to that burghley house by stamford town wellnigh the noblest of them all which was in herewards time deep wood and freestone down round exton and normanton and that other burley on the hill on through those morkery woods which still retain the name of herewards illfated nephew north by irnham and corby on to belton and syston par nobile and southwest again to those still wooded heights whence allbutroyal belvoir looks out over the rich green vale below did hereward and his men range far and wide harrying the frenchman and hunting the dun deer stags there were in plenty there remain to this day in grimsthorpe park by bourne the descendants of the very deer which earl leofric and earl algar and after them hereward the outlaw hunted in the bruneswald  deeptangled forest filled the lower claylands swarming with pheasant roe badger and more wolves than were needed broken parklike glades covered the upper freestones where the red deer came out from harbor for their evening graze and the partridges and plovers whirred up and the hares and rabbits loped away innumerable and where hollies and ferns always gave dry lying for the night what did men need more whose bodies were as stout as their hearts  they were poachers and robbers and why not the deer had once been theirs the game the land the serfs and if godric of corby slew the irnham deer burned irnham hall over the head of the new norman lord and thought no harm he did but what he would with that which had been once his own  easy it was to dash out by night and make a raid to harry the places which they once had owned themselves in the vale of belvoir to the west or to the east in the strip of fertile land which sloped down into the fen and levy blackmail in rippinghale or folkingham or aslackby or sleaford or any other of the vills now thriving villages which still remain in domesdaybook and written against them the ugly and significant  in tatenai habuerunt turgisle et suen iiii carrucas terae c hoc ivo taillebosc ibi habet in dominioall that is that the wars had left of them  the said turgisle torkill or turketil misspelt by frenchmen and sweyn and many a good man morefor ivos possessions were enormouswere thorns in the sides of ivo and his men which must be extracted and the bruneswald a nest of hornets which must be smoked out at any cost  wherefore it befell that once upon a day there came riding to hereward in the bruneswald a horseman all alone  and meeting with hereward and his men he made signs of amity and bowed himself low and pulled out of his purse a letter protesting that he was an englishman and a good felawe and that though he came from lincoln town a friend to the english had sent him  that was believable enough for hereward had his friends and his spies far and wide  and when he opened the letter and looked first like a wary man at the signature a sudden thrill went through him  it was alftrudas  if he was interested in her considering what had passed between them from her childhood it was nothing to be ashamed of and yet somehow he felt ashamed of that same sudden thrill  and hereward had reason to be ashamed he had been faithful to torfridaa virtue most rare in those days few were faithful then save it may be baldwin of mons to his tyrant and idol the sorceress richilda and william of normandywhatever were his other sinsto his wise and sweet and beautiful matilda the stories of his coldness and cruelty to her seem to rest on no foundation one need believe them as little as one does the myth of one chronicler that when she tried to stop him from some expedition and clung to him as he sat upon his horse he smote his spur so deep into her breast that she fell dead the man had selfcontrol and feared god in his own wild waytherefore it was perhaps that he conquered  and hereward had been faithful likewise to torfrida and loved her with an overwhelming adoration as all true men love and for that very reason he was the more aware that his feeling for alftruda was strangely like his feeling for torfrida and yet strangely different  there was nothing in the letter that he should not have read she called him her best and dearest friend twice the savior of her life what could she do in return but at any risk to herself try and save his life the french were upon him the posse comitatus of seven counties was raising northampton cambridge lincoln holland leicester huntingdon warwick were coming to the bruneswald to root him out  lincoln thought hereward that must be gilbert of ghent and oger the breton no gilbert is not coming sir ascelin is coming for him holland that is my friend ivo taillebois well we shall have the chance of paying off old scores northampton the earl thereof just now is the pious and loyal waltheof as he is of huntingdon and cambridge is he going to join young fitzosbern from warwick and leicester to root out the last englishman why not that would be a deed worthy of the man who married judith and believes in the powers that be and eats dirt daily at williams table  then he read on  ascelin had been mentioned he remarked three or four times in the letter which was long as from one lingering over the paper wishing to say more than she dared at the end was a hint of the reason  o that having saved me twice you could save me once more know you that gospatrick has been driven from his earldom on charge of treason and that waltheof has northumbria in his place as well as the parts round you and that gospatrick is fled to scotland again with his sonsmy man among them and now the report comes that my man is slain in battle on the border and that i am to be given awayas i have been given away twice beforeto ascelin this i know as i know all not only from him of ghent but from him of peterborough ascelins uncle  hereward laughed a laugh of cynical triumphpardonable enough in a broken man  gospatrick the wittol the woodcock looking at the springe and then coolly putting his head therein throwing the hatchet after the helve selling his soul and never getting the price of it i foresaw it foretold it i believe to alftruda herselfforetold that he would not keep his bought earldom three years what a people we are we english if gospatrick isas he isthe shrewdest man among us with a dash of canny scots blood too among the oneeyed the blind is king says torfrida out of her wise ancients and blind we are if he is our best no there is one better man left i trust one that will never be fool enough to put his head into the wolfs mouth and trust the norman and that is hereward the outlaw  and hereward boasted to himself at gospatricks expense of his own superior wisdom till his eye caught a line or two which finished the letter  o that you would change your mind much as i honor you for it o that you would come in to the king who loves and trusts you having seen your constancy and faith proved by so many years of affliction great things are open to you and great joysi dare not tell you what but i know them if you would come in you to waste yourself in the forest an outlaw and a savage opportunity once lost never returns time flies fast hereward my friend and we shall all grow oldi think at times that i shall soon grow old and the joys of life will be impossible and nothing left but vain regrets  hey said hereward a very clerkly letter i did not think she was so good a scholar almost as good a one as torfrida  that was all he said and as for thinking he had the posse comitatus of seven counties to think of but what could those great fortunes and joys be which alftruda did not dare to describe  she growing old too impossible that was womans vanity it was but two years since she was as fair as a saint in a window she shall not marry ascelin i will cut his head off she shall have her own choice for once poor child  and hereward found himself worked up to a great height of paternal solicitude for alftruda and righteous indignation against ascelin he did not confess to himself that he disliked much in his selfish vanity the notion of alftrudas marrying any one at all he did not want to marry her himselfof course not but there is no dog in the manger so churlish on such points as a vain man there are those who will not willingly let their own sisters their own daughters their own servants marry why should a woman wish to marry any one but them  but hereward however vain was no dreamer or sluggard he set to work joyfully cheerfully scenting battle afar off like jobs warhorse and pawing for the battle he sent back alftrudas messenger with this answer  tell your lady that i kiss her hands and feet that i cannot write for outlaws carry no pen and ink but that what she has commanded that will i perform  it is noteworthy that when hereward showed torfrida which he did frankly alftrudas letter he did not tell her the exact words of his answer and stumbled and varied much vexing her thereby when she naturally wished to hear them word for word  then he sent out spies to the four airts of heaven and his spies finding a friend and a meal in every hovel brought home all the news he needed  he withdrew torfrida and his men into the heart of the forestno hint of the place is given by the chroniclercut down trees formed an abattis of trunks and branches and awaited the enemy     chapter xxxv  how abbot thorold was put to ransom   though hereward had as yet no feud against bysshoppes and archbysshoppes save egelsin of selsey who had excommunicated him but who was at the other end of england he had feud as may be supposed against thorold abbot of peterborough and thorold feud likewise against him when thorold had entered the golden borough hoping to fatten himself with all its treasures he had found it a smoking ruin and its treasures gone to ely to pay sweyn and his danes and such a sacrilege especially when he was the loser thereby was the unpardonable sin itself in the eyes of thorold as he hoped it might be in the eyes of st peter joyfully therefore he joined his friend ivo taillebois when with his usual pompous verbosity saith peter of blois writing on this very matter he asked him to join in destroying hereward  nevertheless with all the norman chivalry at their back it behoved them to move with caution for so says the chronicler hereward had in these days very many foreigners as well as landsfolk who had come to him to practise and learn war and fled from their masters and friends when they heard of his fame and some of them the kings courtiers who had come to see whether those things which they heard were true whom hereward nevertheless received cautiously on plighted troth and oath  so ivo taillebois summoned all his men and all other mens men who would join him and rode forth through spalding and bourne having announced to lucia his bride that he was going to slay her one remaining relative and when she wept cursed and kicked her as he did once a week after which he came to thorold of peterborough  so on the two worthies rode from peterborough to stamford and from stamford into the wilderness no man knows whither    and far they rode by bush and shaugh    and far by moss and mire  but never found a track of hereward or his men and ivo taillebois left off boasting how he would burn torfrida over a slow fire and confined himself to cursing and abbot thorold left off warbling the song of roland as if he had been going to a second battle of hastings and wished himself in warm bed at peterborough  but at the last they struck upon a great horsetrack and followed it at their best pace for several miles and yet no sign of hereward  catch an englishman quoth the abbot  but that was not so easy the poor folk had hidden themselves like israel of old in thickets and dens and caves of rocks at the faroff sight of the norman tyrants and not a living soul had appeared for twenty miles at last they caught a ragged wretch herding swine and haled him up to ivo  have you seen hereward villain asked he through an interpreter  nay  you lie these are his fresh horsetracks and you must have seen him pass  eh  thrust out one of his eyes and he will find his tongue  it was done  will you answer now  the poor wretch only howled  thrust out the other  no not that mercy i will tell he is gone by this four hours how have you not met him  fool the hoofs point onward there  ayand the fellow could hardly hide a grinbut he had shod all his horses backwards  a storm of execration followed they might be thrown twenty miles out of their right road by the stratagem  so you had seen hereward and would not tell put out his other eye said taillebois as a vent to his own feelings  and they turned their horses heads and rode back leaving the man blind in the forest  the day was waning now the fog hung heavy on the treetops and dripped upon their heads the horses were getting tired and slipped and stumbled in the deep clay paths the footmen were more tired still and cold and hungry straggled more and more the horsetracks led over an open lawn of grass and fern with here and there an ancient thorn and round it on three sides thick wood of oak and beech with under copse of holly and hazel into that wood the horsetracks led by a path on which there was but room for one horse at a time  here they are at last cried ivo i see the fresh footmarks of men as well as horses push on knights and men atarms  the abbot looked at the dark dripping wood and meditated  i think that it will be as well for some of us to remain here and spreading our men along the woodside prevent the escape of the villains a moi hommes darmes  as you like i will go in and bolt the rabbit and you shall snap him up as he comes out  and ivo who was as brave as a bulldog thrust his horse into the path while the abbot sat shivering outside certain nobles of higher rank says peter de blois followed his example not wishing to rust their armor or tear their fine clothes in the dank copse  the knights and menatarms straggled slowly into the forest some by the path some elsewhere grumbling audibly at the black work before them at last the crashing of the branches died away and all was still  abbot thorold sat there upon his shivering horse shivering himself as the cold pierced through his wet mail and as near an hour past and no sign of foe or friend appeared he cursed the hour in which he took off the beautiful garments of the sanctuary to endure those of the battlefield he thought of a warm chamber warm bath warm footcloths warm pheasant and warm wine he kicked his freezing iron feet in the freezing iron stirrup he tried to blow his nose with his freezing iron hand but dropt his handkerchief into the mud and his horse trod on it he tried to warble the song of roland but the words exploded in a cough and a sneeze and so dragged on the weary hours says the chronicler nearly all day till the ninth hour but never did they see coming out of the forest the men who had gone in  a shout from his nephew sir ascelin made all turn their heads behind them on the open lawn in the throat between the woods by which they had entered were some forty knights galloping toward them  ivo  no almost shrieked the abbot there is the whitebear banner it is hereward  there is winter on his left cried one and there with the standard is the accursed monk ranald of ramsey  and on they came having debouched from the wood some two hundred yards off behind a roll in the lawn just far enough off to charge as soon as they were in line  on they came two deep with lances high over their shoulders heads and heels well down while the green tufts flew behind them a moi hommes darmes shouted the abbot but too late the french turned right and left to form was impossible ere the human whirlwind would be upon them  another halfminute and with a shout of a bear a bear the wake the wake they were struck ridden through hurled over and trampled into the mud  i yield grace i yield cried thorold struggling from under his horse but there was no one to whom to yield the knights backs were fifty yards off their right arms high in the air striking and stabbing  the battle was à loutrance there was no quarter given that day     and he that came live out thereof        was he that ran away  the abbot tried to make for the wood but ere he could gain it the knights had turned and one rode straight at him throwing away a broken lance and drawing his sword  abbot thorold may not have been the coward which peter of blois would have him over and above being the bully which all men would have him but if so even a worm will turn and so did the abbot he drew sword from thigh got well under his shield his left foot forward and struck one blow for his life and at the right placehis foes bare knee  but he had to do with a warier man than himself there was a quick jerk of the rein the horse swerved round right upon him and knocked him head over heels while his blow went into empty air  yield or die cried the knight leaping from his horse and kneeling on his head  i am a man of god an abbot churchman thorold  man of all the devils and the knight lugged him up and bound his arms behind him with the abbots own belt  ahoi here i have caught a fish i have got the golden borough in my purse roared he how much has st peter gained since we borrowed of him last abbot he will have to pay out the silver pennies bonnily if he wishes to get back thee  blaspheme not godless barbarian whereat the knight kicked him  and you have thorold the scoundrel winter cried hereward galloping up and we have three or four more dainty french knights and a viscount of i know not where among them this is a good days work now for ivo and his tail  and the abbot with four or five more prisoners were hoisted on to their own horses tied firmly and led away into the forest path  do not leave a wounded man to die cried a knight who lay on the lawn  never we i will come back and put you out of your pain quoth some one  siward siward le blanc are you in this meinie cried the knight in french  that am i who calls  for gods sake save him cried thorold he is my own nephew and i will pay  you will need all your money for yourself said siward the white riding back  are you sir ascelin of ghent  that am i your host of old  i wish i had met you in better company but friends we are and friends must be  and he dismounted and did his best for the wounded man promising to return and fetch him off before night or send yeomen to do so  as he pushed on through the wood the abbot began to see signs of a fight riderless horses crashing through the copse wounded men straggling back to be cut down without mercy by the english the war had been à loutrance for a long while none gave or asked quarter the knights might be kept for ransom they had money the wretched men of the lower classes who had none were slain as they would have slain the english  soon they heard the noise of battle and saw horsemen and footmen pellmell tangled in an abattis from behind which archers and crossbowmen shot them down in safety  hereward dashed forward with the shout of torfrida and at that the french taken in the flank fled and were smitten as they fled hip and thigh  hereward bade them spare a fugitive and bring him to him  i give you your life so run and carry my message that is tailleboiss banner there forward is it not  yes  then go after him and tell himhereward has the abbot of burgh and half a dozen knights safe by the heels and unless ivo clears the wood of his men by nightfall i will hang every one of them up for the crows before morning  ivo got the message and having had enough fighting for the day drew off says the chronicler for the sake of the abbot and his fellowcaptives  two hours after the abbot and the other prisoners were sitting unbound but unarmed in the forest encampment waiting for a right good meal with torfrida bustling about them after binding up the very few wounded among their own men  every courtesy was shown them and their hearts were lifted up as they beheld approaching among the trees great caldrons of good soup forest salads red deer and roe roasted on the wood embers spits of pheasants and partridges larks and buntings thrust off one by one by fair hands into the burdock leaves which served as platters and last but not least jacks of ale and wine appearing mysteriously from a cool old stone quarry abbot thorold ate to his hearts content complimented every one vowed he would forswear all norman cooks and take to the greenwood himself and was as gracious and courtly as if he had been at the new palace at winchester  and all the more for this reasonthat he had intended to overawe the english barbarians by his polished norman manners he found those of hereward and torfrida at least as polished as his own  i am glad you are content lord abbot said torfrida i trust you prefer dining with me to burning me as you meant to do  i burn such peerless beauty i injure a form made only for the courts of kings heaven and all saints knighthood and all chivalry forbid what taillebois may have said i know not i am no more answerable for his intentions than i am for his parentageor his success this day let churls be churls and woodcutters woodcutters i at least thanks to my ancestors am a gentleman  and as a gentleman will of course contribute to the pleasure of your hosts it will surely please you to gratify us with one stave at least of that song which has made your name famous among all knights holding out a harp  i blush but obey a harp in the greenwood a court in the wilderness what joy  and the vain abbot took the harp and saidthese if you will allow my modesty to choose are the staves on which i especially pride myself the staves which tailleferyou will pardon my mentioning him  why pardon a noble minstrel he was and a brave warrior though our foe and often have i longed to hear him little thinking that i should hear instead the maker himself  so said hereward and the abbot sangthose wondrous staves where roland left alone of all the paladins finds death come on him fast and on the pyrenaean peak beneath the pine he lays himself his face toward the ground and under him his sword and magic horn that charles his lord may say and all his folk the gentle count he died a conqueror and then turns his eyes southward toward spain betakes himself to remember many things of so many lands which he conquered valiantly of pleasant france of the men of his lineage of charlemagne his lord who brought him up he could not help to weep and sigh but yet himself he would not forget he bewailed his sins and prayed gods mercytrue father who neer yet didst lie who raised st lazarus from death and guarded daniel from the lions guard my soul from all perils for the sins which in my life i did his right glove then he offered to god st gabriel took it from his hand on his arm the chief bowed down with joined hands he went unto his end god sent down his angel cherubim and st michael whom men call del peril together with them st gabriel he came the soul of the count they bore to paradise  and the abbot ended sadly and gently without that wild aoi the warcry with which he usually ends his staves and the wild men of the woods were softened and saddened by the melody and as many as understood french said when he finished amen so may all good knights die  thou art a great maker abbot they told truths of thee sing us more of thy great courtesy  and he sang them the staves of the olifant the magic hornhow roland would not sound it in his pride and sounded it at turpins bidding but too late and how his temples burst with that great blast and charles and all his peers heard it through the gorges leagues away in france and then his aoi rang forth so loud and clear like any trumpet blast under the oaken glades that the wild men leaped to their feet and shouted health to the gleeman health to the abbot thorold  i have won them thought the abbot to himself strange mixture that man must have been if all which is told of him is true a very typical norman compact of cunning and ferocity chivalry and poetry vanity and superstition and yet able enough to help to conquer england for the pope  then he pressed hereward to sing with many compliments and hereward sang and sang again and all his men crowded round him as the outlaws of judaea may have crowded round david in carmel or hebron to hear like children old ditties which they loved the better the oftener they heard them  no wonder that you can keep these knights together if you can charm them thus with song would that i could hear you singing thus in williams hall  no more of that sir abbot the only music which i have for william is the music of steel on steel  hereward answered sharply because he was half of thorolds mind  now said torfrida as it grew late we must ask our noble guest for what he can give us as easily and well as he can songand that is news we hear naught here in the greenwood and must throw oneself on the kindness of a chance visitor  the abbot leapt at the bait and told them news court gossip bringing in great folks names and his own as often and as familiarly mingled as he could  what of richilda asked torfrida  ever since young arnoul was killed at cassel  arnoul killed shrieked torfrida  is it possible that you do not know  how should i know shut up in ely foryears it seems  but they fought at cassel three months before you went to ely  be it so only tell me arnoul killed  then the abbot told not without feeling a fearful story  robert the frison and richilda had come to open war and gerbod the fleming earl of clueter had gone over from england to help robert william had sent fitzosbern earl of hereford the scourge and tyrant of the welsh to help richilda fitz osbern had married her there and then she had asked help of her liege lord the king of france and he had sent her troops robert and richilda had fought on st peters day 1071nearly two years before at bavinchorum by cassel  richilda had played the heroine and routed roberts left wing taken him prisoner and sent him off to st omer men said that she had done it by her enchantments but her enchantments betrayed her nevertheless fitz osbern her bridegroom fell dead young arnoul had two horses killed under him then gerbod smote him to the ground and richilda and her troops fled in horror richilda was taken and exchanged for the frison at which the king of france being enraged had come down and burnt st omer then richilda undaunted had raised fresh troops to avenge her son then robert had met them at broqueroie by mons and smote them with a dreadful slaughter footnote the place was called till late and may be now the hedges of death then richilda had turned and fled wildly into a convent and so men said tortured herself night and day with fearful penances if by any means she might atone for her great sins  torfrida heard and laid her head upon her knees and wept so bitterly that the abbot entreated pardon for having pained her so much  the news had a deep and lasting effect on her the thought of richilda shivering and starving in the squalid darkness of a convent abode by her thenceforth should she ever find herself atoning in like wise for her sorceriesharmless as they had been for her ambitionsjust as they had been for her crimes but she had committed none no she had sinned in many things but she was not as richilda and yet in the loneliness and sadness of the forest she could not put richilda from before the eyes of her mind  it saddened hereward likewise for richilda he cared little but that boy how he had loved him how he had taught him to ride and sing and joust and handle sword and all the art of war how his own rough soul had been the better for that love how he had looked forward to the day when arnoul should be a great prince and requite him with love now he was gone gone who was not gone or going he seemed to himself the last tree in the forest when should his time come and the lightning strike him down to rot beside the rest but he tost the sad thoughts aside he could not afford to nourish them it was his only chance of life to be merry and desperate  well said hereward ere they hapt themselves up for the night we owe you thanks abbot thorold for an evening worthy of a kings court rather than a hollybush  i have won him over thought the abbot  so charming a courtierso sweet a minstrelso agreeable a newsmongercould i keep you in a cage forever and hang you on a bough i were but too happy but you are too fine a bird to sing in captivity so you must go i fear and leave us to the nightingales and i will take for your ransom  abbot thorolds heart beat high  thirty thousand silver marks  thirty thousand fiends  my beau sire will you undervalue yourself will you degrade yourself i took abbot thorold from his talk to be a man who set even a higher value on himself than other men set on him what higher compliment can i pay to your vast worth than making your ransom high accordingly after the spirit of our ancient english laws take it as it is meant beau sire be proud to pay the money and we will throw you sir ascelin into the bargain as he seems a friend of siwards  thorold hoped that hereward was drunk and might forget or relent but he was so sore at heart that he slept not a wink that night but in the morning he found to his sorrow that hereward had been as sober as himself  in fine he had to pay the money and was a poor man all his days  aha sir ascelin said hereward apart as he bade them all farewell with many courtesies i think i have put a spoke in your wheel about the fair alftruda  eh how most courteous victor  sir ascelin is not a very wealthy gentleman  ascelin laughed assent  nudus intravi nudus exeoengland and i fear now this mortal life likewise  but he looked to his rich uncle the abbot to further a certain marriageproject of his and of course neither my friend gilbert of ghent nor my enemy william of normandy are likely to give away so rich an heiress without some gratification in return  sir hereward knows the world it seems  so he has been told before and therefore having no intention that sir ascelin however worthy of any and every fair lady should marry this one he took care to cut off the stream at the fountainhead if he hears that the suit is still pushed he may cut off another head beside the fountains  there will be no need said ascelin laughing again you have very sufficiently ruined my uncle and my hopes  my head said he as soon as hereward was out of hearing if i do not cut off thy head ere all is over there is neither luck nor craft left among normans i shall catch the wake sleeping some day let him be never so wakeful     chapter xxxvi  how alftruda wrote to hereward   the weary months ran on from summer into winter and winter into summer again for two years and more and neither torfrida nor hereward were the better for them hope deferred maketh the heart sick and a sick heart is but too apt to be a peevish one so there were fits of despondency jars mutual recriminations if i had not taken your advice i should not have been here if i had not loved you so well i might have been very differently offand so forth the words were wiped away the next hour perhaps the next minute by sacred kisses but they had been said and would be recollected and perhaps said again  then again the merry greenwood was merry enough in the summer tide when shaughs were green and     the woodwele sang and would not cease       sitting upon the spray     so loud it wakened robin hood       in the greenwood where he lay  but it was a sad place enough when the autumn fog crawled round the gorse and dripped off the hollies and choked alike the breath and the eyesight when the air sickened with the graveyard smell of rotting leaves and the rainwater stood in the clay holes over the poached and sloppy lawns  it was merry enough too when they were in winter quarters in friendly farmhouses as long as the bright sharp frosts lasted and they tracked the hares and deer merrily over the frozen snows but it was doleful enough in those same farmhouses in the howling wet weather when wind and rain lashed in through unglazed window and illmade roof and there were coughs and colds and rheumatisms and torfrida ached from head to foot and once could not stand upright for a whole month together and every cranny was stuffed up with bits of board and rags keeping out light and air as well as wind and water and there was little difference between the short day and the long night and the men gambled and wrangled amid clouds of peatreek over draughtboards and chessmen which they had carved for themselves and torfrida sat stitching and sewing making and mending her eyes bleared with peatsmoke her hands sore and coarse from continual labor her cheek bronzed her face thin and hollow and all her beauty worn away for very trouble then sometimes there was not enough to eat and every one grumbled at her or some ones clothes were not mended and she was grumbled at again and sometimes a foraging party brought home liquor and all who could got drunk to drive dull care away and hereward forgetful of all her warnings got more than was good for him likewise and at night she coiled herself up in her furs cold and contemptuous and hereward coiled himself up guilty and defiant and woke her again and again with startings and wild words in his sleep and she felt that her beauty was gone and that he saw it and she fancied him perhaps it was only fancy less tender than of yore and then in very pride disdained to take any care of her person and said to herself though she dare not say it to him that if he only loved her for her face he did not love her at all and because she fancied him cold at times she was cold likewise and grew less and less caressing when for his sake as well as her own she should have grown more so day by day  alas for them there are many excuses sorrow may be a softening medicine at last but at first it is apt to be a hardening one and that savage outlaw life which they were leading can never have been a wholesome one for any soul of man and its graces must have existed only in the brains of harpers and gleemen away from law from selfrestraint from refinement from elegance from the very sound of a churchgoing bell they were sinking gradually down to the level of the coarse men and women whom they saw the worse and not the better parts of both their characters were getting the upper hand and it was but too possible that after a while the hero might sink into the ruffian the lady into a slattern and a shrew  but in justice to them be it said that neither of them had complained of the other to any living soul their love had been as yet too perfect too sacred for them to confess to another and thereby confess to themselves that it could in any wise fail they had each idolized the other and been too proud of their idolatry to allow that their idol could crumble or decay  and yet at last that point too was reached one day they were wrangling about somewhat as they too often wrangled and hereward in his temper let fall the words as i said to winter the other day you grow harder and harder upon me  torfrida started and fixed on him wide terrible scornful eyes so you complain of me to your boon companions  and she turned and went away without a word a gulf had opened between them they hardly spoke to each other for a week  hereward complained of torfrida what if torfrida should complain of hereward but to whom not to the coarse women round her her pride revolted from that thoughtand yet she longed for counsel for sympathyto open her heart but to one fellowwoman she would go to the lady godiva at crowland and take counsel of her whether there was any method for so she put it to herself of saving hereward for she saw but too clearly that he was fast forgetting all her teaching and falling back to a point lower than that even from which she had raised him up  to go to crowland was not difficult it was midwinter the dikes were all frozen hereward was out foraging in the lincolnshire wolds so torfrida taking advantage of his absence proposed another foraging party to crowland itself she wanted stuff for clothes needles thread what not a dozen stout fellows volunteered at once to take her the friendly monks of crowland would feast them royally and send them home heaped with all manner of good things while as for meeting ivo tailleboiss men if they had but three to one against them there was a fair chance of killing a few and carrying off their clothes and weapons which would be useful so they made a sledge tied beefbones underneath it put torfrida thereon well wrapped in deer and fox and badger skin and then putting on their skates swept her over the fen to crowland singing like larks along the dikes  and torfrida went in to godiva and wept upon her knees and godiva wept likewise and gave her such counsel as she couldhow if the woman will keep the men heroic she must keep herself not heroic only but devout likewise how she herself by that one deed which had rendered her name famous then and famous though she never dreamt thereof now and it may be to the end of timehad once for all tamed chained and as it were converted the heart of her fierce young lord and enabled her to train him in good time into the most wise most just most pious of all king edwards earls  and torfrida said yes and yes and yes and felt in her heart that she knew all that already had not she too taught entreated softened civilized had not she too spent her life upon a man and that man a wolfshead and a landless outlaw more utterly than godiva could ever have spent hers on one who lived lapped in luxury and wealth and power torfrida had done her best and she had failed or at least fancied in her haste that she had failed  what she wanted was not counsel but love and she clung round the lady godiva till the broken and ruined widow opened all her heart to her and took her in her arms and fondled her as if she had been a babe and the two women spoke few words after that for indeed there was nothing to be said only at last my child my child cried godiva better for thee body and soul to be here with me in the house of god than there amid evil spirits and deeds of darkness in the wild woods  not a cloister not a cloister cried torfrida shuddering and half struggling to get away  it is the only place poor wilful child the only place this side the grave in which we wretched creatures who for our sins are women born can find aught of rest or peace by us sin came into the world and eves curse lies heavy on us to this day and our desire is to our lords and they rule over us and when the slave can work for her master no more what better than to crawl into the house of god and lay down our crosses at the foot of his cross and die you too will come here torfrida some day i know it well you too will come here to rest  never never shrieked torfrida never to these horrid vaults i will die in the fresh air i will be buried under the green hollies and the nightingales as they wander up from my own provence shall build and sing over my grave never never murmured she to herself all the more eagerly because something within her said that it would come to pass  the two women went into the church to matins and prayed long and fervently and at the early daybreak the party went back laden with good things and hearty blessings and caught one of ivo tailleboiss men by the way and slew him and got off him a new suit of clothes in which the poor fellow was going courting and so they got home safe into the bruneswald  but torfrida had not found rest unto her soul for the first time in her life since she became the bride of hereward she had had a confidence concerning him and unknown to him it was to his own mothertrue and yet she felt as if she had betrayed him but then had he not betrayed her and to winter of all men  it might have been two months afterwards that martin lightfoot put a letter into torfridas hand  the letter was addressed to hereward but there was nothing strange in martins bringing it to his mistress ever since their marriage she had opened and generally answered the very few epistles with which her husband was troubled  she was going to open this one as a matter of course when glancing at the superscription she saw or fancied she saw that it was in a womans hand she looked at it again it was sealed plainly with a womans seal and she looked up at martin lightfoot she had remarked as he gave her the letter a sly significant look in his face  what doest thou know of this letter she inquired sharply  that it is from the countess alftruda whomsoever she may be  a chill struck through her heart true alftruda had written before only to warn hereward of danger to his lifeand hers she might be writing again only for the same purpose but still she did not wish that either hereward or she should owe alftruda their lives or anything they had struggled on through weal and woe without her for many a year let them do so without her still that alftruda had once loved hereward she knew well why should she not the wonder was to her that every woman did not love him but she had long since gauged alftrudas character and seen in it a persistence like her own yet as she proudly hoped of a lower temper the persistence of the base weasel not of the noble hound yet the creeping weasel might endure and win when the hound was tired out by his own gallant pace and there was a something in the tone of alftrudas last letter which seemed to tell her that the weasel was still upon the scent of its game but she was too proud to mistrust hereward or rather to seem to mistrust him and yethow dangerous alftruda might be as a rival if rival she choose to be she was up in the world now free rich gay beautiful a favorite at queen matildas court while she  how came this letter into thy hands asked she as carelessly as she could  i was in peterborough last night said martin concerning little matters of my own and there came to me in the street a bonny young page with smart jacket on his back smart cap on his head and smiles and bows and you are one of herewards men quoth he  say that again young jackanapes said i and ill cut your tongue out whereat he took fright and all but cried he was very sorry and meant no harm but he had a letter for my master and he heard i was one of his men  who told him that  well one of the monks he could not justly say which or wouldnt and i thinking the letter of more importance than my own neck ask him quietly into my friends house there he pulls out this and five silver pennies and i shall have five more if i bring an answer back but to none than hereward must i give it with that i calling my friend who is an honest woman and nigh as strong in the arms as i am ask her to clap her back against the door and pull out my axe  now said i i must know a little more about this letter tell me knave who gave it thee or ill split thy skull  the young man cries and blubbers and says that it is the countess alftruda who is staying in the monastery and that he is her serving man and that it is as much as my life is worth to touch a hair of his head and so forthso far so good  then i asked him again who told him i was my masters manand he confessed that it was herluin the priorhe that was lady godivas chaplain of old whom my master robbed of his money when he had the cell of bourne years agone very well quoth i to myself thats one more count on our score against master herluin then i asked him how herluin and the lady alftruda came to know aught of each other and he said that she had been questioning all about the monastery without abbot thorolds knowledge for one that knew hereward and favored him well that was all i could get from the knave he cried so for fright so i took his money and his letter warning him that if be betrayed me there were those would roast him alive before he was done with me and so away over the town wall and ran here fiveandtwenty miles before breakfast and thought it better as you see to give the letter to my lady first  you have been officious said torfrida coldly tis addressed to your master take it to him go  martin lightfoot whistled and obeyed while torfrida walked away proudly and silently with a beating heart  again godivas words came over her should she end in the convent of crowland and suspecting fearing imagining all sorts of baseless phantoms she hardened her heart into a great hardness  martin had gone with the letter and torfrida never heard any more of it  so hereward had secrets which he would not tell to her at last  that at least was a misery which she would not confide to lady godiva or to any soul on earth  but a misery it was such a misery as none can delineate save those who have endured it themselves or had it confided to them by another and happy are they to whom neither has befallen  she wandered on and into the wildwood and sat down by a spring she looked in ither only mirrorat her wan coarse face with wild black elflocks hanging round it and wondered whether alftruda in her luxury and prosperity was still so very beautiful ah that that fountain were the fountain of jouvence the spring of perpetual youth which all believed in those days to exist somewherehow would she plunge into it and be young and fair once more  no she would not she had lived her life and lived it well gallantly lovingly heroically she had given that man her youth her beauty her wealth her wit he should not have them a second time he had had his will of her if he chose to throw her away when he had done with her to prove himself base at last unworthy of all her care her counsels her trainingdreadful thought to have lived to keep that man for her own and just when her work seemed done to lose him no there was worse than that to have lived that she might make that man a perfect knight and just when her work seemed done to see him lose himself  and she wept till she could weep no more then she washed away her tears in that well had it been in greece of old that well would have become a sacred well thenceforth and torfridas tears have changed into forgetmenots and fringed its marge with azure evermore  then she went back calm all but cold but determined not to betray herself let him do what he would perhaps it was all a mistake a fancy at least she would not degrade him and herself by showing suspicion it would be dreadful shameful to herself wickedly unjust to him to accuse him were he innocent after all  hereward she remarked was more kind to her now but it was a kindness which she did not like it was shy faltering as of a man guilty and ashamed and she repelled it as much as she dared and then once or twice returned it passionately madly in hopes  but he never spoke a word of that letter  after a dreadful month martin came mysteriously to her again she trembled for she had remarked in him lately a strange change he had lost his usual loquacity and quaint humor and had fallen back into that sullen taciturnity which so she heard he had kept up in his youth he too must know evil which he dared not tell  there is another letter come it came last night said he  what is that to thee or me my lord has his state secrets is it for us to pry into them go  i thoughti thought  go i say  that your ladyship might wish for a guide to crowland  crowland almost shrieked torfrida for the thought of crowland had risen in her own wretched mind instantly and involuntarily go madman  martin went torfrida paced madly up and down the farmhouse then she settled herself into fierce despair  there was a noise of trampling horses outside the men were arming and saddling seemingly for a raid  hereward hurried in for his armor when he saw torfrida he blushed scarlet  you want your arms said she quietly let me fetch them  no never mind i can harness myself i am going southwest to pay taillebois a visit i am in a great hurry i shall be back in three days thengoodby  he snatched his arms off a perch and hurried out again dragging them on as he passed her he offered to kiss her she put him back and helped him on with his armor while he thanked her confusedly  he was as glad not to kiss me after all  she looked after him as he stood his hand on his horses withers how noble he looked and a great yearning came over her to throw her arms round his neck once and then to stab herself and set him free dying as she had lived for him  two bonny boys were wrestling on the lawn young outlaws who had grown up in the forest with ruddy cheeks and iron limbs  ah winter she heard him say had i had such a boy as that  she heard no more she turned away her heart dead within her she knew all that these words implied in days when the possession of land was everything to the free man and the possession of a son necessary to pass that land on in the ancestral line only to have a son only to prevent the old estate passing with an heiress into the hands of strangers what crimes did not men commit in those days and find themselves excused for them by public opinion and nowher other children if she ever had any had died in childhood the little torfrida named after herself was all that she had brought to hereward and he was the last of his house in him the race of leofric of godiva of earl oslac would become extinct and that girl would marrywhom whom but some french conqueroror at best some english outlaw in either case hereward would have no descendants for whom it was worth his while to labor or to fight what wonder if he longed for a sonand not a son of hers the barren treeto pass his name down to future generations it might be worth while for that to come in to the king to recover his lands toshe saw it all now and her heart was dead within her  she spent that evening neither eating nor drinking but sitting over the log embers her head upon her hands and thinking over all her past life and love since she saw him from the gable window ride the first time into st omer she went through it all with a certain stern delight in the selftorture deliberately day by day year by yearall its lofty aspirations all its blissful passages all its deep disappointments and found in itso she chose to fancy in the wilfulness of her misery nothing but cause for remorse self in all vanity and vexation of spirit for herself she had loved him for herself she had tried to raise him for herself she had set her heart on man and not on god she had sown the wind and behold she had reaped the whirlwind she could not repent she could not pray but oh that she could die  she was unjust to herself in her great nobleness it was not true not half not a tenth part true but perhaps it was good for her that it should seem true for that moment that she should be emptied of all earthly things for once if so she might be filled from above  at last she went into the inner room to lie down and try to sleep at her feet under the perch where herewards armor had hung lay an open letter  she picked it up surprised at seeing such a thing there and kneeling down held it eagerly to the wax candle which was on a spike at the beds head  she knew the handwriting in a moment it was alftrudas  this then was why hereward had been so strangely hurried he must have had that letter and dropped it  her eye and mind took it all in in one instant as the lightning flash reveals a whole landscape and then her mind became as dark as that landscape when the flash is past  it congratulated hereward on having shaken himself free from the fascination of that sorceress it said that all was settled with king william hereward was to come to winchester she had the kings writ for his safety ready to send to him the king would receive him as his liegeman alftruda would receive him as her husband archbishop lanfranc had made difficulties about the dissolution of the marriage with torfrida but gold would do all things at rome and lanfranc was her very good friend and a reasonable manand so forth  men and beasts likewise when stricken with a mortal wound will run and run on blindly aimless impelled by the mere instinct of escape from intolerable agony and so did torfrida half undrest as she was she fled forth into the forest she knew not whither running as one does wrapt in fire but the fire was not without her but within  she cast a passing glance at the girl who lay by her sleeping a pure and gentle sleep  o that thou hadst but been a boy then she thought no more of her not even of hereward but all of which she was conscious was a breast and brain bursting an intolerable choking from which she must escape  she ran and ran on for miles she knew not whether the night was light or dark warm or cold her tender feet might have been ankle deep in snow the branches over her head might have been howling in the tempest or dripping with rain she knew not and heeded not the owls hooted to each other under the staring moon but she heard them not the wolves glared at her from the brakes and slunk off appalled at the white ghostly figure but she saw them not the deer stood at gaze in the glades till she was close upon them and then bounded into the wood she ran right at them past them heedless she had but one thought to flee from the agony of a soul alone in the universe with its own misery  at last she was aware of a man close beside her he had been following her a long way she recollected now but she had not feared him even heeded him but when he laid his hand upon her arm she turned fiercely but without dread  she looked to see if it was hereward to meet him would be death if it were not he she cared not who it was it was not hereward and she cried angrily off off and hurried on  but you are going the wrong way the wrong way said the voice of martin lightfoot  the wrong way fool which is the right way for me save the path which leads to a land where all is forgotten  to crowland to crowland to the minster to the monks that is the only right way for poor wretches in a world like this the lady godiva told you you must go to crowland and now you are going i too i ran away from a monastery when i was young and now i am going back come along  you are right crowland crowland and a nuns cell till death which is the way martin  o a wise lady a reasonable lady but you will be cold before you get thither there will be a frost ere morn so when i saw you run out i caught up something to put over you  torfrida shuddered as martin wrapped her in the white bearskin  no not that anything but that and she struggled to shake it off  then you will be dead ere dawn folks that run wild in the forest thus for but one night die  would god i could die  that shall be as he wills you do not die while martin can keep you alive why you are staggering already  martin caught her up in his arms threw her over his shoulder as if she had been a child and hurried on in the strength of madness  at last he stopped at a cottage door set her down upon the turf and knocked loudly  grimkel tolison grimkel i say  and martin burst the door open with his foot  give me a horse on your life said he to the man inside i am martin herewards man upon my masters business  what is mine is herewards god bless him said the man struggling into a garment and hurrying out to the shed  there is a ghost against the gate cried he recoiling  that is my matter not yours get me a horse to put the ghost upon  torfrida lay against the gatepost exhausted now but quite unable to think martin lifted her on to the beast and led her onward holding her up again and again  you are tired you had run four miles before i could make you hear me  would i had run four thousand and she relapsed into stupor  they passed out of the forest across open wolds and at last down to the river martin knew of a boat there he lifted her from the horse turned him loose put torfrida into the boat and took the oars  she looked up and saw the roofs of bourne shining white in the moonlight  and then she lifted up her voice and shrieked three times            lost lost lost  with such a dreadful cry that the starlings whirred up from the reeds and the wildfowl rose clanging off the meres and the watchdogs in bourne and mainthorpe barked and howled and folk told fearfully next morning how a white ghost had gone down from the forest to the fen and wakened them with its unearthly cry  the sun was high when they came to crowland minster torfrida had neither spoken nor stirred and martin who in the midst of his madness kept a strange courtesy and delicacy had never disturbed her save to wrap the bearskin more closely over her  when they came to the bank she rose stepped out without his help and drawing the bearskin closely round her and over her head walked straight up to the gate of the house of nuns  all men wondered at the white ghost but martin walked behind her his left finger on his lips his right hand grasping his little axe with such a stern and serious face and so fierce an eye that all drew back in silence and let her pass  the portress looked through the wicket  i am torfrida said a voice of terrible calm i am come to see the lady godiva let me in  the portress opened utterly astounded  madam said martin eagerly as torfrida entered  what what she seemed to waken from a dream god bless thee thou good and faithful servant and she turned again  madam say  what  shall i go back and kill him and he held out the little axe  torfrida snatched it from his grasp with a shriek and cast it inside the convent door  mother mary and all saints cried the portress your garments are in rags madam  never mind bring me garments of yours i shall need none other till i die and she walked in and on  she is come to be a nun whispered the portress to the next sister and she again to the next and they all gabbled and lifted up their hands and eyes and thanked all the saints of the calendar over the blessed and miraculous conversion of the lady torfrida and the wealth which she would probably bring to the convent  torfrida went straight on speaking to no one not even to the prioress and into lady godivas chamber  there she dropped at the countesss feet and laid her head upon her knees  i am come as you always told me i should do but it has been a long way hither and i am very tired  my child what is this what brings you here  i am doing penance for my sins  and your feet all cut and bleeding  are they said torfrida vacantly i will tell you all about it when i wake  and she fell fast asleep with her head in godivas lap  the countess did not speak or stir she beckoned the good prioress who had followed torfrida in to go away she saw that something dreadful had happened and prayed as she awaited the news  torfrida slept for a full hour then she woke with a start  where am i hereward  then followed a dreadful shriek which made every nun in that quiet house shudder and thank god that she knew nothing of those agonies of soul which were the lot of the foolish virgins who married and were given in marriage themselves instead of waiting with oil in their lamps for the true bridegroom  i recollect all now said torfrida listen and she told the countess all with speech so calm and clear that godiva was awed by the power and spirit of that marvellous woman  but she groaned in bitterness of soul anything but this rather death from him than treachery this last worst woe had god kept in his quiver for me most miserable of women and now his bolt has fallen hereward hereward that thy mother should wish her last child laid in his grave  not so said torfrida it is well as it is how better it is his only chance for comfort for honor for life itself he would have grown ai was growing bad and foul myself in that ugly wilderness now he will be a knight once more among knights and win himself fresh honor in fresh fields let him marry her why not he can get a dispensation from the pope and then there will be no sin in it you know if the holy father cannot make wrong right who can yes it is very well as it is and i am very well where i am women bring me scissors and one of your nuns dresses i am come to be a nun like you  godiva would have stopped her but torfrida rose upon her knees and calmly made a solemn vow which though canonically void without her husbands consent would she well knew never be disputed by any there and as for himhe has lost me and forever torfrida never gives herself away twice  theres carnal pride in those words my poor child said godiva  cruel said she proudly when i am sacrificing myself utterly for him  and thy poor girl  he will let her come hither said torfrida with forced calm he will see that it is not fit that she should grow up withyes he will send her to meto us and i shall live for herand for you if you will let me be your bower woman dress you serve you read to you you know that i am a pretty scholar you will let me mother i may call you mother may i not and torfrida fondled the old womans thin hands for i do want so much something to love  love thy heavenly bridegroom the only love worthy of woman said godiva as her tears fell fast on torfridas head  she gave a halfimpatient toss  that may come in good time as yet it is enough to do if i can keep down this devil here in my throat women bring me the scissors  and torfrida cut off her raven locks now streaked with gray and put on the nuns dress and became a nun thenceforth  on the second day there came to crowland leofric the priest and with him the poor child  she had woke in the morning and found no mother leofric and the other men searched the woods round far and wide the girl mounted her horse and would go with them then they took a bloodhound and he led them to grimkels hut there they heard of martin the ghost must have been torfrida then the hound brought them to the river and they divined at once that she was gone to crowland to godiva but why they could not guess  then the girl insisted prayed at last commanded them to take her to crowland and to crowland they came  leofric left the girl at the nuns house door and went into the monastery where he had friends enow runaway and renegade as he was as he came into the great court whom should he meet but martin lightfoot in a lay brothers frock  aha and are you come home likewise have you renounced the devil and this last work of his  what work what devil asked leofric who saw method in martins madness and what do you here in a long frock  devil hereward the devil i would have killed him with my axe but she got it from me and threw it in among the holy sisters and i had work to get it again shame on her to spoil my chance of heaven for i should have surely won heaven you know if i had killed the devil  after much beating about leofric got from martin the whole tragedy  and when he heard it he burst out weeping  o hereward hereward o knightly honor o faith and troth and gratitude and love in return for such love as might have tamed lions and made tyrants mild are they all carnal vanities works of the weak flesh bruised reeds which break when they are leaned upon if so you are right martin and there is naught left but to flee from a world in which all men are liars  and leofric in the midst of crowland yard tore off his belt and trusty sword his hauberk and helm also and letting down his monks frock which he wore trussed to the midknee he went to the abbots lodgings and asked to see old ulfketyl  bring him up said the good abbot for he is a valiant man and true in spite of all his vanities and may be he brings news of hereward whom god forgive  and when leofric came in he fell upon his knees bewailing and confessing his sinful life and begged the abbot to take him back again into crowland minster and lay upon him what penance he thought fit and put him in the lowest office because he was a man of blood if only he might stay there and have a sight at times of his dear lady torfrida without whom he should surely die  so leofric was received back in full chapter by abbot and prior and all the monks but when he asked them to lay a penance upon him ulfketyl arose from his high chair and spoke  shall we who have sat here at ease lay a penance on this man who has shed his blood in fifty valiant fights for us and for st guthlac and for this english land look at yon scars upon his head and arms he has had sharper discipline from cold steel than we could give him here with rod and has fasted in the wilderness more sorely many a time than we have fasted here  and all the monks agreed that no penance should be laid on leofric only that he should abstain from singing vain and carnal ballads which turned the heads of the young brothers and made them dream of naught but battles and giants and enchanters and ladies love  hereward came back on the third day and found his wife and daughter gone his guilty conscience told him in the first instant why for he went into the chamber and there upon the floor lay the letter which he had looked for in vain  no one had touched it where it lay perhaps no one had dared to enter the chamber if they had they would not have dared to meddle with writing which they could not read and which might contain some magic spell letters were very safe in those old days  there are moods of man which no one will dare to describe unless like shakespeare he is shakespeare and like shakespeare knows it not  therefore what hereward thought and felt will not be told what he did was this  he raged and blustered he must hide his shame he must justify himself to his knights and much more to himself or if not justify himself must shift some of the blame over to the opposite side so he raged and blustered he had been robbed of his wife and daughter they had been cajoled away by the monks of crowland what villains were those to rob an honest man of his family while he was fighting for his country  so he rode down to the river and there took two great barges and rowed away to crowland with forty menatarms  and all the while he thought of alftruda as he hai seen her at peterborough  and of no one else  not so for all the while he felt that he loved torfridas little finger better than alftrudas whole body and soul into the bargain  what a long way it was to crowland how wearying were the hours through mere and sea how wearying the monotonous pulse of the oars if tobacco had been known then hereward would have smoked all the way and been none the wiser though the happier for it for the herb that drives away the evil spirits of anxiety drives away also the good though stern spirits of remorse  but in those days a man could only escape facts by drinking and hereward was too much afraid of what he should meet in crowland to go thither drunk  sometimes he hoped that torfrida might hold her purpose and set him free to follow his wicked will all the lower nature in him so long crushed under leapt up chuckling and grinning and tumbling head over heels and criednow i shall have a holiday  sometimes he hoped that torfrida might come out to the shore and settle the matter in one moment by a glance of her great hawks eyes if she would but quell him by one look leap on board seize the helm and assume without a word the command of his men and him steer them back to bourne and sit down beside him with a kiss as if nothing had happened if she would but do that and ignore the past would he not ignore it would he not forget alftruda and king william and all the world and go up with her into sherwood and then north to scotland and gospatrick and be a man once more  no he would go with her to the baltic or the mediterranean constantinople and the varangers would be the place and the men ay there to escape out of that charmed ring into a new life  no he did not deserve such luck and he would not get it  she would talk it all out she must for she was a woman  she would blame argue say dreadful wordsdreadful because true and deserved then she would grow angry as women do when they are most in the right and say too muchdreadful words which would be untrue and undeserved then he should resist recriminate he would not stand it he could not stand it no he could never face her again  and yet if he had seen a man insult herif he had seen her at that moment in peril of the slightest danger the slightest bruise he would have rushed forward like a madman and died saving her from that bruise and he knew that and with the strange selfcontradiction of human nature he soothed his own conscience by the thought that he loved her still and that thereforesomehow or other he cared not to make out howhe had done her no wrong then he blustered again for the benefit of his men he would teach these monks of crowland a lesson he would burn the minster over their heads  that would be pity seeing they are the only englishmen left in england said siward the white his nephew very simply  what is that to thee thou hast helped to burn peterborough at my bidding and thou shalt help to burn crowland  i am a free gentleman of england and what i choose i do i and my brother are going to constantinople to join the varanger guard and shall not burn crowland or let any man burn it  shall not let  no said the young man so quietly that hereward was cowed  ii only meantif they did not do right by me  do right thyself said siward  hereward swore awfully and laid his hand on his swordhilt but he did not draw it for he thought he saw overhead a cloud which was very like the figure of st guthlac in crowland window and an awe fell upon him from above  so they came to crowland and hereward landed and beat upon the gates and spoke high words but the monks did not open the gates for a while at last the gates creaked and opened and in the gateway stood abbot ulfketyl in his robes of state and behind him prior and all the officers and all the monks of the house  comes hereward in peace or in war  in war said hereward  then that true and trusty old man who sealed his patriotism if not with his bloodfor the very normans had not the heart to take thatstill with long and bitter sorrows lifted up his head and said like a valiant dane as his name bespoke him against the traitor and the adulterer  i am neither roared hereward  thou wouldst be if thou couldst whoso looketh upon a woman to  preach me no sermons man let me in to seek my wife  over my body said ulfketyl and laid himself down across the threshold  hereward recoiled if he had dared to step over that sacred body there was not a bloodstained ruffian in his crew who dared to follow him  rise rise for gods sake lord abbot said he whatever i am i need not that you should disgrace me thus only let me see herreason with her  she has vowed herself to god and is none of thine hence forth  it is against the canons a wrong and a robbery  ulfketyl rose grand as ever  hereward leofricsson our joy and our glory once hearken to the old man who will soon go whither thine uncle brand is gone and be free of frenchmen and of all this wicked world when the walls of crowland dare not shelter the wronged woman fleeing from mans treason to gods faithfulness then let the roofs of crowland burn till the flame reaches heaven for a sign that the children of god are as false as the children of this world and break their faith like any belted knight  hereward was silenced his men shrunk back from him he felt as if god and the mother of god and st guthlac and all the host of heaven were shrinking back from him likewise he turned to supplications compromiseswhat else was left  at least you will let me have speech of her or of my mother  they must answer that not i  hereward sent in entreating to see one or both  tell him said lady godiva who calls himself my son that my sons were men of honor and that he must have been changed at nurse  tell him said torfrida that i have lived my life and am dead dead if he would see me he will only see my corpse  you would not slay yourself  what is there that i dare not do you do not know torfrida he does  and hereward did and went back again like a man stunned  after a while there came by boat to crowland all torfridas wealth clothes jewels not a shred had hereward kept the magic armor came with them  torfrida gave all to the abbey there and then only the armor she wrapped up in the white bears skin and sent it back to hereward with her blessing and entreaty not to refuse that her last bequest  hereward did not refuse for very shame but for very shame he never wore that armor more for very shame he never slept again upon the white bears skin on which he and his true love had lain so many a year  and torfrida turned herself utterly to serve the lady godiva and to teach and train her child as she had never done before while she had to love hereward and to work day and night with her own fingers for all his men all pride all fierceness all care of self had passed away from her in penitence humility obedience and gentleness she went on never smiling but never weeping her heart was broken and she felt it good for herself to let it break  and leofric the priest and mad martin lightfoot watched like two dogs for her going out and coming in and when she went among the poor corrodiers and nursed the sick and taught the children and went to and fro upon her holy errands blessing and blessed the two wild men had a word from her mouth or a kiss of her hand and were happy all the day after for they loved her with a love mightier than ever hereward had heaped upon her for she had given him all but she had given those two wild men naught but the beatific vision of a noble woman     chapter xxxvii  how hereward lost sword brainbiter   on account of which says the chronicler many troubles came to hereward because torfrida was most wise and of great counsel in need for afterwards as he himself confessed things went not so well with him as they did in her time  and the first thing that went ill was this he was riding through the bruneswald and behind him geri wenoch and matelgar these three and there met him in an open glade a knight the biggest man he had ever seen on the biggest horse and five knights behind him he was an englishman and not a frenchman by his dress and hereward spoke courteously enough to him but who he was and what his business was in the bruneswald hereward thought that he had a right to ask  tell me who thou art who askest before i tell thee who i am who am asked riding here on common land quoth the knight surlily enough  i am hereward without whose leave no man has ridden the bruneswald for many a day  and i am letwold the englishman who rides whither he will in merry england without care for any frenchman upon earth  frenchman why callest thou me frenchman man i am hereward  then thou art if tales be true as french as ivo taillebois i hear that thou hast left thy true lady like a fool and a churl and goest to london or winchester or the nether piti care not whichto make thy peace with the mamzer  the man was a surly brute but what he said was so true that herewards wrath arose he had promised torfrida many a time never to quarrel with an englishman but to endure all things now out of very spite to torfridas counsel because it was torfridas and he had promised to obey it he took up the quarrel  if i am a fool and a churl thou art a greater fool to provoke thine own death and a greater  spare your breath said the big man and let me try hereward as i have many another  whereon they dropped their lancepoints and rode at each other like two mad bulls and by the contagion of folly common in the middle age at each other rode herewards three knights and letwolds five the two leaders found themselves both rolling on the ground jumped up drew their swords and hewed away at each other geri unhorsed his man at the first charge and left him stunned then he turned on another and did the same by him wenoch and matelgar each upset their man the fifth of letwolds knights threw up his lancepoint not liking his new company geri and the other two rode in on the two chiefs who were fighting hard each under shield  stand back roared hereward and give the knight fair play when did any one of us want a man to help him kill or die single has been our rule and shall be  they threw up their lancepoints and stood round to see that great fight letwolds knight rode in among them and stood likewise and friend and foe looked on as they might at a pair of gamecocks  hereward had to his own surprise and that of his fellows met his match the sparks flew the iron clanged but so heavy were the strangers strokes that hereward reeled again and again so sure was the guard of his shield that hereward could not wound him hit where he would at last he dealt a furious blow on the strangers head  if that does not bring your master down quoth geri by brainbiter is gone  it was too true sword brainbiters end was come the ogres magic blade had snapt off short by the handle  your master is a true englishman by the hardness of his brains quoth wenoch as the stranger reeling for a moment lifted up his head and stared at hereward in the face doubtful what to do  will you yield or fight on cried he  yield shouted hereward rushing upon him as a mastiff might on a lion and striking at his helm though shorter than him by a head and shoulders such swift and terrible blows with the broken hilt as staggered the tall stranger  what are you at forgetting what you have at your side roared geri  hereward sprang back he had as was his custom a second sword on his right thigh  i forget everything now said he to himself angrily  and that was too true but he drew the second sword and sprang at his man once more  the stranger tried according to the chronicler who probably had it from one of the three bystanders a blow which has cost many a brave man his life he struck right down on herewards head hereward raised his shield warding the stroke and threw in that coup de jarret which there is no guarding after the downright blow has been given the stranger dropped upon his wounded knee  yield cried hereward in his turn  that is not my fashion and the stranger fought on upon his stumps like witherington in chevy chase  hereward mad with the sight of blood struck at him four or five times the strangers shield was so quick that he could not hit him even on his knee he held his hand and drew back looking at his new rival  what the murrain are we two fighting about said he at last  i know not neither care said the other with a grim chuckle but if any man will fight me him i fight ever since i had beard to my chin  thou art the best man that ever i faced  that is like enough  what wilt thou take if i give thee thy life  my way on which i was going for i turn back for no man alive on land  then thou hast not had enough of me  not by another hour  thou must be born of fiend and not of man  very like it is a wise son knows his own father  hereward burst out laughing  would to heaven i had had thee for my man this three years since  perhaps i would not have been thy man  why not  because i have been my own man ever since i was born and am well content with myself for my master  shall i bind up thy leg asked hereward having no more to say and not wishing to kill the man  no it will grow again like a crabs claw  thou art a fiend and hereward turned away sulky and half afraid  very like no man knows what a devil he is till he tries  what dost mean and hereward turned angrily back  fiends we are all till gods grace comes  little grace has come to thee yet by thy ungracious tongue  rough to men may be gracious to women  what hast thou to do with women asked hereward fiercely  i have a wife and i love her  thou art not like to get back to her today  i fear not with this paltry scratch i had looked for a cut from thee would have saved me all fighting henceforth  what dost mean asked hereward with an oath  that my wife is in heaven and i would needs follow her  hereward got on his horse and rode away never could he find out who that sir letwold was or how he came into the bruneswald all he knew was that he never had had such a fight since he wore beard and that he had lost sword brainbiter from which his evil conscience augured that his luck had turned and that he should lose many things beside     chapter xxxviii  how hereward came in to the king   after these things hereward summoned all his men and set before them the hopelessness of any further resistance and the promises of amnesty lands and honors which william had offered him and persuaded themand indeed he had good arguments enough and to sparethat they should go and make their peace with the king  they were so accustomed to look up to his determination that when it gave way theirs gave way likewise they were so accustomed to trust his wisdom that most of them yielded at once to his arguments that the band should break up all agreed a few of the more suspicious or more desperate said that they could never trust the norman that hereward himself had warned them again and again of his treachery that he was now going to do himself what he had laughed at gospatrick and the rest for doing what had brought ruin on edwin and morcar what he had again and again prophesied would bring ruin on waltheof himself ere all was over  but hereward was deaf to their arguments he had said as little to them as he could about alftruda for very shame but he was utterly besotted on her for her sake he had determined to run his head blindly into the very snare of which he had warned others and he had searedso he fanciedhis conscience it was torfridas fault now not his if she left himif she herself freed him of her own willwhy he was free and there was no more to be said about it  and hereward says the chronicler took gwenoch geri and matelgar and rode south to the king  where were the two young siwards it is not said probably they and a few desperadoes followed the fashion of so many english in those sad dayswhen as sings the norse scald     cold heart and bloody hand     now rule english land  and took ship for constantinople and enlisted in the varanger guard and died full of years and honors leaving fairhaired children behind them to become varangers in their turn  be that as it may hereward rode south but when he had gotten a long way upon the road a fancy says the chronicler came over him he was not going in pomp and glory enough it seemed mean for the once great hereward to sneak into winchester with three knights perhaps it seemed not over safe for the once great hereward to travel with only three knights so he went back all the way to camp and took says the chronicler forty most famous knights all big and tall of stature and splendidif from nothing else from their looks and their harness alone  so hereward and those forty knights rode down from peterborough along the roman road for the roman roads were then and for centuries after the only roads in this land and our forefathers looked on them as the work of gods and giants and called them after the names of their old gods and heroesirmen street watling street and so forth  and then like true englishmen our own forefathers showed their respect for the said divine works not by copying them but by picking them to pieces to pave every man his own courtyard be it so the neglect of new roads the destruction of the old ones was a natural evil consequence of local selfgovernment a cheap price perhaps after all to pay for that power of local selfgovernment which has kept england free unto this day  be that as it may down the roman road hereward went past alconbury hill of the old posting days past wimpole park then deep forest past hatfield then deep forest likewise and so to st albans and there they lodged in the minster for the monks thereof were good english and sang masses daily for king harolds soul and the next day they went south by ways which are not so clear  just outside st albansverulamium of the romans the ruins whereof were believed to be full of ghosts demons and magic treasuresthey turned at st stephens to the left off the roman road to london and by another roman road struck into the vast forest which ringed london round from northeast to southwest following the upper waters of the colne which ran through the woods on their left they came to watford and then turned probably to rickmansworth no longer on the roman paved ways they followed horsetracks between the forest and the rich marshmeadows of the colne as far as denham and then struck into a roman road again at the north end of langley park from thence over heathy commonsfor that western part of buckinghamshire its soil being light and some gravel was little cultivated then and hardly all cultivated nowthey held on straight by langley town into the vale of thames  little they dreamed as they rode down by ditton green off the heathy commons past the poor scattered farms on to the vast rushy meadows while upon them was the dull weight of disappointment shame all but despair their race enslaved their country a prey to strangers and all its future like their own a lurid blanklittle they dreamed of what that vale would be within eight hundred yearsthe eye of england and it may be of the world a spot which owns more wealth and peace more art and civilization more beauty and more virtue it may be than any of gods gardens which make fair this earth windsor on its crowned steep was to them but a new hunting palace of the old miraclemonger edward who had just ruined england runnymede a mile below them down the broad stream was but a horsefen fringed with waterlilies where the men of wessex had met of old to counsel and to bring the country to this pass and as they crossed by ford or ferryboat the shallows of old windsor whither they had been tending all along and struck into the moorlands of wessex itself they were as men going into an unknown wilderness behind them ruin and before them unknown danger  on through windsor forest edward the saints old huntingground its bottoms choked with beech and oak and birch and alder scrub its upper lands vast flats of level heath along the great trackway which runs along the lower side of chobham camp some quarter of a mile broad every rut and trackway as fresh at this day as when the ancient briton finding that his neighbors essedumchariot or rather carthad worn the ruts too deep struck out a fresh wandering line for himself across the dreary heath  over the blackwater by sandhurst and along the flats of hartford bridge where the old furzegrown ruts show the trackway to this day down into the clayland forests of the andredsweald and up out of them again at basing on to the clean crisp chalk turf to strike at popham lane the roman road from silchester and hold it over the high downs till they saw far below them the royal city of winchester  itchen silver as they looked on her from above but when they came down to her so clear that none could see where water ended and where air began hurried through the city in many a stream beyond it rose the white camp the venta belgarum the circular earthwork of white chalk on the high down within the city rose the ancient minster church built by ethelwoldancient even thenwhere slept the ancient kings kennulf egbert and ethelwulf the saxons and by them the danes canute the great and hardicanute his son and norman emma his wife and ethelreds before him and the great earl godwin who seemed to hereward to have died not twenty but two hundred years agoand it may be an old saxon hall upon the little isle whither edgar had bidden bring the heads of all the wolves in wessex where afterwards the bishops built wolvesey palace but nearer to them on the down which sloped up to the west stood an uglier thing which they saw with curses deep and loudthe keep of the new norman castle by the west gate  hereward halted his knights upon the down outside the northern gate then he rode forward himself the gate was open wide but he did not care to go in  so he rode into the gateway and smote upon that gate with his lancebut but the porter saw the knights upon the down and was afraid to come out for he feared treason  then hereward smote a second time but the porter did not come out  then he took the lance by the shaft and smote a third time and he smote so hard that the lancebut flew to flinders against winchester gate  and at that started out two knights who had come down from the castle seeing the meinie on the down and asked  who art thou who knockest here so bold  who i am any man can see by those splinters if he knows what men are left in england this day  the knights looked at the broken wood and then at each other who could the man be who could beat an ash stave to flinders at a single blow  you are young and do not know me and no shame to you go and tell william the king that hereward is come to put his hands between the kings and be the kings man henceforth  you are hereward asked one half awed half disbelieving at herewards short stature  you arei know not who pick up those splinters and take them to king william and say the man who broke that lance against the gate is here to make his peace with thee and he will know who i am  and so cowed were these two knights with herewards royal voice and royal eye and royal strength that they went simply and did what he bade them  and when king william saw the splinters he was as joyful as man could be and said  send him to me and tell him bright shines the sun to me that lights hereward into winchester  but lord king he has with him a meinie of full forty knights  so much the better i shall have the more valiant englishmen to help my valiant french  so hereward rode round outside the walls to williams new entrenched palace outside the west gate by the castle  and then hereward went in and knelt before the norman and put his hands between williams hands and swore to be his man  i have kept my word said he which i sent to thee at rouen seven years agone thou art king of all england and i am the last man to say so  and since thou hast said it i am king indeed come with me and dine and tomorrow i will see thy knights  and william walked out of the hall leaning on herewards shoulder at which all the normans gnashed their teeth with envy  and for my knights lord king thine and mine will mix for a while yet like oil and water and i fear lest there be murder done between them  likely enough  so the knights were bestowed in a vill near by and the next day the venerable king himself went forth to see those knights and caused them to stand and march before him both with arms and without with whom being much delighted he praised them congratulating them on their beauty and stature and saying that they must all be knights of fame in war after which hereward sent them all home except two and waited till he should marry alftruda and get back his heritage  and when that happens said william why should we not have two weddings beausire as well as one i hear that you have in crowland a fair daughter and marriageable  hereward bowed  and i have found a husband for her suitable to her years and who may conduce to your peace and serenity  hereward bit his lip to refuse was impossible in those days but  i trust that your grace has found a knight of higher lineage than him whom after so many honors you honored with the hand of my niece  william laughed it was not his interest to quarrel with hereward aha ivo the woodcutters son i ask your pardon for that sir hereward had you been my man then as you are now it might have been different  if a king ask my pardon i can only ask his in return  you must be friends with taillebois he is a brave knight and a wise warrior  none ever doubted that  and to cover any little blots in his escutcheon i have made him an earl as i may make you some day  your majesty like a true king knows how to reward who is this knight whom you have chosen for my lass  sir hugh of evermue a neighbor of yours and a man of blood and breeding  i know him and his lineage and it is very well i humbly thank your majesty  can i be the same man said hereward to himself bitterly  and he was not the same man he was besotted on alftruda and humbled himself accordingly     chapter xxxix  how torfrida confessed that she had been inspired by the devil   after a few days there came down a priest to crowland and talked with torfrida in archbishop lanfrancs name  whether lanfranc sent him or merely as is probable alftruda he could not have come in a more fit name torfrida knew with all the world how lanfranc had arranged william the normans uncanonical marriage with the pope by help of archdeacon hildebrand afterwards pope himself and had changed his mind deftly to williams side when he saw that william might be useful to holy church and could enslave if duly managed not only the nation of england to himself but the clergy of england to rome all this torfrida and the world knew and therefore she answered  lanfranc i can hardly credit you for i hear that he is a good man though hard but he has settled a queens marriage suit so he may very well settle mine  after which they talked together and she answered him the priest said so wisely and well that he never had met with a woman of so clear a brain or of so stout a heart  at last being puzzled to get that which he wanted he touched on the matter of her marriage with hereward  she wished it he said dissolved she wished herself to enter religion  archbishop lanfranc would be most happy to sanction so holy a desire but there were objections she was a married woman and her husband had not given his consent  let him give it then  there were still objections he had nothing to bring against her which could justify the dissolution of the holy bond unless  unless i bring some myself  there have been rumorsi say not how trueof magic and sorcery  torfrida leaped up from her seat and laughed such a laugh that the priest said in after years it rung through his head as if it had arisen out of the pit of the lost  so that is what you want churchman then you shall have it bring me pen and ink i need not to confess to you you shall read my confession when it is done i am a better scribe mind you than any clerk between here and paris  she seized the pen and ink and wrote not fiercely as the priest expected but slowly and carefully then she gave it the priest to read  will that do churchman will that free my soul and that of your french archbishop  and the priest read to himself  how torfrida of st omer born at aries in provence confest that from her youth up she had been given to the practice of diabolic arts and had at divers times and places used the same both alone and with richilda late countess of hainault how wickedly wantonly and instinct with a malignant spirit she had compassed by charms and spells to win the love of hereward how she had ever since kept in bondage him and others whom she had not loved with the same carnal love but only desired to make them useful to her own desire of power and glory by the same magical arts for which she now humbly begged pardon of holy church and of all christian folk and penetrated with compunction desired only that she might retire into the convent of crowland she asserted the marriage which she had so unlawfully compassed to be null and void and prayed to be released therefrom as a burden to her conscience and soul that she might spend the rest of her life in penitence for her many enormous sins she submitted herself to the judgment of holy church only begging that this her free confession might be counted in her favor and that she might hot be put to death as she deserved nor sent into perpetual imprisonment because her motherinlaw according to the flesh the countess godiva being old and infirm had daily need of her and she wished to serve her menially as long as she lived after which she put herself utterly upon the judgment of the church and meanwhile she desired and prayed that she might be allowed to remain at large in the said monastery of crowland not leaving the precincts thereof without special leave given by the abbot and prioress in one case between her and them reserved to wear garments of haircloth to fast all the year on bread and water and to be disciplined with rods or otherwise at such times as the prioress should command and to such degree as her body softened with carnal luxury could reasonably endure and beyondthat being dead to the world god might have mercy on her soul  and she meant what she said the madness of remorse and disappointment so common in the wild middle age had come over her and with it the twin madness of selftorture  the priest read and trembled not for torfrida but for himself lest she should enchant him after all  she must have been an awful sinner said he to the monks when he got safe out of the room comparable only to the witch of endor or the woman jezebel of whom st john writes in the revelations  i do not know how you frenchmen measure folks when you see them but to our mind she isfor goodness humility and patience comparable only to an angel of god said abbot ulfketyl  you englishmen will have to change your minds on many points if you mean to stay here  we shall not change them and we shall stay here quoth the abbot  how you will not get sweyn and his danes to help you a second time  no we shall all die and give you your wills and you will not have the heart to cast our bones into the fens  not unless you intend to work miracles and set up for saints like your alphege edmund  heaven forbid that we should compare ourselves with them only let us alone till we die  if you let us alone and do not turn traitor meanwhile  abbot ulfketyl bit his lip and kept down the rising fiend  and now said the priest deliver me over torfrida the younger daughter of hereward and this woman that i may take her to the king who has found a fit husband for her  you will hardly get her  not get her  not without her mothers consent the lass cares for naught but her  pish that sorceress send for the girl  abbot ulfketyl forced in his own abbey great and august lord though he was to obey any upstart of a norman priest who came backed by the king and lanfranc sent for the lass  the young outlaw came inhawk on fist and its hood off for it was a petshort sturdy upright brownhaired blueeyed illdressed with hard hands and sunburnt face but with the hawkeye of her father and her mother and the hawks among which she was bred she looked the priest over from head to foot till he was abashed  a frenchman said she and she said no more  the priest looked at her eyes and then at the hawks eyes they were disagreeably like each other he told his errand as courteously as he could for he was not a badhearted man for a norman priest  the lass laughed him to scorn the kings commands she never saw a king in the greenwood and cared for none there was no king in england now since sweyn ulfsson sailed back to denmark who was this norman william to sell a free english lass like a colt or a cow the priest might go back to the slaves of wessex and command them if he could but in the fens men were free and lasses too  the priest was piously shocked and indignant and began to argue  she played with her hawk instead of listening and then was marching out of the room  your mother said he is a sorceress  you are a knave or set on by knaves you lie and you know you lie and she turned away again  she has confessed it  you have driven her mad between you till she will confess anything i presume you threatened to burn her as some of you did awhile back and the young lady made use of words equally strong and true  the priest was not accustomed to the direct language of the greenwood and indignant on his own account threatened and finally offered to use force whereon there looked up into his face such a demon so he said as he never had seen or dreamed of and said  if you lay a finger on me i will brittle you like any deer and therewith pulled out a sayingknife about half as long again as the said priests hand being very sharp so he deposed down the whole length of one edge and likewise down his little fingers length of the other  not being versed in the terms of english venery he asked abbot ulfketyl what brittling of a deer might mean and being informed that it was that operation on the carcass of a stag which his countrymen called eventrer and highland gillies now gralloching he subsided and thought it best to go and consult the young ladys mother  she to his astonishment submitted at once and utterly the king and he whom she had called her husband were very gracious it was all well she would have preferred and the lady godiva too after their experience of the world and the flesh to have devoted her daughter to heaven in the minster there but she was unworthy who was she to train a bride for him who died on cross she accepted this as part of her penance with thankfulness and humility she had heard that sir hugh of evermue was a gentleman of ancient birth and good prowess and she thanked the king for his choice let the priest tell her daughter that she commanded her to go with him to winchester she did not wish to see her she was stained with many crimes and unworthy to approach a pure maiden besides it would only cause misery and tears she was trying to die to the world and to the flesh and she did not wish to reawaken their power within her yes it was very well let the lass go with him  thou art indeed a true penitent said the priest his human heart softening him  thou art very much mistaken said she and turned away  the girl when she heard her mothers command wept shrieked and went at least she was going to her father and from wholesome fear of that same sayingknife the priest left her in peace all the way to winchester  after which abbot ulfketyl went into his lodgings and burst like a noble old nobleman as he was into bitter tears of rage and shame  but torfridas eyes were as dry as her own sackcloth  the priest took the letter back to winchester and showed itit may be to archbishop lanfranc but what he said this chronicler would not dare to say for he was a very wise man and a very stanch and strong pillar of the holy roman church meanwhile he was man enough not to require that anything should be added to torfridas penance and that was enough to prove him a man in those daysat least for a churchmanas it proved archbishop or st ailred to be a few years after in the case of the nun of watton to be read in gales scriptores anglicaniae then he showed the letter to alftruda  and she laughed one of her laughs and said i have her at last  then as it befell he was forced to shew the letter to queen matilda and she wept over it human tears such as she the noble heart had been forced to keep many a time before and said the poor soulyou alftruda woman does hereward know of this  no madam said alftruda not adding that she had taken good care that he should not know  it is the best thing which i have heard of him i should tell him were it not that i must not meddle with my lords plans god grant him a good delivery as they say of the poor souls in jail well madam you have your will at last god give you grace thereof for you have not given him much chance as yet  your majesty will honor us by coming to the wedding asked alftruda utterly unabashed  matilda the good looked at her with a face of such calm childlike astonishment that alftruda dropped her fairy neck at last and slunk out of the presence like a beaten cur  william went to the wedding and swore horrible oaths that they were the handsomest pair he had ever seen and so hereward married alftruda how holy church settled the matter is not said but that hereward married alftruda under these very circumstances may be considered a historic fact being vouched for by gaimar and by the peterborough chronicler and doubtless holy church contrived that it should happen without sin if it conduced to her own interest  and little torfridathen it seems some sixteen years of agewas married to hugh of evermue she wept and struggled as she was dragged into the church  but i do not want to be married i want to go back to my mother  the diabolic instinct may have descended to her said the priests and attracts her to the sorceress we had best sprinkle her with holy water  so they sprinkled her with holy water and used exorcisms indeed the case being an important one the personages of rank they brought out from their treasures the apron of a certain virgin saint and put it round her neck in hopes of driving out the hereditary fiend  if i am led with a halter i must needs go said she with one of her mothers own flashes of wit and went but lady alftruda whispered she halfway up the church i never loved him  behave yourself before the king or i will whip you till the blood runs  and so she would and no one would have wondered in those days  i will murder you if you do but i never even saw him  little fool and what are you going through but what i went through before you  you to say that gnashed the girl as another spark of her mothers came out and you gaining what  what i waited for for fifteen years said alftruda coolly if you have courage and cunning like me to wait for fifteen years you too may have your will likewise  the pure child shuddered and was married to hugh of evermue who is not said to have kicked her and was according to them of crowland a good friend to their monastery and therefore doubtless a good man once says wicked report he offered to strike her as was the fashion in those chivalrous days whereon she turned upon him like a tigress and bidding him remember that she was the daughter of hereward and torfrida gave him such a beating that he not wishing to draw sword upon her surrendered at discretion and they lived all their lives afterwards as happily as most other married people in those times     chapter xl  how hereward began to get his souls price   and now behold hereward at home again fat with the wages of sin and not knowing that they are death  he is once more dominus de brunune cum marisco lord of bourne with the fen with all returns and liberties and all other things adjacent to the same vill which are now held as a barony from the lord king of england he has a fair young wife and with her farms and manors even richer than his own he is still young hearty wise by experience high in the kings favor and deservedly so  why should he not begin life again  why not unless it be true that the wages of sin are not a new life but death  and yet he has his troubles hardly a norman knight or baron round but has a bloodfeud against him for a kinsman slain sir aswart thorold the abbots man was not likely to forgive him for turning him out of the three mainthorpe manors which he had comfortably held for two years past and sending him back to lounge in the abbots hall at peterborough without a yard of land he could call his own sir ascelin was not likely to forgive him for marrying alftruda whom he had intended to marry himself ivo taillebois was not likely to forgive him for existing within a hundred miles of spalding any more than the wolf would forgive the lamb for fouling the water below him beside had he ivo not married herewards niece and what more grievous offence could hereward commit than to be her uncle reminding ivo of his own low birth by his nobility and too likely to take lucias part whenever it should please ivo to beat or kick her only gilbert of ghent the pious and illustrious earl sent messages of congratulation and friendship to hereward it being his custom to sail with the wind and worship the rising suntill it should decline again  but more hardly one of the normans round but in the conceit of their skindeep yesterdays civilization look on hereward as a barbarian englishman who has his throat tattooed and wears a short coat and prefersthe churlto talk english in his own hall though he can talk as good french as they when he is with them beside three or four barbarian tongues if he has need  but more still if they are not likely to bestow their love on hereward hereward is not likely to win love from them of his own will he is peevish and wrathful often insolent and quarrelsome and small blame to him the normans are invaders and tyrants who have no business there and should not be there if he had his way and they and he can no more amalgamate than fire and water moreover he is a very great man or has been such once and he thinks himself one still he has been accustomed to command men whole armies and he will no more treat these normans as his equals than they will treat him as such his own soninlaw hugh of evermue has to take hard wordsthoroughly well deserved it may be but all the more unpleasant for that reason  the truth was that herewards heart was gnawed with shame and remorse and therefore he fancied and not without reason that all men pointed at him the finger of scorn  he had done a bad base accursed deed and he knew it once in his lifefor his other sins were but the sins of his agethe father of men seems if the chroniclers say truth to have put before this splendid barbarian good and evil saying choose and he knew that the evil was evil and chose it nevertheless  eight hundred years after a still greater genius and general had the same choiceas far as human cases of conscience can be alikeput before him and he chose as hereward chose  but as with napoleon and josephine so it was with hereward and torfrida neither throve after  it was not punished by miracle what sin is it worked out its own punishment that which it merited deserved or earned by its own labor no man could commit such a sin without shaking his whole character to the root hereward tried to persuade himself that his was not shaken that he was the same hereward as ever but he could not deceive himself long his conscience was evil he was discontented with all mankind and with himself most of all he tried to be goodas good as he chose to be if he had done wrong in one thing he might make up for it in others but he could not  all his higher instincts fell from him one by one he did not like to think of good and noble things he dared not think of them he felt not at first but as the months rolled on that he was a changed man that god had left him his old bad habits began to return to him gradually he sank back into the very vices from which torfrida had raised him sixteen years before he took to drinking again to dull the malady of thought he excused himself to himself he wished to forget his defeats his disappointment the ruin of his country the splendid past which lay behind him like a dream true but he wished to forget likewise torfrida fasting and weeping in crowland he could not bear the sight of crowland tower on the far green horizon the sound of crowland bells booming over the flat on the southwind he never rode down into the fens he never went to see his daughter at deeping because crowland lay that way he went up into the old bruneswald hunted all day long through the glades where he and his merry men had done their doughty deeds and came home in the evening to get drunk  then he lost his sleep he sent down to crowland to leofric the priest that he might come to him and sing his sagas of the old heroes that he might get rest but leofric sent back for answer that he would not come  that night alftruda heard him by her side in the still hours weeping silently to himself she caressed him but he gave no heed to her  i believe said she bitterly at last that you love torfrida still better than you do me  and hereward answered like mahomet in like case that do i by heaven she believed in me when no one else in the world did  and the vain hard alftruda answered angrily and there was many a fierce quarrel between them after that  with his love of drinking his love of boasting came back because he could do no more great deedsor rather had not the spirit left in him to do morehe must needs like a wornout old man babble of the great deeds which he had done insult and defy his norman neighbors often talk what might be easily caricatured into treason against king william himself  there were great excuses for his follies as there are for those of every beaten man but hereward was spent he had lived his life and had no more life which he could live for every man it would seem brings into the world with him a certain capacity a certain amount of vital force in body and in soul and when that is used up the man must sink down into some sort of second childhood and end like hereward very much where he began unless the grace of god shall lift him up above the capacity of the mere flesh into a life literally new everrenewing everexpanding and eternal  but the grace of god had gone away from hereward as it goes away from all men who are unfaithful to their wives  it was very pitiable let no man judge him life to most is very hard work there are those who endure to the end and are saved there are those again who do not endure upon whose souls may god have mercy  so hereward soon became as intolerable to his norman neighbors as they were intolerable to him  whereon according to the simple fashion of those primitive times they sought about for some one who would pick a quarrel with hereward and slay him in fair fight but an archibald bellthecat was not to be found on every hedge  but it befell that oger the breton he who had morcars lands round bourne came up to see after his lands and to visit his friend and fellowrobber ivo taillebois  ivo thought the hotheaded breton who had already insulted hereward with impunity at winchester the fittest man for his purpose and asked him over his cups whether he had settled with that english ruffian about the docton land  now king william had judged that hereward and oger should hold that land between them as he and toli had done but when two dogs as ivo said have hold of the same bone it is hard if they cannot get a snap at each others noses  oger agreed to that opinion and riding into bourne made inquisition into the doings at docton andscandalous injusticehe found that an old woman had sent six hens to hereward whereof she should have kept three for him  so he sent to demand formally of hereward those three hens and was unpleasantly disappointed when hereward instead of offering to fight him sent him them in an hour and a lusty young cock into the bargain with this messagethat he hoped they might increase and multiply for it was a shame of an honest englishman if he did not help a poor breton churl to eat roast fowls for the first time in his life after feeding on nothing better than furzetoppings like his own ponies  to which oger who like a true breton believed himself descended from king arthur sir tristram and half the knights of the round table replied that his blood was to that of hereward as wine to peatwater and that bretons used furzetoppings only to scourge the backs of insolent barbarians  to which hereward replied that there were gnats enough pestering him in the fens already and that one more was of no consequence  wherefrom the breton judged as at winchester that hereward had no lust to fight  the next day he met hereward going out to hunt and was confirmed in his opinion when hereward lifted his cap to him most courteously saying that he was not aware before that his neighbor was a gentleman of such high blood  blood better at least than thine thou barelegged saxon who has dared to call me churl so you must needs have your throat cut i took you for a wiser man  many have taken me for that which i am not if you will harness yourself i will do the same and we will ride up into the bruneswald and settle this matter in peace  three men on each side to see fair play said the breton  and up into the bruneswald they rode and fought long without advantage on either side  hereward was not the man which he had been his nerve was gone as well as his conscience and all the dash and fury of his old onslaughts gone therewith  he grew tired of the fight not in body but in mind and more than once drew back  let us stop this childs play said he according to the chronicler what need have we to fight here all day about nothing  whereat the breton fancied him already more than halfbeaten and attacked more furiously than ever he would be the first man on earth who ever had had the better of the great outlaw he would win himself eternal glory as the champion of all england  but he had mistaken his man and his indomitable english pluck it was herewards fashion in fight and war says the chronicler always to ply the man most at the last and so found the breton for hereward suddenly lost patience and rushing on him with one of his old shouts hewed at him again and again as if his arm would never tire  oger gave back would he or not in a few moments his swordarm dropt to his side cut half through  have you had enough sir tristram the younger quoth hereward wiping his sword and walking moodily away  oger went out of bourne with his arm in a sling and took counsel with ivo taillebois whereon they two mounted and rode to lincoln and took counsel with gilbert of ghent  the fruit of which was this that a fortnight after gilbert rode into bourne with a great meinie full a hundred strong and with him the sheriff and the kings writ and arrested hereward on a charge of speaking evil of the king breaking his peace compassing the death of his faithful lieges and various other wicked traitorous and diabolical acts  hereward was minded at first to fight and die but gilbert whoto do him justicewished no harm to his ancient squire reasoned with him why should he destroy not only himself but perhaps his people likewise why should he throw away his last chance the king was not so angry as he seemed and if hereward would but be reasonable the matter might be arranged as it was he was not to be put to strong prison he was to be in the custody of robert of herepol châtelain of bedford who hereward knew was a reasonable and courteous man the king had asked him gilbert to take charge of hereward  and what said you  that i had rather have in my pocket the seven devils that came out of st mary magdalene and that i would not have thee within ten miles of lincoln town to be earl of all the danelagh so i begged him to send thee to sir robert just because i knew him to be a mild and gracious man  a year before hereward would have scorned the proposal and probably by one of his famous stratagems escaped there and then out of the midst of all gilberts men but his spirit was broken indeed so was the spirit of every englishman and he mounted his horse sullenly and rode alongside of gilbert unarmed for the first time for many a year  you had better have taken me said sir ascelin aside to the weeping alftruda  i helpless wretch that i am what shall i do for my own safety now he is gone  let me come and provide for it  out wretch traitor cried she  there is nothing very traitorous in succoring distressed ladies said ascelin if i can be of the least service to alftruda the peerless let her but send and i fly to do her bidding  so they rode off  hereward went through cambridge and potton like a man stunned and spoke never a word he could not even think till he heard the key turned on him in a roomnot a small or doleful onein bedford keep and found an iron shackle on his leg fastened to the stone bench on which he sat  robert of herepol had meant to leave his prisoner loose but there were those in gilberts train who told him and with truth that if he did so no mans life would be safe that to brain the jailer with his own keys and then twist out of his bowels a line wherewith to let himself down from the top of the castle would be not only easy but amusing to the famous wake  so robert consented to fetter him so far but no further and begged his pardon again and again as he did it pleading the painful necessities of his office  but hereward heard him not he sat in stupefied despair a great black cloud had covered all heaven and earth and entered into his brain through every sense till his mind as he said afterwards was like hell with the fire gone out  a jailer came in he knew not how long after bringing a good meal and wine he came cautiously toward the prisoner and when still beyond the length of his chain set the food down and thrust it toward him with a stick lest hereward should leap on him and wring his neck  but hereward never even saw him or the food he sat there all day all night and nearly all the next day and hardly moved hand or foot the jailer told sir robert in the evening that he thought the man was mad and would die  so good sir robert went up to him and spoke kindly and hopefully but all hereward answered was that he was very well that he wanted nothing that he had always heard well of sir robert that he should like to get a little sleep but that sleep would not come  the next day sir robert came again early and found him sitting in the same place  he was very well he said how could he be otherwise he was just where he ought to be a man could not be better than in his right place  whereon sir robert gave him up for mad  then he bethought of sending him a harp knowing the fame of herewards music and singing and when he saw the harp the jailer said he wept but bade take the thing away and so sat still where he was  in this state of dull despair he remained for many weeks at last he woke up  there passed through and by bedford large bodies of troops going as it were to and from battle the clank of arms stirred herewards heart as of old and he sent to sir robert to ask what was toward  sir robert the venerable man came to him joyfully and at once glad to speak to an illustrious captive whom he looked on as an injured man and told him news enough  tailleboiss warning about ralph guader and waltheof had not been needless ralph as the most influential of the bretons was on no good terms with the normans save with one and that one of the most powerfulfitzosbern earl of hereford his sister ralph was to have married but william for reasons unknown forbade the match the two great earls celebrated the wedding in spite of william and asked waltheof as a guest and at exning between the fen and newmarket heath      was that brideale      which was mans bale  for there was matured the plot which ivo and others had long seen brewing william had made himself hateful to all men by his cruelties and tyrannies and indeed his government was growing more unrighteous day by day let them drive him out of england and part the land between them two should be dukes the third king paramount  waltheof i presume plotted drunk and repented sober when too late the wittol he should have been a monk  repented he has if ever he was guilty for he fled to archbishop lanfranc and confessed to him so much that lanfranc declares him innocent and has sent him on to william in normandy  o kind priest true priest to send his sheep into the wolfs mouth  you forget dear sire that william is our king  i can hardly forget that with this pretty ring upon my ankle but after my experience of how he has kept faith with me what can i expect for waltheof the wittol save that which i have foretold many a time  as for you dear sire the king has been misinformed concerning you i have sent messengers to reason with him again and again but as long as taillebois warrenne and robert malet had his ear of what use were my poor words  and what said they  that there would be no peace in england if you were loose  they lied i am no boy like waltheof i know when the game is played out and it is played out now the frenchman is master and i know it well were i loose tomorrow and as great a fool as waltheof what could i do with it may be some forty knights and a hundred menatarms against all williams armies but how goes on this fools rebellion if i had been loose i might have helped to crush it in the bud  and you would have done that against waltheof  why not against him he is but bringing more misery on england tell that to william tell him that if he sets me free i will be the first to attack waltheof or whom he will there are no english left to fight against said he bitterly for waltheof is none now  he shall know your words when he returns to england  what is he abroad and all this evil going on  in normandy but the english have risen for the king in herefordshire and beaten earl roger and odo of bayeux and bishop mowbray are on their way to cambridge where they hope to give a good account of earl ralph and that the english may help them there  and they shall they hate ralph guader as much as i do can you send a message for me  whither  to bourne in the bruneswald and say to herewards men wherever they are let them rise and arm if they love hereward and down to cambridge to be the foremost at bishop odos side against ralph guader or waltheof himself send send o that i were free  would to heaven thou wert free my gallant sir said the good man  from that day hereward woke up somewhat he was still a broken man querulous peevish but the hope of freedom and the hope of battle woke him up if he could but get to his men but his melancholy returned his mensome of them at leastwent down to odo at cambridge and did good service guader was utterly routed and escaped to norwich and thence to brittanyhis home the bishops punished their prisoners the rebel normans with horrible mutilations  the wolves are beginning to eat each other said hereward to himself but it was a sickening thought to him that his men had been fighting and he not at their head  after a while there came to bedford castle two witty knaves one was a cook who came to buy milk says the chronicler the other seemingly a gleeman they told stories jested harped sang drank and pleased much the garrison and sir robert who let them hang about the place  they asked next whether it were true that the famous hereward was there if so might a man have a look at him  the jailer said that many men might have gone to see him so easy was sir robert to him but he would have no man and none dare enter save sir robert and he for fear of their lives but he would ask him of herepol  the good knight of herepol said let the rogues go in they may amuse the poor man  so they went in and as soon as they went he knew them one was martin lightfoot the other leofric the unlucky  who sent you asked he surlily turning his face away  she  who  we know but one she and she is at crowland  she sent you and wherefore  that we might sing to you and make you merry  hereward answered them with a terrible word and turned his face to the wall groaning and then bade them sternly to go  so they went for the time  the jailer told this to sir robert who saw all being a kindhearted man  from his poor first wife eh well there can be no harm in that nor if they came from this lady alftruda either for that matter let them go in and out when they will  but they may be spies and traitors  then we can but hang them  robert of herepol it would appear from the chronicle did not much care whether they were spies or not  so the men went to and fro and often sat with hereward but he forbade them sternly to mention torfridas name  alftruda sent to him meanwhile again and again messages of passionate love and sorrow and he listened to them as sullenly as he did to his two servants and sent no answer back and so sat more weary months in the very prison it may be in the very room in which john bunyan sat nigh six hundred years after but in a very different frame of mind  one day sir robert was going up the stairs with another knight and met the two coming down he was talking to that knight earnestly indignantly and somehow as he passed leofric and martin he thought fit to raise his voice as if in a great wrath  shame to all honor and chivalry good saints in heaven what a thing is human fortune that this man who had once a gallant army at his back should be at this moment going like a sheep to the slaughter to buckingham castle at the mercy of his worst enemy ivo taillebois of all men in the world if there were a dozen knights left of all those whom he used to heap with wealth and honor worthy the name of knights they would catch us between here and stratford and make a free man of their lord  so spakeor words to that effect according to the latin chronicler who must have got them from leofric himselfthe good knight of herepol  hillo knaves said he seeing the two are you here eavesdropping out of the castle this instant on your lives  which hint those two witty knaves took on the spot  a few days after hereward was travelling toward buckingham chained upon a horse with sir robert and his men and a goodly company of knights belonging to ivo ivo as the story runs seems to have arranged with ralph pagnel at buckingham to put him into the keeping of a creature of his own and how easy it was to put out a mans eyes or starve him to death in a norman keep none knew better than hereward  but he was past fear or sorrow a dull heavy cloud of despair had settled down upon his soul black with sin his heart could not pray he had hardened himself against all heaven and earth and thought when he thought at all only of his wrongs but never of his sins  they passed through a forest seemingly somewhere near what is newport pagnel named after ralph his wouldbe jailer  suddenly from the trees dashed out a body of knights and at their head the whitebear banner in ranald of ramseys hand  halt shouted sir robert we are past the halfway stone earl ivos and earl ralphs men are answerable now for the prisoner  treason shouted ivos men and one would have struck hereward through with his lance but winter was too quick for him and bore him from his saddle and then dragged hereward out of the fight  the normans surprised while their helmets were hanging at their saddles and their arms not ready for battle were scattered at once but they returned to the attack confident in their own numbers  they were over confident herewards fetters were knocked off and he was horsed and armed and mad with freedom and battle fighting like himself once more  only as he rode to and fro thrusting and hewing he shouted to his men to spare sir robert and all his meinie crying that he was the savior of his life and when the fight was over and all ivos and ralphs men who were not slain had ridden for their lives into stratford he shook hands with that venerable knight giving him innumerable thanks and courtesies for his honorable keeping and begged him to speak well of him to the king  and so these two parted in peace and hereward was a free man     chapter xli  how earl waltheof was made a saint   a few months after there sat in abbot thorolds lodgings in peterborough a select company of normans talking over affairs of state after their supper  well earls and gentlemen said the abbot as he sipped his wine the cause of our good king which is happily the cause of holy church goes well i think we have much to be thankful for when we review the events of the past year we have finished the rebels roger de breteuil is safe in prison ralph guader unsafe in brittany and waltheof more than unsafe inthe place to which traitors descend we have not a manor left which is not in loyal norman hands we have not an english monk left who has not been scourged and starved into holy obedience not an english saint for whom any man cares a jot since guerin de lire preached down st adhelm the admirable primate disposed of st alpheges martyrdom and some other wise mani am ashamed to say that i forget whoproved that st edmund of suffolk was merely a barbarian knight who was killed fighting with danes only a little more heathen than himself we have had great labors and great sufferings since we landed in this barbarous isle upon our holy errand ten years since but under the shadow of the gonfalon of st peter we have conquered and may sing dominus illuminatio mea with humble and thankful hearts  i dont know that said ascelin my lord uncle i shall never sing dominus illuminatio till i see your coffers illuminated once more by those thirty thousand marks  or i said oger le breton till i see myself safe in that bit of land which hereward holds wrongfully of me in locton  or i said ivo taillebois till i see herewards head on bourne gable where he stuck up those normans heads seven years ago  but what the lord abbot means by saying that we have done with english saints i do not see for the villains of crowland have just made a new one for themselves  a new one  i tell you truth and fact i will tell you all lord abbot and you shall judge whether it is not enough to drive an honest man mad to see such things going on under his nose men say of me that i am rough and swear and blaspheme i put it to you lord abbot if job would not have cursed if he had been lord of spalding you know that the king let these crowland monks have waltheofs body  yes i thought it an unwise act of grace it would have been wiser to leave him as he desired out on the down in ground unconsecrate  of course of course for what has happened  that old traitor ulfketyl and his monks bring the body to crowland and bury it as if it had been the popes in a week they begin to spread their liesthat waltheof was innocent that archbishop lanfranc himself said so  that was the only act of human weakness which i have ever known the venerable prelate commit said thorold  that these normans at winchester were so in the traitors favor that the king had to have him out and cut off his head in the gray of the morning ere folks were up and about that the fellow was so holy that he past all his time in prison in weeping and praying and said over the whole psalter every day because his mother had taught it himi wish she had taught him to be an honest manand that when his head was on the block he said all the paternoster as far as lead us not into temptation and then off went his head whereon his head being off finished the prayer withyou know best what comes next abbot  deliver us from evil amen what a manifest lie the traitor was not permitted it is plain to ask for that which could never be granted to him but his soul unworthy to be delivered from evil entered instead into evil and howls forever in the pit  but all the rest may be true said oger and yet that be no reason why these monks should say it  so i told them and threatened them too for not content with making him a martyr they are making him a saint  impious who can do that save the holy father said thorold  you had best get your bishop to look to them then for they are carrying blind beggars and mad girls by the dozen to be cured at the mans tomb that is all their fellows in the cell at spalding went about to take a girl that had fits off one of my manors to cure her but that i stopped with a good horsewhip  and rightly  and gave the monks a piece of my mind and drove them clean out of their cell home to crowland  what a piece of ivos mind on this occasion might be let ingulf describe  against our monastery and all the people of crowland he was by the instigation of the devil raised to such an extreme pitch of fury that he would follow their animals in the marshes with his dogs drive them to a great distance down in the lakes mutilate some in the tails others in the ears while often by breaking the backs and legs of the beasts of burden he rendered them utterly useless against our cell also at spalding and our brethren his neighbors the prior and monks who dwelt all day within his presence he rages with tyrannical and frantic fury lamed their oxen and horses daily impounded their sheep and poultry striking down killing and slaying their swine and pigs while at the same time the servants of the prior were oppressed in the earls court with insupportable exactions were often assaulted in the highways with swords and staves and sometimes killed  well went on the injured earl this hereward gets news of meand news too i dont know whence but true enough it isthat i had sworn to drive ulfketyl out of crowland by writ from king and bishop and lock him up as a minister at the other end of england  you will do but right i will send a knight off to the king this day telling him all and begging him to send us up a trusty norman as abbot of crowland that we may have one more gentleman in the land fit for our company  you must kill hereward first for as i was going to say he sent word to me that the monks of crowland were as the apple of his eye and abbot ulfketyl to him as more than a father and that if i dared to lay a finger on them or their property he would cut my head off  he has promised to cut my head off likewise said ascelin earl knights and gentlemen do you not think it wiser that we should lay our wits together once and for all and cut off his  but who will catch the wake sleeping said ivo laughing  that will i i have my plans and my intelligencers  and so those wicked men took counsel together to slay hereward     chapter xlii  how hereward got the best of his souls price   in those days a messenger came riding post to bourne the countess judith wished to visit the tomb of her late husband earl waltheof and asked hospitality on her road of hereward and alftruda  of course she would come with a great train and the trouble and expense would be great but the hospitality of those days when money was scarce and wine scarcer still was unbounded and a matter of course and alftruda was overjoyed no doubt judith was the most unpopular person in england at that moment called by all a traitress and a fiend but she was an old acquaintance of alftrudas she was the kings niece she was immensely rich not only in manors of her own but in manors as domesdaybook testifies about lincolnshire and the counties round which had belonged to her murdered husbandwhich she had too probably received as the price of her treason so alftruda looked to her visit as to an honor which would enable her to hold her head high among the proud norman dames who despised her as the wife of an englishman  hereward looked on the visit in a different light he called judith ugly names not undeserved and vowed that if she entered his house by the front door he would go out at the back torfrida prophesied he said that she would betray her husband and she had done it  torfrida prophesied did she prophesy that i should betray you likewise asked alftruda in a tone of bitter scorn  no you handsome fiend will you do it  yes i am a handsome fiend am i not and she bridled up her magnificent beauty and stood over him as a snake stands over a mouse  yes you are handsomebeautiful i adore you  and yet you will not do what i wish  what you wish what would i not do for you what have i not done for you  then receive judith and now go hunting and bring me in game i want deer roe fowls anything and everything from the greatest to the smallest go and hunt  and hereward trembled and went  there are flowers whose scent is so luscious that silly children will plunge their heads among them drinking in their odor to the exclusion of all fresh air on a sudden sometimes comes a revulsion of the nerves the sweet odor changes in a moment to a horrible one and the child cannot bear for years after the scent which has once disgusted it by oversweetness  and so had it happened to hereward he did not love alftruda now he loathed hated dreaded her and yet he could not take his eyes for a moment off her beauty he watched every movement of her hand to press it obey it he would have preferred instead of hunting simply to sit and watch her go about the house at her work he was spellbound to a thing which he regarded with horror  but he was told to go and hunt and he went with all his men and sent home large supplies for the larder and as he hunted the free fresh air of the forest comforted him the free forest life came back to him and he longed to be an outlaw once more and hunt on forever he would not go back yet at least to face that judith so he sent back the greater part of his men with a story he was ill he was laid up at a farmhouse far away in the forest and begged the countess to excuse his absence he had sent fresh supplies of game and a goodly company of his men knights and housecarles who would escort her royally to crowland  judith cared little for his absence he was but an english barbarian alftruda was half glad to have him out of the way lest his now sullen and uncertain temper should break out and bowed herself to the earth before judith who patronized her to her hearts content and offered her slyly insolent condolences on being married to a barbarian she herself could sympathizewho more  alftruda might have answered with scorn that she was an adeliza and of better english blood than judiths norman blood but she had her ends to gain and gained them  for judith was pleased to be so delighted with her that she kissed her lovingly and said with much emotion that she required a friend who would support her through her coming trial and who better than one who herself had suffered so much would she accompany her to crowland  alftruda was overjoyed and away they went  and to crowland they came and to the tomb in the minster whereof men said already that the sacred corpse within worked miracles of healing  and judith habited in widows weeds approached the tomb and laid on it as a peaceoffering to the manes of the dead a splendid pall of silk and gold  a fierce blast came howling off the fen screeched through the minster towers swept along the dark aisles and then so say the chroniclers caught up the pall from off the tomb and hurled it far away into a corner  a miracle cried all the monks at once and honestly enough like true englishmen as they were  the holy heart refuses the gift countess said old ulfketyl in a voice of awe  judith covered her face with her hands and turned away trembling and walked out while all looked upon her as a thing accursed  of her subsequent life her folly her wantonness her disgrace her poverty her wanderings her wretched death let others tell  but these normans believed that the curse of heaven was upon her from that day and the best of them believed likewise that waltheofs murder was the reason that william her uncle prospered no more in life  ah saucy sir said alftruda to ulfketyl as she went out there is one waiting at peterborough now who will teach thee mannersingulf of fontenelle abbot in thy room  does hereward know that asked ulfketyl looking keenly at her  what is that to thee said she fiercely and flung out of the minster but hereward did not know there were many things abroad of which she told him nothing  they went back and were landed at deeping town and making their way along the king street or old roman road to bourne thereon a man met them running they had best stay where they were the frenchmen were out and there was fighting up in bourne  alftrudas knights wanted to push on to see after the bourne folk judiths knights wanted to push on to help the french and the two parties were ready to fight each other there was a great tumult the ladies had much ado to still it  alftruda said that it might be but a countrymans rumor that at least it was shame to quarrel with their guests at last it was agreed that two knights should gallop on into bourne and bring back news  but those knights never came back so the whole body moved on bourne and there they found out the news for themselves  hereward had gone home as soon as they had departed and sat down to eat and drink his manner was sad and strange he drank much at the midday meal and then lay down to sleep setting guards as usual  after a while he leapt up with a shriek and a shudder  they ran to him asking whether he was ill  ill no yes ill at heart i have had a dreaman ugly dream i thought that all the men i ever slew on earth came to me with their wounds all gaping and cried at me our luck then thy luck now chaplain is there not a verse somewhereuncle brand said it to me on his deathbedwhoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed  surely the master is fey whispered gwenoch in fear to the chaplain answer him out of scripture  text none such that i know of quoth priest ailward a graceless fellow who had taken leofrics place if that were the law it would be but few honest men that would die in their beds let us drink and drive girls fancies out of our heads  so they drank again and hereward fell asleep once more  it is thy turn to watch priest said gwenoch  to ailward so keep the door well for i am worn out with hunting and so fell asleep  ailward shuffled into his harness and went to the door the wine was heady the sun was hot in a few minutes he was asleep likewise  hereward slept who can tell how long but at last there was a bustle a heavy fall and waking with a start he sprang up he saw ailward lying dead across the gate and above him a crowd of fierce faces some of which he knew too well he saw ivo taillebois he saw oger he saw his fellowbreton sir raoul de dol he saw sir ascelin he saw sir aswa thorolds man he saw sir hugh of evermue his own soninlaw and with them he saw or seemed to see the ogre of cornwall and obrodar of ivark and dirk hammerhand of walcheren and many another old foe long underground and in his ear rang the textwhoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed and hereward knew that his end was come  there was no time to put on mail or helmet he saw the old sword and shield hang on a perch and tore them down as he girded the sword on winter sprang to his side  i have three lancestwo for me and one for you and we can hold the door against twenty  till they fire the house over our heads shall hereward die like a wolf in a cave forward all herewards men  and he rushed out upon his fate no man followed him save winter the rest disperst unarmed were running hither and thither helplessly  brothers in arms and brothers in valhalla shouted winter as he rushed after him  a knight was running to and fro in the court shouting herewards name where is the villain wake we have caught thee asleep at last  i am out quoth hereward as the man almost stumbled against him and this is in  and through shield hauberk and body as says gaima went herewards javelin while all drew back confounded for the moment at that mighty stroke  felons shouted hereward your king has given me his truce and do you dare break my house and kill my folk is that your norman law and is this your norman honorto take a man unawares over his meat come on traitors all and get what you can of a naked man footnote i e without armor you will buy it dearguard my back winter  and he ran right at the press of knights and the fight began     he gored them like a woodwild boar     as long as that lance might endure  says gaimar      and when that lance did break in hand      full fell enough he smote with brand  and as he hewed on silently with grinding teeth and hard glittering eyes of whom did he think of alftruda  not so but of that pale ghost with great black hollow eyes who sat in crowland with thin bare feet and sackcloth on her tender limbs watching praying longing loving uncomplaining that ghost had been for many a month the background of all his thoughts and dreams it was so clear before his minds eye now that unawares to himself he shouted torfrida as he struck and struck the harder at the sound of his old battlecry  and now he is all wounded and bebled and winter who has fought back to back with him has fallen on his face and hereward stands alone turning from side to side as he sweeps his sword right and left till the forest rings with the blows but staggering as he turns within a ring of eleven corpses he stands who will go in and make the twelfth  a knight rushes in to fall headlong down cloven through the helm but herewards blade snaps short and he hurls it away as his foes rush in with a shout of joy he tears his shield from his left arm and with it says gaimar brains two more  but the end is come taillebois and evermue are behind him now four lances are through his back and bear him down to his knees  cut off his head breton shouted ivo raoul de dol rushed forward sword in hand at that cry hereward lifted up his dying head one stroke more ere it was all done forever  and with a shout of torfrida which made the bruneswald ring he hurled the shield full in the bretons face and fell forward dead  the knights drew their lances from that terrible corpse slowly and with caution as men who have felled a bear yet dare not step within reach of the seemingly lifeless paw  the dog died hard said ivo lucky for us that sir ascelin had news of his knights being gone to crowland if he had had them to back him we had not done this deed today  i will make sure said ascelin as he struck off the once fair and golden head  ho breton cried ivo the villain is dead get up man and see for yourself what ails him  but when they lifted up raoul de dol his brains were running down his face and all men stood astonished at that last mighty stroke  that blow said ascelin will be sung hereafter by minstrel and maiden as the last blow of the last englishman knights we have slain a better knight than ourselves if there had been three more such men in this realm they would have driven us and king william back again into the sea  so said ascelin those words of his too were sung by many a jongleur norman as well as english in the times that were to come  likely enough said ivo but that is the more reason why we should set that head of his up over the halldoor as a warning to these english churls that their last man is dead and their last stake thrown and lost  so perished the last of the english  it was the third day the normans were drinking in the hall of bourne casting lots among themselves who should espouse the fair alftruda who sat weeping within over the headless corpse when in the afternoon a servant came in and told them how a barge full of monks had come to the shore and that they seemed to be monks from crowland ivo taillebois bade drive them back again into the barge with whips but hugh of evermue spoke up  i am lord and master in bourne this day and if ivo have a quarrel against st guthlac i have none this ingulf of fontenelle the new abbot who has come thither since old ulfketyl was sent to prison is a loyal man and a friend of king williams and my friend he shall be till he behaves himself as my foe let them come up in peace  taillebois growled and cursed but the monks came up and into the hall and at their head ingulf himself to receive whom all men rose save taillebois  i come said ingulf in most courtly french noble knights to ask a boon and in the name of the most merciful on behalf of a noble and unhappy lady let it be enough to have avenged yourself on the living gentlemen and christians war not against the dead  no no master abbot shouted taillebois waltheof is enough to keep crowland in miracles for the present you shall not make a martyr of another saxon churl he wants the barbarians body knights and you will be fools if you let him have it  churl barbarian said a haughty voice and a nun stepped forward who had stood just behind ingulf she was clothed entirely in black her bare feet were bleeding from the stones her hand as she lifted it was as thin as a skeletons  she threw back her veil and showed to the knights what had been once the famous beauty of torfrida  but the beauty was long past away her hair was white as snow her cheeks were fallen in her hawklike features were all sharp and hard only in their hollow sockets burned still the great black eyes so fiercely that all men turned uneasily from her gaze  churl barbarian she said slowly and quietly but with an intensity which was more terrible than rage who gives such names to one who was as much better born and better bred than those who now sit here as he was braver and more terrible than they the base woodcutters son the upstart who would have been honored had he taken service as yon dead mans groom  talk to me so and my stirrup leathers shall make acquaintance with your sides said taillebois  keep them for your wife churl barbarian there is not a man within this hall who is not a barbarian compared with him which of you touched the harp like him which of you like him could move all hearts with song which of you knows all tongues from lapland to provence which of you has been the joy of ladies bowers the counsellor of earls and heroes the rival of a mighty king which of you will compare yourself with himwhom you dared not even strike you and your robber crew fairly in front but skulked round him till he fell pecked to death by you as lapland skratlings peck to death the bear ten years ago he swept this hall of such as you and hung their heads upon yon gable outside and were he alive but one five minutes again this hall would be right cleanly swept again give me his bodyor bear forever the name of cowards and torfridas curse  and she fixed her terrible eyes first on one and then on another calling them by name  ivo tailleboisbasest of all  take the witchs accursed eyes off me and he covered his face with his hands i shall be overlookedplanet struck hew the witch down take her away  hugh of evermuethe dead mans daughter is yours and the dead mans lands are not these remembrances enough of him are you so fond of his memory that you need his corpse likewise  give it her give it her said he hanging down his head like a rated cur  ascelin of lincoln once ascelin of ghentthere was a time when you would have donewhat would you notfor one glance of torfridas eyesstay do not deceive yourself fair sir torfrida means to ask no favor of you or of living man but she commands you do the thing she bids or with one glance of her eye she sends you childless to your grave  madam lady torfrida what is there i would not do for you what have i done now save avenge your great wrong  torfrida made no answer but fixed steadily on him eyes which widened every moment  but madamand he turned shrinking from the fancied spellwhat would you have thethe corpse it is in the keeping ofof another lady  so said torfrida quietly leave her to me and she swept past them all and flung open the bower door at their backs discovering alftruda sitting by the dead  the ruffians were so utterly appalled not only by the false powers of magic but by veritable powers of majesty and eloquence that they let her do what she would  out cried she using a short and terrible epithet out siren with fairys face and tail of fiend and leave the husband with his wife  alftruda looked up shrieked and then with the sudden passion of a weak nature drew a little knife and sprang up  ivo made a coarse jest the abbot sprang in for the sake of all holy things let there be no more murder here  torfrida smiled and fixed her snakes eye upon her wretched rival  out woman and choose thee a new husband among these french gallants ere i blast thee from head to foot with the leprosy of naaman the syrian  alftruda shuddered and fled shrieking into an inner room  now knights give methat which hangs outside  ascelin hurried out glad to escape in a minute he returned  the head was already taken down a tall lay brother the moment he had seen it had climbed the gable snatched it away and now sat in a corner of the yard holding it on his knees talking to it chiding it as if it had been alive when men had offered to take it he had drawn a battleaxe from under his frock and threatened to brain all comers and the monks had warned off ascelin saying that the man was mad and had berserk fits of superhuman strength and rage  he will give it me said torfrida and went out  look at that gable foolish head said the madman ten years agone you and i took down from thence another head o foolish head to get yourself at last up into that same place why would you not be ruled by her you foolish golden head  martin said torfrida  take it and comb it mistress as you used to do comb out the golden locks again fit to shine across the battlefield she has let them get all tangled into elfknots that lazy slut within  torfrida took it from his hands dryeyed and went in  then the monks silently took up the bier and all went forth and down the hill toward the fen they laid the corpse within the barge and slowly rowed away    and on by porsad and by asendyke   by winding reaches on and shining meres   between gray reedronds and green alderbeds   a dirge of monks and wail of women rose   in vain to heaven for the last englishman   then died far off within the boundless mist   and left the norman master of the land  so torfrida took the corpse home to crowland and buried it in the choir near the blessed martyr st waltheof after which she did not die but lived on many years footnote if ingulf can be trusted torfrida died about a d 1085 spending all day in nursing and feeding the countess godiva and lying all night on herewards tomb and praying that he might find grace and mercy in that day  and at last godiva died and they took her away and buried her with great pomp in her own minster church of coventry  and after that torfrida died likewise because she had nothing left for which to live and they laid her in herewards grave and their dust is mingled to this day  and leofric the priest lived on to a good old age and above all things he remembered the deeds and the sins of his master and wrote them in a book and this is what remains thereof  but when martin lightfoot died no man has said for no man in those days took account of such poor churls and running servingmen  and herewards comrades were all scattered abroad some maimed some blinded some with tongues cut out to beg by the wayside or crawl into convents and then die while their sisters and daughters ladies born and bred were the slaves of grooms and scullions from beyond the sea  and so as sang thorkel skallason     cold heart and bloody hand     now rule english land footnote laings heimskringla  and after that things waxed even worse and worse for sixty years and more all through the reigns of the two williams and of henry beauclerc and of stephen till men saw visions and portents and thought that the foul fiend was broken loose on earth and they whispered oftener and oftener that the soul of hereward haunted the bruneswald where he loved to hunt the dun deer and the roe and in the bruneswald when henry of poitou was made abbot footnote anglosaxon chronicle a d 1127 men sawlet no man think lightly of the marvel which we are about to relate for it was well known all over the countryupon the sunday when men sing exsurge quare o domine many hunters hunting black and tall and loathly and their hounds were black and ugly with wide eyes and they rode on black horses and black bucks and they saw them in the very deerpark of the town of peterborough and in all the woods to stamford and the monks heard the blasts of the horns which they blew in the night men of truth kept watch upon them and said that there might be well about twenty or thirty hornblowers this was seen and heard all that lent until easter and the norman monks of peterborough said how it was hereward doomed to wander forever with apollyon and all his crew because he had stolen the riches of the golden borough but the poor folk knew better and said that the mighty outlaw was rejoicing in the chase blowing his horn for englishmen to rise against the french and therefore it was that he was seen first on arise o lord sunday  but they were so sore trodden down that they could never rise for the french footnote anglosaxon chronicle a d 1137 had filled the land full of castles they greatly oppressed the wretched people by making them work at these castles and when the castles were finished they filled them with devils and evil men they took those whom they suspected of having any goods both men and women and they put them in prison for their gold and silver and tortured them with pains unspeakable for never were any martyrs tormented as these were they hung some by their feet and smoked them with foul smoke some by the thumbs or by the head and put burning things on their feet they put a knotted string round their heads and twisted it till it went into the brain they put them in dungeons wherein were adders and snakes and toads and thus wore them out some they put into a crucethousethat is into a chest that was short and narrow and they put sharp stones therein and crushed the man so that they broke all his bones there were hateful and grim things called sachenteges in many of the castles which two or three men had enough to do to carry this sachentege was made thus it was fastened to a beam having a sharp iron to go round a mans throat and neck so that he might no ways sit nor lie nor sleep but he must bear all the iron many thousands they wore out with hunger they were continually levying a tax from the towns which they called truserie and when the wretched townsfolk had no more to give then burnt they all the towns so that well mightest thou walk a whole days journey or ever thou shouldest see a man settled in a town or its lands tilled  then was corn dear and flesh and cheese and butter for there was none in the land wretched men starved with hunger some lived on alms who had been once rich some fled the country never was there more misery and never heathens acted worse than these  for now the sons of the churchs darlings of the crusaders whom the pope had sent beneath a gonfalon blessed by him to destroy the liberties of england turned by a just retribution upon that very norman clergy who had abetted all their iniquities in the name of rome they spared neither church nor churchyard but took all that was valuable therein and then burned the church and all together neither did they spare the lands of bishops nor of abbots nor of priests but they robbed the monks and clergy and every man plundered his neighbor as much as he could if two or three men came riding to a town all the townsfolk fled before them and thought that they were robbers the bishops and clergy were forever cursing them but this to them was nothing for they were all accursed and forsworn and reprobate the earth bare no corn you might as well have tilled the sea for all the land was ruined by such deeds and it was said openly that christ and his saints slept  and so was avenged the blood of harold and his brothers of edwin and morcar of waltheof and hereward  and those who had the spirit of hereward in them fled to the merry greenwood and became bold outlaws with robin hood scarlet and john adam bell and clym of the cleugh and william of cloudeslee and watched with sullen joy the norman robbers tearing in pieces each other and the church who had blest their crime  and they talked and sung of hereward and all his doughty deeds over the hearth in lone farmhouses or in the outlaws lodge beneath the hollins green and all the burden of their song was ah that hereward were alive again for they knew not that hereward was alive forevermore that only his husk and shell lay mouldering there in crowland choir that above them and around them and in them destined to raise them out of that bitter bondage and mould them into a great nation and the parents of still greater nations in lands as yet unknown brooded the immortal spirit of hereward now purged from all earthly dross even the spirit of freedom which can never die     chapter xliii  how deeping fen was drained   ill war and disorder ruin and death cannot last forever they are by their own nature exceptional and suicidal and spend themselves with what they feed on and then the true laws of gods universe peace and order usefulness and life will reassert themselves as they have been waiting all along to do hid in gods presence from the strife of men  and even so it was with bourne  nearly eighty years after in the year of grace 1155 there might have been seen sitting side by side and hand in hand upon a sunny bench on the bruneswald slope in the low december sun an old knight and an old lady the master and mistress of bourne  much had changed since herewards days the house below had been raised a whole story there were fresh herbs and flowers in the garden unknown at the time of the conquest but the great change was in the fen especially away toward deeping on the southern horizon  where had been lonely meres foul watercourses stagnant slime there were now great dikes rich and fair corn and grass lands rows of pure white cottages the newlydrained land swarmed with stocks of new breeds horses and sheep from flanders cattle from normandy for richard de rulos was the firstas far as history tellsof that noble class of agricultural squires who are englands blessing and englands pride  for this richard de rulos says ingulf or whoever wrote in his name who had married the daughter and heiress of hugh of evermue lord of bourne and deeping being a man of agricultural pursuits got permission from the monks of crowland for twenty marks of silver to enclose as much as he would of the common marshes so he shut out the welland by a strong embankment and building thereon numerous tenements and cottages in a short time he formed a large vill marked out gardens and cultivated fields while by shutting out the river he found in the meadow land which had been lately deep lakes and impassable marshes wherefore the place was called deeping the deep meadow most fertile fields and desirable lands and out of sloughs and bogs accursed made quiet a garden of pleasaunce  so there the good man the beginner of the good work of centuries sat looking out over the fen and listening to the music which came on the southern breezeabove the low of the kine and the clang of the wildfowl settling down to restfrom the bells of crowland minster far away  they were not the same bells which tolled for hereward and torfrida those had run down in molten streams upon that fatal night when abbot ingulf leaped out of bed to see the vast wooden sanctuary wrapt in one sheet of roaring flame from the carelessness of a plumber who had raked the ashes over his fire in the belltower and left it to smoulder through the night  then perished all the riches of crowland its library too of more than seven hundred volumes with that famous nadir or orrery the like whereof was not in all england wherein the seven planets were represented each in their proper metals and even worse all the charters of the monastery perished a loss which involved the monks thereof in centuries of lawsuits and compelled them to become as industrious and skilful forgers of documents as were to be found in the minsters of the middle age  but crowland minster had been rebuilt in greater glory than ever by the help of the norman gentry round abbot ingulf finding that st guthlacs plain inability to take care of himself had discredited him much in the fenmens eyes fell back norman as he was on the virtues of the holy martyr st waltheof whose tomb he opened with due reverence and found the body as whole and uncorrupted as on the day on which it was buried and the head united to the body while a fine crimson line around the neck was the only sign remaining of his decollation  on seeing which ingulf could not contain himself for joy and interrupting the response which the brethren were singing with a loud voice began the hymn te deum laudamus on which the chanter taking it up enjoined the rest of the brethren to sing it after which ingulfwho had never seen waltheof in life discovered that it was none other than he whom he had seen in a vision at fontenelle as an earl most gorgeously arrayed with a torc of gold about his neck and with him an abbot two bishops and two saints the two former being usfran and ausbert the abbots st wandresigil of fontenelle and the two saints of course st guthlac and st neot  whereon crawling on his hands and knees he kissed the face of the holy martyr and perceived such a sweet odor proceeding from the holy body as he never remembered to have smelt either in the palace of the king or in syria with all its aromatic herbs  quid plura what more was needed for a convent of burntout monks st waltheof was translated in state to the side of st guthlac and the news of this translation of the holy martyr being spread throughout the country multitudes of the faithful flocked daily to the tomb and offering up their vows there tended in a great degree to resuscitate our monastery  but more the virtues of st waltheof were too great not to turn themselves or be turned to some practical use so if not in the days of ingulf at least in those of abbot joffrid who came after him st waltheof began says peter of blois to work wonderful deeds the blind received their sight the deaf their hearing the lame their power of walking and the dumb their power of speech while each day troops innumerable of other sick persons were arriving by every road as to the very fountain of their safety  and by the offerings of the pilgrims who came flocking in from every part the revenues of the monastery were increased in no small degree  only one wicked norman monk of st albans audwin by name dared to dispute the sanctity of the martyr calling him a wicked traitor who had met with his deserts in vain did abbot joffrid himself a norman from st evroult expostulate with the inconvenient blasphemer he launched out into invective beyond measure till on the spot in presence of the said father he was seized with such a stomachache that he went home to st albans and died in a few days after which all went well with crowland and the norman monks who worked the english martyr to get money out of the english whom they had enslaved  and yetso strangely mingled for good and evil are the works of menthat lying brotherhood of crowland set up in those very days for pure love of learning and of teaching learning a little school of letters in a poor town hard by which became under their auspices the university of cambridge  so the bells of crowland were restored more melodious than ever and richard of rulos doubtless had his share in their restoration and that day they were ringing with a will and for a good reason for that day had come the news that henry plantagenet was crowned king of england  lord said the good old knight now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace this day at last he sees an english king head the english people  god grant said the old lady that he may be such a lord to england as thou hast been to bourne  if he will beand better far will he be by gods grace from what i hear of him than ever i have beenhe must learn that which i learnt from theeto understand these englishmen and know what stout and trusty prudhommes they are all down to the meanest serf when once one can humor their sturdy independent tempers  and he must learn too the lesson which thou didst teach me when i would have had thee in the pride of youth put on the magic armor of my ancestors and win me fame in every tournament and battlefield blessed be the day when richard of rulos said to me if others dare to be men of war i dare more for i dare to be a man of peace have patience with me and i will win for thee and for myself a renown more lasting before god and man than ever was won with lance do you remember those words richard mine  the old man leant his head upon his hands it may be that not those words but the deeds which god has caused to follow them may by christs merits bring us a short purgatory and a long heaven  amen only whatever grief we may endure in the next life for our sins may we endure it as we have the griefs of this life hand in hand  amen torfrida there is one thing more to do before we die the tomb in crowland ever since the fire blackened it it has seemed to me too poor and mean to cover the dust which once held two such noble souls let us send over to normandy for fair white stone of caen and let carve a tomb worthy of thy grandparents  and what shall we write thereon  what but that which is there already here lies the last of the english  not so we will writehere lies the last of the old english but upon thy tomb when thy time comes the monks of crowland shall writehere lies the first of the new english who by the inspiration of god began to drain the fens  explicit
