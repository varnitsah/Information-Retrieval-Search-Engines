the table  mysteries he commented there is no such thing as a mystery in connection with any crime provided intelligence is brought to bear upon its investigation  very much astonished polly burton looked over the top of her newspaper and fixed a pair of very severe coldly inquiring brown eyes upon him  she had disapproved of the man from the instant when he shuffled across the shop and sat down opposite to her at the same marbletopped table which already held her large coffee 3d her roll and butter 2d and plate of tongue 6d  now this particular corner this very same table that special view of the magnificent marble hallknown as the norfolk street branch of the aërated bread companys depôtswere pollys own corner table and view here she had partaken of eleven pennyworth of luncheon and one pennyworth of daily information ever since that glorious nevertobeforgotten day when she was enrolled on the staff of the evening observer well call it that if you please and became a member of that illustrious and worldfamed organization known as the british press  she was a personality was miss burton of the evening observer her cards were printed thus  illustration miss mary j burton evening observer  she had interviewed miss ellen terry and the bishop of madagascar mr seymour hicks and the chief commissioner of police she had been present at the last marlborough house garden partyin the cloakroom that is to say where she caught sight of lady thingummys hat miss whatyoumaycalls sunshade and of various other things modistical or fashionable all of which were duly described under the heading royalty and dress in the early afternoon edition of the evening observer  the article itself is signed mjb and is to be found in the files of that leading halfpennyworth  for these reasonsand for various others toopolly felt irate with the man in the corner and told him so with her eyes as plainly as any pair of brown eyes can speak  she had been reading an article in the daily telegraph the article was palpitatingly interesting had polly been commenting audibly upon it certain it is that the man over there had spoken in direct answer to her thoughts  she looked at him and frowned the next moment she smiled miss burton of the evening observer had a keen sense of humour which two years association with the british press had not succeeded in destroying and the appearance of the man was sufficient to tickle the most ultramorose fancy polly thought to herself that she had never seen any one so pale so thin with such funny lightcoloured hair brushed very smoothly across the top of a very obviously bald crown he looked so timid and nervous as he fidgeted incessantly with a piece of string his long lean and trembling fingers tying and untying it into knots of wonderful and complicated proportions  having carefully studied every detail of the quaint personality polly felt more amiable  and yet she remarked kindly but authoritatively this article in an otherwise wellinformed journal will tell you that even within the last year no fewer than six crimes have completely baffled the police and the perpetrators of them are still at large  pardon me he said gently i never for a moment ventured to suggest that there were no mysteries to the police i merely remarked that there were none where intelligence was brought to bear upon the investigation of crime  not even in the fenchurch street mystery i suppose she asked sarcastically  least of all in the socalled fenchurch street mystery he replied quietly  now the fenchurch street mystery as that extraordinary crime had popularly been called had puzzledas polly well knewthe brains of every thinking man and woman for the last twelve months it had puzzled her not inconsiderably she had been interested fascinated she had studied the case formed her own theories thought about it all often and often had even written one or two letters to the press on the subjectsuggesting arguing hinting at possibilities and probabilities adducing proofs which other amateur detectives were equally ready to refute the attitude of that timid man in the corner therefore was peculiarly exasperating and she retorted with sarcasm destined to completely annihilate her selfcomplacent interlocutor  what a pity it is in that case that you do not offer your priceless services to our misguided though wellmeaning police  isnt it he replied with perfect goodhumour well you know for one thing i doubt if they would accept them and in the second place my inclinations and my duty wouldwere i to become an active member of the detective forcenearly always be in direct conflict as often as not my sympathies go to the criminal who is clever and astute enough to lead our entire police force by the nose  i dont know how much of the case you remember he went on quietly it certainly at first began even to puzzle me on the 12th of last december a woman poorly dressed but with an unmistakable air of having seen better days gave information at scotland yard of the disappearance of her husband william kershaw of no occupation and apparently of no fixed abode she was accompanied by a frienda fat oilylooking germanand between them they told a tale which set the police immediately on the move  it appears that on the 10th of december at about three oclock in the afternoon karl müller the german called on his friend william kershaw for the purpose of collecting a small debtsome ten pounds or sowhich the latter owed him on arriving at the squalid lodging in charlotte street fitzroy square he found william kershaw in a wild state of excitement and his wife in tears müller attempted to state the object of his visit but kershaw with wild gestures waved him aside andin his own wordsflabbergasted him by asking him pointblank for another loan of two pounds which sum he declared would be the means of a speedy fortune for himself and the friend who would help him in his need  after a quarter of an hour spent in obscure hints kershaw finding the cautious german obdurate decided to let him into the secret plan which he averred would place thousands into their hands  instinctively polly had put down her paper the mild stranger with his nervous air and timid watery eyes had a peculiar way of telling his tale which somehow fascinated her  i dont know he resumed if you remember the story which the german told to the police and which was corroborated in every detail by the wife or widow briefly it was this some thirty years previously kershaw then twenty years of age and a medical student at one of the london hospitals had a chum named barker with whom he roomed together with another  the latter so it appears brought home one evening a very considerable sum of money which he had won on the turf and the following morning he was found murdered in his bed kershaw fortunately for himself was able to prove a conclusive alibi he had spent the night on duty at the hospital as for barker he had disappeared that is to say as far as the police were concerned but not as far as the watchful eyes of his friend kershaw were able to spyat least so the latter said barker very cleverly contrived to get away out of the country and after sundry vicissitudes finally settled down at vladivostok in eastern siberia where under the assumed name of smethurst he built up an enormous fortune by trading in furs  now mind you every one knows smethurst the siberian millionaire kershaws story that he had once been called barker and had committed a murder thirty years ago was never proved was it i am merely telling you what kershaw said to his friend the german and to his wife on that memorable afternoon of december the 10th  according to him smethurst had made one gigantic mistake in his clever careerhe had on four occasions written to his late friend william kershaw two of these letters had no bearing on the case since they were written more than twentyfive years ago and kershaw moreover had lost themso he saidlong ago according to him however the first of these letters was written when smethurst alias barker had spent all the money he had obtained from the crime and found himself destitute in new york  kershaw then in fairly prosperous circumstances sent him a £10 note for the sake of old times the second when the tables had turned and kershaw had begun to go downhill smethurst as he then already called himself sent his whilom friend £50 after that as müller gathered kershaw had made sundry demands on smethursts everincreasing purse and had accompanied these demands by various threats which considering the distant country in which the millionaire lived were worse than futile  but now the climax had come and kershaw after a final moment of hesitation handed over to his german friend the two last letters purporting to have been written by smethurst and which if you remember played such an important part in the mysterious story of this extraordinary crime i have a copy of both these letters here added the man in the corner as he took out a piece of paper from a very wornout pocketbook and unfolding it very deliberately he began to read  siryour preposterous demands for money are wholly unwarrantable i have already helped you quite as much as you deserve however for the sake of old times and because you once helped me when i was in a terrible difficulty i am willing to once more let you impose upon my good nature a friend of mine here a russian merchant to whom i have sold my business starts in a few days for an extended tour to many european and asiatic ports in his yacht and has invited me to accompany him as far as england being tired of foreign parts and desirous of seeing the old country once again after thirty years absence i have decided to accept his invitation i dont know when we may actually be in europe but i promise you that as soon as we touch a suitable port i will write to you again making an appointment for you to see me in london but remember that if your demands are too preposterous i will not for a moment listen to them and that i am the last man in the world to submit to persistent and unwarrantable blackmail    i am sir       yours truly           francis smethurst  the second letter was dated from southampton continued the old man in the corner calmly and curiously enough was the only letter which kershaw professed to have received from smethurst of which he had kept the envelope and which was dated it was quite brief he added referring once more to his piece of paper  dear sirreferring to my letter of a few weeks ago i wish to inform you that the tsarskoe selo will touch at tilbury on tuesday next the 10th i shall land there and immediately go up to london by the first train i can get if you like you may meet me at fenchurch street station in the firstclass waitingroom in the late afternoon since i surmise that after thirty years absence my face may not be familiar to you i may as well tell you that you will recognize me by a heavy astrakhan fur coat which i shall wear together with a cap of the same you may then introduce yourself to me and i will personally listen to what you may have to say      yours faithfully         francis smethurst  it was this last letter which had caused william kershaws excitement and his wifes tears in the germans own words he was walking up and down the room like a wild beast gesticulating wildly and muttering sundry exclamations mrs kershaw however was full of apprehension she mistrusted the man from foreign partswho according to her husbands story had already one crime upon his consciencewho might she feared risk another in order to be rid of a dangerous enemy womanlike she thought the scheme a dishonourable one for the law she knew is severe on the blackmailer  the assignation might be a cunning trap in any case it was a curious one why she argued did not smethurst elect to see kershaw at his hotel the following day a thousand whys and wherefores made her anxious but the fat german had been won over by kershaws visions of untold gold held tantalisingly before his eyes he had lent the necessary £2 with which his friend intended to tidy himself up a bit before he went to meet his friend the millionaire half an hour afterwards kershaw had left his lodgings and that was the last the unfortunate woman saw of her husband or müller the german of his friend  anxiously his wife waited that night but he did not return the next day she seems to have spent in making purposeless and futile inquiries about the neighbourhood of fenchurch street and on the 12th she went to scotland yard gave what particulars she knew and placed in the hands of the police the two letters written by smethurst     chapter ii  a millionaire in the dock   the man in the corner had finished his glass of milk his watery blue eyes looked across at miss polly burtons eager little face from which all traces of severity had now been chased away by an obvious and intense excitement  it was only on the 31st he resumed after a while that a body decomposed past all recognition was found by two lightermen in the bottom of a disused barge she had been moored at one time at the foot of one of those dark flights of steps which lead down between tall warehouses to the river in the east end of london i have a photograph of the place here he added selecting one out of his pocket and placing it before polly  the actual barge you see had already been removed when i took this snapshot but you will realize what a perfect place this alley is for the purpose of one man cutting anothers throat in comfort and without fear of detection the body as i said was decomposed beyond all recognition it had probably been there eleven days but sundry articles such as a silver ring and a tie pin were recognizable and were identified by mrs kershaw as belonging to her husband  she of course was loud in denouncing smethurst and the police had no doubt a very strong case against him for two days after the discovery of the body in the barge the siberian millionaire as he was already popularly called by enterprising interviewers was arrested in his luxurious suite of rooms at the hotel cecil  to confess the truth at this point i was not a little puzzled mrs kershaws story and smethursts letters had both found their way into the papers and following my usual methodmind you i am only an amateur i try to reason out a case for the love of the thingi sought about for a motive for the crime which the police declared smethurst had committed to effectually get rid of a dangerous blackmailer was the generally accepted theory well did it ever strike you how paltry that motive really was  miss polly had to confess however that it had never struck her in that light  surely a man who had succeeded in building up an immense fortune by his own individual efforts was not the sort of fool to believe that he had anything to fear from a man like kershaw he must have known that kershaw held no damning proofs against himnot enough to hang him anyway have you ever seen smethurst he added as he once more fumbled in his pocketbook  polly replied that she had seen smethursts picture in the illustrated papers at the time then he added placing a small photograph before her  what strikes you most about the face  well i think its strange astonished expression due to the total absence of eyebrows and the funny foreign cut of the hair  so close that it almost looks as if it had been shaved exactly that is what struck me most when i elbowed my way into the court that morning and first caught sight of the millionaire in the dock he was a tall soldierlylooking man upright in stature his face very bronzed and tanned he wore neither moustache nor beard his hair was cropped quite close to his head like a frenchmans but of course what was so very remarkable about him was that total absence of eyebrows and even eyelashes which gave the face such a peculiar appearanceas you say a perpetually astonished look  he seemed however wonderfully calm he had been accommodated with a chair in the dockbeing a millionaireand chatted pleasantly with his lawyer sir arthur inglewood in the intervals between the calling of the several witnesses for the prosecution whilst during the examination of these witnesses he sat quite placidly with his head shaded by his hand  müller and mrs kershaw repeated the story which they had already told to the police i think you said that you were not able owing to pressure of work to go to the court that day and hear the case so perhaps you have no recollection of mrs kershaw no ah well here is a snapshot i managed to get of her once that is her exactly as she stood in the boxoverdressedin elaborate crape with a bonnet which once had contained pink roses and to which a remnant of pink petals still clung obtrusively amidst the deep black  she would not look at the prisoner and turned her head resolutely towards the magistrate i fancy she had been fond of that vagabond husband of hers an enormous weddingring encircled her finger and that too was swathed in black she firmly believed that kershaws murderer sat there in the dock and she literally flaunted her grief before him  i was indescribably sorry for her as for müller he was just fat oily pompous conscious of his own importance as a witness his fat fingers covered with brass rings gripped the two incriminating letters which he had identified they were his passports as it were to a delightful land of importance and notoriety sir arthur inglewood i think disappointed him by stating that he had no questions to ask of him müller had been brimful of answers ready with the most perfect indictment the most elaborate accusations against the bloated millionaire who had decoyed his dear friend kershaw and murdered him in heaven knows what an outoftheway corner of the east end  after this however the excitement grew apace müller had been dismissed and had retired from the court altogether leading away mrs kershaw who had completely broken down  constable d 21 was giving evidence as to the arrest in the meanwhile the prisoner he said had seemed completely taken by surprise not understanding the cause or history of the accusation against him however when put in full possession of the facts and realizing no doubt the absolute futility of any resistance he had quietly enough followed the constable into the cab no one at the fashionable and crowded hotel cecil had even suspected that anything unusual had occurred  then a gigantic sigh of expectancy came from every one of the spectators the fun was about to begin james buckland a porter at fenchurch street railway station had just sworn to tell all the truth etc after all it did not amount to much he said that at six oclock in the afternoon of december the 10th in the midst of one of the densest fogs he ever remembers the 55 from tilbury steamed into the station being just about an hour late he was on the arrival platform and was hailed by a passenger in a firstclass carriage he could see very little of him beyond an enormous black fur coat and a travelling cap of fur also  the passenger had a quantity of luggage all marked fs and he directed james buckland to place it all upon a fourwheel cab with the exception of a small handbag which he carried himself having seen that all his luggage was safely bestowed the stranger in the fur coat paid the porter and telling the cabman to wait until he returned he walked away in the direction of the waitingrooms still carrying his small handbag  i stayed for a bit added james buckland talking to the driver about the fog and that then i went about my business seein that the local from southend ad been signalled  the prosecution insisted most strongly upon the hour when the stranger in the fur coat having seen to his luggage walked away towards the waitingrooms the porter was emphatic it was not a minute later than 615 he averred  sir arthur inglewood still had no questions to ask and the driver of the cab was called  he corroborated the evidence of james buckland as to the hour when the gentleman in the fur coat had engaged him and having filled his cab in and out with luggage had told him to wait and cabby did wait he waited in the dense foguntil he was tired until he seriously thought of depositing all the luggage in the lost property office and of looking out for another farewaited until at last at a quarter before nine whom should he see walking hurriedly towards his cab but the gentleman in the fur coat and cap who got in quickly and told the driver to take him at once to the hotel cecil this cabby declared had occurred at a quarter before nine still sir arthur inglewood made no comment and mr francis smethurst in the crowded stuffy court had calmly dropped to sleep  the next witness constable thomas taylor had noticed a shabbily dressed individual with shaggy hair and beard loafing about the station and waitingrooms in the afternoon of december the 10th he seemed to be watching the arrival platform of the tilbury and southend trains  two separate and independent witnesses cleverly unearthed by the police had seen this same shabbily dressed individual stroll into the firstclass waitingroom at about 615 on wednesday december the 10th and go straight up to a gentleman in a heavy fur coat and cap who had also just come into the room the two talked together for a while no one heard what they said but presently they walked off together no one seemed to know in which direction  francis smethurst was rousing himself from his apathy he whispered to his lawyer who nodded with a bland smile of encouragement the employés of the hotel cecil gave evidence as to the arrival of mr smethurst at about 930 pm on wednesday december the 10th in a cab with a quantity of luggage and this closed the case for the prosecution  everybody in that court already saw smethurst mounting the gallows it was uninterested curiosity which caused the elegant audience to wait and hear what sir arthur inglewood had to say he of course is the most fashionable man in the law at the present moment his lolling attitudes his drawling speech are quite the rage and imitated by the gilded youth of society  even at this moment when the siberian millionaires neck literally and metaphorically hung in the balance an expectant titter went round the fair spectators as sir arthur stretched out his long loose limbs and lounged across the table he waited to make his effectsir arthur is a born actorand there is no doubt that he made it when in his slowest most drawly tones he said quietly  with regard to this alleged murder of one william kershaw on wednesday december the 10th between 615 and 845 pm your honour i now propose to call two witnesses who saw this same william kershaw alive on tuesday afternoon december the 16th that is to say six days after the supposed murder  it was as if a bombshell had exploded in the court even his honour was aghast and i am sure the lady next to me only recovered from the shock of the surprise in order to wonder whether she need put off her dinner party after all  as for me added the man in the corner with that strange mixture of nervousness and selfcomplacency which had set miss polly burton wondering well you see i had made up my mind long ago where the hitch lay in this particular case and i was not so surprised as some of the others  perhaps you remember the wonderful development of the case which so completely mystified the policeand in fact everybody except myself torriani and a waiter at his hotel in the commercial road both deposed that at about 330 pm on december the 10th a shabbily dressed individual lolled into the coffeeroom and ordered some tea he was pleasant enough and talkative told the waiter that his name was william kershaw that very soon all london would be talking about him as he was about through an unexpected stroke of good fortune to become a very rich man and so on and so on nonsense without end  when he had finished his tea he lolled out again but no sooner had he disappeared down a turning of the road than the waiter discovered an old umbrella left behind accidentally by the shabby talkative individual as is the custom in his highly respectable restaurant signor torriani put the umbrella carefully away in his office on the chance of his customer calling to claim it when he had discovered his loss and sure enough nearly a week later on tuesday the 16th at about 1 pm the same shabbily dressed individual called and asked for his umbrella he had some lunch and chatted once again to the waiter signor torriani and the waiter gave a description of william kershaw which coincided exactly with that given by mrs kershaw of her husband  oddly enough he seemed to be a very absentminded sort of person for on this second occasion no sooner had he left than the waiter found a pocketbook in the coffeeroom underneath the table it contained sundry letters and bills all addressed to william kershaw this pocketbook was produced and karl müller who had returned to the court easily identified it as having belonged to his dear and lamented friend villiam  this was the first blow to the case against the accused it was a pretty stiff one you will admit already it had begun to collapse like a house of cards still there was the assignation and the undisputed meeting between smethurst and kershaw and those two and a half hours of a foggy evening to satisfactorily account for  the man in the corner made a long pause keeping the girl on tenterhooks he had fidgeted with his bit of string till there was not an inch of it free from the most complicated and elaborate knots  i assure you he resumed at last that at that very moment the whole mystery was to me as clear as daylight i only marvelled how his honour could waste his time and mine by putting what he thought were searching questions to the accused relating to his past francis smethurst who had quite shaken off his somnolence spoke with a curious nasal twang and with an almost imperceptible soupçon of foreign accent he calmly denied kershaws version of his past declared that he had never been called barker and had certainly never been mixed up in any murder case thirty years ago  but you knew this man kershaw persisted his honour since you wrote to him  pardon me your honour said the accused quietly i have never to my knowledge seen this man kershaw and i can swear that i never wrote to him  never wrote to him retorted his honour warningly that is a strange assertion to make when i have two of your letters to him in my hands at the present moment  i never wrote those letters your honour persisted the accused quietly they are not in my handwriting  which we can easily prove came in sir arthur inglewoods drawly tones as he handed up a packet to his honour here are a number of letters written by my client since he has landed in this country and some of which were written under my very eyes  as sir arthur inglewood had said this could be easily proved and the prisoner at his honours request scribbled a few lines together with his signature several times upon a sheet of notepaper it was easy to read upon the magistrates astounded countenance that there was not the slightest similarity in the two handwritings  a fresh mystery had cropped up who then had made the assignation with william kershaw at fenchurch street railway station the prisoner gave a fairly satisfactory account of the employment of his time since his landing in england  i came over on the tsarskoe selo he said a yacht belonging to a friend of mine when we arrived at the mouth of the thames there was such a dense fog that it was twentyfour hours before it was thought safe for me to land my friend who is a russian would not land at all he was regularly frightened at this land of fogs he was going on to madeira immediately  i actually landed on tuesday the 10th and took a train at once for town i did see to my luggage and a cab as the porter and driver told your honour then i tried to find my way to a refreshmentroom where i could get a glass of wine i drifted into the waitingroom and there i was accosted by a shabbily dressed individual who began telling me a piteous tale who he was i do not know he said he was an old soldier who had served his country faithfully and then been left to starve he begged of me to accompany him to his lodgings where i could see his wife and starving children and verify the truth and piteousness of his tale  well your honour added the prisoner with noble frankness it was my first day in the old country i had come back after thirty years with my pockets full of gold and this was the first sad tale i had heard but i am a business man and did not want to be exactly done in the eye i followed my man through the fog out into the streets he walked silently by my side for a time i had not a notion where i was  suddenly i turned to him with some question and realized in a moment that my gentleman had given me the slip finding probably that i would not part with my money till i had seen the starving wife and children he left me to my fate and went in search of more willing bait  the place where i found myself was dismal and deserted i could see no trace of cab or omnibus i retraced my steps and tried to find my way back to the station only to find myself in worse and more deserted neighbourhoods i became hopelessly lost and fogged i dont wonder that two and a half hours elapsed while i thus wandered on in the dark and deserted streets my sole astonishment is that i ever found the station at all that night or rather close to it a policeman who showed me the way  but how do you account for kershaw knowing all your movements still persisted his honour and his knowing the exact date of your arrival in england how do you account for these two letters in fact  i cannot account for it or them your honour replied the prisoner quietly i have proved to you have i not that i never wrote those letters and that the manerkershaw is his namewas not murdered by me  can you tell me of anyone here or abroad who might have heard of your movements and of the date of your arrival  my late employés at vladivostok of course knew of my departure but none of them could have written these letters since none of them know a word of english  then you can throw no light upon these mysterious letters you cannot help the police in any way towards the clearing up of this strange affair  the affair is as mysterious to me as to your honour and to the police of this country  francis smethurst was discharged of course there was no semblance of evidence against him sufficient to commit him for trial the two overwhelming points of his defence which had completely routed the prosecution were firstly the proof that he had never written the letters making the assignation and secondly the fact that the man supposed to have been murdered on the 10th was seen to be alive and well on the 16th but then who in the world was the mysterious individual who had apprised kershaw of the movements of smethurst the millionaire     chapter iii  his deduction   the man in the corner cocked his funny thin head on one side and looked at polly then he took up his beloved bit of string and deliberately untied every knot he had made in it when it was quite smooth he laid it out upon the table  i will take you if you like point by point along the line of reasoning which i followed myself and which will inevitably lead you as it led me to the only possible solution of the mystery  first take this point he said with nervous restlessness once more taking up his bit of string and forming with each point raised a series of knots which would have shamed a navigating instructor obviously it was impossible for kershaw not to have been acquainted with smethurst since he was fully apprised of the latters arrival in england by two letters now it was clear to me from the first that no one could have written those two letters except smethurst you will argue that those letters were proved not to have been written by the man in the dock exactly remember kershaw was a careless manhe had lost both envelopes to him they were insignificant now it was never disproved that those letters were written by smethurst  but suggested polly  wait a minute he interrupted while knot number two appeared upon the scene it was proved that six days after the murder william kershaw was alive and visited the torriani hotel where already he was known and where he conveniently left a pocketbook behind so that there should be no mistake as to his identity but it was never questioned where mr francis smethurst the millionaire happened to spend that very same afternoon  surely you dont mean gasped the girl  one moment please he added triumphantly how did it come about that the landlord of the torriani hotel was brought into court at all how did sir arthur inglewood or rather his client know that william kershaw had on those two memorable occasions visited the hotel and that its landlord could bring such convincing evidence forward that would for ever exonerate the millionaire from the imputation of murder  surely i argued the usual means the police  the police had kept the whole affair very dark until the arrest at the hotel cecil they did not put into the papers the usual if anyone happens to know of the whereabouts etc etc had the landlord of that hotel heard of the disappearance of kershaw through the usual channels he would have put himself in communication with the police sir arthur inglewood produced him how did sir arthur inglewood come on his track  surely you dont mean  point number four he resumed imperturbably mrs kershaw was never requested to produce a specimen of her husbands handwriting why because the police clever as you say they are never started on the right tack they believed william kershaw to have been murdered they looked for william kershaw  on december the 31st what was presumed to be the body of william kershaw was found by two lightermen i have shown you a photograph of the place where it was found dark and deserted it is in all conscience is it not just the place where a bully and a coward would decoy an unsuspecting stranger murder him first then rob him of his valuables his papers his very identity and leave him there to rot the body was found in a disused barge which had been moored some time against the wall at the foot of these steps it was in the last stages of decomposition and of course could not be identified but the police would have it that it was the body of william kershaw  it never entered their heads that it was the body of francis smethurst and that william kershaw was his murderer  ah it was cleverly artistically conceived kershaw is a genius think of it all his disguise kershaw had a shaggy beard hair and moustache he shaved up to his very eyebrows no wonder that even his wife did not recognize him across the court and remember she never saw much of his face while he stood in the dock kershaw was shabby slouchy he stooped smethurst the millionaire might have served in the prussian army  then that lovely trait about going to revisit the torriani hotel just a few days grace in order to purchase moustache and beard and wig exactly similar to what he had himself shaved off making up to look like himself splendid then leaving the pocketbook behind he he he kershaw was not murdered of course not he called at the torriani hotel six days after the murder whilst mr smethurst the millionaire hobnobbed in the park with duchesses hang such a man fie  he fumbled for his hat with nervous trembling fingers he held it deferentially in his hand whilst he rose from the table polly watched him as he strode up to the desk and paid twopence for his glass of milk and his bun soon he disappeared through the shop whilst she still found herself hopelessly bewildered with a number of snapshot photographs before her still staring at a long piece of string smothered from end to end in a series of knots as bewildering as irritating as puzzling as the man who had lately sat in the corner     chapter iv  the robbery in phillimore terrace   whether miss polly burton really did expect to see the man in the corner that saturday afternoon twere difficult to say certain it is that when she found her way to the table close by the window and realized that he was not there she felt conscious of an overwhelming sense of disappointment and yet during the whole of the week she had with more pride than wisdom avoided this particular abc shop  i thought you would not keep away very long said a quiet voice close to her ear  she nearly lost her balancewhere in the world had he come from she certainly had not heard the slightest sound and yet there he sat in the corner like a veritable jackinthebox his mild blue eyes staring apologetically at her his nervous fingers toying with the inevitable bit of string  the waitress brought him his glass of milk and a cheesecake he ate it in silence while his piece of string lay idly beside him on the table when he had finished he fumbled in his capacious pockets and drew out the inevitable pocketbook  placing a small photograph before the girl he said quietly  that is the back of the houses in phillimore terrace which overlook adam and eve mews  she looked at the photograph then at him with a kindly look of indulgent expectancy  you will notice that the row of back gardens have each an exit into the mews these mews are built in the shape of a capital f the photograph is taken looking straight down the short horizontal line which ends as you see in a culdesac the bottom of the vertical line turns into phillimore terrace and the end of the upper long horizontal line into high street kensington now on that particular night or rather early morning of january 15th constable d 21 having turned into the mews from phillimore terrace stood for a moment at the angle formed by the long vertical artery of the mews and the short horizontal one which as i observed before looks on to the back gardens of the terrace houses and ends in a culdesac  how long d 21 stood at that particular corner he could not exactly say but he thinks it must have been three or four minutes before he noticed a suspiciouslooking individual shambling along under the shadow of the garden walls he was working his way cautiously in the direction of the culdesac and d 21 also keeping well within the shadow went noiselessly after him  he had almost overtaken himwas in fact not more than thirty yards from himwhen from out of one of the two end housesno 22 phillimore terrace in facta man in nothing but his nightshirt rushed out excitedly and before d 21 had time to intervene literally threw himself upon the suspected individual rolling over and over with him on the hard cobblestones and frantically shrieking thief thief police  it was some time before the constable succeeded in rescuing the tramp from the excited grip of his assailant and several minutes before he could make himself heard  there there thatll do he managed to say at last as he gave the man in the shirt a vigorous shove which silenced him for the moment leave the man alone now you mustnt make that noise this time o night wakin up all the folks the unfortunate tramp who in the meanwhile had managed to got on to his feet again made no attempt to get away probably he thought he would stand but a poor chance but the man in the shirt had partly recovered his power of speech and was now blurting out jerky halfintelligible sentences  i have been robbedrobbedithat ismy mastermr knopf the desk is openthe diamonds goneall in my chargeandnow they are stolen thats the thiefill sweari heard himnot three minutes agorushed downstairsthe door into the garden was smashedi ran across the gardenhe was sneaking about here stillthief thief police diamonds constable dont let him goill make you responsible if you let him go  now thenthatll do admonished d 21 as soon as he could get a word in stop that row will you  the man in the shirt was gradually recovering from his excitement  can i give this man in charge he asked  what for  burglary and housebreaking i heard him i tell you he must have mr knopfs diamonds about him at this moment  where is mr knopf  out of town groaned the man in the shirt he went to brighton last night and left me in charge and now this thief has been and  the tramp shrugged his shoulders and suddenly without a word he quietly began taking off his coat and waistcoat these he handed across to the constable eagerly the man in the shirt fell on them and turned the ragged pockets inside out from one of the windows a hilarious voice made some facetious remark as the tramp with equal solemnity began divesting himself of his nether garments  now then stop that nonsense pronounced d 21 severely what were you doing here this time o night anyway  the streets o london is free to the public aint they queried the tramp  this dont lead nowhere my man  then ive lost my way thats all growled the man surlily and praps youll let me get along now  by this time a couple of constables had appeared upon the scene d 21 had no intention of losing sight of his friend the tramp and the man in the shirt had again made a dash for the latters collar at the bare idea that he should be allowed to get along  i think d 21 was alive to the humour of the situation he suggested that robertson the man in the nightshirt should go in and get some clothes on whilst he himself would wait for the inspector and the detective whom d 15 would send round from the station immediately  poor robertsons teeth were chattering with cold he had a violent fit of sneezing as d 21 hurried him into the house the latter with another constable remained to watch the burglared premises both back and front and d 15 took the wretched tramp to the station with a view to sending an inspector and a detective round immediately  when the two latter gentlemen arrived at no 22 phillimore terrace they found poor old robertson in bed shivering and still quite blue he had got himself a hot drink but his eyes were streaming and his voice was terribly husky d 21 had stationed himself in the diningroom where robertson had pointed the desk out to him with its broken lock and scattered contents  robertson between his sneezes gave what account he could of the events which happened immediately before the robbery  his master mr ferdinand knopf he said was a diamond merchant and a bachelor he himself had been in mr knopfs employ over fifteen years and was his only indoor servant a charwoman came every day to do the housework  last night mr knopf dined at the house of mr shipman at no 26 lower down mr shipman is the great jeweller who has his place of business in south audley street by the last post there came a letter with the brighton postmark and marked urgent for mr knopf and he robertson was just wondering if he should run over to no 26 with it when his master returned he gave one glance at the contents of the letter asked for his abc railway guide and ordered him robertson to pack his bag at once and fetch him a cab  i guessed what it was continued robertson after another violent fit of sneezing mr knopf has a brother mr emile knopf to whom he is very much attached and who is a great invalid he generally goes about from one seaside place to another he is now at brighton and has recently been very ill  if you will take the trouble to go downstairs i think you will still find the letter lying on the hall table  i read it after mr knopf left it was not from his brother but from a gentleman who signed himself j collins md i dont remember the exact words but of course youll be able to read the lettermr j collins said he had been called in very suddenly to see mr emile knopf who he added had not many hours to live and had begged of the doctor to communicate at once with his brother in london  before leaving mr knopf warned me that there were some valuables in his deskdiamonds mostly and told me to be particularly careful about locking up the house he often has left me like this in charge of his premises and usually there have been diamonds in his desk for mr knopf has no regular city office as he is a commercial traveller  this briefly was the gist of the matter which robertson related to the inspector with many repetitions and persistent volubility  the detective and inspector before returning to the station with their report thought they would call at no 26 on mr shipman the great jeweller  you remember of course added the man in the corner dreamily contemplating his bit of string the exciting developments of this extraordinary case mr arthur shipman is the head of the firm of shipman and co the wealthy jewellers he is a widower and lives very quietly by himself in his own oldfashioned way in the small kensington house leaving it to his two married sons to keep up the style and swagger befitting the representatives of so wealthy a firm  i have only known mr knopf a very little while he explained to the detectives he sold me two or three stones once or twice i think but we are both single men and we have often dined together last night he dined with me he had that afternoon received a very fine consignment of brazilian diamonds as he told me and knowing how beset i am with callers at my business place he had brought the stones with him hoping perhaps to do a bit of trade over the nuts and wine  i bought £25000 worth of him added the jeweller as if he were speaking of so many farthings and gave him a cheque across the dinner table for that amount i think we were both pleased with our bargain and we had a final bottle of 48 port over it together mr knopf left me at about 930 for he knows i go very early to bed and i took my new stock upstairs with me and locked it up in the safe i certainly heard nothing of the noise in the mews last night i sleep on the second floor in the front of the house and this is the first i have heard of poor mr knopfs loss  at this point of his narrative mr shipman very suddenly paused and his face became very pale with a hasty word of excuse he unceremoniously left the room and the detective heard him running quickly upstairs  less than two minutes later mr shipman returned there was no need for him to speak both the detective and the inspector guessed the truth in a moment by the look upon his face  the diamonds he gasped i have been robbed     chapter v  a nights adventure   now i must tell you continued the man in the corner that after i had read the account of the double robbery which appeared in the early afternoon papers i set to work and had a good thinkyes he added with a smile noting pollys look at the bit of string on which he was still at work yes aided by this small adjunct to continued thoughti made notes as to how i should proceed to discover the clever thief who had carried off a small fortune in a single night of course my methods are not those of a london detective he has his own way of going to work the one who was conducting this case questioned the unfortunate jeweller very closely about his servants and his household generally  i have three servants explained mr shipman two of whom have been with me for many years one the housemaid is a fairly new comershe has been here about six months she came recommended by a friend and bore an excellent character she and the parlourmaid room together the cook who knew me when i was a schoolboy sleeps alone all three servants sleep on the floor above i locked the jewels up in the safe which stands in the dressingroom my keys and watch i placed as usual beside my bed as a rule i am a fairly light sleeper  i cannot understand how it could have happenedbutyou had better come up and have a look at the safe the key must have been abstracted from my bedside the safe opened and the keys replacedall while i was fast asleep though i had no occasion to look into the safe until just now i should have discovered my loss before going to business for i intended to take the diamonds away with me  the detective and the inspector went up to have a look at the safe the lock had in no way been tampered withit had been opened with its own key the detective spoke of chloroform but mr shipman declared that when he woke in the morning at about halfpast seven there was no smell of chloroform in the room however the proceedings of the daring thief certainly pointed to the use of an anaesthetic an examination of the premises brought to light the fact that the burglar had as in mr knopfs house used the glasspanelled door from the garden as a means of entrance but in this instance he had carefully cut out the pane of glass with a diamond slipped the bolts turned the key and walked in  which among your servants knew that you had the diamonds in your house last night mr shipman asked the detective  not one i should say replied the jeweller though perhaps the parlourmaid whilst waiting at table may have heard me and mr knopf discussing our bargain  would you object to my searching all your servants boxes  certainly not they would not object either i am sure they are perfectly honest  the searching of servants belongings is invariably a useless proceeding added the man in the corner with a shrug of the shoulders no one not even a latterday domestic would be fool enough to keep stolen property in the house however the usual farce was gone through with more or less protest on the part of mr shipmans servants and with the usual result  the jeweller could give no further information the detective and inspector to do them justice did their work of investigation minutely and what is more intelligently it seemed evident from their deductions that the burglar had commenced proceedings on no 26 phillimore terrace and had then gone on probably climbing over the garden walls between the houses to no 22 where he was almost caught in the act by robertson the facts were simple enough but the mystery remained as to the individual who had managed to glean the information of the presence of the diamonds in both the houses and the means which he had adopted to get that information it was obvious that the thief or thieves knew more about mr knopfs affairs than mr shipmans since they had known how to use mr emile knopfs name in order to get his brother out of the way  it was now nearly ten oclock and the detectives having taken leave of mr shipman went back to no 22 in order to ascertain whether mr knopf had come back the door was opened by the old charwoman who said that her master had returned and was having some breakfast in the diningroom  mr ferdinand knopf was a middleaged man with sallow complexion black hair and beard of obviously hebrew extraction he spoke with a marked foreign accent but very courteously to the two officials who he begged would excuse him if he went on with his breakfast  i was fully prepared to hear the bad news he explained which my man robertson told me when i arrived the letter i got last night was a bogus one there is no such person as j collins md my brother had never felt better in his life you will i am sure very soon trace the cunning writer of that epistleah but i was in a rage i can tell you when i got to the metropole at brighton and found that emile my brother had never heard of any doctor collins  the last train to town had gone although i raced back to the station as hard as i could poor old robertson he has a terrible cold ah yes my loss it is for me a very serious one if i had not made that lucky bargain with mr shipman last night i should perhaps at this moment be a ruined man  the stones i had yesterday were firstly some magnificent brazilians these i sold to mr shipman mostly then i had some very good cape diamondsall gone and some quite special parisians of wonderful work and finish entrusted to me for sale by a great french house i tell you sir my loss will be nearly £10000 altogether i sell on commission and of course have to make good the loss  he was evidently trying to bear up manfully and as a business man should under his sad fate he refused in any way to attach the slightest blame to his old and faithful servant robertson who had caught perhaps his death of cold in his zeal for his absent master as for any hint of suspicion falling even remotely upon the man the very idea appeared to mr knopf absolutely preposterous  with regard to the old charwoman mr knopf certainly knew nothing about her beyond the fact that she had been recommended to him by one of the tradespeople in the neighbourhood and seemed perfectly honest respectable and sober  about the tramp mr knopf knew still less nor could he imagine how he or in fact anybody else could possibly know that he happened to have diamonds in his house that night  this certainly seemed the great hitch in the case  mr ferdinand knopf at the instance of the police later on went to the station and had a look at the suspected tramp he declared that he had never set eyes on him before  mr shipman on his way home from business in the afternoon had done likewise and made a similar statement  brought before the magistrate the tramp gave but a poor account of himself he gave a name and address which latter of course proved to be false after that he absolutely refused to speak he seemed not to care whether he was kept in custody or not very soon even the police realized that for the present at any rate nothing could be got out of the suspected tramp  mr francis howard the detective who had charge of the case though he would not admit it even to himself was at his wits ends you must remember that the burglary through its very simplicity was an exceedingly mysterious affair the constable d 21 who had stood in adam and eve mews presumably while mr knopfs house was being robbed had seen no one turn out from the culdesac into the main passage of the mews  the stables which immediately faced the back entrance of the phillimore terrace houses were all private ones belonging to residents in the neighbourhood the coachmen their families and all the grooms who slept in the stablings were rigidly watched and questioned one and all had seen nothing heard nothing until robertsons shrieks had roused them from their sleep  as for the letter from brighton it was absolutely commonplace and written upon notepaper which the detective with machiavellian cunning traced to a stationers shop in west street but the trade at that particular shop was a very brisk one scores of people had bought notepaper there similar to that on which the supposed doctor had written his tricky letter the handwriting was cramped perhaps a disguised one in any case except under very exceptional circumstances it could afford no clue to the identity of the thief needless to say the tramp when told to write his name wrote a totally different and absolutely uneducated hand  matters stood however in the same persistently mysterious state when a small discovery was made which suggested to mr francis howard an idea which if properly carried out would he hoped inevitably bring the cunning burglar safely within the grasp of the police  that was the discovery of a few of mr knopfs diamonds continued the man in the corner after a slight pause evidently trampled into the ground by the thief whilst making his hurried exit through the garden of no 22 phillimore terrace  at the end of this garden there is a small studio which had been built by a former owner of the house and behind it a small piece of waste ground about seven feet square which had once been a rockery and is still filled with large loose stones in the shadow of which earwigs and woodlice innumerable have made a happy hunting ground  it was robertson who two days after the robbery having need of a large stone for some household purpose or other dislodged one from that piece of waste ground and found a few shining pebbles beneath it mr knopf took them round to the policestation himself immediately and identified the stones as some of his parisian ones  later on the detective went to view the place where the find had been made and there conceived the plan upon which he built big cherished hopes  acting upon the advice of mr francis howard the police decided to let the anonymous tramp out of his safe retreat within the station and to allow him to wander whithersoever he chose a good idea perhapsthe presumption being that sooner or later if the man was in any way mixed up with the cunning thieves he would either rejoin his comrades or even lead the police to where the remnant of his hoard lay hidden needless to say his footsteps were to be literally dogged  the wretched tramp on his discharge wandered out of the yard wrapping his thin coat round his shoulders for it was a bitterly cold afternoon he began operations by turning into the town hall tavern for a good feed and a copious drink mr francis howard noted that he seemed to eye every passerby with suspicion but he seemed to enjoy his dinner and sat some time over his bottle of wine  it was close upon four oclock when he left the tavern and then began for the indefatigable mr howard one of the most wearisome and uninteresting chases through the mazes of the london streets he ever remembers to have made up notting hill down the slums of notting dale along the high street beyond hammersmith and through shepherds bush did that anonymous tramp lead the unfortunate detective never hurrying himself stopping every now and then at a publichouse to get a drink whither mr howard did not always care to follow him  in spite of his fatigue mr francis howards hopes rose with every halfhour of this weary tramp the man was obviously striving to kill time he seemed to feel no weariness but walked on and on perhaps suspecting that he was being followed  at last with a beating heart though half perished with cold and with terribly sore feet the detective began to realize that the tramp was gradually working his way back towards kensington it was then close upon eleven oclock at night once or twice the man had walked up and down the high street from st pauls school to derry and toms shops and back again he had looked down one or two of the side streets andat lasthe turned into phillimore terrace he seemed in no hurry he oven stopped once in the middle of the road trying to light a pipe which as there was a high east wind took him some considerable time then he leisurely sauntered down the street and turned into adam and eve mews with mr francis howard now close at his heels  acting upon the detectives instructions there were several men in plain clothes ready to his call in the immediate neighbourhood two stood within the shadow of the steps of the congregational church at the corner of the mews others were stationed well within a soft call  hardly therefore had the hare turned into the culdesac at the back of phillimore terrace than at a slight sound from mr francis howard every egress was barred to him and he was caught like a rat in a trap  as soon as the tramp had advanced some thirty yards or so the whole length of this part of the mews is about one hundred yards and was lost in the shadow mr francis howard directed four or five of his men to proceed cautiously up the mews whilst the same number were to form a line all along the front of phillimore terrace between the mews and the high street  remember the backgarden walls threw long and dense shadows but the silhouette of the man would be clearly outlined if he made any attempt at climbing over them mr howard felt quite sure that the thief was bent on recovering the stolen goods which no doubt he had hidden in the rear of one of the houses he would be caught in flagrante delicto and with a heavy sentence hovering over him he would probably be induced to name his accomplice mr francis howard was thoroughly enjoying himself  the minutes sped on absolute silence in spite of the presence of so many men reigned in the dark and deserted mews  of course this nights adventure was never allowed to get into the papers added the man in the corner with his mild smile had the plan been successful we should have heard all about it with a long eulogistic article as to the astuteness of our police but as it waswell the tramp sauntered up the mewsandthere he remained for aught mr francis howard or the other constables could ever explain the earth or the shadows swallowed him up no one saw him climb one of the garden walls no one heard him break open a door he had retreated within the shadow of the garden walls and was seen or heard of no more  one of the servants in the phillimore terrace houses must have belonged to the gang said polly with quick decision  ah yes but which said the man in the corner making a beautiful knot in his bit of string i can assure you that the police left not a stone unturned once more to catch sight of that tramp whom they had had in custody for two days but not a trace of him could they find nor of the diamonds from that day to this     chapter vi  all he knew   the tramp was missing continued the man in the corner and mr francis howard tried to find the missing tramp going round to the front and seeing the lights at no 26 still in he called upon mr shipman the jeweller had had a few friends to dinner and was giving them whiskiesandsodas before saying good night the servants had just finished washing up and were waiting to go to bed neither they nor mr shipman nor his guests had seen or heard anything of the suspicious individual  mr francis howard went on to see mr ferdinand knopf this gentleman was having his warm bath preparatory to going to bed so robertson told the detective however mr knopf insisted on talking to mr howard through his bathroom door mr knopf thanked him for all the trouble he was taking and felt sure that he and mr shipman would soon recover possession of their diamonds thanks to the persevering detective  he he he laughed the man in the corner poor mr howard he perseveredbut got no farther no nor anyone else for that matter even i might not be able to convict the thieves if i told all i knew to the police  now follow my reasoning point by point he added eagerly  who knew of the presence of the diamonds in the house of mr shipman and mr knopf firstly he said putting up an ugly clawlike finger mr shipman then mr knopf then presumably the man robertson  and the tramp said polly  leave the tramp alone for the present since he has vanished and take point number two mr shipman was drugged that was pretty obvious no man under ordinary circumstances would without waking have his keys abstracted and then replaced at his own bedside mr howard suggested that the thief was armed with some anaesthetic but how did the thief get into mr shipmans room without waking him from his natural sleep is it not simpler to suppose that the thief had taken the precaution to drug the jeweller before the latter went to bed  but  wait a moment and take point number three though there was every proof that mr shipman had been in possession of £25000 worth of goods since mr knopf had a cheque from him for that amount there was no proof that in mr knopfs house there was even an odd stone worth a sovereign  and then again went on the scarecrow getting more and more excited did it ever strike you or anybody else that at no time while the tramp was in custody while all that searching examination was being gone on with no one ever saw mr knopf and his man robertson together at the same time  ah he continued whilst suddenly the young girl seemed to see the whole thing as in a vision they did not forget a single detailfollow them with me point by point two cunning scoundrelsgeniuses they should be calledwell provided with some illgotten fundsbut determined on a grand coup they play at respectability for six months say one is the master the other the servant they take a house in the same street as their intended victim make friends with him accomplish one or two creditable but very small business transactions always drawing on the reserve funds which might even have amounted to a few hundredsand a bit of credit  then the brazilian diamonds and the parisianswhich remember were so perfect that they required chemical testing to be detected the parisian stones are soldnot in business of coursein the evening after dinner and a good deal of wine mr knopfs brazilians were beautiful perfect mr knopf was a wellknown diamond merchant  mr shipman boughtbut with the morning would have come sober sense the cheque stopped before it could have been presented the swindler caught no those exquisite parisians were never intended to rest in mr shipmans safe until the morning that last bottle of 48 port with the aid of a powerful soporific ensured that mr shipman would sleep undisturbed during the night  ah remember all the details they were so admirable the letter posted in brighton by the cunning rogue to himself the smashed desk the broken pane of glass in his own house the man robertson on the watch while knopf himself in ragged clothing found his way into no 26 if constable d 21 had not appeared upon the scene that exciting comedy in the early morning would not have been enacted as it was in the supposed fight mr shipmans diamonds passed from the hands of the tramp into those of his accomplice  then later on robertson ill in bed while his master was supposed to have returnedby the way it never struck anybody that no one saw mr knopf come home though he surely would have driven up in a cab then the double part played by one man for the next two days it certainly never struck either the police or the inspector remember they only saw robertson when in bed with a streaming cold but knopf had to be got out of gaol as soon as possible the dual rôle could not have been kept up for long hence the story of the diamonds found in the garden of no 22 the cunning rogues guessed that the usual plan would be acted upon and the suspected thief allowed to visit the scene where his hoard lay hidden  it had all been foreseen and robertson must have been constantly on the watch the tramp stopped mind you in phillimore terrace for some moments lighting a pipe the accomplice then was fully on the alert he slipped the bolts of the back garden gate five minutes later knopf was in the house in a hot bath getting rid of the disguise of our friend the tramp remember that again here the detective did not actually see him  the next morning mr knopf black hair and beard and all was himself again the whole trick lay in one simple art which those two cunning rascals knew to absolute perfection the art of impersonating one another  they are brothers presumablytwin brothers i should say  but mr knopf suggested polly  well look in the trades directory you will see f knopf  co diamond merchants of some city address ask about the firm among the trade you will hear that it is firmly established on a sound financial basis he he he and it deserves to be added the man in the corner as calling for the waitress he received his ticket and taking up his shabby hat took himself and his bit of string rapidly out of the room     chapter vii  the york mystery   the man in the corner looked quite cheerful that morning he had had two glasses of milk and had even gone to the extravagance of an extra cheesecake polly knew that he was itching to talk police and murders for he cast furtive glances at her from time to time produced a bit of string tied and untied it into scores of complicated knots and finally bringing out his pocketbook he placed two or three photographs before her  do you know who that is he asked pointing to one of these  the girl looked at the face on the picture it was that of a woman not exactly pretty but very gentle and childlike with a strange pathetic look in the large eyes which was wonderfully appealing  that was lady arthur skelmerton he said and in a flash there flitted before pollys mind the weird and tragic history which had broken this loving womans heart lady arthur skelmerton that name recalled one of the most bewildering most mysterious passages in the annals of undiscovered crimes  yes it was sad wasnt it he commented in answer to pollys thoughts another case which but for idiotic blunders on the part of the police must have stood clear as daylight before the public and satisfied general anxiety would you object to my recapitulating its preliminary details  she said nothing so he continued without waiting further for a reply  it all occurred during the york racing week a time which brings to the quiet cathedral city its quota of shady characters who congregate wherever money and wits happen to fly away from their owners lord arthur skelmerton a very wellknown figure in london society and in racing circles had rented one of the fine houses which overlook the racecourse he had entered peppercorn by st armandnotre dame for the great ebor handicap peppercorn was the winner of the newmarket and his chances for the ebor were considered a practical certainty  if you have ever been to york you will have noticed the fine houses which have their drive and front entrances in the road called the mount and the gardens of which extend as far as the racecourse commanding a lovely view over the entire track it was one of these houses called the elms which lord arthur skelmerton had rented for the summer  lady arthur came down some little time before the racing week with her servantsshe had no children but she had many relatives and friends in york since she was the daughter of old sir john etty the cocoa manufacturer a rigid quaker who it was generally said kept the tightest possible hold on his own pursestrings and looked with marked disfavour upon his aristocratic soninlaws fondness for gaming tables and betting books  as a matter of fact maud etty had married the handsome young lieutenant in the hussars quite against her fathers wishes but she was an only child and after a good deal of demur and grumbling sir john who idolized his daughter gave way to her whim and a reluctant consent to the marriage was wrung from him  but as a yorkshireman he was far too shrewd a man of the world not to know that love played but a very small part in persuading a dukes son to marry the daughter of a cocoa manufacturer and as long as he lived he determined that since his daughter was being wed because of her wealth that wealth should at least secure her own happiness he refused to give lady arthur any capital which in spite of the most carefully worded settlements would inevitably sooner or later have found its way into the pockets of lord arthurs racing friends but he made his daughter a very handsome allowance amounting to over £3000 a year which enabled her to keep up an establishment befitting her new rank  a great many of these facts intimate enough as they are leaked out you see during that period of intense excitement which followed the murder of charles lavender and when the public eye was fixed searchingly upon lord arthur skelmerton probing all the inner details of his idle useless life  it soon became a matter of common gossip that poor little lady arthur continued to worship her handsome husband in spite of his obvious neglect and not having as yet presented him with an heir she settled herself down into a life of humble apology for her plebeian existence atoning for it by condoning all his faults and forgiving all his vices even to the extent of cloaking them before the prying eyes of sir john who was persuaded to look upon his soninlaw as a paragon of all the domestic virtues and a perfect model of a husband  among lord arthur skelmertons many expensive tastes there was certainly that for horseflesh and cards after some successful betting at the beginning of his married life he had started a racingstable which it was generally believedas he was very luckywas a regular source of income to him  peppercorn however after his brilliant performances at newmarket did not continue to fulfil his masters expectations his collapse at york was attributed to the hardness of the course and to various other causes but its immediate effect was to put lord arthur skelmerton in what is popularly called a tight place for he had backed his horse for all he was worth and must have stood to lose considerably over £5000 on that one day  the collapse of the favourite and the grand victory of king cole a rank outsider on the other hand had proved a golden harvest for the bookmakers and all the york hotels were busy with dinners and suppers given by the confraternity of the turf to celebrate the happy occasion the next day was friday one of few important racing events after which the brilliant and the shady throng which had flocked into the venerable city for the week would fly to more congenial climes and leave it with its fine old minster and its ancient walls as sleepy as quiet as before  lord arthur skelmerton also intended to leave york on the saturday and on the friday night he gave a farewell bachelor dinner party at the elms at which lady arthur did not appear after dinner the gentlemen settled down to bridge with pretty stiff points you may be sure it had just struck eleven at the minster tower when constables mcnaught and murphy who were patrolling the racecourse were startled by loud cries of murder and police  quickly ascertaining whence these cries proceeded they hurried on at a gallop and came upquite close to the boundary of lord arthur skelmertons groundsupon a group of three men two of whom seemed to be wrestling vigorously with one another whilst the third was lying face downwards on the ground as soon as the constables drew near one of the wrestlers shouted more vigorously and with a certain tone of authority  here you fellows hurry up sharp the brute is giving me the slip  but the brute did not seem inclined to do anything of the sort he certainly extricated himself with a violent jerk from his assailants grasp but made no attempt to run away the constables had quickly dismounted whilst he who had shouted for help originally added more quietly  my name is skelmerton this is the boundary of my property i was smoking a cigar at the pavilion over there with a friend when i heard loud voices followed by a cry and a groan i hurried down the steps and saw this poor fellow lying on the ground with a knife sticking between his shoulderblades and his murderer he added pointing to the man who stood quietly by with constable mcnaughts firm grip upon his shoulder still stooping over the body of his victim i was too late i fear to save the latter but just in time to grapple with the assassin  its a lie here interrupted the man hoarsely i didnt do it constable i swear i didnt do it i saw him falli was coming along a couple of hundred yards away and i tried to see if the poor fellow was dead i swear i didnt do it  youll have to explain that to the inspector presently my man was constable mcnaughts quiet comment and still vigorously protesting his innocence the accused allowed himself to be led away and the body was conveyed to the station pending fuller identification  the next morning the papers were full of the tragedy a column and a half of the york herald was devoted to an account of lord arthur skelmertons plucky capture of the assassin the latter had continued to declare his innocence but had remarked it appears with grim humour that he quite saw he was in a tight place out of which however he would find it easy to extricate himself he had stated to the police that the deceaseds name was charles lavender a wellknown bookmaker which fact was soon verified for many of the murdered mans pals were still in the city  so far the most pushing of newspaper reporters had been unable to glean further information from the police no one doubted however but that the man in charge who gave his name as george higgins had killed the bookmaker for purposes of robbery the inquest had been fixed for the tuesday after the murder  lord arthur had been obliged to stay in york a few days as his evidence would be needed that fact gave the case perhaps a certain amount of interest as far as york and london society were concerned charles lavender moreover was well known on the turf but no bombshell exploding beneath the walls of the ancient cathedral city could more have astonished its inhabitants than the news which at about five in the afternoon on the day of the inquest spread like wildfire throughout the town that news was that the inquest had concluded at three oclock with a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown and that two hours later the police had arrested lord arthur skelmerton at his private residence the elms and charged him on a warrant with the murder of charles lavender the bookmaker     chapter viii  the capital charge   the police it appears instinctively feeling that some mystery lurked round the death of the bookmaker and his supposed murderers quiet protestations of innocence had taken a very considerable amount of trouble in collecting all the evidence they could for the inquest which might throw some light upon charles lavenders life previous to his tragic end thus it was that a very large array of witnesses was brought before the coroner chief among whom was of course lord arthur skelmerton  the first witnesses called were the two constables who deposed that just as the church clocks in the neighbourhood were striking eleven they had heard the cries for help had ridden to the spot whence the sounds proceeded and had found the prisoner in the tight grasp of lord arthur skelmerton who at once accused the man of murder and gave him in charge both constables gave the same version of the incident and both were positive as to the time when it occurred  medical evidence went to prove that the deceased had been stabbed from behind between the shoulderblades whilst he was walking that the wound was inflicted by a large hunting knife which was produced and which had been left sticking in the wound  lord arthur skelmerton was then called and substantially repeated what he had already told the constables he stated namely that on the night in question he had some gentlemen friends to dinner and afterwards bridge was played he himself was not playing much and at a few minutes before eleven he strolled out with a cigar as far as the pavilion at the end of his garden he then heard the voices the cry and the groan previously described by him and managed to hold the murderer down until the arrival of the constables  at this point the police proposed to call a witness james terry by name and a bookmaker by profession who had been chiefly instrumental in identifying the deceased a pal of his it was his evidence which first introduced that element of sensation into the case which culminated in the wildly exciting arrest of a dukes son upon a capital charge  it appears that on the evening after the ebor terry and lavender were in the bar of the black swan hotel having drinks  i had done pretty well over peppercorns fiasco he explained but poor old lavender was very much down in the dumps he had held only a few very small bets against the favourite and the rest of the day had been a poor one with him i asked him if he had any bets with the owner of peppercorn and he told me that he only held one for less than £500  i laughed and said that if he held one for £5000 it would make no difference as from what i had heard from the other fellows lord arthur skelmerton must be about stumped lavender seemed terribly put out at this and swore he would get that £500 out of lord arthur if no one else got another penny from him  its the only money ive made today he says to me i mean to get it  you wont i says  i will he says  you will have to look pretty sharp about it then i says for every one will be wanting to get something and first come first served  oh hell serve me right enough never you mind says lavender to me with a laugh if he dont pay up willingly ive got that in my pocket which will make him sit up and open my ladys eyes and sir john ettys too about their precious noble lord  then he seemed to think he had gone too far and wouldnt say anything more to me about that affair i saw him on the course the next day i asked him if he had got his £500 he said no but i shall get it today  lord arthur skelmerton after having given his own evidence had left the court it was therefore impossible to know how he would take this account which threw so serious a light upon an association with the dead man of which he himself had said nothing  nothing could shake james terrys account of the facts he had placed before the jury and when the police informed the coroner that they proposed to place george higgins himself in the witnessbox as his evidence would prove as it were a complement and corollary of that of terry the jury very eagerly assented  if james terry the bookmaker loud florid vulgar was an unprepossessing individual certainly george higgins who was still under the accusation of murder was ten thousand times more so  none too clean slouchy obsequious yet insolent he was the very personification of the cad who haunts the racecourse and who lives not so much by his own wits as by the lack of them in others he described himself as a turf commission agent whatever that may be  he stated that at about six oclock on the friday afternoon when the racecourse was still full of people all hurrying after the days excitements he himself happened to be standing close to the hedge which marks the boundary of lord arthur skelmertons grounds there is a pavilion there at the end of the garden he explained on slightly elevated ground and he could hear and see a group of ladies and gentlemen having tea some steps lead down a little to the left of the garden on to the course and presently he noticed at the bottom of these steps lord arthur skelmerton and charles lavender standing talking together he knew both gentlemen by sight but he could not see them very well as they were both partly hidden by the hedge he was quite sure that the gentlemen had not seen him and he could not help overhearing some of their conversation  thats my last word lavender lord arthur was saying very quietly i havent got the money and i cant pay you now youll have to wait  wait i cant wait said old lavender in reply ive got my engagements to meet same as you im not going to risk being posted up as a defaulter while you hold £500 of my money youd better give it me now or  but lord arthur interrupted him very quietly and said  yes my good man or  or ill let sir john have a good look at that little bill i had of yours a couple of years ago if youll remember my lord it has got at the bottom of it sir johns signature in your handwriting perhaps sir john or perhaps my lady would pay me something for that little bill if not the police can have a squint at it ive held my tongue long enough and  look here lavender said lord arthur do you know what this little game of yours is called in law  yes and i dont care says lavender if i dont have that £500 i am a ruined man if you ruin me ill do for you and we shall be quits thats my last word  he was talking very loudly and i thought some of lord arthurs friends up in the pavilion must have heard he thought so too i think for he said quickly  if you dont hold your confounded tongue ill give you in charge for blackmail this instant  you wouldnt dare says lavender and he began to laugh but just then a lady from the top of the steps said your tea is getting cold and lord arthur turned to go but just before he went lavender says to him ill come back tonight youll have the money then  george higgins it appears after he had heard this interesting conversation pondered as to whether he could not turn what he knew into some sort of profit being a gentleman who lives entirely by his wits this type of knowledge forms his chief source of income as a preliminary to future moves he decided not to lose sight of lavender for the rest of the day  lavender went and had dinner at the black swan explained mr george higgins and i after i had had a bite myself waited outside till i saw him come out at about ten oclock i was rewarded for my trouble he told the hall porter to get him a fly and he jumped into it i could not hear what direction he gave the driver but the fly certainly drove off towards the racecourse  now i was interested in this little affair continued the witness and i couldnt afford a fly i started to run of course i couldnt keep up with it but i thought i knew which way my gentleman had gone i made straight for the racecourse and for the hedge at the bottom of lord arthur skelmertons grounds  it was rather a dark night and there was a slight drizzle i couldnt see more than about a hundred yards before me all at once it seemed to me as if i heard lavenders voice talking loudly in the distance i hurried forward and suddenly saw a group of two figuresmere blurs in the darknessfor one instant at a distance of about fifty yards from where i was  the next moment one figure had fallen forward and the other had disappeared i ran to the spot only to find the body of the murdered man lying on the ground i stooped to see if i could be of any use to him and immediately i was collared from behind by lord arthur himself  you may imagine said the man in the corner how keen was the excitement of that moment in court coroner and jury alike literally hung breathless on every word that shabby vulgar individual uttered you see by itself his evidence would have been worth very little but coming on the top of that given by james terry its significancemore its truthhad become glaringly apparent closely crossexamined he adhered strictly to his statement and having finished his evidence george higgins remained in charge of the constables and the next witness of importance was called up  this was mr chipps the senior footman in the employment of lord arthur skelmerton he deposed that at about 1030 on the friday evening a party drove up to the elms in a fly and asked to see lord arthur on being told that his lordship had company he seemed terribly put out  i hasked the party to give me is card continued mr chipps as i didnt know perhaps that is lordship might wish to see im but i kept im standing at the all door as i didnt altogether like his looks i took the card in his lordship and the gentlemen was playin cards in the smokingroom and as soon as i could do so without disturbing is lordship i give him the partys card  what name was there on the card here interrupted the coroner  i couldnt say now sir replied mr chipps i dont really remember it was a name i had never seen before but i see so many visiting cards one way and the other in is lordships all that i cant remember all the names  then after a few minutes waiting you gave his lordship the card what happened then  is lordship didnt seem at all pleased said mr chipps with much guarded dignity but finally he said show him into the library chipps ill see him and he got up from the card table saying to the gentlemen go on without me ill be back in a minute or two  i was about to open the door for is lordship when my lady came into the room and then his lordship suddenly changed his mind like and said to me tell that man im busy and cant see him and e sat down again at the card table i went back to the all and told the party is lordship wouldnt see im e said oh it doesnt matter and went away quite quiet like  do you recollect at all at what time that was asked one of the jury  yes sir while i was waiting to speak to is lordship i looked at the clock sir it was twenty past ten sir  there was one more significant fact in connection with the case which tended still more to excite the curiosity of the public at the time and still further to bewilder the police later on and that fact was mentioned by chipps in his evidence the knife namely with which charles lavender had been stabbed and which remember had been left in the wound was now produced in court after a little hesitation chipps identified it as the property of his master lord arthur skelmerton  can you wonder then that the jury absolutely refused to bring in a verdict against george higgins there was really beyond lord arthur skelmertons testimony not one particle of evidence against him whilst as the day wore on and witness after witness was called up suspicion ripened in the minds of all those present that the murderer could be no other than lord arthur skelmerton himself  the knife was of course the strongest piece of circumstantial evidence and no doubt the police hoped to collect a great deal more now that they held a clue in their hands directly after the verdict therefore which was guardedly directed against some person unknown the police obtained a warrant and later on arrested lord arthur in his own house  the sensation of course was tremendous hours before he was brought up before the magistrate the approach to the court was thronged his friends mostly ladies were all eager you see to watch the dashing society man in so terrible a position there was universal sympathy for lady arthur who was in a very precarious state of health her worship of her worthless husband was well known small wonder that his final and awful misdeed had practically broken her heart the latest bulletin issued just after his arrest stated that her ladyship was not expected to live she was then in a comatose condition and all hope had perforce to be abandoned  at last the prisoner was brought in he looked very pale perhaps but otherwise kept up the bearing of a highbred gentleman he was accompanied by his solicitor sir marmaduke ingersoll who was evidently talking to him in quiet reassuring tones  mr buchanan prosecuted for the treasury and certainly his indictment was terrific according to him but one decision could be arrived at namely that the accused in the dock had in a moment of passion and perhaps of fear killed the blackmailer who threatened him with disclosures which might for ever have ruined him socially and having committed the deed and fearing its consequences probably realizing that the patrolling constables might catch sight of his retreating figure he had availed himself of george higginss presence on the spot to loudly accuse him of the murder  having concluded his able speech mr buchanan called his witnesses and the evidence which on second hearing seemed more damning than ever was all gone through again  sir marmaduke had no question to ask of the witnesses for the prosecution he stared at them placidly through his goldrimmed spectacles then he was ready to call his own for the defence colonel mcintosh ra was the first he was present at the bachelors party given by lord arthur the night of the murder his evidence tended at first to corroborate that of chipps the footman with regard to lord arthurs orders to show the visitor into the library and his counterorder as soon as his wife came into the room  did you not think it strange colonel asked mr buchanan that lord arthur should so suddenly have changed his mind about seeing his visitor  well not exactly strange said the colonel a fine manly soldierly figure who looked curiously out of his element in the witnessbox i dont think that it is a very rare occurrence for racing men to have certain acquaintances whom they would not wish their wives to know anything about  then it did not strike you that lord arthur skelmerton had some reason for not wishing his wife to know of that particular visitors presence in his house  i dont think that i gave the matter the slightest serious consideration was the colonels guarded reply  mr buchanan did not press the point and allowed the witness to conclude his statements  i had finished my turn at bridge he said and went out into the garden to smoke a cigar lord arthur skelmerton joined me a few minutes later and we were sitting in the pavilion when i heard a loud and as i thought threatening voice from the other side of the hedge  i did not catch the words but lord arthur said to me there seems to be a row down there ill go and have a look and see what it is i tried to dissuade him and certainly made no attempt to follow him but not more than half a minute could have elapsed before i heard a cry and a groan then lord arthurs footsteps hurrying down the wooden stairs which lead on to the racecourse  you may imagine said the man in the corner what severe crossexamination the gallant colonel had to undergo in order that his assertions might in some way be shaken by the prosecution but with military precision and frigid calm he repeated his important statements amidst a general silence through which you could have heard the proverbial pin  he had heard the threatening voice while sitting with lord arthur skelmerton then came the cry and groan and after that lord arthurs steps down the stairs he himself thought of following to see what had happened but it was a very dark night and he did not know the grounds very well while trying to find his way to the garden steps he heard lord arthurs cry for help the tramp of the patrolling constables horses and subsequently the whole scene between lord arthur the man higgins and the constables when he finally found his way to the stairs lord arthur was returning in order to send a groom for police assistance  the witness stuck to his points as he had to his guns at beckfontein a year ago nothing could shake him and sir marmaduke looked triumphantly across at his opposing colleague  with the gallant colonels statements the edifice of the prosecution certainly began to collapse you see there was not a particle of evidence to show that the accused had met and spoken to the deceased after the latters visit at the front door of the elms he told chipps that he wouldnt see the visitor and chipps went into the hall directly and showed lavender out the way he came no assignation could have been made no hint could have been given by the murdered man to lord arthur that he would go round to the back entrance and wished to see him there  two other guests of lord arthurs swore positively that after chipps had announced the visitor their host stayed at the cardtable until a quarter to eleven when evidently he went out to join colonel mcintosh in the garden sir marmadukes speech was clever in the extreme bit by bit he demolished that tower of strength the case against the accused basing his defence entirely upon the evidence of lord arthur skelmertons guests that night  until 1045 lord arthur was playing cards a quarter of an hour later the police were on the scene and the murder had been committed in the meanwhile colonel mcintoshs evidence proved conclusively that the accused had been sitting with him smoking a cigar it was obvious therefore clear as daylight concluded the great lawyer that his client was entitled to a full discharge nay more he thought that the police should have been more careful before they harrowed up public feeling by arresting a highborn gentleman on such insufficient evidence as they had brought forward  the question of the knife remained certainly but sir marmaduke passed over it with guarded eloquence placing that strange question in the category of those inexplicable coincidences which tend to puzzle the ablest detectives and cause them to commit such unpardonable blunders as the present one had been after all the footman may have been mistaken the pattern of that knife was not an exclusive one and he on behalf of his client flatly denied that it had ever belonged to him  well continued the man in the corner with the chuckle peculiar to him in moments of excitement the noble prisoner was discharged perhaps it would be invidious to say that he left the court without a stain on his character for i daresay you know from experience that the crime known as the york mystery has never been satisfactorily cleared up  many people shook their heads dubiously when they remembered that after all charles lavender was killed with a knife which one witness had sworn belonged to lord arthur others again reverted to the original theory that george higgins was the murderer that he and james terry had concocted the story of lavenders attempt at blackmail on lord arthur and that the murder had been committed for the sole purpose of robbery  be that as it may the police have not so far been able to collect sufficient evidence against higgins or terry and the crime has been classed by press and public alike in the category of socalled impenetrable mysteries     chapter ix  a brokenhearted woman   the man in the corner called for another glass of milk and drank it down slowly before he resumed  now lord arthur lives mostly abroad he said his poor suffering wife died the day after he was liberated by the magistrate she never recovered consciousness even sufficiently to hear the joyful news that the man she loved so well was innocent after all  mystery he added as if in answer to pollys own thoughts the murder of that man was never a mystery to me i cannot understand how the police could have been so blind when every one of the witnesses both for the prosecution and defence practically pointed all the time to the one guilty person what do you think of it all yourself  i think the whole case so bewildering she replied that i do not see one single clear point in it  you dont he said excitedly while the bony fingers fidgeted again with that inevitable bit of string you dont see that there is one point clear which to me was the key of the whole thing  lavender was murdered wasnt he lord arthur did not kill him he had at least in colonel mcintosh an unimpeachable witness to prove that he could not have committed that murderand yet he added with slow excited emphasis marking each sentence with a knot and yet he deliberately tries to throw the guilt upon a man who obviously was also innocent now why  he may have thought him guilty  or wished to shield or cover the retreat of one he knew to be guilty  i dont understand  think of someone he said excitedly someone whose desire would be as great as that of lord arthur to silence a scandal round that gentlemans name someone who unknown perhaps to lord arthur had overheard the same conversation which george higgins related to the police and the magistrate someone who whilst chipps was taking lavenders card in to his master had a few minutes time wherein to make an assignation with lavender promising him money no doubt in exchange for the compromising bills  surely you dont mean gasped polly  point number one he interrupted quietly utterly missed by the police george higgins in his deposition stated that at the most animated stage of lavenders conversation with lord arthur and when the bookmakers tone of voice became loud and threatening a voice from the top of the steps interrupted that conversation saying your tea is getting cold  yesbut she argued  wait a moment for there is point number two that voice was a ladys voice now i did exactly what the police should have done but did not do i went to have a look from the racecourse side at those garden steps which to my mind are such important factors in the discovery of this crime i found only about a dozen rather low steps anyone standing on the top must have heard every word charles lavender uttered the moment he raised his voice  even then  very well you grant that he said excitedly then there was the great the allimportant point which oddly enough the prosecution never for a moment took into consideration when chipps the footman first told lavender that lord arthur could not see him the bookmaker was terribly put out chipps then goes to speak to his master a few minutes elapse and when the footman once again tells lavender that his lordship wont see him the latter says very well and seems to treat the matter with complete indifference  obviously therefore something must have happened in between to alter the bookmakers frame of mind well what had happened think over all the evidence and you will see that one thing only had occurred in the interval namely lady arthurs advent into the room  in order to go into the smokingroom she must have crossed the hall she must have seen lavender in that brief interval she must have realized that the man was persistent and therefore a living danger to her husband remember women have done strange things they are a far greater puzzle to the student of human nature than the sterner less complex sex has ever been as i argued beforeas the police should have argued all alongwhy did lord arthur deliberately accuse an innocent man of murder if not to shield the guilty one  remember lady arthur may have been discovered the man george higgins may have caught sight of her before she had time to make good her retreat his attention as well us that of the constables had to be diverted lord arthur acted on the blind impulse of saving his wife at any cost  she may have been met by colonel mcintosh argued polly  perhaps she was he said who knows the gallant colonel had to swear to his friends innocence he could do that in all conscienceafter that his duty was accomplished no innocent man was suffering for the guilty the knife which had belonged to lord arthur would always save george higgins for a time it had pointed to the husband fortunately never to the wife poor thing she died probably of a broken heart but women when they love think only of one object on earththe one who is beloved  to me the whole thing was clear from the very first when i read the account of the murderthe knife stabbingbah dont i know enough of english crime not to be certain at once that no englishman be he ruffian from the gutter or be he dukes son ever stabs his victim in the back italians french spaniards do it if you will and women of most nations an englishmans instinct is to strike and not to stab george higgins or lord arthur skelmerton would have knocked their victim down the woman only would lie in wait till the enemys back was turned she knows her weakness and she does not mean to miss  think it over there is not one flaw in my argument but the police never thought the matter outperhaps in this case it was as well  he had gone and left miss polly burton still staring at the photograph of a pretty gentlelooking woman with a decided wilful curve round the mouth and a strange unaccountable look in the large pathetic eyes and the little journalist felt quite thankful that in this case the murder of charles lavender the bookmakercowardly wicked as it washad remained a mystery to the police and the public     chapter x  the mysterious death on the underground railway   it was all very well for mr richard frobisher of the london mail to cut up rough about it polly did not altogether blame him  she liked him all the better for that frank outburst of manlike illtemper which after all said and done was only a very flattering form of masculine jealousy  moreover polly distinctly felt guilty about the whole thing she had promised to meet dickiethat is mr richard frobisherat two oclock sharp outside the palace theatre because she wanted to go to a maud allan matinée and because he naturally wished to go with her  but at two oclock sharp she was still in norfolk street strand inside an abc shop sipping cold coffee opposite a grotesque old man who was fiddling with a bit of string  how could she be expected to remember maud allan or the palace theatre or dickie himself for a matter of that the man in the corner had begun to talk of that mysterious death on the underground railway and polly had lost count of time of place and circumstance  she had gone to lunch quite early for she was looking forward to the matinée at the palace  the old scarecrow was sitting in his accustomed place when she came into the abc shop but he had made no remark all the time that the young girl was munching her scone and butter she was just busy thinking how rude he was not even to have said good morning when an abrupt remark from him caused her to look up  will you be good enough he said suddenly to give me a description of the man who sat next to you just now while you were having your cup of coffee and scone  involuntarily polly turned her head towards the distant door through which a man in a light overcoat was even now quickly passing that man had certainly sat at the next table to hers when she first sat down to her coffee and scone he had finished his luncheonwhatever it wasmoment ago had paid at the desk and gone out the incident did not appear to polly as being of the slightest consequence  therefore she did not reply to the rude old man but shrugged her shoulders and called to the waitress to bring her bill  do you know if he was tall or short dark or fair continued the man in the corner seemingly not the least disconcerted by the young girls indifference can you tell me at all what he was like  of course i can rejoined polly impatiently but i dont see that my description of one of the customers of an abc shop can have the slightest importance  he was silent for a minute while his nervous fingers fumbled about in his capacious pockets in search of the inevitable piece of string when he had found this necessary adjunct to thought he viewed the young girl again through his halfclosed lids and added maliciously  but supposing it were of paramount importance that you should give an accurate description of a man who sat next to you for half an hour today how would you proceed  i should say that he was of medium height  five foot eight nine or ten he interrupted quietly  how can one tell to an inch or two rejoined polly crossly he was between colours  whats that he inquired blandly  neither fair nor darkhis nose  well what was his nose like will you sketch it  i am not an artist his nose was fairly straighthis eyes  were neither dark nor lighthis hair had the same striking peculiarityhe was neither short nor tallhis nose was neither aquiline nor snub he recapitulated sarcastically  no she retorted he was just ordinary looking  would you know him againsay tomorrow and among a number of other men who were neither tall nor short dark nor fair aquiline nor snubnosed etc  i dont knowi mighthe was certainly not striking enough to be specially remembered  exactly he said while he leant forward excitedly for all the world like a jackinthebox let loose precisely and you are a journalistcall yourself one at leastand it should be part of your business to notice and describe people i dont mean only the wonderful personage with the clear saxon features the fine blue eyes the noble brow and classic face but the ordinary personthe person who represents ninety out of every hundred of his own kindthe average englishman say of the middle classes who is neither very tall nor very short who wears a moustache which is neither fair nor dark but which masks his mouth and a top hat which hides the shape of his head and brow a man in fact who dresses like hundreds of his fellowcreatures moves like them speaks like them has no peculiarity  try to describe him to recognize him say a week hence among his other eightynine doubles worse still to swear his life away if he happened to be implicated in some crime wherein your recognition of him would place the halter round his neck  try that i say and having utterly failed you will more readily understand how one of the greatest scoundrels unhung is still at large and why the mystery on the underground railway was never cleared up  i think it was the only time in my life that i was seriously tempted to give the police the benefit of my own views upon the matter you see though i admire the brute for his cleverness i did not see that his being unpunished could possibly benefit any one  in these days of tubes and motor traction of all kinds the oldfashioned best cheapest and quickest route to city and west end is often deserted and the good old metropolitan railway carriages cannot at any time be said to be overcrowded anyway when that particular train steamed into aldgate at about 4 pm on march 18th last the firstclass carriages were all but empty  the guard marched up and down the platform looking into all the carriages to see if anyone had left a halfpenny evening paper behind for him and opening the door of one of the firstclass compartments he noticed a lady sitting in the further corner with her head turned away towards the window evidently oblivious of the fact that on this line aldgate is the terminal station  where are you for lady he said  the lady did not move and the guard stepped into the carriage thinking that perhaps the lady was asleep he touched her arm lightly and looked into her face in his own poetic language he was struck all of a eap in the glassy eyes the ashen colour of the cheeks the rigidity of the head there was the unmistakable look of death  hastily the guard having carefully locked the carriage door summoned a couple of porters and sent one of them off to the policestation and the other in search of the stationmaster  fortunately at this time of day the up platform is not very crowded all the traffic tending westward in the afternoon it was only when an inspector and two police constables accompanied by a detective in plain clothes and a medical officer appeared upon the scene and stood round a firstclass railway compartment that a few idlers realized that something unusual had occurred and crowded round eager and curious  thus it was that the later editions of the evening papers under the sensational heading mysterious suicide on the underground railway had already an account of the extraordinary event the medical officer had very soon come to the decision that the guard had not been mistaken and that life was indeed extinct  the lady was young and must have been very pretty before the look of fright and horror had so terribly distorted her features she was very elegantly dressed and the more frivolous papers were able to give their feminine readers a detailed account of the unfortunate womans gown her shoes hat and gloves  it appears that one of the latter the one on the right hand was partly off leaving the thumb and wrist bare that hand held a small satchel which the police opened with a view to the possible identification of the deceased but which was found to contain only a little loose silver some smellingsalts and a small empty bottle which was handed over to the medical officer for purposes of analysis  it was the presence of that small bottle which had caused the report to circulate freely that the mysterious case on the underground railway was one of suicide certain it was that neither about the ladys person nor in the appearance of the railway carriage was there the slightest sign of struggle or even of resistance only the look in the poor womans eyes spoke of sudden terror of the rapid vision of an unexpected and violent death which probably only lasted an infinitesimal fraction of a second but which had left its indelible mark upon the face otherwise so placid and so still  the body of the deceased was conveyed to the mortuary so far of course not a soul had been able to identify her or to throw the slightest light upon the mystery which hung around her death  against that quite a crowd of idlersgenuinely interested or notobtained admission to view the body on the pretext of having lost or mislaid a relative or a friend at about 830 pm a young man very well dressed drove up to the station in a hansom and sent in his card to the superintendent it was mr hazeldene shipping agent of 11 crown lane ec and no 19 addison row kensington  the young man looked in a pitiable state of mental distress his hand clutched nervously a copy of the st jamess gazette which contained the fatal news he said very little to the superintendent except that a person who was very dear to him had not returned home that evening  he had not felt really anxious until half an hour ago when suddenly he thought of looking at his paper the description of the deceased lady though vague had terribly alarmed him he had jumped into a hansom and now begged permission to view the body in order that his worst fears might be allayed  you know what followed of course continued the man in the corner the grief of the young man was truly pitiable in the woman lying there in a public mortuary before him mr hazeldene had recognized his wife  i am waxing melodramatic said the man in the corner who looked up at polly with a mild and gentle smile while his nervous fingers vainly endeavoured to add another knot on the scrappy bit of string with which he was continually playing and i fear that the whole story savours of the penny novelette but you must admit and no doubt you remember that it was an intensely pathetic and truly dramatic moment  the unfortunate young husband of the deceased lady was not much worried with questions that night as a matter of fact he was not in a fit condition to make any coherent statement it was at the coroners inquest on the following day that certain facts came to light which for the time being seemed to clear up the mystery surrounding mrs hazeldenes death only to plunge that same mystery later on into denser gloom than before  the first witness at the inquest was of course mr hazeldene himself i think every ones sympathy went out to the young man as he stood before the coroner and tried to throw what light he could upon the mystery he was well dressed as he had been the day before but he looked terribly ill and worried and no doubt the fact that he had not shaved gave his face a careworn and neglected air  it appears that he and the deceased had been married some six years or so and that they had always been happy in their married life they had no children mrs hazeldene seemed to enjoy the best of health till lately when she had had a slight attack of influenza in which dr arthur jones had attended her the doctor was present at this moment and would no doubt explain to the coroner and the jury whether he thought that mrs hazeldene had the slightest tendency to heart disease which might have had a sudden and fatal ending  the coroner was of course very considerate to the bereaved husband he tried by circumlocution to get at the point he wanted namely mrs hazeldenes mental condition lately mr hazeldene seemed loath to talk about this no doubt he had been warned as to the existence of the small bottle found in his wifes satchel  it certainly did seem to me at times he at last reluctantly admitted that my wife did not seem quite herself she used to be very gay and bright and lately i often saw her in the evening sitting as if brooding over some matters which evidently she did not care to communicate to me  still the coroner insisted and suggested the small bottle  i know i know replied the young man with a short heavy sigh you meanthe question of suicidei cannot understand it at allit seems so sudden and so terribleshe certainly had seemed listless and troubled latelybut only at timesand yesterday morning when i went to business she appeared quite herself again and i suggested that we should go to the opera in the evening she was delighted i know and told me she would do some shopping and pay a few calls in the afternoon  do you know at all where she intended to go when she got into the underground railway  well not with certainty you see she may have meant to get out at baker street and go down to bond street to do her shopping then again she sometimes goes to a shop in st pauls churchyard in which case she would take a ticket to aldersgate street but i cannot say  now mr hazeldene said the coroner at last very kindly will you try to tell me if there was anything in mrs hazeldenes life which you know of and which might in some measure explain the cause of the distressed state of mind which you yourself had noticed did there exist any financial difficulty which might have preyed upon mrs hazeldenes mind was there any friendto whose intercourse with mrs hazeldeneyouerat any time took exception in fact added the coroner as if thankful that he had got over an unpleasant moment can you give me the slightest indication which would tend to confirm the suspicion that the unfortunate lady in a moment of mental anxiety or derangement may have wished to take her own life  there was silence in the court for a few moments mr hazeldene seemed to every one there present to be labouring under some terrible moral doubt he looked very pale and wretched and twice attempted to speak before he at last said in scarcely audible tones  no there were no financial difficulties of any sort my wife had an independent fortune of her ownshe had no extravagant tastes  nor any friend you at any time objected to insisted the coroner  nor any friend iat any time objected to stammered the unfortunate young man evidently speaking with an effort  i was present at the inquest resumed the man in the corner after he had drunk a glass of milk and ordered another and i can assure you that the most obtuse person there plainly realized that mr hazeldene was telling a lie it was pretty plain to the meanest intelligence that the unfortunate lady had not fallen into a state of morbid dejection for nothing and that perhaps there existed a third person who could throw more light on her strange and sudden death than the unhappy bereaved young widower  that the death was more mysterious even than it had at first appeared became very soon apparent you read the case at the time no doubt and must remember the excitement in the public mind caused by the evidence of the two doctors dr arthur jones the ladys usual medical man who had attended her in a last very slight illness and who had seen her in a professional capacity fairly recently declared most emphatically that mrs hazeldene suffered from no organic complaint which could possibly have been the cause of sudden death moreover he had assisted mr andrew thornton the district medical officer in making a postmortem examination and together they had come to the conclusion that death was due to the action of prussic acid which had caused instantaneous failure of the heart but how the drug had been administered neither he nor his colleague were at present able to state  do i understand then dr jones that the deceased died poisoned with prussic acid  such is my opinion replied the doctor  did the bottle found in her satchel contain prussic acid  it had contained some at one time certainly  in your opinion then the lady caused her own death by taking a dose of that drug  pardon me i never suggested such a thing the lady died poisoned by the drug but how the drug was administered we cannot say by injection of some sort certainly the drug certainly was not swallowed there was not a vestige of it in the stomach  yes added the doctor in reply to another question from the coroner death had probably followed the injection in this case almost immediately say within a couple of minutes or perhaps three it was quite possible that the body would not have more than one quick and sudden convulsion perhaps not that death in such cases is absolutely sudden and crushing  i dont think that at the time any one in the room realized how important the doctors statement was a statement which by the way was confirmed in all its details by the district medical officer who had conducted the postmortem mrs hazeldene had died suddenly from an injection of prussic acid administered no one knew how or when she had been travelling in a firstclass railway carriage in a busy time of the day that young and elegant woman must have had singular nerve and coolness to go through the process of a selfinflicted injection of a deadly poison in the presence of perhaps two or three other persons  mind you when i say that no one there realized the importance of the doctors statement at that moment i am wrong there were three persons who fully understood at once the gravity of the situation and the astounding development which the case was beginning to assume  of course i should have put myself out of the question added the weird old man with that inimitable selfconceit peculiar to himself i guessed then and there in a moment where the police were going wrong and where they would go on going wrong until the mysterious death on the underground railway had sunk into oblivion together with the other cases which they mismanage from time to time  i said there were three persons who understood the gravity of the two doctors statementsthe other two were firstly the detective who had originally examined the railway carriage a young man of energy and plenty of misguided intelligence the other was mr hazeldene  at this point the interesting element of the whole story was first introduced into the proceedings and this was done through the humble channel of emma funnel mrs hazeldenes maid who as far as was known then was the last person who had seen the unfortunate lady alive and had spoken to her  mrs hazeldene lunched at home explained emma who was shy and spoke almost in a whisper she seemed well and cheerful she went out at about halfpast three and told me she was going to spences in st pauls churchyard to try on her new tailormade gown mrs hazeldene had meant to go there in the morning but was prevented as mr errington called  mr errington asked the coroner casually who is mr errington  but this emma found difficult to explain mr errington wasmr errington thats all  mr errington was a friend of the family he lived in a flat in the albert mansions he very often came to addison row and generally stayed late  pressed still further with questions emma at last stated that latterly mrs hazeldene had been to the theatre several times with mr errington and that on those nights the master looked very gloomy and was very cross  recalled the young widower was strangely reticent he gave forth his answers very grudgingly and the coroner was evidently absolutely satisfied with himself at the marvellous way in which after a quarter of an hour of firm yet very kind questionings he had elicited from the witness what information he wanted  mr errington was a friend of his wife he was a gentleman of means and seemed to have a great deal of time at his command he himself did not particularly care about mr errington but he certainly had never made any observations to his wife on the subject  but who is mr errington repeated the coroner once more what does he do what is his business or profession  he has no business or profession  what is his occupation then  he has no special occupation he has ample private means but he has a great and very absorbing hobby  what is that  he spends all his time in chemical experiments and is i believe as an amateur a very distinguished toxicologist     chapter xi  mr errington   did you ever see mr errington the gentleman so closely connected with the mysterious death on the underground railway asked the man in the corner as he placed one or two of his little snapshot photos before miss polly burton  there he is to the very life fairly goodlooking a pleasant face enough but ordinary absolutely ordinary  it was this absence of any peculiarity which very nearly but not quite placed the halter round mr erringtons neck  but i am going too fast and you will lose the thread  the public of course never heard how it actually came about that mr errington the wealthy bachelor of albert mansions of the grosvenor and other young dandies clubs one fine day found himself before the magistrates at bow street charged with being concerned in the death of mary beatrice hazeldene late of no 19 addison row  i can assure you both press and public were literally flabbergasted you see mr errington was a wellknown and very popular member of a certain smart section of london society he was a constant visitor at the opera the racecourse the park and the carlton he had a great many friends and there was consequently quite a large attendance at the police court that morning  what had transpired was this  after the very scrappy bits of evidence which came to light at the inquest two gentlemen bethought themselves that perhaps they had some duty to perform towards the state and the public generally accordingly they had come forward offering to throw what light they could upon the mysterious affair on the underground railway  the police naturally felt that their information such as it was came rather late in the day but as it proved of paramount importance and the two gentlemen moreover were of undoubtedly good position in the world they were thankful for what they could get and acted accordingly they accordingly brought mr errington up before the magistrate on a charge of murder  the accused looked pale and worried when i first caught sight of him in the court that day which was not to be wondered at considering the terrible position in which he found himself  he had been arrested at marseilles where he was preparing to start for colombo  i dont think he realized how terrible his position really was until later in the proceedings when all the evidence relating to the arrest had been heard and emma funnel had repeated her statement as to mr erringtons call at 19 addison row in the morning and mrs hazeldene starting off for st pauls churchyard at 330 in the afternoon  mr hazeldene had nothing to add to the statements he had made at the coroners inquest he had last seen his wife alive on the morning of the fatal day she had seemed very well and cheerful  i think every one present understood that he was trying to say as little as possible that could in any way couple his deceased wifes name with that of the accused  and yet from the servants evidence it undoubtedly leaked out that mrs hazeldene who was young pretty and evidently fond of admiration had once or twice annoyed her husband by her somewhat open yet perfectly innocent flirtation with mr errington  i think every one was most agreeably impressed by the widowers moderate and dignified attitude you will see his photo there among this bundle that is just how he appeared in court in deep black of course but without any sign of ostentation in his mourning he had allowed his beard to grow lately and wore it closely cut in a point  after his evidence the sensation of the day occurred a tall darkhaired man with the word city written metaphorically all over him had kissed the book and was waiting to tell the truth and nothing but the truth  he gave his name as andrew campbell head of the firm of campbell  co brokers of throgmorton street  in the afternoon of march 18th mr campbell travelling on the underground railway had noticed a very pretty woman in the same carriage as himself she had asked him if she was in the right train for aldersgate mr campbell replied in the affirmative and then buried himself in the stock exchange quotations of his evening paper  at gower street a gentleman in a tweed suit and bowler hat got into the carriage and took a seat opposite the lady  she seemed very much astonished at seeing him but mr andrew campbell did not recollect the exact words she said  the two talked to one another a good deal and certainly the lady appeared animated and cheerful witness took no notice of them he was very much engrossed in some calculations and finally got out at farringdon street he noticed that the man in the tweed suit also got out close behind him having shaken hands with the lady and said in a pleasant way au revoir dont be late tonight mr campbell did not hear the ladys reply and soon lost sight of the man in the crowd  every one was on tenterhooks and eagerly waiting for the palpitating moment when witness would describe and identify the man who last had seen and spoken to the unfortunate woman within five minutes probably of her strange and unaccountable death  personally i knew what was coming before the scotch stockbroker spoke  i could have jotted down the graphic and lifelike description he would give of a probable murderer it would have fitted equally well the man who sat and had luncheon at this table just now it would certainly have described five out of every ten young englishmen you know  the individual was of medium height he wore a moustache which was not very fair nor yet very dark his hair was between colours he wore a bowler hat and a tweed suitandandthat was allmr campbell might perhaps know him again but then again he might nothe was not paying much attentionthe gentleman was sitting on the same side of the carriage as himselfand he had his hat on all the time he himself was busy with his newspaperyeshe might know him againbut he really could not say  mr andrew campbells evidence was not worth very much you will say no it was not in itself and would not have justified any arrest were it not for the additional statements made by mr james verner manager of messrs rodney  co colour printers  mr verner is a personal friend of mr andrew campbell and it appears that at farringdon street where he was waiting for his train he saw mr campbell get out of a firstclass railway carriage mr verner spoke to him for a second and then just as the train was moving off he stepped into the same compartment which had just been vacated by the stockbroker and the man in the tweed suit he vaguely recollects a lady sitting in the opposite corner to his own with her face turned away from him apparently asleep but he paid no special attention to her he was like nearly all business men when they are travellingengrossed in his paper presently a special quotation interested him he wished to make a note of it took out a pencil from his waistcoat pocket and seeing a clean piece of pasteboard on the floor he picked it up and scribbled on it the memorandum which he wished to keep he then slipped the card into his pocketbook  it was only two or three days later added mr verner in the midst of breathless silence that i had occasion to refer to these same notes again  in the meanwhile the papers had been full of the mysterious death on the underground railway and the names of those connected with it were pretty familiar to me it was therefore with much astonishment that on looking at the pasteboard which i had casually picked up in the railway carriage i saw the name on it frank errington  there was no doubt that the sensation in court was almost unprecedented never since the days of the fenchurch street mystery and the trial of smethurst had i seen so much excitement mind you i was not excitedi knew by now every detail of that crime as if i had committed it myself in fact i could not have done it better although i have been a student of crime for many years now many people therehis friends mostlybelieved that errington was doomed i think he thought so too for i could see that his face was terribly white and he now and then passed his tongue over his lips as if they were parched  you see he was in the awful dilemmaa perfectly natural one by the wayof being absolutely incapable of proving an alibi the crimeif crime there washad been committed three weeks ago a man about town like mr frank errington might remember that he spent certain hours of a special afternoon at his club or in the park but it is very doubtful in nine cases out of ten if he can find a friend who could positively swear as to having seen him there no no mr errington was in a tight corner and he knew it you see there werebesides the evidencetwo or three circumstances which did not improve matters for him his hobby in the direction of toxicology to begin with the police had found in his room every description of poisonous substances including prussic acid  then again that journey to marseilles the start for colombo was though perfectly innocent a very unfortunate one mr errington had gone on an aimless voyage but the public thought that he had fled terrified at his own crime sir arthur inglewood however here again displayed his marvellous skill on behalf of his client by the masterly way in which he literally turned all the witnesses for the crown inside out  having first got mr andrew campbell to state positively that in the accused he certainly did not recognize the man in the tweed suit the eminent lawyer after twenty minutes crossexamination had so completely upset the stockbrokers equanimity that it is very likely he would not have recognized his own officeboy  but through all his flurry and all his annoyance mr andrew campbell remained very sure of one thing namely that the lady was alive and cheerful and talking pleasantly with the man in the tweed suit up to the moment when the latter having shaken hands with her left her with a pleasant au revoir dont be late tonight he had heard neither scream nor struggle and in his opinion if the individual in the tweed suit had administered a dose of poison to his companion it must have been with her own knowledge and free will and the lady in the train most emphatically neither looked nor spoke like a woman prepared for a sudden and violent death  mr james verner against that swore equally positively that he had stood in full view of the carriage door from the moment that mr campbell got out until he himself stepped into the compartment that there was no one else in that carriage between farringdon street and aldgate and that the lady to the best of his belief had made no movement during the whole of that journey  no frank errington was not committed for trial on the capital charge said the man in the corner with one of his sardonic smiles thanks to the cleverness of sir arthur inglewood his lawyer he absolutely denied his identity with the man in the tweed suit and swore he had not seen mrs hazeldene since eleven oclock in the morning of that fatal day there was no proof that he had moreover according to mr campbells opinion the man in the tweed suit was in all probability not the murderer common sense would not admit that a woman could have a deadly poison injected into her without her knowledge while chatting pleasantly to her murderer  mr errington lives abroad now he is about to marry i dont think any of his real friends for a moment believed that he committed the dastardly crime the police think they know better they do know this much that it could not have been a case of suicide that if the man who undoubtedly travelled with mrs hazeldene on that fatal afternoon had no crime upon his conscience he would long ago have come forward and thrown what light he could upon the mystery  as to who that man was the police in their blindness have not the faintest doubt under the unshakable belief that errington is guilty they have spent the last few months in unceasing labour to try and find further and stronger proofs of his guilt but they wont find them because there are none there are no positive proofs against the actual murderer for he was one of those clever blackguards who think of everything foresee every eventuality who know human nature well and can foretell exactly what evidence will be brought against them and act accordingly  this blackguard from the first kept the figure the personality of frank errington before his mind frank errington was the dust which the scoundrel threw metaphorically in the eyes of the police and you must admit that he succeeded in blinding themto the extent even of making them entirely forget the one simple little sentence overheard by mr andrew campbell and which was of course the clue to the whole thingthe only slip the cunning rogue madeau revoir dont be late tonight mrs hazeldene was going that night to the opera with her husband  you are astonished he added with a shrug of the shoulders you do not see the tragedy yet as i have seen it before me all along the frivolous young wife the flirtation with the friendall a blind all pretence i took the trouble which the police should have taken immediately of finding out something about the finances of the hazeldene ménage money is in nine cases out of ten the keynote to a crime  i found that the will of mary beatrice hazeldene had been proved by the husband her sole executor the estate being sworn at £15000 i found out moreover that mr edward sholto hazeldene was a poor shippers clerk when he married the daughter of a wealthy builder in kensingtonand then i made note of the fact that the disconsolate widower had allowed his beard to grow since the death of his wife  theres no doubt that he was a clever rogue added the strange creature leaning excitedly over the table and peering into pollys face do you know how that deadly poison was injected into the poor womans system by the simplest of all means one known to every scoundrel in southern europe a ringyes a ring which has a tiny hollow needle capable of holding a sufficient quantity of prussic acid to have killed two persons instead of one the man in the tweed suit shook hands with his fair companionprobably she hardly felt the prick not sufficiently in any case to make her utter a scream and mind you the scoundrel had every facility through his friendship with mr errington of procuring what poison he required not to mention his friends visiting card we cannot gauge how many months ago he began to try and copy frank errington in his style of dress the cut of his moustache his general appearance making the change probably so gradual that no one in his own entourage would notice it he selected for his model a man his own height and build with the same coloured hair  but there was the terrible risk of being identified by his fellowtraveller in the underground suggested polly  yes there certainly was that risk he chose to take it and he was wise he reckoned that several days would in any case elapse before that person who by the way was a business man absorbed in his newspaper would actually see him again the great secret of successful crime is to study human nature added the man in the corner as he began looking for his hat and coat edward hazeldene knew it well  but the ring  he may have bought that when he was on his honeymoon he suggested with a grim chuckle the tragedy was not planned in a week it may have taken years to mature but you will own that there goes a frightful scoundrel unhung i have left you his photograph as he was a year ago and as he is now you will see he has shaved his beard again but also his moustache i fancy he is a friend now of mr andrew campbell  he left miss polly burton wondering not knowing what to believe  and that is why she missed her appointment with mr richard frobisher of the london mail to go and see maud allan dance at the palace theatre that afternoon     chapter xii  the liverpool mystery   a titlea foreign title i meanis always very useful for purposes of swindles and frauds remarked the man in the corner to polly one day the cleverest robberies of modern times were perpetrated lately in vienna by a man who dubbed himself lord seymour whilst over here the same class of thief calls himself count something ending in o or prince the other ending in off  fortunately for our hotel and lodginghouse keepers over here she replied they are beginning to be more alive to the ways of foreign swindlers and look upon all titled gentry who speak broken english as possible swindlers or thieves  the result sometimes being exceedingly unpleasant to the real grands seigneurs who honour this country at times with their visits replied the man in the corner now take the case of prince semionicz a man whose sixteen quarterings are duly recorded in gotha who carried enough luggage with him to pay for the use of every room in an hotel for at least a week whose gold cigarette case with diamond and turquoise ornament was actually stolen without his taking the slightest trouble to try and recover it that same man was undoubtedly looked upon with suspicion by the manager of the liverpool northwestern hotel from the moment that his secretarya dapper somewhat vulgar little frenchmanbespoke on behalf of his employer with himself and a valet the best suite of rooms the hotel contained  obviously those suspicions were unfounded for the little secretary as soon as prince semionicz had arrived deposited with the manager a pile of bank notes also papers and bonds the value of which would exceed tenfold the most outrageous bill that could possibly be placed before the noble visitor moreover m albert lambert explained that the prince who only meant to stay in liverpool a few days was on his way to chicago where he wished to visit princess anna semionicz his sister who was married to mr girwan the great copper king and multimillionaire  yet as i told you before in spite of all these undoubted securities suspicion of the wealthy russian prince lurked in the minds of most liverpudlians who came in business contact with him he had been at the northwestern two days when he sent his secretary to window and vassall the jewellers of bold street with a request that they would kindly send a representative round to the hotel with some nice pieces of jewellery diamonds and pearls chiefly which he was desirous of taking as a present to his sister in chicago  mr winslow took the order from m albert with a pleasant bow then he went to his inner office and consulted with his partner mr vassall as to the best course to adopt both the gentlemen were desirous of doing business for business had been very slack lately neither wished to refuse a possible customer or to offend mr pettitt the manager of the northwestern who had recommended them to the prince but that foreign title and the vulgar little french secretary stuck in the throats of the two pompous and worthy liverpool jewellers and together they agreed firstly that no credit should be given and secondly that if a cheque or even a bankers draft were tendered the jewels were not to be given up until that cheque or draft was cashed  then came the question as to who should take the jewels to the hotel it was altogether against business etiquette for the senior partners to do such errands themselves moreover it was thought that it would be easier for a clerk to explain without giving undue offence that he could not take the responsibility of a cheque or draft without having cashed it previously to giving up the jewels  then there was the question of the probable necessity of conferring in a foreign tongue the head assistant charles needham who had been in the employ of winslow and vassall for over twelve years was in true british fashion ignorant of any language save his own it was therefore decided to dispatch mr schwarz a young german clerk lately arrived on the delicate errand  mr schwarz was mr winslows nephew and godson a sister of that gentleman having married the head of the great german firm of schwarz  co silversmiths of hamburg and berlin  the young man had soon become a great favourite with his uncle whose heir he would presumably be as mr winslow had no children  at first mr vassall made some demur about sending mr schwarz with so many valuable jewels alone in a city which he had not yet had the time to study thoroughly but finally he allowed himself to be persuaded by his senior partner and a fine selection of necklaces pendants bracelets and rings amounting in value to over £16000 having been made it was decided that mr schwarz should go to the northwestern in a cab the next day at about three oclock in the afternoon this he accordingly did the following day being a thursday  business went on in the shop as usual under the direction of the head assistant until about seven oclock when mr winslow returned from his club where he usually spent an hour over the papers every afternoon and at once asked for his nephew to his astonishment mr needham informed him that mr schwarz had not yet returned this seemed a little strange and mr winslow with a slightly anxious look in his face went into the inner office in order to consult his junior partner mr vassall offered to go round to the hotel and interview mr pettitt  i was beginning to get anxious myself he said but did not quite like to say so i have been in over half an hour hoping every moment that you would come in and that perhaps you could give me some reassuring news i thought that perhaps you had met mr schwarz and were coming back together  however mr vassall walked round to the hotel and interviewed the hall porter the latter perfectly well remembered mr schwarz sending in his card to prince semionicz  at what time was that asked mr vassall  about ten minutes past three sir when he came it was about an hour later when he left  when he left gasped more than said mr vassall  yes sir mr schwarz left here about a quarter before four sir  are you quite sure  quite sure mr pettitt was in the hall when he left and he asked him something about business mr schwarz laughed and said not bad i hope theres nothing wrong sir added the man  ohernothingthank you can i see mr pettitt  certainly sir  mr pettitt the manager of the hotel shared mr vassalls anxiety immediately he heard that the young german had not yet returned home  i spoke to him a little before four oclock we had just switched on the electric light which we always do these winter months at that hour but i shouldnt worry myself mr vassall the young man may have seen to some business on his way home youll probably find him in when you go back  apparently somewhat reassured mr vassall thanked mr pettitt and hurried back to the shop only to find that mr schwarz had not returned though it was now close on eight oclock  mr winslow looked so haggard and upset that it would have been cruel to heap reproaches upon his other troubles or to utter so much as the faintest suspicion that young schwarzs permanent disappearance with £16000 in jewels and money was within the bounds of probability  there was one chance left but under the circumstances a very slight one indeed the winslows private house was up the birkenhead end of the town young schwarz had been living with them ever since his arrival in liverpool and he may haveeither not feeling well or for some other reasongone straight home without calling at the shop it was unlikely as valuable jewellery was never kept at the private house butit just might have happened  it would be useless continued the man in the corner and decidedly uninteresting were i to relate to you messrs winslows and vassalls further anxieties with regard to the missing young man suffice it to say that on reaching his private house mr winslow found that his godson had neither returned nor sent any telegraphic message of any kind  not wishing to needlessly alarm his wife mr winslow made an attempt at eating his dinner but directly after that he hurried back to the northwestern hotel and asked to see prince semionicz the prince was at the theatre with his secretary and probably would not be home until nearly midnight  mr winslow then not knowing what to think nor yet what to fear and in spite of the horror he felt of giving publicity to his nephews disappearance thought it his duty to go round to the policestation and interview the inspector it is wonderful how quickly news of that type travels in a large city like liverpool already the morning papers of the following day were full of the latest sensation mysterious disappearance of a wellknown tradesman  mr winslow found a copy of the paper containing the sensational announcement on his breakfasttable it lay side by side with a letter addressed to him in his nephews handwriting which had been posted in liverpool  mr winslow placed that letter written to him by his nephew into the hands of the police its contents therefore quickly became public property the astounding statements made therein by mr schwarz created in quiet businesslike liverpool a sensation which has seldom been equalled  it appears that the young fellow did call on prince semionicz at a quarter past three on wednesday december 10th with a bag full of jewels amounting in value to some £16000 the prince duly admired and finally selected from among the ornaments a necklace pendant and bracelet the whole being priced by mr schwarz according to his instructions at £10500 prince semionicz was most prompt and businesslike in his dealings  you will require immediate payment for these of course he said in perfect english and i know you business men prefer solid cash to cheques especially when dealing with foreigners i always provide myself with plenty of bank of england notes in consequence he added with a pleasant smile as £10500 in gold would perhaps be a little inconvenient to carry if you will kindly make out the receipt my secretary m lambert will settle all business matters with you  he thereupon took the jewels he had selected and locked them up in his dressingcase the beautiful silver fillings of which mr schwarz just caught a short glimpse of then having been accommodated with paper and ink the young jeweller made out the account and receipt whilst m lambert the secretary counted out before him 105 crisp bank of england notes of £100 each then with a final bow to his exceedingly urbane and eminently satisfactory customer mr schwarz took his leave in the hall he saw and spoke to mr pettitt and then he went out into the street  he had just left the hotel and was about to cross towards st georges hall when a gentleman in a magnificent fur coat stepped quickly out of a cab which had been stationed near the kerb and touching him lightly upon the shoulder said with an unmistakable air of authority at the same time handing him a card  that is my name i must speak with you immediately  schwarz glanced at the card and by the light of the arc lamps above his head read on it the name of dimitri slaviansky burgreneff de la iiie section de la police imperial de sm le czar  quickly the owner of the unpronounceable name and the significant title pointed to the cab from which he had just alighted and schwarz whose every suspicion with regard to his princely customer bristled up in one moment clutched his bag and followed his imposing interlocutor as soon as they were both comfortably seated in the cab the latter began with courteous apology in broken but fluent english  i must ask your pardon sir for thus trespassing upon your valuable time and i certainly should not have done so but for the certainty that our interests in a certain matter which i have in hand are practically identical in so far that we both should wish to outwit a clever rogue  instinctively and his mind full of terrible apprehension mr schwarzs hand wandered to his pocketbook filled to overflowing with the banknotes which he had so lately received from the prince  ah i see interposed the courteous russian with a smile he has played the confidence trick on you with the usual addition of so many socalled banknotes  socalled gasped the unfortunate young man  i dont think i often err in my estimate of my own countrymen continued m burgreneff i have vast experience you must remember therefore i doubt if i am doing merwhat does he call himselfprince somethingan injustice if i assert even without handling those crisp bits of paper you have in your pocketbook that no bank would exchange them for gold  remembering his uncles suspicions and his own mr schwarz cursed himself for his blindness and folly in accepting notes so easily without for a moment imagining that they might be false now with every one of those suspicions fully on the alert he felt the bits of paper with nervous anxious fingers while the imperturbable russian calmly struck a match  see here he said pointing to one of the notes the shape of that w in the signature of the chief cashier i am not an english police officer but i could pick out that spurious w among a thousand genuine ones you see i have seen a good many  now of course poor young schwarz had not seen very many bank of england notes he could not have told whether one w in mr bowens signature is better than another but though he did not speak english nearly as fluently as his pompous interlocutor he understood every word of the appalling statement the latter had just made  then that prince he said at the hotel  is no more prince than you and i my dear sir concluded the gentleman of his imperial majestys police calmly  and the jewels mr winslows jewels  with the jewels there may be a chanceoh a mere chance these forged banknotes which you accepted so trustingly may prove the means of recovering your property  how  the penalty of forging and circulating spurious banknotes is very heavy you know that the fear of seven years penal servitude will act as a wonderful sedative upon theerprinces joyful mood he will give up the jewels to me all right enough never you fear he knows added the russian officer grimly that there are plenty of old scores to settle up without the additional one of forged banknotes our interests you see are identical may i rely on your cooperation  oh i will do as you wish said the delighted young german mr winslow and mr vassall they trusted me and i have been such a fool i hope it is not too late  i think not said m burgreneff his hand already on the door of the cab though i have been talking to you i have kept an eye on the hotel and our friend the prince has not yet gone out we are accustomed you know to have eyes everywhere we of the russian secret police i dont think that i will ask you to be present at the confrontation perhaps you will wait for me in the cab there is a nasty fog outside and you will be more private will you give me those beautiful banknotes thank you dont be anxious i wont be long  he lifted his hat and slipped the notes into the inner pocket of his magnificent fur coat as he did so mr schwarz caught sight of a rich uniform and a wide sash which no doubt was destined to carry additional moral weight with the clever rogue upstairs  then his imperial majestys police officer stepped quickly out of the cab and mr schwarz was left alone     chapter xiii  a cunning rascal   yes left severely alone continued the man in the corner with a sarcastic chuckle so severely alone in fact that one quarter of an hour after another passed by and still the magnificent police officer in the gorgeous uniform did not return then when it was too late schwarz cursed himself once again for the doubledyed idiot that he was he had been only too ready to believe that prince semionicz was a liar and a rogue and under these unjust suspicions he had fallen an all too easy prey to one of the most cunning rascals he had ever come across  an inquiry from the hall porter at the northwestern elicited the fact that no such personage as mr schwarz described had entered the hotel the young man asked to see prince semionicz hoping against hope that all was not yet lost the prince received him most courteously he was dictating some letters to his secretary while the valet was in the next room preparing his masters evening clothes mr schwarz found it very difficult to explain what he actually did want  there stood the dressingcase in which the prince had locked up the jewels and there the bag from which the secretary had taken the banknotes after much hesitation on schwarzs part and much impatience on that of the prince the young man blurted out the whole story of the socalled russian police officer whose card he still held in his hand  the prince it appears took the whole thing wonderfully goodnaturedly no doubt he thought the jeweller a hopeless fool he showed him the jewels the receipt he held and also a large bundle of banknotes similar to those schwarz had with such culpable folly given up to the clever rascal in the cab  i pay all my bills with bank of england notes mr schwarz it would have been wiser perhaps if you had spoken to the manager of the hotel about me before you were so ready to believe any cockandbull story about my supposed rogueries  finally he placed a small 16mo volume before the young jeweller and said with a pleasant smile  if people in this country who are in a large way of business and are therefore likely to come in contact with people of foreign nationality were to study these little volumes before doing business with any foreigner who claims a title much disappointment and a great loss would often be saved now in this case had you looked up page 797 of this little volume of gothas almanach you would have seen my name in it and known from the first that the socalled russian detective was a liar  there was nothing more to be said and mr schwarz left the hotel no doubt now that he had been hopelessly duped he dared not go home and half hoped by communicating with the police that they might succeed in arresting the thief before he had time to leave liverpool he interviewed detectiveinspector watson and was at once confronted with the awful difficulty which would make the recovery of the banknotes practically hopeless he had never had the time or opportunity of jotting down the numbers of the notes  mr winslow though terribly wrathful against his nephew did not wish to keep him out of his home as soon as he had received schwarzs letter he traced him with inspector watsons help to his lodgings in north street where the unfortunate young man meant to remain hidden until the terrible storm had blown over or perhaps until the thief had been caught redhanded with the booty still in his hands  this happy event needless to say never did occur though the police made every effort to trace the man who had decoyed schwarz into the cab his appearance was such an uncommon one it seemed most unlikely that no one in liverpool should have noticed him after he left that cab the wonderful fur coat the long beard all must have been noticeable even though it was past four oclock on a somewhat foggy december afternoon  but every investigation proved futile no one answering schwarzs description of the man had been seen anywhere the papers continued to refer to the case as the liverpool mystery scotland yard sent mr fairburn downthe celebrated detectiveat the request of the liverpool police to help in the investigations but nothing availed  prince semionicz with his suite left liverpool and he who had attempted to blacken his character and had succeeded in robbing messrs winslow and vassall of £10500 had completely disappeared  the man in the corner readjusted his collar and necktie which during the narrative of this interesting mystery had worked its way up his long cranelike neck under his large flappy ears his costume of checked tweed of a peculiarly loud pattern had tickled the fancy of some of the waitresses who were standing gazing at him and giggling in one corner this evidently made him nervous he gazed up very meekly at polly looking for all the world like a baldheaded adjutant dressed for a holiday  of course all sorts of theories of the theft got about at first one of the most popular and at the same time most quickly exploded being that young schwarz had told a cockandbull story and was the actual thief himself  however as i said before that was very quickly exploded as mr schwarz senior a very wealthy merchant never allowed his sons carelessness to be a serious loss to his kind employers as soon as he thoroughly grasped all the circumstances of the extraordinary case he drew a cheque for £10500 and remitted it to messrs winslow and vassall it was just but it was also highminded  all liverpool knew of the generous action as mr winslow took care that it should and any evil suspicion regarding young mr schwarz vanished as quickly as it had come  then of course there was the theory about the prince and his suite and to this day i fancy there are plenty of people in liverpool and also in london who declare that the socalled russian police officer was a confederate no doubt that theory was very plausible and messrs winslow and vassall spent a good deal of money in trying to prove a case against the russian prince  very soon however that theory was also bound to collapse mr fairburn whose reputation as an investigator of crime waxes in direct inverted ratio to his capacities did hit upon the obvious course of interviewing the managers of the larger london and liverpool agents de change he soon found that prince semionicz had converted a great deal of russian and french money into english banknotes since his arrival in this country more than £30000 in good solid honest money was traced to the pockets of the gentleman with the sixteen quarterings it seemed therefore more than improbable that a man who was obviously fairly wealthy would risk imprisonment and hard labour if not worse for the sake of increasing his fortune by £10000  however the theory of the princes guilt has taken firm root in the dull minds of our police authorities they have had every information with regard to prince semioniczs antecedents from russia his position his wealth have been placed above suspicion and yet they suspect and go on suspecting him or his secretary they have communicated with the police of every european capital and while they still hope to obtain sufficient evidence against those they suspect they calmly allow the guilty to enjoy the fruit of his clever roguery  the guilty said polly who do you think  who do i think knew at that moment that young schwarz had money in his possession he said excitedly wriggling in his chair like a jackinthebox obviously some one was guilty of that theft who knew that schwarz had gone to interview a rich russian and would in all probability return with a large sum of money in his possession  who indeed but the prince and his secretary she argued but just now you said  just now i said that the police were determined to find the prince and his secretary guilty they did not look further than their own stumpy noses messrs winslow and vassall spent money with a free hand in those investigations mr winslow as the senior partner stood to lose over £9000 by that robbery now with mr vassall it was different  when i saw how the police went on blundering in this case i took the trouble to make certain inquiries the whole thing interested me so much and i learnt all that i wished to know i found out namely that mr vassall was very much a junior partner in the firm that he only drew ten per cent of the profits having been promoted lately to a partnership from having been senior assistant  now the police did not take the trouble to find that out  but you dont mean that  i mean that in all cases where robbery affects more than one person the first thing to find out is whether it affects the second party equally with the first i proved that to you didnt i over that robbery in phillimore terrace there as here one of the two parties stood to lose very little in comparison with the other  even then she began  wait a moment for i found out something more the moment i had ascertained that mr vassall was not drawing more than about £500 a year from the business profits i tried to ascertain at what rate he lived and what were his chief vices i found that he kept a fine house in albert terrace now the rents of those houses are £250 a year therefore speculation horseracing or some sort of gambling must help to keep up that establishment speculation and most forms of gambling are synonymous with debt and ruin it is only a question of time whether mr vassall was in debt or not at the time that i cannot say but this i do know that ever since that unfortunate loss to him of about £1000 he has kept his house in nicer style than before and he now has a good banking account at the lancashire and liverpool bank which he opened a year after his heavy loss  but it must have been very difficult argued polly  what he said to have planned out the whole thing for carrying it out was mere childs play he had twentyfour hours in which to put his plan into execution why what was there to do firstly to go to a local printer in some outoftheway part of the town and get him to print a few cards with the highsounding name that of course is done while you wait beyond that there was the purchase of a good secondhand uniform fur coat and a beard and a wig from a costumiers  no no the execution was not difficult it was the planning of it all the daring that was so fine schwarz of course was a foreigner he had only been in england a little over a fortnight vassalls broken english misled him probably he did not know the junior partner very intimately i have no doubt that but for his uncles absurd british prejudice and suspicions against the russian prince schwarz would not have been so ready to believe in the latters roguery as i said it would be a great boon if english tradesmen studied gotha more but it was clever wasnt it i couldnt have done it much better myself  that last sentence was so characteristic before polly could think of some plausible argument against his theory he was gone and she was trying vainly to find another solution to the liverpool mystery     chapter xiv  the edinburgh mystery   the man in the corner had not enjoyed his lunch miss polly burton could see that he had something on his mind for even before he began to talk that morning he was fidgeting with his bit of string and setting all her nerves on the jar  have you ever felt real sympathy with a criminal or a thief he asked her after a while  only once i think she replied and then i am not quite sure that the unfortunate woman who did enlist my sympathies was the criminal you make her out to be  you mean the heroine of the york mystery he replied blandly i know that you tried very hard that time to discredit the only possible version of that mysterious murder the version which is my own now i am equally sure that you have at the present moment no more notion as to who killed and robbed poor lady donaldson in charlotte square edinburgh than the police have themselves and yet you are fully prepared to poohpooh my arguments and to disbelieve my version of the mystery such is the lady journalists mind  if you have some cockandbull story to explain that extraordinary case she retorted of course i shall disbelieve it certainly if you are going to try and enlist my sympathies on behalf of edith crawford i can assure you you wont succeed  well i dont know that that is altogether my intention i see you are interested in the case but i dare say you dont remember all the circumstances you must forgive me if i repeat that which you know already if you have ever been to edinburgh at all you will have heard of grahams bank and mr andrew graham the present head of the firm is undoubtedly one of the most prominent notabilities of modern athens  the man in the corner took two or three photos from his pocketbook and placed them before the young girl then pointing at them with his long bony finger  that he said is mr elphinstone graham the eldest son a typical young scotchman as you see and this is david graham the second son  polly looked more closely at this last photo and saw before her a young face upon which some lasting sorrow seemed already to have left its mark the face was delicate and thin the features pinched and the eyes seemed almost unnaturally large and prominent  he was deformed commented the man in the corner in answer to the girls thoughts and as such an object of pity and even of repugnance to most of his friends there was also a good deal of talk in edinburgh society as to his mental condition his mind according to many intimate friends of the grahams being at times decidedly unhinged be that as it may i fancy that his life must have been a very sad one he had lost his mother when quite a baby and his father seemed strangely enough to have an almost unconquerable dislike towards him  every one got to know presently of david grahams sad position in his fathers own house and also of the great affection lavished upon him by his godmother lady donaldson who was a sister of mr grahams  she was a lady of considerable wealth being the widow of sir george donaldson the great distiller but she seems to have been decidedly eccentric latterly she had astonished all her familywho were rigid presbyteriansby announcing her intention of embracing the roman catholic faith and then retiring to the convent of st augustines at newton abbot in devonshire  she had sole and absolute control of the vast fortune which a doting husband had bequeathed to her clearly therefore she was at liberty to bestow it upon a devonshire convent if she chose but this evidently was not altogether her intention  i told you how fond she was of her deformed godson did i not being a bundle of eccentricities she had many hobbies none more pronounced than the fixed determination to seebefore retiring from the world altogetherdavid graham happily married  now it appears that david graham ugly deformed halfdemented as he was had fallen desperately in love with miss edith crawford daughter of the late dr crawford of princes gardens the young lady howeververy naturally perhapsfought shy of david graham who about this time certainly seemed very queer and morose but lady donaldson with characteristic determination seems to have made up her mind to melt miss crawfords heart towards her unfortunate nephew  on october the 2nd last at a family party given by mr graham in his fine mansion in charlotte square lady donaldson openly announced her intention of making over by deed of gift to her nephew david graham certain property money and shares amounting in total value to the sum of £100000 and also her magnificent diamonds which were worth £50000 for the use of the said davids wife keith macfinlay a lawyer of princes street received the next day instructions for drawing up the necessary deed of gift which she pledged herself to sign the day of her godsons wedding  a week later the scotsman contained the following paragraph  a marriage is arranged and will shortly take place between david younger son of andrew graham esq of charlotte square edinburgh and dochnakirk perthshire and edith lillian only surviving daughter of the late dr kenneth crawford of princes gardens  in edinburgh society comments were loud and various upon the forthcoming marriage and on the whole these comments were far from complimentary to the families concerned i do not think that the scotch are a particularly sentimental race but there was such obvious buying selling and bargaining about this marriage that scottish chivalry rose in revolt at the thought  against that the three people most concerned seemed perfectly satisfied david graham was positively transformed his moroseness was gone from him he lost his queer ways and wild manners and became gentle and affectionate in the midst of this great and unexpected happiness miss edith crawford ordered her trousseau and talked of the diamonds to her friends and lady donaldson was only waiting for the consummation of this marriageher hearts desirebefore she finally retired from the world at peace with it and with herself  the deed of gift was ready for signature on the wedding day which was fixed for november 7th and lady donaldson took up her abode temporarily in her brothers house in charlotte square  mr graham gave a large ball on october 23rd special interest is attached to this ball from the fact that for this occasion lady donaldson insisted that davids future wife should wear the magnificent diamonds which were soon to become hers  they were it seems superb and became miss crawfords stately beauty to perfection the ball was a brilliant success the last guest leaving at four am the next day it was the universal topic of conversation and the day after that when edinburgh unfolded the late editions of its morning papers it learned with horror and dismay that lady donaldson had been found murdered in her room and that the celebrated diamonds had been stolen  hardly had the beautiful little city however recovered from this awful shock than its newspapers had another thrilling sensation ready for their readers  already all scotch and english papers had mysteriously hinted at startling information obtained by the procurator fiscal and at an impending sensational arrest  then the announcement came and every one in edinburgh read horrorstruck and aghast that the sensational arrest was none other than that of miss edith crawford for murder and robbery both so daring and horrible that reason refused to believe that a young lady born and bred in the best social circle could have conceived much less executed so heinous a crime she had been arrested in london at the midland hotel and brought to edinburgh where she was judicially examined bail being refused     chapter xv  a terrible plight   little more than a fortnight after that edith crawford was duly committed to stand her trial before the high court of justiciary she had pleaded not guilty at the pleading diet and her defence was entrusted to sir james fenwick one of the most eminent advocates at the criminal bar  strange to say continued the man in the corner after a while public opinion from the first went dead against the accused the public is absolutely like a child perfectly irresponsible and wholly illogical it argued that since miss crawford had been ready to contract a marriage with a halfdemented deformed creature for the sake of his £100000 she must have been equally ready to murder and rob an old lady for the sake of £50000 worth of jewellery without the encumbrance of so undesirable a husband  perhaps the great sympathy aroused in the popular mind for david graham had much to do with this illfeeling against the accused david graham had by this cruel and dastardly murder lost the bestif not the onlyfriend he possessed he had also lost at one fell swoop the large fortune which lady donaldson had been about to assign to him  the deed of gift had never been signed and the old ladys vast wealth instead of enriching her favourite nephew was distributedsince she had made no willamongst her heirsatlaw and now to crown this long chapter of sorrow david graham saw the girl he loved accused of the awful crime which had robbed him of friend and fortune  it was therefore with an unmistakable thrill of righteous satisfaction that edinburgh society saw this mercenary girl in so terrible a plight  i was immensely interested in the case and journeyed down to edinburgh in order to get a good view of the chief actors in the thrilling drama which was about to be unfolded there  i succeededi generally doin securing one of the front seats among the audience and was already comfortably installed in my place in court when through the trap door i saw the head of the prisoner emerge she was very becomingly dressed in deep black and led by two policemen she took her place in the dock sir james fenwick shook hands with her very warmly and i could almost hear him instilling words of comfort into her  the trial lasted six clear days during which time more than forty persons were examined for the prosecution and as many for the defence but the most interesting witnesses were certainly the two doctors the maid tremlett campbell the high street jeweller and david graham  there was of course a great deal of medical evidence to go through poor lady donaldson had been found with a silk scarf tied tightly round her neck her face showing even to the inexperienced eye every symptom of strangulation  then tremlett lady donaldsons confidential maid was called closely examined by crown counsel she gave an account of the ball at charlotte square on the 23rd and the wearing of the jewels by miss crawford on that occasion  i helped miss crawford on with the tiara over her hair she said and my lady put the two necklaces round miss crawfords neck herself there were also some beautiful brooches bracelets and earrings at four oclock in the morning when the ball was over miss crawford brought the jewels back to my ladys room my lady had already gone to bed and i had put out the electric light as i was going too there was only one candle left in the room close to the bed  miss crawford took all the jewels off and asked lady donaldson for the key of the safe so that she might put them away my lady gave her the key and said to me you can go to bed tremlett you must be dead tired i was glad to go for i could hardly stand upi was so tired i said good night to my lady and also to miss crawford who was busy putting the jewels away as i was going out of the room i heard lady donaldson saying have you managed it my dear miss crawford said i have put everything away very nicely  in answer to sir james fenwick tremlett said that lady donaldson always carried the key of her jewel safe on a ribbon round her neck and had done so the whole day preceding her death  on the night of the 24th she continued lady donaldson still seemed rather tired and went up to her room directly after dinner and while the family were still sitting in the diningroom she made me dress her hair then she slipped on her dressinggown and sat in the armchair with a book she told me that she then felt strangely uncomfortable and nervous and could not account for it  however she did not want me to sit with her so i thought that the best thing i could do was to tell mr david graham that her ladyship did not seem very cheerful her ladyship was so fond of mr david it always made her happy to have him with her i then went to my room and at halfpast eight mr david called me he said your mistress does seem a little restless tonight if i were you i would just go and listen at her door in about an hours time and if she has not gone to bed i would go in and stay with her until she has at about ten oclock i did as mr david suggested and listened at her ladyships door however all was quiet in the room and thinking her ladyship had gone to sleep i went back to bed  the next morning at eight oclock when i took in my mistresss cup of tea i saw her lying on the floor her poor dear face all purple and distorted i screamed and the other servants came rushing along then mr graham had the door locked and sent for the doctor and the police  the poor woman seemed to find it very difficult not to break down she was closely questioned by sir james fenwick but had nothing further to say she had last seen her mistress alive at eight oclock on the evening of the 24th  and when you listened at her door at ten oclock asked sir james did you try to open it  i did but it was locked she replied  did lady donaldson usually lock her bedroom at night  nearly always  and in the morning when you took in the tea  the door was open i walked straight in  you are quite sure insisted sir james  i swear it solemnly asserted the woman  after that we were informed by several members of mr grahams establishment that miss crawford had been in to tea at charlotte square in the afternoon of the 24th that she told every one she was going to london by the night mail as she had some special shopping she wished to do there it appears that mr graham and david both tried to persuade her to stay to dinner and then to go by the 910 pm from the caledonian station miss crawford however had refused saying she always preferred to go from the waverley station it was nearer to her own rooms and she still had a good deal of writing to do  in spite of this two witnesses saw the accused in charlotte square later on in the evening she was carrying a bag which seemed heavy and was walking towards the caledonian railway station  but the most thrilling moment in that sensational trial was reached on the second day when david graham looking wretchedly ill unkempt and haggard stepped into the witnessbox a murmur of sympathy went round the audience at sight of him who was the second perhaps most deeply stricken victim of the charlotte square tragedy  david graham in answer to crown counsel gave an account of his last interview with lady donaldson  tremlett had told me that she seemed anxious and upset and i went to have a chat with her she soon cheered up and  there the unfortunate young man hesitated visibly but after a while resumed with an obvious effort  she spoke of my marriage and of the gift she was about to bestow upon me she said the diamonds would be for my wife and after that for my daughter if i had one she also complained that mr macfinlay had been so punctilious about preparing the deed of gift and that it was a great pity the £100000 could not just pass from her hands to mine without so much fuss  i stayed talking with her for about half an hour then i left her as she seemed ready to go to bed but i told her maid to listen at the door in about an hours time  there was deep silence in the court for a few moments a silence which to me seemed almost electrical it was as if some time before it was uttered the next question put by crown counsel to the witness had hovered in the air  you were engaged to miss edith crawford at one time were you not  one felt rather than heard the almost inaudible yes which escaped from david grahams compressed lips  under what circumstances was that engagement broken off  sir james fenwick had already risen in protest but david graham had been the first to speak  i do not think that i need answer that question  i will put it in a different form then said crown counsel urbanelyone to which my learned friend cannot possibly take exception did you or did you not on october 27th receive a letter from the accused in which she desired to be released from her promise of marriage to you  again david graham would have refused to answer and he certainly gave no audible reply to the learned counsels question but every one in the audience there presentaye every member of the jury and of the barread upon david grahams pale countenance and large sorrowful eyes that ominous yes which had failed to reach his trembling lips     chapter xvi  non proven   there is no doubt continued the man in the corner that what little sympathy the young girls terrible position had aroused in the public mind had died out the moment that david graham left the witnessbox on the second day of the trial whether edith crawford was guilty of murder or not the callous way in which she had accepted a deformed lover and then thrown him over had set every ones mind against her  it was mr graham himself who had been the first to put the procurator fiscal in possession of the fact that the accused had written to david from london breaking off her engagement this information had no doubt directed the attention of the fiscal to miss crawford and the police soon brought forward the evidence which had led to her arrest  we had a final sensation on the third day when mr campbell jeweller of high street gave his evidence he said that on october 25th a lady came to his shop and offered to sell him a pair of diamond earrings trade had been very bad and he had refused the bargain although the lady seemed ready to part with the earrings for an extraordinarily low sum considering the beauty of the stones  in fact it was because of this evident desire on the ladys part to sell at any cost that he had looked at her more keenly than he otherwise would have done he was now ready to swear that the lady that offered him the diamond earrings was the prisoner in the dock  i can assure you that as we all listened to this apparently damnatory evidence you might have heard a pin drop amongst the audience in that crowded court the girl alone there in the dock remained calm and unmoved remember that for two days we had heard evidence to prove that old dr crawford had died leaving his daughter penniless that having no mother she had been brought up by a maiden aunt who had trained her to be a governess which occupation she had followed for years and that certainly she had never been known by any of her friends to be in possession of solitaire diamond earrings  the prosecution had certainly secured an ace of trumps but sir james fenwick who during the whole of that day had seemed to take little interest in the proceedings here rose from his seat and i knew at once that he had got a titbit in the way of a point up his sleeve gaunt and unusually tall and with his beaklike nose he always looks strangely impressive when he seriously tackles a witness he did it this time with a vengeance i can tell you he was all over the pompous little jeweller in a moment  had mr campbell made a special entry in his book as to the visit of the lady in question  no  had he any special means of ascertaining when that visit did actually take place  nobut  what record had he of the visit  mr campbell had none in fact after about twenty minutes of crossexamination he had to admit that he had given but little thought to the interview with the lady at the time and certainly not in connection with the murder of lady donaldson until he had read in the papers that a young lady had been arrested  then he and his clerk talked the matter over it appears and together they had certainly recollected that a lady had brought some beautiful earrings for sale on a day which must have been the very morning after the murder if sir james fenwicks object was to discredit this special witness he certainly gained his point  all the pomposity went out of mr campbell he became flurried then excited then he lost his temper after that he was allowed to leave the court and sir james fenwick resumed his seat and waited like a vulture for its prey  it presented itself in the person of mr campbells clerk who before the procurator fiscal had corroborated his employers evidence in every respect in scotland no witness in any one case is present in court during the examination of another and mr macfarlane the clerk was therefore quite unprepared for the pitfalls which sir james fenwick had prepared for him he tumbled into them head foremost and the eminent advocate turned him inside out like a glove  mr macfarlane did not lose his temper he was of too humble a frame of mind to do that but he got into a hopeless quagmire of mixed recollections and he too left the witnessbox quite unprepared to swear as to the day of the interview with the lady with the diamond earrings  i dare say mind you continued the man in the corner with a chuckle that to most people present sir james fenwicks crossquestioning seemed completely irrelevant both mr campbell and his clerk were quite ready to swear that they had had an interview concerning some diamond earrings with a lady of whose identity with the accused they were perfectly convinced and to the casual observer the question as to the time or even the day when that interview took place could make but little difference in the ultimate issue  now i took in in a moment the entire drift of sir james fenwicks defence of edith crawford when mr macfarlane left the witnessbox the second victim of the eminent advocates caustic tongue i could read as in a book the whole history of that crime its investigation and the mistakes made by the police first and the public prosecutor afterwards  sir james fenwick knew them too of course and he placed a finger upon each one demolishinglike a child who blows upon a house of cardsthe entire scaffolding erected by the prosecution  mr campbells and mr macfarlanes identification of the accused with the lady who on some dateadmitted to be uncertainhad tried to sell a pair of diamond earrings was the first point sir james had plenty of witnesses to prove that on the 25th the day after the murder the accused was in london whilst the day before mr campbells shop had been closed long before the family circle had seen the last of lady donaldson clearly the jeweller and his clerk must have seen some other lady whom their vivid imagination had pictured as being identical with the accused  then came the great question of time mr david graham had been evidently the last to see lady donaldson alive he had spoken to her as late as 830 pm sir james fenwick had called two porters at the caledonian railway station who testified to miss crawford having taken her seat in a firstclass carriage of the 910 train some minutes before it started  was it conceivable therefore argued sir james that in the space of half an hour the accuseda young girlcould have found her way surreptitiously into the house at a time when the entire household was still astir that she should have strangled lady donaldson forced open the safe and made away with the jewels a manan experienced burglar might have done it but i contend that the accused is physically incapable of accomplishing such a feat  with regard to the broken engagement continued the eminent counsel with a smile it may have seemed a little heartless certainly but heartlessness is no crime in the eyes of the law the accused has stated in her declaration that at the time she wrote to mr david graham breaking off her engagement she had heard nothing of the edinburgh tragedy  the london papers had reported the crime very briefly the accused was busy shopping she knew nothing of mr david grahams altered position in no case was the breaking off of the engagement a proof that the accused had obtained possession of the jewels by so foul a deed  it is of course impossible for me continued the man in the corner apologetically to give you any idea of the eminent advocates eloquence and masterful logic it struck every one i think just as it did me that he chiefly directed his attention to the fact that there was absolutely no proof against the accused  be that as it may the result of that remarkable trial was a verdict of non proven the jury was absent forty minutes and it appears that in the mind of every one of them there remained in spite of sir james arguments a firmly rooted convictioncall it instinct if you likethat edith crawford had done away with lady donaldson in order to become possessed of those jewels and that in spite of the pompous jewellers many contradictions she had offered him some of those diamonds for sale but there was not enough proof to convict and she was given the benefit of the doubt  i have heard english people argue that in england she would have been hanged personally i doubt that i think that an english jury not having the judicial loophole of non proven would have been bound to acquit her what do you think     chapter xvii  undeniable facts   there was a moments silence for polly did not reply immediately and he went on making impossible knots in his bit of string then she said quietly  i think that i agree with those english people who say that an english jury would have condemned her i have no doubt that she was guilty she may not have committed that awful deed herself some one in the charlotte square house may have been her accomplice and killed and robbed lady donaldson while edith crawford waited outside for the jewels david graham left his godmother at 830 pm if the accomplice was one of the servants in the house he or she would have had plenty of time for any amount of villainy and edith crawford could have yet caught the 910 pm train from the caledonian station  then who in your opinion he asked sarcastically and cocking his funny birdlike head on one side tried to sell diamond earrings to mr campbell the jeweller  edith crawford of course she retorted triumphantly he and his clerk both recognized her  when did she try to sell them the earrings  ah that is what i cannot quite make out and there to my mind lies the only mystery in this case on the 25th she was certainly in london and it is not very likely that she would go back to edinburgh in order to dispose of the jewels there where they could most easily be traced  not very likely certainly he assented drily  and added the young girl on the day before she left for london lady donaldson was alive  and pray he said suddenly as with comic complacency he surveyed a beautiful knot he had just twisted up between his long fingers what has that fact got to do with it  but it has everything to do with it she retorted  ah there you go he sighed with comic emphasis my teachings dont seem to have improved your powers of reasoning you are as bad as the police lady donaldson has been robbed and murdered and you immediately argue that she was robbed and murdered by the same person  but argued polly  there is no but he said getting more and more excited see how simple it is edith crawford wears the diamonds one night then she brings them back to lady donaldsons room remember the maids statement my lady said have you put them back my deara simple statement utterly ignored by the prosecution but what did it mean that lady donaldson could not see for herself whether edith crawford had put back the jewels or not since she asked the question  then you argue  i never argue he interrupted excitedly i state undeniable facts edith crawford who wanted to steal the jewels took them then and there when she had the opportunity why in the world should she have waited lady donaldson was in bed and tremlett the maid had gone  the next daynamely the 25thshe tries to dispose of a pair of earrings to mr campbell she fails and decides to go to london where she has a better chance sir james fenwick did not think it desirable to bring forward witnesses to prove what i have since ascertained is a fact namely that on the 27th of october three days before her arrest miss crawford crossed over to belgium and came back to london the next day in belgium no doubt lady donaldsons diamonds taken out of their settings calmly repose at this moment while the money derived from their sale is safely deposited in a belgian bank  but then who murdered lady donaldson and why gasped polly  cannot you guess he queried blandly have i not placed the case clearly enough before you to me it seems so simple it was a daring brutal murder remember think of one who not being the thief himself would nevertheless have the strongest of all motives to shield the thief from the consequences of her own misdeed aye and the power toosince it would be absolutely illogical nay impossible that he should be an accomplice  surely  think of a curious nature warped morally as well as physicallydo you know how those natures feel a thousand times more strongly than the even straight natures in everyday life then think of such a nature brought face to face with this awful problem  do you think that such a nature would hesitate a moment before committing a crime to save the loved one from the consequences of that deed mind you i dont assert for a moment that david graham had any intention of murdering lady donaldson tremlett tells him that she seems strangely upset he goes to her room and finds that she has discovered that she has been robbed she naturally suspects edith crawford recollects the incidents of the other night and probably expresses her feelings to david graham and threatens immediate prosecution scandal what you will  i repeat it again i dare say he had no wish to kill her probably he merely threatened to a medical gentleman who spoke of sudden heart failure was no doubt right then imagine david grahams remorse his horror and his fears the empty safe probably is the first object that suggested to him the grim tableau of robbery and murder which he arranges in order to ensure his own safety  but remember one thing no miscreant was seen to enter or leave the house surreptitiously the murderer left no signs of entrance and none of exit an armed burglar would have left some tracesome one would have heard something then who locked and unlocked lady donaldsons door that night while she herself lay dead  some one in the house i tell yousome one who left no tracesome one against whom there could be no suspicionsome one who killed without apparently the slightest premeditation and without the slightest motive think of iti know i am rightand then tell me if i have at all enlisted your sympathies in the author of the edinburgh mystery  he was gone polly looked again at the photo of david graham did a crooked mind really dwell in that crooked body and were there in the world such crimes that were great enough to be deemed sublime     chapter xviii  the theft at the english provident bank   that question of motive is a very difficult and complicated one at times said the man in the corner leisurely pulling off a huge pair of flaming dogskin gloves from his meagre fingers i have known experienced criminal investigators declare as an infallible axiom that to find the person interested in the committal of the crime is to find the criminal  well that may be so in most cases but my experience has proved to me that there is one factor in this world of ours which is the mainspring of human actions and that factor is human passions for good or evil passions rule this poor humanity of ours remember there are the women french detectives who are acknowledged masters in their craft never proceed till after they have discovered the feminine element in a crime whether in theft murder or fraud according to their theory there is always a woman  perhaps the reason why the phillimore terrace robbery was never brought home to its perpetrators is because there was no woman in any way connected with it and i am quite sure on the other hand that the reason why the thief at the english provident bank is still unpunished is because a clever woman has escaped the eyes of our police force  he had spoken at great length and very dictatorially miss polly burton did not venture to contradict him knowing by now that whenever he was irritable he was invariably rude and she then had the worst of it  when i am old he resumed and have nothing more to do i think i shall take professionally to the police force they have much to learn  could anything be more ludicrous than the selfsatisfaction the abnormal conceit of this remark made by that shrivelled piece of mankind in a nervous hesitating tone of voice polly made no comment but drew from her pocket a beautiful piece of string and knowing his custom of knotting such an article while unravelling his mysteries she handed it across the table to him she positively thought that he blushed  as an adjunct to thought she said moved by a conciliatory spirit  he looked at the invaluable toy which the young girl had tantalisingly placed close to his hand then he forced himself to look all round the coffeeroom at polly at the waitresses at the piles of pallid buns upon the counter but involuntarily his mild blue eyes wandered back lovingly to the long piece of string on which his playful imagination no doubt already saw a series of knots which would be equally tantalising to tie and to untie  tell me about the theft at the english provident bank suggested polly condescendingly  he looked at her as if she had proposed some mysterious complicity in an unheardof crime finally his lean fingers sought the end of the piece of string and drew it towards him his face brightened up in a moment  there was an element of tragedy in that particular robbery he began after a few moments of beatified knotting altogether different to that connected with most crimes a tragedy which as far as i am concerned would seal my lips for ever and forbid them to utter a word which might lead the police on the right track  your lips suggested polly sarcastically are as far as i can see usually sealed before our longsuffering incompetent police and  and you should be the last to grumble at this he quietly interrupted for you have spent some very pleasant halfhours already listening to what you have termed my cockandbull stories you know the english provident bank of course in oxford street there were plenty of sketches of it at the time in the illustrated papers here is a photo of the outside i took it myself some time ago and only wish i had been cheeky or lucky enough to get a snapshot of the interior but you see that the office has a separate entrance from the rest of the house which was and still is as is usual in such cases inhabited by the manager and his family  mr ireland was the manager then it was less than six months ago he lived over the bank with his wife and family consisting of a son who was clerk in the business and two or three younger children the house is really smaller than it looks on this photo for it has no depth and only one set of rooms on each floor looking out into the street the back of the house being nothing but the staircase mr ireland and his family therefore occupied the whole of it  as for the business premises they were and in fact are of the usual pattern an office with its rows of desks clerks and cashiers and beyond through a glass door the managers private room with the ponderous safe and desk and so on  the private room has a door into the hall of the house so that the manager is not obliged to go out into the street in order to go to business there are no livingrooms on the ground floor and the house has no basement  i am obliged to put all these architectural details before you though they may sound rather dry and uninteresting but they are really necessary in order to make my argument clear  at night of course the bank premises are barred and bolted against the street and as an additional precaution there is always a night watchman in the office as i mentioned before there is only a glass door between the office and the managers private room this of course accounted for the fact that the night watchman heard all that he did hear on that memorable night and so helped further to entangle the thread of that impenetrable mystery  mr ireland as a rule went into his office every morning a little before ten oclock but on that particular morning for some reason which he never could or would explain he went down before having his breakfast at about nine oclock mrs ireland stated subsequently that not hearing him return she sent the servant down to tell the master that breakfast was getting cold the girls shrieks were the first intimation that something alarming had occurred  mrs ireland hastened downstairs on reaching the hall she found the door of her husbands room open and it was from there that the girls shrieks proceeded  the master mumthe poor masterhe is dead mumi am sure he is deadaccompanied by vigorous thumps against the glass partition and not very measured language on the part of the watchman from the outer office such aswhy dont you open the door instead of making that row  mrs ireland is not the sort of woman who under any circumstances would lose her presence of mind i think she proved that throughout the many trying circumstances connected with the investigation of the case she gave only one glance at the room and realized the situation on the armchair with head thrown back and eyes closed lay mr ireland apparently in a dead faint some terrible shock must have very suddenly shattered his nervous system and rendered him prostrate for the moment what that shock had been it was pretty easy to guess  the door of the safe was wide open and mr ireland had evidently tottered and fainted before some awful fact which the open safe had revealed to him he had caught himself against a chair which lay on the floor and then finally sunk unconscious into the armchair  all this which takes some time to describe continued the man in the corner took remember only a second to pass like a flash through mrs irelands mind she quickly turned the key of the glass door which was on the inside and with the help of james fairbairn the watchman she carried her husband upstairs to his room and immediately sent both for the police and for a doctor  as mrs ireland had anticipated her husband had received a severe mental shock which had completely prostrated him the doctor prescribed absolute quiet and forbade all worrying questions for the present the patient was not a young man the shock had been very severeit was a case a very slight one of cerebral congestionand mr irelands reason if not his life might be gravely jeopardised by any attempt to recall before his enfeebled mind the circumstances which had preceded his collapse  the police therefore could proceed but slowly in their investigations the detective who had charge of the case was necessarily handicapped whilst one of the chief actors concerned in the drama was unable to help him in his work  to begin with the robber or robbers had obviously not found their way into the managers inner room through the bank premises james fairbairn had been on the watch all night with the electric light full on and obviously no one could have crossed the outer office or forced the heavily barred doors without his knowledge  there remained the other access to the room that is the one through the hall of the house the hall door it appears was always barred and bolted by mr ireland himself when he came home whether from the theatre or his club it was a duty he never allowed any one to perform but himself during his annual holiday with his wife and family his son who usually had the submanager to stay with him on those occasions did the bolting and barringbut with the distinct understanding that this should be done by ten oclock at night  as i have already explained to you there is only a glass partition between the general office and the managers private room and according to james fairbairns account this was naturally always left wide open so that he during his night watch would of necessity hear the faintest sound as a rule there was no light left in the managers room and the other doorthat leading into the hallwas bolted from the inside by james fairbairn the moment he had satisfied himself that the premises were safe and he had begun his nightwatch an electric bell in both the offices communicated with mr irelands bedroom and that of his son mr robert ireland and there was a telephone installed to the nearest district messengers office with an understood signal which meant police  at nine oclock in the morning it was the night watchmans duty as soon as the first cashier had arrived to dust and tidy the managers room and to undo the bolts after that he was free to go home to his breakfast and rest  you will see of course that james fairbairns position in the english provident bank is one of great responsibility and trust but then in every bank and business house there are men who hold similar positions they are always men of wellknown and tried characters often old soldiers with goodconduct records behind them james fairbairn is a fine powerful scotchman he had been night watchman to the english provident bank for fifteen years and was then not more than fortythree or fortyfour years old he is an exguardsman and stands six feet three inches in his socks  it was his evidence of course which was of such paramount importance and which somehow or other managed in spite of the utmost care exercised by the police to become public property and to cause the wildest excitement in banking and business circles  james fairbairn stated that at eight oclock in the evening of march 25th having bolted and barred all the shutters and the door of the back premises he was about to lock the managers door as usual when mr ireland called to him from the floor above telling him to leave that door open as he might want to go into the office again for a minute when he came home at eleven oclock james fairbairn asked if he should leave the light on but mr ireland said no turn it out i can switch it on if i want it  the night watchman at the english provident bank has permission to smoke he also is allowed a nice fire and a tray consisting of a plate of substantial sandwiches and one glass of ale which he can take when he likes james fairbairn settled himself in front of the fire lit his pipe took out his newspaper and began to read he thought he had heard the street door open and shut at about a quarter to ten he supposed that it was mr ireland going out to his club but at ten minutes to ten oclock the watchman heard the door of the managers room open and some one enter immediately closing the glass partition door and turning the key  he naturally concluded it was mr ireland himself  from where he sat he could not see into the room but he noticed that the electric light had not been switched on and that the manager seemingly had no light but an occasional match  for the minute continued james fairbairn a thought did just cross my mind that something might perhaps be wrong and i put my newspaper aside and went to the other end of the room towards the glass partition the managers room was still quite dark and i could not clearly see into it but the door into the hall was open and there was of course a light through there i had got quite close to the partition when i saw mrs ireland standing in the doorway and heard her saying in a very astonished tone of voice why lewis i thought you had gone to your club ages ago what in the world are you doing here in the dark  lewis is mr irelands christian name was james fairbairns further statement i did not hear the managers reply but quite satisfied now that nothing was wrong i went back to my pipe and my newspaper almost directly afterwards i heard the manager leave his room cross the hall and go out by the street door it was only after he had gone that i recollected that he must have forgotten to unlock the glass partition and that i could not therefore bolt the door into the hall the same as usual and i suppose that is how those confounded thieves got the better of me     chapter xix  conflicting evidence   by the time the public had been able to think over james fairbairns evidence a certain disquietude and unrest had begun to make itself felt both in the bank itself and among those of our detective force who had charge of the case the newspapers spoke of the matter with very obvious caution and warned all their readers to await the further development of this sad case  while the manager of the english provident bank lay in such a precarious condition of health it was impossible to arrive at any definite knowledge as to what the thief had actually made away with the chief cashier however estimated the loss at about £5000 in gold and notes of the bank moneythat was of course on the assumption that mr ireland had no private money or valuables of his own in the safe  mind you at this point public sympathy was much stirred in favour of the poor man who lay ill perhaps dying and yet whom strangely enough suspicion had already slightly touched with its poisoned wing  suspicion is a strong word perhaps to use at this point in the story no one suspected anybody at present james fairbairn had told his story and had vowed that some thief with false keys must have sneaked through the house into the inner office  public excitement you will remember lost nothing by waiting hardly had we all had time to wonder over the night watchmans singular evidence and pending further and fuller detail to check our growing sympathy for the man who was ill than the sensational side of this mysterious case culminated in one extraordinary absolutely unexpected fact mrs ireland after a twentyfour hours untiring watch beside her husbands sick bed had at last been approached by the detective and been asked to reply to a few simple questions and thus help to throw some light on the mystery which had caused mr irelands illness and her own consequent anxiety  she professed herself quite ready to reply to any questions put to her and she literally astounded both inspector and detective when she firmly and emphatically declared that james fairbairn must have been dreaming or asleep when he thought he saw her in the doorway at ten oclock that night and fancied he heard her voice  she may or may not have been down in the hall at that particular hour for she usually ran down herself to see if the last post had brought any letters but most certainly she had neither seen nor spoken to mr ireland at that hour for mr ireland had gone out an hour before she herself having seen him to the front door never for a moment did she swerve from this extraordinary statement she spoke to james fairbairn in the presence of the detective and told him he must absolutely have been mistaken that she had not seen mr ireland and that she had not spoken to him  one other person was questioned by the police and that was mr robert ireland the managers eldest son it was presumed that he would know something of his fathers affairs the idea having now taken firm hold of the detectives mind that perhaps grave financial difficulties had tempted the unfortunate manager to appropriate some of the firms money  mr robert ireland however could not say very much his father did not confide in him to the extent of telling him all his private affairs but money never seemed scarce at home certainly and mr ireland had to his sons knowledge not a single extravagant habit he himself had been dining out with a friend on that memorable evening and had gone on with him to the oxford music hall he met his father on the doorstep of the bank at about 1130 pm and they went in together there certainly was nothing remarkable about mr ireland then his son averred he appeared in no way excited and bade his son good night quite cheerfully  there was the extraordinary the remarkable hitch continued the man in the corner waxing more and more excited every moment the publicwho is at times very densesaw it clearly nevertheless of course every one at once jumped to the natural conclusion that mrs ireland was telling a liea noble lie a selfsacrificing lie a lie endowed with all the virtues if you like but still a lie  she was trying to save her husband and was going the wrong way to work james fairbairn after all could not have dreamt quite all that he declared he had seen and heard no one suspected james fairbairn there was no occasion to do that to begin with he was a great heavy scotchman with obviously no powers of invention such as mrs irelands strange assertion credited him with moreover the theft of the banknotes could not have been of the slightest use to him  but remember there was the hitch without it the public mind would already have condemned the sick man upstairs without hope of rehabilitation this fact struck every one  granting that mr ireland had gone into his office at ten minutes to ten oclock at night for the purpose of extracting £5000 worth of notes and gold from the bank safe whilst giving the theft the appearance of a night burglary granting that he was disturbed in his nefarious project by his wife who failing to persuade him to make restitution took his side boldly and very clumsily attempted to rescue him out of his difficult positionwhy should he at nine oclock the following morning fall in a dead faint and get cerebral congestion at sight of a defalcation he knew had occurred one might simulate a fainting fit but no one can assume a high temperature and a congestion which the most ordinary practitioner who happened to be called in would soon see were nonexistent  mr ireland according to james fairbairns evidence must have gone out soon after the theft come in again with his son an hour and a half later talked to him gone quietly to bed and waited for nine hours before he fell ill at sight of his own crime it was not logical you will admit unfortunately the poor man himself was unable to give any explanation of the nights tragic adventures  he was still very weak and though under strong suspicion he was left by the doctors orders in absolute ignorance of the heavy charges which were gradually accumulating against him he had made many anxious inquiries from all those who had access to his bedside as to the result of the investigation and the probable speedy capture of the burglars but every one had strict orders to inform him merely that the police so far had no clue of any kind  you will admit as every one did that there was something very pathetic about the unfortunate mans position so helpless to defend himself if defence there was against so much overwhelming evidence that is why i think public sympathy remained with him still it was terrible to think of his wife presumably knowing him to be guilty and anxiously waiting whilst dreading the moment when restored to health he would have to face the doubts the suspicions probably the open accusations which were fast rising up around him     chapter xx  an alibi   it was close on six weeks before the doctor at last allowed his patient to attend to the grave business which had prostrated him for so long  in the meantime among the many people who directly or indirectly were made to suffer in this mysterious affair no one i think was more pitied and more genuinely sympathised with than robert ireland the managers eldest son  you remember that he had been clerk in the bank well naturally the moment suspicion began to fasten on his father his position in the business became untenable i think every one was very kind to him mr sutherland french who was made acting manager during mr lewis irelands regrettable absence did everything in his power to show his goodwill and sympathy to the young man but i dont think that he or any one else was much astonished when after mrs irelands extraordinary attitude in the case had become public property he quietly intimated to the acting manager that he had determined to sever his connection with the bank  the best of recommendations was of course placed at his disposal and it was finally understood that as soon as his father was completely restored to health and would no longer require his presence in london he would try to obtain employment somewhere abroad he spoke of the new volunteer corps organized for the military policing of the new colonies and truth to tell no one could blame him that he should wish to leave far behind him all london banking connections the sons attitude certainly did not tend to ameliorate the fathers position it was pretty evident that his own family had ceased to hope in the poor managers innocence  and yet he was absolutely innocent you must remember how that fact was clearly demonstrated as soon as the poor man was able to say a word for himself and he said it to some purpose too  mr ireland was and is very fond of music on the evening in question while sitting in his club he saw in one of the daily papers the announcement of a peculiarly attractive programme at the queens hall concert he was not dressed but nevertheless felt an irresistible desire to hear one or two of these attractive musical items and he strolled down to the hall now this sort of alibi is usually very difficult to prove but dame fortune oddly enough favoured mr ireland on this occasion probably to compensate him for the hard knocks she had been dealing him pretty freely of late  it appears that there was some difficulty about his seat which was sold to him at the box office and which he nevertheless found wrongfully occupied by a determined lady who refused to move the management had to be appealed to the attendants also remembered not only the incident but also the face and appearance of the gentleman who was the innocent cause of the altercation  as soon as mr ireland could speak for himself he mentioned the incident and the persons who had been witness to it he was identified by them to the amazement it must be confessed of police and public alike who had comfortably decided that no one could be guilty save the manager of the provident bank himself moreover mr ireland was a fairly wealthy man with a good balance at the union bank and plenty of private means the result of years of provident living  he had but to prove that if he really had been in need of an immediate £5000which was all the amount extracted from the bank safe that nighthe had plenty of securities on which he could at an hours notice have raised twice that sum his life insurances had been fully paid up he had not a debt which a £5 note could not easily have covered  on the fatal night he certainly did remember asking the watchman not to bolt the door to his office as he thought he might have one or two letters to write when he came home but later on he had forgotten all about this after the concert he met his son in oxford street just outside the house and thought no more about the office the door of which was shut and presented no unusual appearance  mr ireland absolutely denied having been in his office at the hour when james fairbairn positively asserted he heard mrs ireland say in an astonished tone of voice why lewis what in the world are you doing here it became pretty clear therefore that james fairbairns view of the managers wife had been a mere vision  mr ireland gave up his position as manager of the english provident both he and his wife felt no doubt that on the whole perhaps there had been too much talk too much scandal connected with their name to be altogether advantageous to the bank moreover mr irelands health was not so good as it had been he has a pretty house now at sittingbourne and amuses himself during his leisure hours with amateur horticulture and i who alone in london besides the persons directly connected with this mysterious affair know the true solution of the enigma often wonder how much of it is known to the exmanager of the english provident bank  the man in the corner had been silent for some time miss polly burton in her presumption had made up her mind at the commencement of his tale to listen attentively to every point of the evidence in connection with the case which he recapitulated before her and to follow the point in order to try and arrive at a conclusion of her own and overwhelm the antediluvian scarecrow with her sagacity  she said nothing for she had arrived at no conclusion the case puzzled every one and had amazed the public in its various stages from the moment when opinion began to cast doubt on mr irelands honesty to that when his integrity was proved beyond a doubt one or two people had suspected mrs ireland to have been the actual thief but that idea had soon to be abandoned  mrs ireland had all the money she wanted the theft occurred six months ago and not a single banknote was ever traced to her pocket moreover she must have had an accomplice since some one else was in the managers room that night and if that some one else was her accomplice why did she risk betraying him by speaking loudly in the presence of james fairbairn when it would have been so much simpler to turn out the light and plunge the hall into darkness  you are altogether on the wrong track sounded a sharp voice in direct answer to pollys thoughtsaltogether wrong if you want to acquire my method of induction and improve your reasoning power you must follow my system first think of the one absolutely undisputed positive fact you must have a startingpoint and not go wandering about in the realms of suppositions  but there are no positive facts she said irritably  you dont say so he said quietly do you not call it a positive fact that the bank safe was robbed of £5000 on the evening of march 25th before 1130 pm  yes that is all which is positive and  do you not call it a positive fact he interrupted quietly that the lock of the safe not being picked it must have been opened by its own key  i know that she rejoined crossly and that is why every one agreed that james fairbairn could not possibly  and do you not call it a positive fact then that james fairbairn could not possibly etc etc seeing that the glass partition door was locked from the inside mrs ireland herself let james fairbairn into her husbands office when she saw him lying fainting before the open safe of course that was a positive fact and so was the one that proved to any thinking mind that if that safe was opened with a key it could only have been done by a person having access to that key  but the man in the private office  exactly the man in the private office enumerate his points if you please said the funny creature marking each point with one of his favourite knots he was a man who might that night have had access to the key of the safe unsuspected by the manager or even his wife and a man for whom mrs ireland was willing to tell a downright lie are there many men for whom a woman of the better middle class and an englishwoman would be ready to perjure herself surely not she might do it for her husband the public thought she had it never struck them that she might have done it for her son  her son exclaimed polly  ah she was a clever woman he ejaculated enthusiastically one with courage and presence of mind which i dont think i have ever seen equalled she runs downstairs before going to bed in order to see whether the last post has brought any letters she sees the door of her husbands office ajar she pushes it open and there by the sudden flash of a hastily struck match she realizes in a moment that a thief stands before the open safe and in that thief she has already recognized her son at that very moment she hears the watchmans step approaching the partition there is no time to warn her son she does not know the glass door is locked james fairbairn may switch on the electric light and see the young man in the very act of robbing his employers safe  one thing alone can reassure the watchman one person alone had the right to be there at that hour of the night and without hesitation she pronounces her husbands name  mind you i firmly believe that at the time the poor woman only wished to gain time that she had every hope that her son had not yet had the opportunity to lay so heavy a guilt upon his conscience  what passed between mother and son we shall never know but this much we do know that the young villain made off with his booty and trusted that his mother would never betray him poor woman what a night of it she must have spent but she was clever and farseeing she knew that her husbands character could not suffer through her action accordingly she took the only course open to her to save her son even from his fathers wrath and boldly denied james fairbairns statement  of course she was fully aware that her husband could easily clear himself and the worst that could be said of her was that she had thought him guilty and had tried to save him she trusted to the future to clear her of any charge of complicity in the theft  by now every one has forgotten most of the circumstances the police are still watching the career of james fairbairn and mrs irelands expenditure as you know not a single note so far has been traced to her against that one or two of the notes have found their way back to england no one realizes how easy it is to cash english banknotes at the smaller agents de change abroad the changeurs are only too glad to get them what do they care where they come from as long as they are genuine and a week or two later m le changeur could not swear who tendered him any one particular note  you see young robert ireland went abroad he will come back some day having made a fortune theres his photo and this is his mothera clever woman wasnt she  and before polly had time to reply he was gone she really had never seen any one move across a room so quickly but he always left an interesting trail behind a piece of string knotted from end to end and a few photos     chapter xxi  the dublin mystery   i always thought that the history of that forged will was about as interesting as any i had read said the man in the corner that day he had been silent for some time and was meditatively sorting and looking through a packet of small photographs in his pocketbook polly guessed that some of these would presently be placed before her for inspectionand she had not long to wait  that is old brooks he said pointing to one of the photographs millionaire brooks as he was called and these are his two sons percival and murray it was a curious case wasnt it personally i dont wonder that the police were completely at sea if a member of that highly estimable force happened to be as clever as the clever author of that forged will we should have very few undetected crimes in this country  that is why i always try to persuade you to give our poor ignorant police the benefit of your great insight and wisdom said polly with a smile  i know he said blandly you have been most kind in that way but i am only an amateur crime interests me only when it resembles a clever game of chess with many intricate moves which all tend to one solution the checkmating of the antagonistthe detective force of the country now confess that in the dublin mystery the clever police there were absolutely checkmated  absolutely  just as the public was there were actually two crimes committed in one city which have completely baffled detection the murder of patrick wethered the lawyer and the forged will of millionaire brooks there are not many millionaires in ireland no wonder old brooks was a notability in his way since his businessbacon curing i believe it isis said to be worth over £2000000 of solid money  his younger son murray was a refined highly educated man and was moreover the apple of his fathers eye as he was the spoilt darling of dublin society goodlooking a splendid dancer and a perfect rider he was the acknowledged catch of the matrimonial market of ireland and many a very aristocratic house was opened hospitably to the favourite son of the millionaire  of course percival brooks the eldest son would inherit the bulk of the old mans property and also probably the larger share in the business he too was goodlooking more so than his brother he too rode danced and talked well but it was many years ago that mammas with marriageable daughters had given up all hopes of percival brooks as a probable soninlaw that young mans infatuation for maisie fortescue a lady of undoubted charm but very doubtful antecedents who had astonished the london and dublin musichalls with her extravagant dances was too well known and too oldestablished to encourage any hopes in other quarters  whether percival brooks would ever marry maisie fortescue was thought to be very doubtful old brooks had the full disposal of all his wealth and it would have fared ill with percival if he introduced an undesirable wife into the magnificent fitzwilliam place establishment  that is how matters stood continued the man in the corner when dublin society one morning learnt with deep regret and dismay that old brooks had died very suddenly at his residence after only a few hours illness at first it was generally understood that he had had an apoplectic stroke anyway he had been at business hale and hearty as ever the day before his death which occurred late on the evening of february 1st  it was the morning papers of february 2nd which told the sad news to their readers and it was those selfsame papers which on that eventful morning contained another even more startling piece of news that proved the prelude to a series of sensations such as tranquil placid dublin had not experienced for many years this was that on that very afternoon which saw the death of dublins greatest millionaire mr patrick wethered his solicitor was murdered in phoenix park at five oclock in the afternoon while actually walking to his own house from his visit to his client in fitzwilliam place  patrick wethered was as well known as the proverbial town pump his mysterious and tragic death filled all dublin with dismay the lawyer who was a man sixty years of age had been struck on the back of the head by a heavy stick garrotted and subsequently robbed for neither money watch or pocketbook were found upon his person whilst the police soon gathered from patrick wethereds household that he had left home at two oclock that afternoon carrying both watch and pocketbook and undoubtedly money as well  an inquest was held and a verdict of wilful murder was found against some person or persons unknown  but dublin had not exhausted its stock of sensations yet millionaire brooks had been buried with due pomp and magnificence and his will had been proved his business and personalty being estimated at £2500000 by percival gordon brooks his eldest son and sole executor the younger son murray who had devoted the best years of his life to being a friend and companion to his father while percival ran after balletdancers and musichall starsmurray who had avowedly been the apple of his fathers eye in consequencewas left with a miserly pittance of £300 a year and no share whatever in the gigantic business of brooks  sons bacon curers of dublin  something had evidently happened within the precincts of the brooks town mansion which the public and dublin society tried in vain to fathom elderly mammas and blushing débutantes were already thinking of the best means whereby next season they might more easily show the cold shoulder to young murray brooks who had so suddenly become a hopeless detrimental in the marriage market when all these sensations terminated in one gigantic overwhelming bit of scandal which for the next three months furnished food for gossip in every drawingroom in dublin  mr murray brooks namely had entered a claim for probate of a will made by his father in 1891 declaring that the later will made the very day of his fathers death and proved by his brother as sole executor was null and void that will being a forgery     chapter xxii  forgery   the facts that transpired in connection with this extraordinary case were sufficiently mysterious to puzzle everybody as i told you before all mr brooks friends never quite grasped the idea that the old man should so completely have cut off his favourite son with the proverbial shilling  you see percival had always been a thorn in the old mans flesh horseracing gambling theatres and musichalls were in the old porkbutchers eyes so many deadly sins which his son committed every day of his life and all the fitzwilliam place household could testify to the many and bitter quarrels which had arisen between father and son over the latters gambling or racing debts many people asserted that brooks would sooner have left his money to charitable institutions than seen it squandered upon the brightest stars that adorned the musichall stage  the case came up for hearing early in the autumn in the meanwhile percival brooks had given up his racecourse associates settled down in the fitzwilliam place mansion and conducted his fathers business without a manager but with all the energy and forethought which he had previously devoted to more unworthy causes  murray had elected not to stay on in the old house no doubt associations were of too painful and recent a nature he was boarding with the family of a mr wilson hibbert who was the late patrick wethereds the murdered lawyers partner they were quiet homely people who lived in a very pokey little house in kilkenny street and poor murray must in spite of his grief have felt very bitterly the change from his luxurious quarters in his fathers mansion to his present tiny room and homely meals  percival brooks who was now drawing an income of over a hundred thousand a year was very severely criticised for adhering so strictly to the letter of his fathers will and only paying his brother that paltry £300 a year which was very literally but the crumbs off his own magnificent dinner table  the issue of that contested will case was therefore awaited with eager interest in the meanwhile the police who had at first seemed fairly loquacious on the subject of the murder of mr patrick wethered suddenly became strangely reticent and by their very reticence aroused a certain amount of uneasiness in the public mind until one day the irish times published the following extraordinary enigmatic paragraph  we hear on authority which cannot be questioned that certain extraordinary developments are expected in connection with the brutal murder of our distinguished townsman mr wethered the police in fact are vainly trying to keep it secret that they hold a clue which is as important as it is sensational and that they only await the impending issue of a wellknown litigation in the probate court to effect an arrest  the dublin public flocked to the court to hear the arguments in the great will case i myself journeyed down to dublin as soon as i succeeded in fighting my way to the densely crowded court i took stock of the various actors in the drama which i as a spectator was prepared to enjoy there were percival brooks and murray his brother the two litigants both goodlooking and well dressed and both striving by keeping up a running conversation with their lawyer to appear unconcerned and confident of the issue with percival brooks was henry oranmore the eminent irish kc whilst walter hibbert a rising young barrister the son of wilson hibbert appeared for murray  the will of which the latter claimed probate was one dated 1891 and had been made by mr brooks during a severe illness which threatened to end his days this will had been deposited in the hands of messrs wethered and hibbert solicitors to the deceased and by it mr brooks left his personalty equally divided between his two sons but had left his business entirely to his youngest son with a charge of £2000 a year upon it payable to percival you see that murray brooks therefore had a very deep interest in that second will being found null and void  old mr hibbert had very ably instructed his son and walter hibberts opening speech was exceedingly clever he would show he said on behalf of his client that the will dated february 1st 1908 could never have been made by the late mr brooks as it was absolutely contrary to his avowed intentions and that if the late mr brooks did on the day in question make any fresh will at all it certainly was not the one proved by mr percival brooks for that was absolutely a forgery from beginning to end mr walter hibbert proposed to call several witnesses in support of both these points  on the other hand mr henry oranmore kc very ably and courteously replied that he too had several witnesses to prove that mr brooks certainly did make a will on the day in question and that whatever his intentions may have been in the past he must have modified them on the day of his death for the will proved by mr percival brooks was found after his death under his pillow duly signed and witnessed and in every way legal  then the battle began in sober earnest there were a great many witnesses to be called on both sides their evidence being of more or less importancechiefly less but the interest centred round the prosaic figure of john oneill the butler at fitzwilliam place who had been in mr brooks family for thirty years  i was clearing away my breakfast things said john when i heard the masters voice in the study close by oh my he was that angry i could hear the words disgrace and villain and liar and balletdancer and one or two other ugly words as applied to some female lady which i would not like to repeat at first i did not take much notice as i was quite used to hearing my poor dear master having words with mr percival so i went downstairs carrying my breakfast things but i had just started cleaning my silver when the study bell goes ringing violently and i hear mr percivals voice shouting in the hall john quick send for dr mulligan at once your master is not well send one of the men and you come up and help me to get mr brooks to bed  i sent one of the grooms for the doctor continued john who seemed still affected at the recollection of his poor master to whom he had evidently been very much attached and i went up to see mr brooks i found him lying on the study floor his head supported in mr percivals arms my father has fallen in a faint said the young master help me to get him up to his room before dr mulligan comes  mr percival looked very white and upset which was only natural and when we had got my poor master to bed i asked if i should not go and break the news to mr murray who had gone to business an hour ago however before mr percival had time to give me an order the doctor came i thought i had seen death plainly writ in my masters face and when i showed the doctor out an hour later and he told me that he would be back directly i knew that the end was near  mr brooks rang for me a minute or two later he told me to send at once for mr wethered or else for mr hibbert if mr wethered could not come i havent many hours to live john he says to memy heart is broke the doctor says my heart is broke a man shouldnt marry and have children john for they will sooner or later break his heart i was so upset i couldnt speak but i sent round at once for mr wethered who came himself just about three oclock that afternoon  after he had been with my master about an hour i was called in and mr wethered said to me that mr brooks wished me and one other of us servants to witness that he had signed a paper which was on a table by his bedside i called pat mooney the head footman and before us both mr brooks put his name at the bottom of that paper then mr wethered give me the pen and told me to write my name as a witness and that pat mooney was to do the same after that we were both told that we could go  the old butler went on to explain that he was present in his late masters room on the following day when the undertakers who had come to lay the dead man out found a paper underneath his pillow john oneill who recognized the paper as the one to which he had appended his signature the day before took it to mr percival and gave it into his hands  in answer to mr walter hibbert john asserted positively that he took the paper from the undertakers hand and went straight with it to mr percivals room  he was alone said john i gave him the paper he just glanced at it and i thought he looked rather astonished but he said nothing and i at once left the room  when you say that you recognized the paper as the one which you had seen your master sign the day before how did you actually recognize that it was the same paper asked mr hibbert amidst breathless interest on the part of the spectators i narrowly observed the witnesss face  it looked exactly the same paper to me sir replied john somewhat vaguely  did you look at the contents then  no sir certainly not  had you done so the day before  no sir only at my masters signature  then you only thought by the outside look of the paper that it was the same  it looked the same thing sir persisted john obstinately  you see continued the man in the corner leaning eagerly forward across the narrow marble table the contention of murray brooks adviser was that mr brooks having made a will and hidden itfor some reason or other under his pillowthat will had fallen through the means related by john oneill into the hands of mr percival brooks who had destroyed it and substituted a forged one in its place which adjudged the whole of mr brooks millions to himself it was a terrible and very daring accusation directed against a gentleman who in spite of his many wild oats sowed in early youth was a prominent and important figure in irish high life  all those present were aghast at what they heard and the whispered comments i could hear around me showed me that public opinion at least did not uphold mr murray brooks daring accusation against his brother  but john oneill had not finished his evidence and mr walter hibbert had a bit of sensation still up his sleeve he had namely produced a paper the will proved by mr percival brooks and had asked john oneill if once again he recognized the paper  certainly sir said john unhesitatingly that is the one the undertaker found under my poor dead masters pillow and which i took to mr percivals room immediately  then the paper was unfolded and placed before the witness  now mr oneill will you tell me if that is your signature  john looked at it for a moment then he said excuse me sir and produced a pair of spectacles which he carefully adjusted before he again examined the paper then he thoughtfully shook his head  it dont look much like my writing sir he said at last that is to say he added by way of elucidating the matter it does look like my writing but then i dont think it is  there was at that moment a look in mr percival brooks face continued the man in the corner quietly which then and there gave me the whole history of that quarrel that illness of mr brooks of the will aye and of the murder of patrick wethered too  all i wondered at was how every one of those learned counsel on both sides did not get the clue just the same as i did but went on arguing speechifying crossexamining for nearly a week until they arrived at the one conclusion which was inevitable from the very first namely that the will was a forgerya gross clumsy idiotic forgery since both john oneill and pat mooney the two witnesses absolutely repudiated the signatures as their own the only successful bit of caligraphy the forger had done was the signature of old mr brooks  it was a very curious fact and one which had undoubtedly aided the forger in accomplishing his work quickly that mr wethered the lawyer having no doubt realized that mr brooks had not many moments in life to spare had not drawn up the usual engrossed magnificent document dear to the lawyer heart but had used for his clients will one of those regular printed forms which can be purchased at any stationers  mr percival brooks of course flatly denied the serious allegation brought against him he admitted that the butler had brought him the document the morning after his fathers death and that he certainly on glancing at it had been very much astonished to see that that document was his fathers will against that he declared that its contents did not astonish him in the slightest degree that he himself knew of the testators intentions but that he certainly thought his father had entrusted the will to the care of mr wethered who did all his business for him  i only very cursorily glanced at the signature he concluded speaking in a perfectly calm clear voice you must understand that the thought of forgery was very far from my mind and that my fathers signature is exceedingly well imitated if indeed it is not his own which i am not at all prepared to believe as for the two witnesses signatures i dont think i had ever seen them before i took the document to messrs barkston and maud who had often done business for me before and they assured me that the will was in perfect form and order  asked why he had not entrusted the will to his fathers solicitors he replied  for the very simple reason that exactly half an hour before the will was placed in my hands i had read that mr patrick wethered had been murdered the night before mr hibbert the junior partner was not personally known to me  after that for forms sake a good deal of expert evidence was heard on the subject of the dead mans signature but that was quite unanimous and merely went to corroborate what had already been established beyond a doubt namely that the will dated february 1st 1908 was a forgery and probate of the will dated 1891 was therefore granted to mr murray brooks the sole executor mentioned therein     chapter xxiii  a memorable day   two days later the police applied for a warrant for the arrest of mr percival brooks on a charge of forgery  the crown prosecuted and mr brooks had again the support of mr oranmore the eminent kc perfectly calm like a man conscious of his own innocence and unable to grasp the idea that justice does sometimes miscarry mr brooks the son of the millionaire himself still the possessor of a very large fortune under the former will stood up in the dock on that memorable day in october 1908 which still no doubt lives in the memory of his many friends  all the evidence with regard to mr brooks last moments and the forged will was gone through over again that will it was the contention of the crown had been forged so entirely in favour of the accused cutting out every one else that obviously no one but the beneficiary under that false will would have had any motive in forging it  very pale and with a frown between his deepset handsome irish eyes percival brooks listened to this large volume of evidence piled up against him by the crown  at times he held brief consultations with mr oranmore who seemed as cool as a cucumber have you ever seen oranmore in court he is a character worthy of dickens his pronounced brogue his fat podgy cleanshaven face his not always immaculately clean large hands have often delighted the caricaturist as it very soon transpired during that memorable magisterial inquiry he relied for a verdict in favour of his client upon two main points and he had concentrated all his skill upon making these two points as telling as he possibly could  the first point was the question of time john oneill crossexamined by oranmore stated without hesitation that he had given the will to mr percival at eleven oclock in the morning and now the eminent kc brought forward and placed in the witnessbox the very lawyers into whose hands the accused had then immediately placed the will now mr barkston a very wellknown solicitor of king street declared positively that mr percival brooks was in his office at a quarter before twelve two of his clerks testified to the same time exactly and it was impossible contended mr oranmore that within threequarters of an hour mr brooks could have gone to a stationers bought a will form copied mr wethereds writing his fathers signature and that of john oneill and pat mooney  such a thing might have been planned arranged practised and ultimately after a great deal of trouble successfully carried out but human intelligence could not grasp the other as a possibility  still the judge wavered the eminent kc had shaken but not shattered his belief in the prisoners guilt but there was one point more and this oranmore with the skill of a dramatist had reserved for the fall of the curtain  he noted every sign in the judges face he guessed that his client was not yet absolutely safe then only did he produce his last two witnesses  one of them was mary sullivan one of the housemaids in the fitzwilliam mansion she had been sent up by the cook at a quarter past four oclock on the afternoon of february 1st with some hot water which the nurse had ordered for the masters room just as she was about to knock at the door mr wethered was coming out of the room mary stopped with the tray in her hand and at the door mr wethered turned and said quite loudly now dont fret dont be anxious do try and be calm your will is safe in my pocket nothing can change it or alter one word of it but yourself  it was of course a very ticklish point in law whether the housemaids evidence could be accepted you see she was quoting the words of a man since dead spoken to another man also dead there is no doubt that had there been very strong evidence on the other side against percival brooks mary sullivans would have counted for nothing but as i told you before the judges belief in the prisoners guilt was already very seriously shaken and now the final blow aimed at it by mr oranmore shattered his last lingering doubts  dr mulligan namely had been placed by mr oranmore into the witnessbox he was a medical man of unimpeachable authority in fact absolutely at the head of his profession in dublin what he said practically corroborated mary sullivans testimony he had gone in to see mr brooks at halfpast four and understood from him that his lawyer had just left him  mr brooks certainly though terribly weak was calm and more composed he was dying from a sudden heart attack and dr mulligan foresaw the almost immediate end but he was still conscious and managed to murmur feebly i feel much easier in my mind now doctorhave made my willwethered has beenhes got it in his pocketit is safe theresafe from that but the words died on his lips and after that he spoke but little he saw his two sons before he died but hardly knew them or even looked at them  you see concluded the man in the corner you see that the prosecution was bound to collapse oranmore did not give it a leg to stand on the will was forged it is true forged in the favour of percival brooks and of no one else forged for him and for his benefit whether he knew and connived at the forgery was never proved or as far as i know even hinted but it was impossible to go against all the evidence which pointed that as far as the act itself was concerned he at least was innocent you see dr mulligans evidence was not to be shaken mary sullivans was equally strong  there were two witnesses swearing positively that old brooks will was in mr wethereds keeping when that gentleman left the fitzwilliam mansion at a quarter past four at five oclock in the afternoon the lawyer was found dead in phoenix park between a quarter past four and eight oclock in the evening percival brooks never left the housethat was subsequently proved by oranmore up to the hilt and beyond a doubt since the will found under old brooks pillow was a forged will where then was the will he did make and which wethered carried away with him in his pocket  stolen of course said polly by those who murdered and robbed him it may have been of no value to them but they naturally would destroy it lest it might prove a clue against them  then you think it was mere coincidence he asked excitedly  what  that wethered was murdered and robbed at the very moment that he carried the will in his pocket whilst another was being forged in its place  it certainly would be very curious if it were a coincidence she said musingly  very he repeated with biting sarcasm whilst nervously his bony fingers played with the inevitable bit of string very curious indeed just think of the whole thing there was the old man with all his wealth and two sons one to whom he is devoted and the other with whom he does nothing but quarrel one day there is another of these quarrels but more violent more terrible than any that have previously occurred with the result that the father heartbroken by it all has an attack of apoplexy and practically dies of a broken heart after that he alters his will and subsequently a will is proved which turns out to be a forgery  now everybodypolice press and public alikeat once jump to the conclusion that as percival brooks benefits by that forged will percival brooks must be the forger  seek for him whom the crime benefits is your own axiom argued the girl  i beg your pardon  percival brooks benefited to the tune of £2000000  i beg your pardon he did nothing of the sort he was left with less than half the share that his younger brother inherited  now yes but that was a former will and  and that forged will was so clumsily executed the signature so carelessly imitated that the forgery was bound to come to light did that never strike you  yes but  there is no but he interrupted it was all as clear as daylight to me from the very first the quarrel with the old man which broke his heart was not with his eldest son with whom he was used to quarrelling but with the second son whom he idolised in whom he believed dont you remember how john oneill heard the words liar and deceit percival brooks had never deceived his father his sins were all on the surface murray had led a quiet life had pandered to his father and fawned upon him until like most hypocrites he at last got found out who knows what ugly gambling debt or debt of honour suddenly revealed to old brooks was the cause of that last and deadly quarrel  you remember that it was percival who remained beside his father and carried him up to his room where was murray throughout that long and painful day when his father lay dyinghe the idolised son the apple of the old mans eye you never hear his name mentioned as being present there all that day but he knew that he had offended his father mortally and that his father meant to cut him off with a shilling he knew that mr wethered had been sent for that wethered left the house soon after four oclock  and here the cleverness of the man comes in having lain in wait for wethered and knocked him on the back of the head with a stick he could not very well make that will disappear altogether there remained the faint chance of some other witnesses knowing that mr brooks had made a fresh will mr wethereds partner his clerk or one of the confidential servants in the house therefore a will must be discovered after the old mans death  now murray brooks was not an expert forger it takes years of training to become that a forged will executed by himself would be sure to be found outyes thats it sure to be found out the forgery will be palpablelet it be palpable and then it will be found out branded as such and the original will of 1891 so favourable to the young blackguards interests would be held as valid was it devilry or merely additional caution which prompted murray to pen that forged will so glaringly in percivals favour it is impossible to say  anyhow it was the cleverest touch in that marvellously devised crime to plan that evil deed was great to execute it was easy enough he had several hours leisure in which to do it then at night it was simplicity itself to slip the document under the dead mans pillow sacrilege causes no shudder to such natures as murray brooks the rest of the drama you know already  but percival brooks  the jury returned a verdict of not guilty there was no evidence against him  but the money surely the scoundrel does not have the enjoyment of it still  no he enjoyed it for a time but he died about three months ago and forgot to take the precaution of making a will so his brother percival has got the business after all if you ever go to dublin i should order some of brooks bacon if i were you it is very good     chapter xxiv  an unparalleled outrage   do you care for the seaside asked the man in the corner when he had finished his lunch i dont mean the seaside at ostend or trouville but honest english seaside with nigger minstrels threeshilling excursionists and dirty expensive furnished apartments where they charge you a shilling for lighting the hall gas on sundays and sixpence on other evenings do you care for that  i prefer the country  ah perhaps it is preferable personally i only liked one of our english seaside resorts once and that was for a week when edward skinner was up before the magistrate charged with what was known as the brighton outrage i dont know if you remember the memorable day in brighton memorable for that elegant town which deals more in amusements than mysteries when mr francis morton one of its most noted residents disappeared yes disappeared as completely as any vanishing lady in a musichall he was wealthy had a fine house servants a wife and children and he disappeared there was no getting away from that  mr francis morton lived with his wife in one of the large houses in sussex square at the kemp town end of brighton mrs morton was well known for her americanisms her swagger dinner parties and beautiful paris gowns she was the daughter of one of the many american millionaires i think her father was a chicago porkbutcher who conveniently provide wealthy wives for english gentlemen and she had married mr francis morton a few years ago and brought him her quarter of a million for no other reason but that she fell in love with him he was neither goodlooking nor distinguished in fact he was one of those men who seem to have city stamped all over their person  he was a gentleman of very regular habits going up to london every morning on business and returning every afternoon by the husbands train so regular was he in these habits that all the servants at the sussex square house were betrayed into actual gossip over the fact that on wednesday march 17th the master was not home for dinner hales the butler remarked that the mistress seemed a bit anxious and didnt eat much food the evening wore on and mr morton did not appear at nine oclock the young footman was dispatched to the station to make inquiries whether his master had been seen there in the afternoon or whetherwhich heaven forbidthere had been an accident on the line the young man interviewed two or three porters the bookstall boy and ticket clerk all were agreed that mr morton did not go up to london during the day no one had seen him within the precincts of the station there certainly had been no accident reported either on the up or down line  but the morning of the 18th came with its initial postmans knock but neither mr morton nor any sign or news from him mrs morton who evidently had spent a sleepless night for she looked sadly changed and haggard sent a wire to the hall porter at the large building in cannon street where her husband had his office an hour later she had the reply not seen mr morton all day yesterday not here today by the afternoon every one in brighton knew that a fellowresident had mysteriously disappeared from or in the city  a couple of days then another elapsed and still no sign of mr morton the police were doing their best the gentleman was so well known in brightonas he had been a resident two yearsthat it was not difficult to firmly establish the one fact that he had not left the city since no one saw him in the station on the morning of the 17th nor at any time since then mild excitement prevailed throughout the town at first the newspapers took the matter somewhat jocosely where is mr morton was the usual placard on the evenings contents bills but after three days had gone by and the worthy brighton resident was still missing while mrs morton was seen to look more haggard and careworn every day mild excitement gave place to anxiety  there were vague hints now as to foul play the news had leaked out that the missing gentleman was carrying a large sum of money on the day of his disappearance there were also vague rumours of a scandal not unconnected with mrs morton herself and her own past history which in her anxiety for her husband she had been forced to reveal to the detectiveinspector in charge of the case  then on saturday the news which the late evening papers contained was this  acting on certain information received the police today forced an entrance into one of the rooms of russell house a highclass furnished apartment on the kings parade and there they discovered our missing distinguished townsman mr francis morton who had been robbed and subsequently locked up in that room since wednesday the 17th when discovered he was in the last stages of inanition he was tied into an armchair with ropes a thick wool shawl had been wound round his mouth and it is a positive marvel that left thus without food and very little air the unfortunate gentleman survived the horrors of these four days of incarceration  he has been conveyed to his residence in sussex square and we are pleased to say that doctor mellish who is in attendance has declared his patient to be out of serious danger and that with care and rest he will be soon quite himself again  at the same time our readers will learn with unmixed satisfaction that the police of our city with their usual acuteness and activity have already discovered the identity and whereabouts of the cowardly ruffian who committed this unparalleled outrage     chapter xxv  the prisoner   i really dont know continued the man in the corner blandly what it was that interested me in the case from the very first certainly it had nothing very out of the way or mysterious about it but i journeyed down to brighton nevertheless as i felt that something deeper and more subtle lay behind that extraordinary assault following a robbery no doubt  i must tell you that the police had allowed it to be freely circulated abroad that they held a clue it had been easy enough to ascertain who the lodger was who had rented the furnished room in russell house his name was supposed to be edward skinner and he had taken the room about a fortnight ago but had gone away ostensibly for two or three days on the very day of mr mortons mysterious disappearance it was on the 20th that mr morton was found and thirtysix hours later the public were gratified to hear that mr edward skinner had been traced to london and arrested on the charge of assault upon the person of mr francis morton and of robbing him of the sum of £10000  then a further sensation was added to the already bewildering case by the startling announcement that mr francis morton refused to prosecute  of course the treasury took up the case and subpoenaed mr morton as a witness so that gentlemanif he wished to hush the matter up or had been in any way terrorised into a promise of doing sogained nothing by his refusal except an additional amount of curiosity in the public mind and further sensation around the mysterious case  it was all this you see which had interested me and brought me down to brighton on march 23rd to see the prisoner edward skinner arraigned before the beak i must say that he was a very ordinarylooking individual fair of ruddy complexion with snub nose and the beginning of a bald place on the top of his head he too looked the embodiment of a prosperous stodgy city gent  i took a quick survey of the witnesses present and guessed that the handsome stylish woman sitting next to mr reginald pepys the noted lawyer for the crown was mrs morton  there was a large crowd in court and i heard whispered comments among the feminine portion thereof as to the beauty of mrs mortons gown the value of her large picture hat and the magnificence of her diamond rings  the police gave all the evidence required with regard to the finding of mr morton in the room at russell house and also to the arrest of skinner at the langham hotel in london it appears that the prisoner seemed completely taken aback at the charge preferred against him and declared that though he knew mr francis morton slightly in business he knew nothing as to his private life  prisoner stated continued inspector buckle that he was not even aware mr morton lived in brighton but i have evidence here which i will place before your honour to prove that the prisoner was seen in the company of mr morton at 930 oclock on the morning of the assault  crossexamined by mr matthew quiller the detectiveinspector admitted that prisoner merely said that he did not know that mr morton was a resident of brightonhe never denied having met him there  the witness or rather witnesses referred to by the police were two brighton tradesmen who knew mr morton by sight and had seen him on the morning of the 17th walking with the accused  in this instance mr quiller had no question to ask of the witnesses and it was generally understood that the prisoner did not wish to contradict their statement  constable hartrick told the story of the finding of the unfortunate mr morton after his four days incarceration the constable had been sent round by the chief inspector after certain information given by mrs chapman the landlady of russell house he had found the door locked and forced it open mr morton was in an armchair with several yards of rope wound loosely round him he was almost unconscious and there was a thick wool shawl tied round his mouth which must have deadened any cry or groan the poor gentleman might have uttered but as a matter of fact the constable was under the impression that mr morton had been either drugged or stunned in some way at first which had left him weak and faint and prevented him from making himself heard or extricating himself from his bonds which were very clumsily evidently very hastily wound round his body  the medical officer who was called in and also dr mellish who attended mr morton both said that he seemed dazed by some stupefying drug and also of course terribly weak and faint with the want of food  the first witness of real importance was mrs chapman the proprietress of russell house whose original information to the police led to the discovery of mr morton in answer to mr pepys she said that on march 1st the accused called at her house and gave his name as mr edward skinner  he required he said a furnished room at a moderate rental for a permanency with full attendance when he was in but he added that he would often be away for two or three days or even longer at a time  he told me that he was a traveller for a teahouse continued mrs chapman and i showed him the front room on the third floor as he did not want to pay more than twelve shillings a week i asked him for a reference but he put three sovereigns in my hand and said with a laugh that he supposed paying for his room a month in advance was sufficient reference if i didnt like him after that i could give him a weeks notice to quit  you did not think of asking him the name of the firm for which he travelled asked mr pepys  no i was quite satisfied as he paid me for the room the next day he sent in his luggage and took possession of the room he went out most mornings on business but was always in brighton for saturday and sunday on the 16th he told me that he was going to liverpool for a couple of days he slept in the house that night and went off early on the 17th taking his portmanteau with him  at what time did he leave asked mr pepys  i couldnt say exactly replied mrs chapman with some hesitation you see this is the off season here none of my rooms are let except the one to mr skinner and i only have one servant i keep four during the summer autumn and winter season she added with conscious pride fearing that her former statement might prejudice the reputation of russell house i thought i had heard mr skinner go out about nine oclock but about an hour later the girl and i were both in the basement and we heard the front door open and shut with a bang and then a step in the hall  thats mr skinner said mary so it is i said why i thought he had gone an hour ago he did go out then said mary for he left his bedroom door open and i went in to do his bed and tidy his room just go and see if thats him mary i said and mary ran up to the hall and up the stairs and came back to tell me that that was mr skinner all right enough he had gone straight up to his room mary didnt see him but he had another gentleman with him as she could hear them talking in mr skinners room  then you cant tell us at what time the prisoner left the house finally  no that i cant i went out shopping soon after that when i came in it was twelve oclock i went up to the third floor and found that mr skinner had locked his door and taken the key with him as i knew mary had already done the room i did not trouble more about it though i did think it strange for a gentleman to look up his room and not leave the key with me  and of course you heard no noise of any kind in the room then  no not that day or the next but on the third day mary and i both thought we heard a funny sound i said that mr skinner had left his window open and it was the blind flapping against the windowpane but when we heard that funny noise again i put my ear to the keyhole and i thought i could hear a groan i was very frightened and sent mary for the police  mrs chapman had nothing more of interest to say the prisoner certainly was her lodger she had last seen him on the evening of the 16th going up to his room with his candle mary the servant had much the same story to relate as her mistress  i think it was im right enough said mary guardedly i didnt see im but i went up to is landing and stopped a moment outside is door i could ear loud voices in the roomgentlemen talking  i suppose you would not do such a thing as to listen mary queried mr pepys with a smile  no sir said mary with a bland smile i didnt catch what the gentlemen said but one of them spoke so loud i thought they must be quarrelling  mr skinner was the only person in possession of a latchkey i presume no one else could have come in without ringing at the door  oh no sir  that was all so far you see the case was progressing splendidly for the crown against the prisoner the contention of course was that skinner had met mr morton brought him home with him assaulted drugged then gagged and bound him and finally robbed him of whatever money he had in his possession which according to certain affidavits which presently would be placed before the magistrate amounted to £10000 in notes  but in all this there still remained the great element of mystery for which the public and the magistrate would demand an explanation namely what were the relationships between mr morton and skinner which had induced the former to refuse the prosecution of the man who had not only robbed him but had so nearly succeeded in leaving him to die a terrible and lingering death  mr morton was too ill as yet to appear in person dr mellish had absolutely forbidden his patient to undergo the fatigue and excitement of giving evidence himself in court that day but his depositions had been taken at his bedside were sworn to by him and were now placed before the magistrate by the prosecuting counsel and the facts they revealed were certainly as remarkable as they were brief and enigmatical  as they were read by mr pepys an awed and expectant hush seemed to descend over the large crowd gathered there and all necks were strained eagerly forward to catch a glimpse of a tall elegant woman faultlessly dressed and wearing exquisite jewellery but whose handsome face wore as the prosecuting counsel read her husbands deposition a more and more ashen hue  this your honour is the statement made upon oath by mr francis morton commenced mr pepys in that loud sonorous voice of his which sounds so impressive in a crowded and hushed court i was obliged for certain reasons which i refuse to disclose to make a payment of a large sum of money to a man whom i did not know and have never seen it was in a matter of which my wife was cognisant and which had entirely to do with her own affairs i was merely the gobetween as i thought it was not fit that she should see to this matter herself the individual in question had made certain demands of which she kept me in ignorance as long as she could not wishing to unnecessarily worry me at last she decided to place the whole matter before me and i agreed with her that it would be best to satisfy the mans demands  i then wrote to that individual whose name i do not wish to disclose addressing the letter as my wife directed me to do to the brighton post office saying that i was ready to pay the £10000 to him at any place or time and in what manner he might appoint i received a reply which bore the brighton postmark and which desired me to be outside furnivals the drapers in west street at 930 on the morning of march 17th and to bring the money £10000 in bank of england notes  on the 16th my wife gave me a cheque for the amount and i cashed it at her bankbirds in fleet street at halfpast nine the following morning i was at the appointed place an individual wearing a grey overcoat bowler hat and red tie accosted me by name and requested me to walk as far as his lodgings in the kings parade i followed him neither of us spoke he stopped at a house which bore the name russell house and which i shall be able to swear to as soon as i am able to go out he let himself in with a latchkey and asked me to follow him up to his room on the third floor i thought i noticed when we were in the room that he locked the door however i had nothing of any value about me except the £10000 which i was ready to give him we had not exchanged the slightest word  i gave him the notes and he folded them and put them in his pocketbook then i turned towards the door and without the slightest warning i felt myself suddenly gripped by the shoulder while a handkerchief was pressed to my nose and mouth i struggled as best i could but the handkerchief was saturated with chloroform and i soon lost consciousness i hazily remember the man saying to me in short jerky sentences spoken at intervals while i was still weakly struggling  what a fool you must think me my dear sir did you really think that i was going to let you quietly walk out of here straight to the policestation eh such dodges have been done before i know when a mans silence has to be bought for money find out who he is see where he lives give him the money then inform against him no you dont not this time i am off to the continong with this £10000 and i can get to newhaven in time for the midday boat so youll have to keep quiet until i am the other side of the channel my friend you wont be much inconvenienced my landlady will hear your groans presently and release you so youll be all right there now drink thisthats better he forced something bitter down my throat then i remember nothing more  when i regained consciousness i was sitting in an armchair with some rope tied round me and a wool shawl round my mouth i hadnt the strength to make the slightest effort to disentangle myself or to utter a scream i felt terribly sick and faint  mr reginald pepys had finished reading and no one in that crowded court had thought of uttering a sound the magistrates eyes were fixed upon the handsome lady in the magnificent gown who was mopping her eyes with a dainty lace handkerchief  the extraordinary narrative of the victim of so daring an outrage had kept every one in suspense one thing was still expected to make the measure of sensation as full as it had ever been over any criminal case and that was mrs mortons evidence she was called by the prosecuting counsel and slowly gracefully she entered the witnessbox there was no doubt that she had felt keenly the tortures which her husband had undergone and also the humiliation of seeing her name dragged forcibly into this ugly blackmailing scandal  closely questioned by mr reginald pepys she was forced to admit that the man who blackmailed her was connected with her early life in a way which would have brought terrible disgrace upon her and upon her children the story she told amidst many tears and sobs and much use of her beautiful lace handkerchief and beringed hands was exceedingly pathetic  it appears that when she was barely seventeen she was inveigled into a secret marriage with one of those foreign adventurers who swarm in every country and who styled himself comte armand de la tremouille he seems to have been a blackguard of unusually low pattern for after he had extracted from her some £200 of her pin money and a few diamond brooches he left her one fine day with a laconic word to say that he was sailing for europe by the argentina and would not be back for some time she was in love with the brute poor young soul for when a week later she read that the argentina was wrecked and presumably every soul on board had perished she wept very many bitter tears over her early widowhood  fortunately her father a very wealthy porkbutcher of chicago had known nothing of his daughters culpable foolishness four years later he took her to london where she met mr francis morton and married him she led six or seven years of very happy married life when one day like a thunderbolt from a clear blue sky she received a typewritten letter signed armand de la tremouille full of protestations of undying love telling a long and pathetic tale of years of suffering in a foreign land whither he had drifted after having been rescued almost miraculously from the wreck of the argentina and where he never had been able to scrape a sufficient amount of money to pay for his passage home at last fate had favoured him he had after many vicissitudes found the whereabouts of his dear wife and was now ready to forgive all that was past and take her to his loving arms once again  what followed was the usual course of events when there is a blackguard and a fool of a woman she was terrorised and did not dare to tell her husband for some time she corresponded with the comte de la tremouille begging him for her sake and in memory of the past not to attempt to see her she found him amenable to reason in the shape of several hundred pounds which passed through the brighton post office into his hands at last one day by accident mr morton came across one of the comte de la tremouilles interesting letters she confessed everything throwing herself upon her husbands mercy  now mr francis morton was a business man who viewed life practically and soberly he liked his wife who kept him in luxury and wished to keep her whereas the comte de la tremouille seemed willing enough to give her up for a consideration mrs morton who had the sole and absolute control of her fortune on the other hand was willing enough to pay the price and hush up the scandal which she believedsince she was a bit of a foolwould land her in prison for bigamy mr francis morton wrote to the comte de la tremouille that his wife was ready to pay him the sum of £10000 which he demanded in payment for her absolute liberty and his own complete disappearance out of her life now and for ever the appointment was made and mr morton left his house at 9 am on march 17th with the £10000 in his pocket  the public and the magistrate had hung breathless upon her words there was nothing but sympathy felt for this handsome woman who throughout had been more sinned against than sinning and whose gravest fault seems to have been a total lack of intelligence in dealing with her own life but i can assure you of one thing that in no case within my recollection was there ever such a sensation in a court as when the magistrate after a few minutes silence said gently to mrs morton  and now mrs morton will you kindly look at the prisoner and tell me if in him you recognize your former husband  and she without even turning to look at the accused said quietly  oh no your honour of course that man is not the comte de la tremouille     chapter xxvi  a sensation   i can assure you that the situation was quite dramatic continued the man in the corner whilst his funny clawlike hands took up a bit of string with renewed feverishness  in answer to further questions from the magistrate she declared that she had never seen the accused he might have been the gobetween however that she could not say the letters she received were all typewritten but signed armand de la tremouille and certainly the signature was identical with that on the letters she used to receive from him years ago all of which she had kept  and did it never strike you asked the magistrate with a smile that the letters you received might be forgeries  how could they be she replied decisively no one knew of my marriage to the comte de la tremouille no one in england certainly and besides if some one did know the comte intimately enough to forge his handwriting and to blackmail me why should that some one have waited all these years i have been married seven years your honour  that was true enough and there the matter rested as far as she was concerned but the identity of mr francis mortons assailant had to be finally established of course before the prisoner was committed for trial dr mellish promised that mr morton would be allowed to come to court for half an hour and identify the accused on the following day and the case was adjourned until then the accused was led away between two constables bail being refused and brighton had perforce to moderate its impatience until the wednesday  on that day the court was crowded to overflowing actors playwrights literary men of all sorts had fought for admission to study for themselves the various phases and faces in connection with the case mrs morton was not present when the prisoner quiet and selfpossessed was brought in and placed in the dock his solicitor was with him and a sensational defence was expected  presently there was a stir in the court and that certain sound half rustle half sigh which preludes an expected palpitating event mr morton pale thin wearing yet in his hollow eyes the stamp of those five days of suffering walked into court leaning on the arm of his doctormrs morton was not with him  he was at once accommodated with a chair in the witnessbox and the magistrate after a few words of kindly sympathy asked him if he had anything to add to his written statement on mr morton replying in the negative the magistrate added  and now mr morton will you kindly look at the accused in the dock and tell me whether you recognize the person who took you to the room in russell house and then assaulted you  slowly the sick man turned towards the prisoner and looked at him then he shook his head and replied quietly  no sir that certainly was not the man  you are quite sure asked the magistrate in amazement while the crowd literally gasped with wonder  i swear it asserted mr morton  can you describe the man who assaulted you  certainly he was dark of swarthy complexion tall thin with bushy eyebrows and thick black hair and short beard he spoke english with just the faintest suspicion of a foreign accent  the prisoner as i told you before was english in every feature english in his ruddy complexion and absolutely english in his speech  after that the case for the prosecution began to collapse every one had expected a sensational defence and mr matthew quiller counsel for skinner fully justified all these expectations he had no fewer than four witnesses present who swore positively that at 945 am on the morning of wednesday march 17th the prisoner was in the express train leaving brighton for victoria  not being endowed with the gift of being in two places at once and mr morton having added the whole weight of his own evidence in mr edward skinners favour that gentleman was once more remanded by the magistrate pending further investigation by the police bail being allowed this time in two sureties of £50 each     chapter xxvii  two blackguards   tell me what you think of it said the man in the corner seeing that polly remained silent and puzzled  well she replied dubiously i suppose that the socalled armand de la tremouilles story was true in substance that he did not perish on the argentina but drifted home and blackmailed his former wife  doesnt it strike you that there are at least two very strong points against that theory he asked making two gigantic knots in his piece of string  two  yes in the first place if the blackmailer was the comte de la tremouille returned to life why should he have been content to take £10000 from a lady who was his lawful wife and who could keep him in luxury for the rest of his natural life upon her large fortune which was close upon a quarter of a million the real comte de la tremouille remember had never found it difficult to get money out of his wife during their brief married life whatever mr mortons subsequent experience in the same direction might have been and secondly why should he have typewritten his letters to his wife  because  that was a point which to my mind the police never made the most of now my experience in criminal cases has invariably been that when a typewritten letter figures in one that letter is a forgery it is not very difficult to imitate a signature but it is a jolly sight more difficult to imitate a handwriting throughout an entire letter  then do you think  i think if you will allow me he interrupted excitedly that we will go through the pointsthe sensible tangible points of the case firstly mr morton disappears with £10000 in his pocket for four entire days at the end of that time he is discovered loosely tied to an armchair and a wool shawl round his mouth secondly a man named skinner is accused of the outrage mr morton although he himself is able mind you to furnish the best defence possible for skinner by denying his identity with the man who assaulted him refuses to prosecute why  he did not wish to drag his wifes name into the case  he must have known that the crown would take up the case then again how is it no one saw him in the company of the swarthy foreigner he described  two witnesses did see mr morton in company with skinner argued polly  yes at 920 in west street that would give edward skinner time to catch the 945 at the station and to entrust mr morton with the latchkey of russell house remarked the man in the corner dryly  what nonsense polly ejaculated  nonsense is it he said tugging wildly at his bit of string is it nonsense to affirm that if a man wants to make sure that his victim shall not escape he does not usually wind rope loosely round his figure nor does he throw a wool shawl lightly round his mouth the police were idiotic beyond words they themselves discovered that morton was so loosely fastened to his chair that very little movement would have disentangled him and yet it never struck them that nothing was easier for that particular type of scoundrel to sit down in an armchair and wind a few yards of rope round himself then having wrapped a wool shawl round his throat to slip his two arms inside the ropes  but what object would a man in mr mortons position have for playing such extraordinary pranks  ah the motive there you are what do i always tell you seek the motive now what was mr mortons position he was the husband of a lady who owned a quarter of a million of money not one penny of which he could touch without her consent as it was settled on herself and who after the terrible way in which she had been plundered and then abandoned in her early youth no doubt kept a very tight hold upon the pursestrings mr mortons subsequent life has proved that he had certain expensive not altogether avowable tastes one day he discovers the old love letters of the comte armand de la tremouille  then he lays his plans he typewrites a letter forges the signature of the erstwhile count and awaits events the fish does rise to the bait he gets sundry bits of money and his success makes him daring he looks round him for an accompliceclever unscrupulous greedyand selects mr edward skinner probably some former pal of his wild oats days  the plan was very neat you must confess mr skinner takes the room in russell house and studies all the manners and customs of his landlady and her servant he then draws the full attention of the police upon himself he meets morton in west street then disappears ostensibly after the assault in the meanwhile morton goes to russell house he walks upstairs talks loudly in the room then makes elaborate preparations for his comedy  why he nearly died of starvation  that i dare say was not a part of his reckoning he thought no doubt that mrs chapman or the servant would discover and rescue him pretty soon he meant to appear just a little faint and endured quietly the first twentyfour hours of inanition but the excitement and want of food told on him more than he expected after twentyfour hours he turned very giddy and sick and falling from one fainting fit into another was unable to give the alarm  however he is all right again now and concludes his part of a downright blackguard to perfection under the plea that his conscience does not allow him to live with a lady whose first husband is still alive he has taken a bachelor flat in london and only pays afternoon calls on his wife in brighton but presently he will tire of his bachelor life and will return to his wife and ill guarantee that the comte de la tremouille will never be heard of again  and that afternoon the man in the corner left miss polly burton alone with a couple of photos of two uninteresting stodgy quietlooking menmorton and skinnerwho if the old scarecrow was right in his theories wore a pair of the finest blackguards unhung     chapter xxviii  the regents park murder   by this time miss polly burton had become quite accustomed to her extraordinary visàvis in the corner  he was always there when she arrived in the selfsame corner dressed in one of his remarkable check tweed suits he seldom said good morning and invariably when she appeared he began to fidget with increased nervousness with some tattered and knotty piece of string  were you ever interested in the regents park murder he asked her one day  polly replied that she had forgotten most of the particulars connected with that curious murder but that she fully remembered the stir and flutter it had caused in a certain section of london society  the racing and gambling set particularly you mean he said all the persons implicated in the murder directly or indirectly were of the type commonly called society men or men about town whilst the harewood club in hanover square round which centred all the scandal in connection with the murder was one of the smartest clubs in london  probably the doings of the harewood club which was essentially a gambling club would for ever have remained officially absent from the knowledge of the police authorities but for the murder in the regents park and the revelations which came to light in connection with it  i dare say you know the quiet square which lies between portland place and the regents park and is called park crescent at its south end and subsequently park square east and west the marylebone road with all its heavy traffic cuts straight across the large square and its pretty gardens but the latter are connected together by a tunnel under the road and of course you must remember that the new tube station in the south portion of the square had not yet been planned  february 6th 1907 was a very foggy night nevertheless mr aaron cohen of 30 park square west at two oclock in the morning having finally pocketed the heavy winnings which he had just swept off the green table of the harewood club started to walk home alone an hour later most of the inhabitants of park square west were aroused from their peaceful slumbers by the sounds of a violent altercation in the road a mans angry voice was heard shouting violently for a minute or two and was followed immediately by frantic screams of police and murder then there was the double sharp report of firearms and nothing more  the fog was very dense and as you no doubt have experienced yourself it is very difficult to locate sound in a fog nevertheless not more than a minute or two had elapsed before constable f 18 the point policeman at the corner of marylebone road arrived on the scene and having first of all whistled for any of his comrades on the beat began to grope his way about in the fog more confused than effectually assisted by contradictory directions from the inhabitants of the houses close by who were nearly falling out of the upper windows as they shouted out to the constable  by the railings policeman  higher up the road  no lower down  it was on this side of the pavement i am sure  no the other  at last it was another policeman f 22 who turning into park square west from the north side almost stumbled upon the body of a man lying on the pavement with his head against the railings of the square by this time quite a little crowd of people from the different houses in the road had come down curious to know what had actually happened  the policeman turned the strong light of his bullseye lantern on the unfortunate mans face  it looks as if he had been strangled dont it he murmured to his comrade  and he pointed to the swollen tongue the eyes half out of their sockets bloodshot and congested the purple almost black hue of the face  at this point one of the spectators more callous to horrors peered curiously into the dead mans face he uttered an exclamation of astonishment  why surely its mr cohen from no 30  the mention of a name familiar down the length of the street had caused two or three other men to come forward and to look more closely into the horribly distorted mask of the murdered man  our nextdoor neighbour undoubtedly asserted mr ellison a young barrister residing at no 31  what in the world was he doing this foggy night all alone and on foot asked somebody else  he usually came home very late i fancy he belonged to some gambling club in town i dare say he couldnt get a cab to bring him out here mind you i dont know much about him we only knew him to nod to  poor beggar it looks almost like an oldfashioned case of garroting  anyway the blackguardly murderer whoever he was wanted to make sure he had killed his man added constable f 18 as he picked up an object from the pavement heres the revolver with two cartridges missing you gentlemen heard the report just now  he dont seem to have hit him though the poor bloke was strangled no doubt  and tried to shoot at his assailant obviously asserted the young barrister with authority  if he succeeded in hitting the brute there might be a chance of tracing the way he went  but not in the fog  soon however the appearance of the inspector detective and medical officer who had quickly been informed of the tragedy put an end to further discussion  the bell at no 30 was rung and the servantsall four of them womenwere asked to look at the body  amidst tears of horror and screams of fright they all recognized in the murdered man their master mr aaron cohen he was therefore conveyed to his own room pending the coroners inquest  the police had a pretty difficult task you will admit there were so very few indications to go by and at first literally no clue  the inquest revealed practically nothing very little was known in the neighbourhood about mr aaron cohen and his affairs his female servants did not even know the name or whereabouts of the various clubs he frequented  he had an office in throgmorton street and went to business every day he dined at home and sometimes had friends to dinner when he was alone he invariably went to the club where he stayed until the small hours of the morning  the night of the murder he had gone out at about nine oclock that was the last his servants had seen of him with regard to the revolver all four servants swore positively that they had never seen it before and that unless mr cohen had bought it that very day it did not belong to their master  beyond that no trace whatever of the murderer had been found but on the morning after the crime a couple of keys linked together by a short metal chain were found close to a gate at the opposite end of the square that which immediately faced portland place these were proved to be firstly mr cohens latchkey and secondly his gatekey of the square  it was therefore presumed that the murderer having accomplished his fell design and ransacked his victims pockets had found the keys and made good his escape by slipping into the square cutting under the tunnel and out again by the further gate he then took the precaution not to carry the keys with him any further but threw them away and disappeared in the fog  the jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown and the police were put on their mettle to discover the unknown and daring murderer the result of their investigations conducted with marvellous skill by mr william fisher led about a week after the crime to the sensational arrest of one of londons smartest young bucks  the case mr fisher had got up against the accused briefly amounted to this  on the night of february 6th soon after midnight play began to run very high at the harewood club in hanover square mr aaron cohen held the bank at roulette against some twenty or thirty of his friends mostly young fellows with no wits and plenty of money the bank was winning heavily and it appears that this was the third consecutive night on which mr aaron cohen had gone home richer by several hundreds than he had been at the start of play  young john ashley who is the son of a very worthy county gentleman who is mfh somewhere in the midlands was losing heavily and in his case also it appears that it was the third consecutive night that fortune had turned her face against him  remember continued the man in the corner that when i tell you all these details and facts i am giving you the combined evidence of several witnesses which it took many days to collect and to classify  it appears that young mr ashley though very popular in society was generally believed to be in what is vulgarly termed low water up to his eyes in debt and mortally afraid of his dad whose younger son he was and who had on one occasion threatened to ship him off to australia with a £5 note in his pocket if he made any further extravagant calls upon his paternal indulgence  it was also evident to all john ashleys many companions that the worthy mfh held the pursestrings in a very tight grip the young man bitten with the desire to cut a smart figure in the circles in which he moved had often recourse to the varying fortunes which now and again smiled upon him across the green tables in the harewood club  be that as it may the general consensus of opinion at the club was that young ashley had changed his last pony before he sat down to a turn of roulette with aaron cohen on that particular night of february 6th  it appears that all his friends conspicuous among whom was mr walter hatherell tried their very best to dissuade him from pitting his luck against that of cohen who had been having a most unprecedented run of good fortune but young ashley heated with wine exasperated at his own bad luck would listen to no one he tossed one £5 note after another on the board he borrowed from those who would lend then played on parole for a while finally at halfpast one in the morning after a run of nineteen on the red the young man found himself without a penny in his pockets and owing a debtgambling debta debt of honour of £1500 to mr aaron cohen  now we must render this much maligned gentleman that justice which was persistently denied to him by press and public alike it was positively asserted by all those present that mr cohen himself repeatedly tried to induce young mr ashley to give up playing he himself was in a delicate position in the matter as he was the winner and once or twice the taunt had risen to the young mans lips accusing the holder of the bank of the wish to retire on a competence before the break in his luck  mr aaron cohen smoking the best of havanas had finally shrugged his shoulders and said as you please  but at halfpast one he had had enough of the player who always lost and never paidnever could pay so mr cohen probably believed he therefore at that hour refused to accept mr john ashleys promissory stakes any longer a very few heated words ensued quickly checked by the management who are ever on the alert to avoid the least suspicion of scandal  in the meanwhile mr hatherell with great good sense persuaded young ashley to leave the club and all its temptations and go home if possible to bed  the friendship of the two young men which was very well known in society consisted chiefly it appears in walter hatherell being the willing companion and helpmeet of john ashley in his mad and extravagant pranks but tonight the latter apparently tardily sobered by his terrible and heavy losses allowed himself to be led away by his friend from the scene of his disasters it was then about twenty minutes to two  here the situation becomes interesting continued the man in the corner in his nervous way no wonder that the police interrogated at least a dozen witnesses before they were quite satisfied that every statement was conclusively proved  walter hatherell after about ten minutes absence that is to say at ten minutes to two returned to the club room in reply to several inquiries he said that he had parted with his friend at the corner of new bond street since he seemed anxious to be alone and that ashley said he would take a turn down piccadilly before going homehe thought a walk would do him good  at two oclock or thereabouts mr aaron cohen satisfied with his evenings work gave up his position at the bank and pocketing his heavy winnings started on his homeward walk while mr walter hatherell left the club half an hour later  at three oclock precisely the cries of murder and the report of firearms were heard in park square west and mr aaron cohen was found strangled outside the garden railings     chapter xxix  the motive   now at first sight the murder in the regents park appeared both to police and public as one of those silly clumsy crimes obviously the work of a novice and absolutely purposeless seeing that it could but inevitably lead its perpetrators without any difficulty to the gallows  you see a motive had been established seek him whom the crime benefits say our french confrères but there was something more than that  constable james funnell on his beat turned from portland place into park crescent a few minutes after he had heard the clock at holy trinity church marylebone strike halfpast two the fog at that moment was perhaps not quite so dense as it was later on in the morning and the policeman saw two gentlemen in overcoats and tophats leaning arm in arm against the railings of the square close to the gate he could not of course distinguish their faces because of the fog but he heard one of them saying to the other  it is but a question of time mr cohen i know my father will pay the money for me and you will lose nothing by waiting  to this the other apparently made no reply and the constable passed on when he returned to the same spot after having walked over his beat the two gentlemen had gone but later on it was near this very gate that the two keys referred to at the inquest had been found  another interesting fact added the man in the corner with one of those sarcastic smiles of his which polly could not quite explain was the finding of the revolver upon the scene of the crime that revolver shown to mr ashleys valet was sworn to by him as being the property of his master  all these facts made of course a very remarkable so far quite unbroken chain of circumstantial evidence against mr john ashley no wonder therefore that the police thoroughly satisfied with mr fishers work and their own applied for a warrant against the young man and arrested him in his rooms in clarges street exactly a week after the committal of the crime  as a matter of fact you know experience has invariably taught me that when a murderer seems particularly foolish and clumsy and proofs against him seem particularly damning that is the time when the police should be most guarded against pitfalls  now in this case if john ashley had indeed committed the murder in regents park in the manner suggested by the police he would have been a criminal in more senses than one for idiocy of that kind is to my mind worse than many crimes  the prosecution brought its witnesses up in triumphal array one after another there were the members of the harewood clubwho had seen the prisoners excited condition after his heavy gambling losses to mr aaron cohen there was mr hatherell who in spite of his friendship for ashley was bound to admit that he had parted from him at the corner of bond street at twenty minutes to two and had not seen him again till his return home at five am  then came the evidence of arthur chipps john ashleys valet it proved of a very sensational character  he deposed that on the night in question his master came home at about ten minutes to two chipps had then not yet gone to bed five minutes later mr ashley went out again telling the valet not to sit up for him chipps could not say at what time either of the young gentlemen had come home  that short visit homepresumably to fetch the revolverwas thought to be very important and mr john ashleys friends felt that his case was practically hopeless  the valets evidence and that of james funnell the constable who had overheard the conversation near the park railings were certainly the two most damning proofs against the accused i assure you i was having a rare old time that day there were two faces in court to watch which was the greatest treat i had had for many a day one of these was mr john ashleys  heres his photoshort dark dapper a little racy in style but otherwise he looks a son of a welltodo farmer he was very quiet and placid in court and addressed a few words now and again to his solicitor he listened gravely and with an occasional shrug of the shoulders to the recital of the crime such as the police had reconstructed it before an excited and horrified audience  mr john ashley driven to madness and frenzy by terrible financial difficulties had first of all gone home in search of a weapon then waylaid mr aaron cohen somewhere on that gentlemans way home the young man had begged for delay mr cohen perhaps was obdurate but ashley followed him with his importunities almost to his door  there seeing his creditor determined at last to cut short the painful interview he had seized the unfortunate man at an unguarded moment from behind and strangled him then fearing that his dastardly work was not fully accomplished he had shot twice at the already dead body missing it both times from sheer nervous excitement the murderer then must have emptied his victims pockets and finding the key of the garden thought that it would be a safe way of evading capture by cutting across the squares under the tunnel and so through the more distant gate which faced portland place  the loss of the revolver was one of those unforeseen accidents which a retributive providence places in the path of the miscreant delivering him by his own act of folly into the hands of human justice  mr john ashley however did not appear the least bit impressed by the recital of his crime he had not engaged the services of one of the most eminent lawyers expert at extracting contradictions from witnesses by skilful crossexaminationsoh dear me no he had been contented with those of a dull prosy very secondrate limb of the law who as he called his witnesses was completely innocent of any desire to create a sensation  he rose quietly from his seat and amidst breathless silence called the first of three witnesses on behalf of his client he called threebut he could have produced twelvegentlemen members of the ashton club in great portland street all of whom swore that at three oclock on the morning of february 6th that is to say at the very moment when the cries of murder roused the inhabitants of park square west and the crime was being committed mr john ashley was sitting quietly in the clubrooms of the ashton playing bridge with the three witnesses he had come in a few minutes before threeas the hall porter of the club testifiedand stayed for about an hour and a half  i need not tell you that this undoubted this fully proved alibi was a positive bombshell in the stronghold of the prosecution the most accomplished criminal could not possibly be in two places at once and though the ashton club transgresses in many ways against the gambling laws of our very moral country yet its members belong to the best most unimpeachable classes of society mr ashley had been seen and spoken to at the very moment of the crime by at least a dozen gentlemen whose testimony was absolutely above suspicion  mr john ashleys conduct throughout this astonishing phase of the inquiry remained perfectly calm and correct it was no doubt the consciousness of being able to prove his innocence with such absolute conclusion that had steadied his nerves throughout the proceedings  his answers to the magistrate were clear and simple even on the ticklish subject of the revolver  i left the club sir he explained fully determined to speak with mr cohen alone in order to ask him for a delay in the settlement of my debt to him you will understand that i should not care to do this in the presence of other gentlemen i went home for a minute or twonot in order to fetch a revolver as the police assert for i always carry a revolver about with me in foggy weatherbut in order to see if a very important business letter had come for me in my absence  then i went out again and met mr aaron cohen not far from the harewood club i walked the greater part of the way with him and our conversation was of the most amicable character we parted at the top of portland place near the gate of the square where the policeman saw us mr cohen then had the intention of cutting across the square as being a shorter way to his own house i thought the square looked dark and dangerous in the fog especially as mr cohen was carrying a large sum of money  we had a short discussion on the subject and finally i persuaded him to take my revolver as i was going home only through very frequented streets and moreover carried nothing that was worth stealing after a little demur mr cohen accepted the loan of my revolver and that is how it came to be found on the actual scene of the crime finally i parted from mr cohen a very few minutes after i had heard the church clock striking a quarter before three i was at the oxford street end of great portland street at five minutes to three and it takes at least ten minutes to walk from where i was to the ashton club  this explanation was all the more credible mind you because the question of the revolver had never been very satisfactorily explained by the prosecution a man who has effectually strangled his victim would not discharge two shots of his revolver for apparently no other purpose than that of rousing the attention of the nearest passerby it was far more likely that it was mr cohen who shotperhaps wildly into the air when suddenly attacked from behind mr ashleys explanation therefore was not only plausible it was the only possible one  you will understand therefore how it was that after nearly half an hours examination the magistrate the police and the public were alike pleased to proclaim that the accused left the court without a stain upon his character     chapter xxx  friends   yes interrupted polly eagerly since for once her acumen had been at least as sharp as his but suspicion of that horrible crime only shifted its taint from one friend to another and of course i know  but thats just it he quietly interrupted you dont knowmr walter hatherell of course you mean so did every one else at once the friend weak and willing committing a crime on behalf of his cowardly yet more assertive friend who had tempted him to evil it was a good theory and was held pretty generally i fancy even by the police  i say even because they worked really hard in order to build up a case against young hatherell but the great difficulty was that of time at the hour when the policeman had seen the two men outside park square together walter hatherell was still sitting in the harewood club which he never left until twenty minutes to two had he wished to waylay and rob aaron cohen he would not have waited surely till the time when presumably the latter would already have reached home  moreover twenty minutes was an incredibly short time in which to walk from hanover square to regents park without the chance of cutting across the squares to look for a man whose whereabouts you could not determine to within twenty yards or so to have an argument with him murder him and ransack his pockets and then there was the total absence of motive  but said polly meditatively for she remembered now that the regents park murder as it had been popularly called was one of those which had remained as impenetrable a mystery as any other crime had ever been in the annals of the police  the man in the corner cocked his funny birdlike head well on one side and looked at her highly amused evidently at her perplexity  you do not see how that murder was committed he asked with a grin  polly was bound to admit that she did not  if you had happened to have been in mr john ashleys predicament he persisted you do not see how you could conveniently have done away with mr aaron cohen pocketed his winnings and then led the police of your country entirely by the nose by proving an indisputable alibi  i could not arrange conveniently she retorted to be in two different places half a mile apart at one and the same time  no i quite admit that you could not do this unless you also had a friend  a friend but you say  i say that i admired mr john ashley for his was the head which planned the whole thing but he could not have accomplished the fascinating and terrible drama without the help of willing and able hands  even then she protested  point number one he began excitedly fidgeting with his inevitable piece of string john ashley and his friend walter hatherell leave the club together and together decide on the plan of campaign hatherell returns to the club and ashley goes to fetch the revolverthe revolver which played such an important part in the drama but not the part assigned to it by the police now try to follow ashley closely as he dogs aaron cohens footsteps do you believe that he entered into conversation with him that he walked by his side that he asked for delay no he sneaked behind him and caught him by the throat as the garroters used to do in the fog cohen was apoplectic and ashley is young and powerful moreover he meant to kill  but the two men talked together outside the square gates protested polly one of whom was cohen and the other ashley  pardon me he said jumping up in his seat like a monkey on a stick there were not two men talking outside the square gates according to the testimony of james funnell the constable two men were leaning arm in arm against the railings and one man was talking  then you think that  at the hour when james funnell heard holy trinity clock striking halfpast two aaron cohen was already dead look how simple the whole thing is he added eagerly and how easy after thateasy but oh dear me how wonderfully how stupendously clever as soon as james funnell has passed on john ashley having opened the gate lifts the body of aaron cohen in his arms and carries him across the square the square is deserted of course but the way is easy enough and we must presume that ashley had been in it before anyway there was no fear of meeting any one  in the meantime hatherell has left the club as fast as his athletic legs can carry him he rushes along oxford street and portland place it had been arranged between the two miscreants that the square gate should be left on the latch  close on ashleys heels now hatherell too cuts across the square and reaches the further gate in good time to give his confederate a hand in disposing the body against the railings then without another instants delay ashley runs back across the gardens straight to the ashton club throwing away the keys of the dead man on the very spot where he had made it a point of being seen and heard by a passerby  hatherell gives his friend six or seven minutes start then he begins the altercation which lasts two or three minutes and finally rouses the neighbourhood with cries of murder and report of pistol in order to establish that the crime was committed at the hour when its perpetrator has already made out an indisputable alibi  i dont know what you think of it all of course added the funny creature as he fumbled for his coat and his gloves but i call the planning of that murderon the part of novices mind youone of the cleverest pieces of strategy i have ever come across it is one of those cases where there is no possibility whatever now of bringing the crime home to its perpetrator or his abettor they have not left a single proof behind them they foresaw everything and each acted his part with a coolness and courage which applied to a great and good cause would have made fine statesmen of them both  as it is i fear they are just a pair of young blackguards who have escaped human justice and have only deserved the full and ungrudging admiration of yours very sincerely  he had gone polly wanted to call him back but his meagre person was no longer visible through the glass door there were many things she would have wished to ask of himwhat were his proofs his facts his were theories after all and yet somehow she felt that he had solved once again one of the darkest mysteries of great criminal london     chapter xxxi  the de genneville peerage   the man in the corner rubbed his chin thoughtfully and looked out upon the busy street below  i suppose he said there is some truth in the saying that providence watches over bankrupts kittens and lawyers  i didnt know there was such a saying replied polly with guarded dignity  isnt there perhaps i am misquoting anyway there should be kittens it seems live and thrive through social and domestic upheavals which would annihilate a selfsupporting tomcat and today i read in the morning papers the account of a noble lords bankruptcy and in the society ones that of his visit at the house of a cabinet minister where he is the most honoured guest as for lawyers when providence had exhausted all other means of securing their welfare it brought forth the peerage cases  i believe as a matter of fact that this special dispensation of providence as you call it requires more technical knowledge than any other legal complication that comes before the law courts she said  and also a great deal more money in the clients pocket than any other complication now take the brockelsby peerage case have you any idea how much money was spent over that soap bubble which only burst after many hundreds if not thousands of pounds went in lawyers and counsels fees  i suppose a great deal of money was spent on both sides she replied until that sudden awful issue  which settled the dispute effectually he interrupted with a dry chuckle of course it is very doubtful if any reputable solicitor would have taken up the case timothy beddingfield the birmingham lawyer is a gentleman whowellhas had some misfortunes shall we say he is still on the rolls mind you but i doubt if any case would have its chances improved by his conducting it against that there is just this to be said that some of these old peerages have such peculiar histories and own such wonderful archives that a claim is always worth investigatingyou never know what may be the rights of it  i believe that at first every one laughed over the pretensions of the hon robert ingram de genneville to the joint title and part revenues of the old barony of genneville but obviously he might have got his case it certainly sounded almost like a fairytale this claim based upon the supposed validity of an ancient document over 400 years old it was then that a mediaeval lord de genneville more endowed with muscle than common sense became during his turbulent existence much embarrassed and hopelessly puzzled through the presentation made to him by his lady of twinborn sons  his embarrassment chiefly arose from the fact that my ladys attendants while ministering to the comfort of the mother had in a moment of absentmindedness so placed the two infants in their cot that subsequently no one not evenperhaps least of allthe mother could tell which was the one who had been the first to make his appearance into this troublesome and puzzling world  after many years of cogitation during which the lord de genneville approached nearer to the grave and his sons to mans estate he gave up trying to solve the riddle as to which of the twins should succeed to his title and revenues he appealed to his liege lord and kingedward fourth of that nameand with the latters august sanction he drew up a certain document wherein he enacted that both his sons should after his death share his titles and goodly revenues and that the first son born in wedlock of either father should subsequently be the sole heir  in this document was also added that if in future times should any lords de genneville be similarly afflicted with twin sons who had equal rights to be considered the eldest born the same rule should apply as to the succession  subsequently a lord de genneville was created earl of brockelsby by one of the stuart kings but for four hundred years after its enactment the extraordinary deed of succession remained a mere tradition the countesses of brockelsby having seemingly no predilection for twins but in 1878 the mistress of brockelsby castle presented her lord with twinborn sons  fortunately in modern times science is more wideawake and attendants more careful the twin brothers did not get mixed up and one of them was styled viscount tirlemont and was heir to the earldom whilst the other born two hours later was that fascinating dashing young guardsman well known at hurlingham goodwood london and in his own countythe hon robert ingram de genneville  it certainly was an evil day for this brilliant young scion of the ancient race when he lent an ear to timothy beddingfield this man and his family before him had been solicitors to the earls of brockelsby for many generations but timothy owing to certain irregularities had forfeited the confidence of his client the late earl  he was still in practice in birmingham however and of course knew the ancient family tradition anent the twin succession whether he was prompted by revenge or merely selfadvertisement no one knows  certain it is that he did advise the hon robert de gennevillewho apparently had more debts than he conveniently could pay and more extravagant tastes than he could gratify on a younger sons portionto lay a claim on his fathers death to the joint title and a moiety of the revenues of the ancient barony of genneville that claim being based upon the validity of the fifteenthcentury document  you may gather how extensive were the pretensions of the hon robert from the fact that the greater part of edgbaston is now built upon land belonging to the old barony anyway it was the last straw in an ocean of debt and difficulties and i have no doubt that beddingfield had not much trouble in persuading the hon robert to commence litigation at once  the young earl of brockelsbys attitude however remained one of absolute quietude in his nine points of the law he was in possession both of the title and of the document it was for the other side to force him to produce the one or to share the other  it was at this stage of the proceedings that the hon robert was advised to marry in order to secure if possible the first male heir of the next generation since the young earl himself was still a bachelor a suitable fiancée was found for him by his friends in the person of miss mabel brandon the daughter of a rich birmingham manufacturer and the marriage was fixed to take place at birmingham on thursday september 15th 1907  on the 13th the hon robert ingram de genneville arrived at the castle hotel in new street for his wedding and on the 14th at eight oclock in the morning he was discovered lying on the floor of his bedroommurdered  the sensation which the awful and unexpected sequel to the do genneville peerage case caused in the minds of the friends of both litigants was quite unparalleled i dont think any crime of modern times created quite so much stir in all classes of society birmingham was wild with excitement and the employés of the castle hotel had real difficulty in keeping off the eager and inquisitive crowd who thronged daily to the hall vainly hoping to gather details of news relating to the terrible tragedy  at present there was but little to tell the shrieks of the chambermaid who had gone into the hon roberts room with his shaving water at eight oclock had attracted some of the waiters soon the manager and his secretary came up and immediately sent for the police  it seemed at first sight as if the young man had been the victim of a homicidal maniac so brutal had been the way in which he had been assassinated the head and body were battered and bruised by some heavy stick or poker almost past human shape as if the murderer had wished to wreak some awful vengeance upon the body of his victim in fact it would be impossible to recount the gruesome aspect of that room and of the murdered mans body such as the police and the medical officer took note of that day  it was supposed that the murder had been committed the evening before as the victim was dressed in his evening clothes and all the lights in the room had been left fully turned on robbery also must have had a large share in the miscreants motives for the drawers and cupboards the portmanteau and dressingbag had been ransacked as if in search of valuables on the floor there lay a pocketbook torn in half and only containing a few letters addressed to the hon robert de genneville  the earl of brockelsby nextofkin to the deceased was also telegraphed for he drove over from brockelsby castle which is about seven miles from birmingham he was terribly affected by the awfulness of the tragedy and offered a liberal reward to stimulate the activity of the police in search of the miscreant  the inquest was fixed for the 17th three days later and the public was left wondering where the solution lay of the terrible and gruesome murder at the castle hotel     chapter xxxii  a highbred gentleman   the central figure in the coroners court that day was undoubtedly the earl of brockelsby in deep black which contrasted strongly with his florid complexion and fair hair sir marmaduke ingersoll his solicitor was with him and he had already performed the painful duty of identifying the deceased as his brother this had been an exceedingly painful duty owing to the terribly mutilated state of the body and face but the clothes and various trinkets he wore including a signet ring had fortunately not tempted the brutal assassin and it was through them chiefly that lord brockelsby was able to swear to the identity of his brother  the various employés at the hotel gave evidence as to the discovery of the body and the medical officer gave his opinion as to the immediate cause of death deceased had evidently been struck at the back of the head with a poker or heavy stick the murderer then venting his blind fury upon the body by battering in the face and bruising it in a way that certainly suggested the work of a maniac  then the earl of brockelsby was called and was requested by the coroner to state when he had last seen his brother alive  the morning before his death replied his lordship he came up to birmingham by an early train and i drove up from brockelsby to see him i got to the hotel at eleven oclock and stayed with him for about an hour  and that is the last you saw of the deceased  that is the last i saw of him replied lord brockelsby  he seemed to hesitate for a moment or two as if in thought whether he should speak or not and then to suddenly make up his mind to speak for he added i stayed in town the whole of that day and only drove back to brockelsby late in the evening i had some business to transact and put up at the grand as i usually do and dined with some friends  would you tell us at what time you returned to brockelsby castle  i think it must have been about eleven oclock it is a sevenmile drive from here  i believe said the coroner after a slight pause during which the attention of all the spectators was riveted upon the handsome figure of the young man as he stood in the witnessbox the very personification of a highbred gentleman i believe that i am right in stating that there was an unfortunate legal dispute between your lordship and your brother  that is so  the coroner stroked his chin thoughtfully for a moment or two then he added  in the event of the deceaseds claim to the joint title and revenues of de genneville being held good in the courts of law there would be a great importance would there not attached to his marriage which was to have taken place on the 15th  in that event there certainly would be  is the jury to understand then that you and the deceased parted on amicable terms after your interview with him in the morning  the earl of brockelsby hesitated again for a minute or two while the crowd and the jury hung breathless on his lips  there was no enmity between us he replied at last  from which we may gather that there may have beenshall i saya slight disagreement at that interview  my brother had unfortunately been misled by the misrepresentations or perhaps the too optimistic views of his lawyer he had been dragged into litigation on the strength of an old family document which he had never seen which moreover is antiquated and owing to certain wording in it invalid i thought that it would be kinder and more considerate if i were to let my brother judge of the document for himself i knew that when he had seen it he would be convinced of the absolutely futile basis of his claim and that it would be a terrible disappointment to him that is the reason why i wished to see him myself about it rather than to do it through the more formalperhaps more correctmedium of our respective lawyers i placed the facts before him with on my part a perfectly amicable spirit  the young earl of brockelsby had made this somewhat lengthy perfectly voluntary explanation of the state of affairs in a calm quiet voice with much dignity and perfect simplicity but the coroner did not seem impressed by it for he asked very drily  did you part good friends  on my side absolutely so  but not on his insisted the coroner  i think he felt naturally annoyed that he had been so illadvised by his solicitors  and you made no attempt later on in the day to adjust any illfeeling that may have existed between you and him asked the coroner marking with strange earnest emphasis every word he uttered  if you mean did i go and see my brother again that dayno i did not  and your lordship can give us no further information which might throw some light upon the mystery which surrounds the hon robert de gennevilles death still persisted the coroner  i am sorry to say i cannot replied the earl of brockelsby with firm decision  the coroner still looked puzzled and thoughtful it seemed at first as if he wished to press his point further every one felt that some deep import had lain behind his examination of the witness and all were on tenterhooks as to what the next evidence might bring forth the earl of brockelsby had waited a minute or two then at a sign from the coroner had left the witnessbox in order to have a talk with his solicitor  at first he paid no attention to the depositions of the cashier and hall porter of the castle hotel but gradually it seemed to strike him that curious statements were being made by these witnesses and a frown of anxious wonder settled between his brows whilst his young face lost some of its florid hue  mr tremlett the cashier at the hotel had been holding the attention of the court he stated that the hon robert ingram de genneville had arrived at the hotel at eight oclock on the morning of the 13th he had the room which he usually occupied when he came to the castle namely no 21 and he went up to it immediately on his arrival ordering some breakfast to be brought up to him  at eleven oclock the earl of brockelsby called to see his brother and remained with him until about twelve in the afternoon deceased went out and returned for his dinner at seven oclock in company with a gentleman whom the cashier knew well by sight mr timothy beddingfield the lawyer of paradise street the gentlemen had their dinner downstairs and after that they went up to the hon mr de gennevilles room for coffee and cigars  i could not say at what time mr beddingfield left continued the cashier but i rather fancy i saw him in the hall at about 915 pm he was wearing an inverness cape over his dress clothes and a glengarry cap it was just at the hour when the visitors who had come down for the night from london were arriving thick and fast the hall was very full and there was a large party of americans monopolising most of our personnel so i could not swear positively whether i did see mr beddingfield or not then though i am quite sure that it was mr timothy beddingfield who dined and spent the evening with the hon mr de genneville as i know him quite well by sight at ten oclock i am off duty and the night porter remains alone in the hall  mr tremletts evidence was corroborated in most respects by a waiter and by the hall porter they had both seen the deceased come in at seven oclock in company with a gentleman and their description of the latter coincided with that of the appearance of mr timothy beddingfield whom however they did not actually know  at this point of the proceedings the foreman of the jury wished to know why mr timothy beddingfields evidence had not been obtained and was informed by the detectiveinspector in charge of the case that that gentleman had seemingly left birmingham but was expected home shortly the coroner suggested an adjournment pending mr beddingfields appearance but at the earnest request of the detective he consented to hear the evidence of peter tyrrell the night porter at the castle hotel who if you remember the case at all succeeded in creating the biggest sensation of any which had been made through this extraordinary and weirdly gruesome case  it was the first time i had been on duty at the castle he said for i used to be night porter at brights in wolverhampton but just after i had come on duty at ten oclock a gentleman came and asked if he could see the hon robert de genneville i said that i thought he was in but would send up and see the gentleman said it doesnt matter dont trouble i know his room twentyone isnt it and up he went before i could say another word  did he give you any name asked the coroner  no sir  what was he like  a young gentleman sir as far as i can remember in an inverness cape and glengarry cap but i could not see his face very well as he stood with his back to the light and the cap shaded his eyes and he only spoke to me for a minute  look all round you said the coroner quietly is there any one in this court at all like the gentleman you speak of  an awed hush fell over the many spectators there present as peter tyrrell the night porter of the castle hotel turned his head towards the body of the court and slowly scanned the many faces there present for a moment he seemed to hesitateonly for a moment though then as if vaguely conscious of the terrible importance his next words might have he shook his head gravely and said  i wouldnt like to swear  the coroner tried to press him but with true british stolidity he repeated i wouldnt like to say  well then what happened asked the coroner who had perforce to abandon his point  the gentleman went upstairs sir and about a quarter of an hour later he come down again and i let him out he was in a great hurry then he threw me a halfcrown and said good night  and though you saw him again then you cannot tell us if you would know him again  once more the hall porters eyes wandered as if instinctively to a certain face in the court once more he hesitated for many seconds which seemed like so many hours during which a mans honour a mans life hung perhaps in the balance  then peter tyrrell repeated slowly i wouldnt swear  but coroner and jury alike aye and every spectator in that crowded court had seen that the mans eyes had rested during that one moment of hesitation upon the face of the earl of brockelsby     chapter xxxiii  the living and the dead   the man in the corner blinked across at polly with his funny mild blue eyes  no wonder you are puzzled he continued so was everybody in the court that day every one save myself i alone could see in my minds eye that gruesome murder such as it had been committed with all its details and above all its motive and such as you will see it presently when i place it all clearly before you  but before you see daylight in this strange case i must plunge you into further darkness in the same manner as the coroner and jury were plunged on the following day the second day of that remarkable inquest it had to be adjourned since the appearance of mr timothy beddingfield had now become of vital importance the public had come to regard his absence from birmingham at this critical moment as decidedly remarkable to say the least of it and all those who did not know the lawyer by sight wished to see him in his inverness cape and glengarry cap such as he had appeared before the several witnesses on the night of the awful murder  when the coroner and jury were seated the first piece of information which the police placed before them was the astounding statement that mr timothy beddingfields whereabouts had not been ascertained though it was confidently expected that he had not gone far and could easily be traced there was a witness present who the police thought might throw some light as to the lawyers probable destination for obviously he had left birmingham directly after his interview with the deceased  this witness was mrs higgins who was mr beddingfields housekeeper she stated that her master was in the constant habitespecially latterlyof going up to london on business he usually left by a late evening train on those occasions and mostly was only absent thirtysix hours he kept a portmanteau always ready packed for the purpose for he often left at a few moments notice mrs higgins added that her master stayed at the great western hotel in london for it was there that she was instructed to wire if anything urgent required his presence back in birmingham  on the night of the 14th she continued at nine oclock or thereabouts a messenger came to the door with the masters card and said that he was instructed to fetch mr beddingfields portmanteau and then to meet him at the station in time to catch the 935 pm up train i gave him the portmanteau of course as he had brought the card and i had no idea there could be anything wrong but since then i have heard nothing of my master and i dont know when he will return  questioned by the coroner she added that mr beddingfield had never stayed away quite so long without having his letters forwarded to him there was a large pile waiting for him now she had written to the great western hotel london asking what she should do about the letters but had received no reply she did not know the messenger by sight who had called for the portmanteau once or twice before mr beddingfield had sent for his things in that manner when he had been dining out  mr beddingfield certainly wore his inverness cape over his dress clothes when he went out at about six oclock in the afternoon he also wore a glengarry cap  the messenger had so far not yet been found and from this pointnamely the sending for the portmanteauall traces of mr timothy beddingfield seem to have been lost whether he went up to london by that 935 train or not could not be definitely ascertained the police had questioned at least a dozen porters at the railway as well as ticket collectors but no one had any special recollection of a gentleman in an inverness cape and glengarry cap a costume worn by more than one firstclass passenger on a cold night in september  there was the hitch you see it all lay in this mr timothy beddingfield the lawyer had undoubtedly made himself scarce he was last seen in company with the deceased and wearing an inverness cape and glengarry cap two or three witnesses saw him leaving the hotel at about 915 then the messenger calls at the lawyers house for the portmanteau after which mr timothy beddingfield seems to vanish into thin air butand that is a great butthe night porter at the castle seems to have seen some one wearing the momentous inverness and glengarry half an hour or so later on and going up to deceaseds room where he stayed about a quarter of an hour  undoubtedly you will say as every one said to themselves that day after the night porter and mrs higgins had been heard that there was a very ugly and very black finger which pointed unpleasantly at mr timothy beddingfield especially as that gentleman for some reason which still required an explanation was not there to put matters right for himself but there was just one little thinga mere trifle perhapswhich neither the coroner nor the jury dared to overlook though strictly speaking it was not evidence  you will remember that when the night porter was asked if he could among the persons present in court recognize the hon robert de gennevilles belated visitor every one had noticed his hesitation and marked that the mans eyes had rested doubtingly upon the face and figure of the young earl of brockelsby  now if that belated visitor had been mr timothy beddingfieldtall lean dry as dust with a birdlike beak and cleanshaven chinno one could for a moment have mistaken his faceeven if they only saw it very casually and recollected it but very dimlywith that of young lord brockelsby who was florid and rather shortthe only point in common between them was their saxon hair  you see that it was a curious point dont you added the man in the corner who now had become so excited that his fingers worked like long thin tentacles round and round his bit of string it weighed very heavily in favour of timothy beddingfield added to which you must also remember that as far as he was concerned the hon robert de genneville was to him the goose with the golden eggs  the de genneville peerage case had brought beddingfields name in great prominence with the death of the claimant all hopes of prolonging the litigation came to an end there was a total lack of motive as far as beddingfield was concerned  not so with the earl of brockelsby said polly and ive often maintained  what he interrupted that the earl of brockelsby changed clothes with beddingfield in order more conveniently to murder his own brother where and when could the exchange of costume have been effected considering that the inverness cape and glengarry cap were in the hall of the castle hotel at 915 and at that hour and until ten oclock lord brockelsby was at the grand hotel finishing dinner with some friends that was subsequently proved remember and also that he was back at brockelsby castle which is seven miles from birmingham at eleven oclock sharp now the visit of the individual in the glengarry occurred some time after 10 pm  then there was the disappearance of beddingfield said the girl musingly that certainly points very strongly to him he was a man in good practice i believe and fairly well known  and has never been heard of from that day to this concluded the old scarecrow with a chuckle no wonder you are puzzled the police were quite baffled and still are for a matter of that and yet see how simple it is only the police would not look further than these two menlord brockelsby with a strong motive and the night porters hesitation against him and beddingfield without a motive but with strong circumstantial evidence and his own disappearance as condemnatory signs  if only they would look at the case as i did and think a little about the dead as well as about the living if they had remembered that peerage case the hon roberts debts his last straw which proved a futile claim  only that very day the earl of brockelsby had by quietly showing the original ancient document to his brother persuaded him how futile were all his hopes who knows how many were the debts contracted the promises made the money borrowed and obtained on the strength of that claim which was mere romance ahead nothing but ruin enmity with his brother his marriage probably broken off a wasted life in fact  is it small wonder that though illfeeling against the earl of brockelsby may have been deep there was hatred bitter deadly hatred against the man who with false promises had led him into so hopeless a quagmire probably the hon robert owed a great deal of money to beddingfield which the latter hoped to recoup at usurious interest with threats of scandal and what not  think of all that he added and then tell me if you believe that a stronger motive for the murder of such an enemy could well be found  but what you suggest is impossible said polly aghast  allow me he said it is more than possibleit is very easy and simple the two men were alone together in the hon robert de gennevilles room after dinner you as representing the public and the police say that beddingfield went away and returned half an hour later in order to kill his client i say that it was the lawyer who was murdered at nine oclock that evening and that robert de genneville the ruined man the hopeless bankrupt was the assassin  then  yes of course now you remember for i have put you on the track the face and the body were so battered and bruised that they were past recognition both men were of equal height the hair which alone could not be disfigured or obliterated was in both men similar in colour  then the murderer proceeds to dress his victim in his own clothes with the utmost care he places his own rings on the fingers of the dead man his own watch in the pocket a gruesome task but an important one and it is thoroughly well done then he himself puts on the clothes of his victim with finally the inverness cape and glengarry and when the hall is full of visitors he slips out unperceived he sends the messenger for beddingfields portmanteau and starts off by the night express  but then his visit at the castle hotel at ten oclock she urged how dangerous  dangerous yes but oh how clever you see he was the earl of brockelsbys twin brother and twin brothers are always somewhat alike he wished to appear dead murdered by some one he cared not whom but what he did care about was to throw clouds of dust in the eyes of the police and he succeeded with a vengeance perhapswho knowshe wished to assure himself that he had forgotten nothing in the mise en scène that the body battered and bruised past all semblance of any human shape save for its clothes really would appear to every one as that of the hon robert de genneville while the latter disappeared for ever from the old world and started life again in the new  then you must always reckon with the practically invariable rule that a murderer always revisits if only once the scene of his crime  two years have elapsed since the crime no trace of timothy beddingfield the lawyer has ever been found and i can assure you that it will never be for his plebeian body lies buried in the aristocratic family vault of the earl of brockelsby  he was gone before polly could say another word the faces of timothy beddingfield of the earl of brockelsby of the hon robert de genneville seemed to dance before her eyes and to mock her for the hopeless bewilderment in which she found herself plunged because of them then all the faces vanished or rather were merged in one long thin birdlike one with bonerimmed spectacles on the top of its beak and a wide rude grin beneath it and still puzzled still doubtful the young girl too paid for her scanty luncheon and went her way     chapter xxxiv  the mysterious death in percy street   miss polly burton had had many an argument with mr richard frobisher about that old man in the corner who seemed far more interesting and deucedly more mysterious than any of the crimes over which he philosophised  dick thought moreover that miss polly spent more of her leisure time now in that abc shop than she had done in his own company before and told her so with that delightful air of sheepish sulkiness which the male creature invariably wears when he feels jealous and wont admit it  polly liked dick to be jealous but she liked that old scarecrow in the abc shop very much too and though she made sundry vague promises from time to time to mr richard frobisher she nevertheless drifted back instinctively day after day to the teashop in norfolk street strand and stayed there sipping coffee for as long as the man in the corner chose to talk  on this particular afternoon she went to the abc shop with a fixed purpose that of making him give her his views of mrs owens mysterious death in percy street  the facts had interested and puzzled her she had had countless arguments with mr richard frobisher as to the three great possible solutions of the puzzleaccident suicide murder  undoubtedly neither accident nor suicide he said dryly  polly was not aware that she had spoken what an uncanny habit that creature had of reading her thoughts  you incline to the idea then that mrs owen was murdered do you know by whom  he laughed and drew forth the piece of string he always fidgeted with when unravelling some mystery  you would like to know who murdered that old woman he asked at last  i would like to hear your views on the subject polly replied  i have no views he said dryly no one can know who murdered the woman since no one ever saw the person who did it no one can give the faintest description of the mysterious man who alone could have committed that clever deed and the police are playing a game of blind mans buff  but you must have formed some theory of your own she persisted  it annoyed her that the funny creature was obstinate about this point and she tried to nettle his vanity  i suppose that as a matter of fact your original remark that there are no such things as mysteries does not apply universally there is a mysterythat of the death in percy street and you like the police are unable to fathom it  he pulled up his eyebrows and looked at her for a minute or two  confess that that murder was one of the cleverest bits of work accomplished outside russian diplomacy he said with a nervous laugh i must say that were i the judge called upon to pronounce sentence of death on the man who conceived that murder i could not bring myself to do it i would politely request the gentleman to enter our foreign officewe have need of such men the whole mise en scène was truly artistic worthy of its milieuthe rubens studios in percy street tottenham court road  have you ever noticed them they are only studios by name and are merely a set of rooms in a corner house with the windows slightly enlarged and the rents charged accordingly in consideration of that additional five inches of smoky daylight filtering through dusty windows on the ground floor there is the order office of some stained glass works with a workshop in the rear and on the first floor landing a small room allotted to the caretaker with gas coal and fifteen shillings a week for which princely income she is deputed to keep tidy and clean the general aspect of the house  mrs owen who was the caretaker there was a quiet respectable woman who eked out her scanty wages by sundrymostly very meagretips doled out to her by impecunious artists in exchange for promiscuous domestic services in and about the respective studios  but if mrs owens earnings were not large they were very regular and she had no fastidious tastes she and her cockatoo lived on her wages and all the tips added up and never spent year after year went to swell a very comfortable little account at interest in the birkbeck bank this little account had mounted up to a very tidy sum and the thrifty widowor old maidno one ever knew which she waswas generally referred to by the young artists of the rubens studios as a lady of means but this is a digression  no one slept on the premises except mrs owen and her cockatoo the rule was that one by one as the tenants left their rooms in the evening they took their respective keys to the caretakers room she would then in the early morning tidy and dust the studios and the office downstairs lay the fire and carry up coals  the foreman of the glass works was the first to arrive in the morning he had a latchkey and let himself in after which it was the custom of the house that he should leave the street door open for the benefit of the other tenants and their visitors  usually when he came at about nine oclock he found mrs owen busy about the house doing her work and he had often a brief chat with her about the weather but on this particular morning of february 2nd he neither saw nor heard her however as the shop had been tidied and the fire laid he surmised that mrs owen had finished her work earlier than usual and thought no more about it one by one the tenants of the studios turned up and the day sped on without any ones attention being drawn noticeably to the fact that the caretaker had not appeared upon the scene  it had been a bitterly cold night and the day was even worse a cutting northeasterly gale was blowing there had been a great deal of snow during the night which lay quite thick on the ground and at five oclock in the afternoon when the last glimmer of the pale winter daylight had disappeared the confraternity of the brush put palette and easel aside and prepared to go home the first to leave was mr charles pitt he locked up his studio and as usual took his key into the caretakers room  he had just opened the door when an icy blast literally struck him in the face both the windows were wide open and the snow and sleet were beating thickly into the room forming already a white carpet upon the floor  the room was in semiobscurity and at first mr pitt saw nothing but instinctively realizing that something was wrong he lit a match and saw before him the spectacle of that awful and mysterious tragedy which has ever since puzzled both police and public on the floor already half covered by the drifting snow lay the body of mrs owen face downwards in a nightgown with feet and ankles bare and these and her hands were of a deep purple colour whilst in a corner of the room huddled up with the cold the body of the cockatoo lay stark and stiff     chapter xxxv  suicide or murder   at first there was only talk of a terrible accident the result of some inexplicable carelessness which perhaps the evidence at the inquest would help to elucidate  medical assistance came too late the unfortunate woman was indeed dead frozen to death inside her own room further examination showed that she had received a severe blow at the back of the head which must have stunned her and caused her to fall helpless beside the open window temperature at five degrees below zero had done the rest detective inspector howell discovered close to the window a wroughtiron gas bracket the height of which corresponded exactly with the bruise at the back of mrs owens head  hardly however had a couple of days elapsed when public curiosity was whetted by a few startling headlines such as the halfpenny evening papers alone know how to concoct  the mysterious death in percy street is it suicide or murder thrilling detailsstrange developments sensational arrest  what had happened was simply this  at the inquest a few certainly very curious facts connected with mrs owens life had come to light and this had led to the apprehension of a young man of very respectable parentage on a charge of being concerned in the tragic death of the unfortunate caretaker  to begin with it happened that her life which in an ordinary way should have been very monotonous and regular seemed at any rate latterly to have been more than usually chequered and excited every witness who had known her in the past concurred in the statement that since october last a great change had come over the worthy and honest woman  i happen to have a photo of mrs owen as she was before this great change occurred in her quiet and uneventful life and which led as far as the poor soul was concerned to such disastrous results  here she is to the life added the funny creature placing the photo before pollyas respectable as stodgy as uninteresting as it is well possible for a member of your charming sex to be not a face you will admit to lead any youngster to temptation or to induce him to commit a crime  nevertheless one day all the tenants of the rubens studios were surprised and shocked to see mrs owen quiet respectable mrs owen sallying forth at six oclock in the afternoon attired in an extravagant bonnet and a cloak trimmed with imitation astrakhan whichslightly open in frontdisplayed a gold locket and chain of astonishing proportions  many were the comments the hints the bits of sarcasm levelled at the worthy woman by the frivolous confraternity of the brush  the plot thickened when from that day forth a complete change came over the worthy caretaker of the rubens studios while she appeared day after day before the astonished gaze of the tenants and the scandalized looks of the neighbours attired in new and extravagant dresses her work was hopelessly neglected and she was always out when wanted  there was of course much talk and comment in various parts of the rubens studios on the subject of mrs owens dissipations the tenants began to put two and two together and after a very little while the general consensus of opinion became firmly established that the honest caretakers demoralisation coincided week for week almost day for day with young greenhills establishment in no 8 studio  every one had remarked that he stayed much later in the evening than any one else and yet no one presumed that he stayed for purposes of work suspicions soon rose to certainty when mrs owen and arthur greenhill were seen by one of the glass workmen dining together at gambias restaurant in tottenham court road  the workman who was having a cup of tea at the counter noticed particularly that when the bill was paid the money came out of mrs owens purse the dinner had been sumptuousveal cutlets a cut from the joint dessert coffee and liqueurs finally the pair left the restaurant apparently very gay young greenhill smoking a choice cigar  irregularities such as these were bound sooner or later to come to the ears and eyes of mr allman the landlord of the rubens studios and a month after the new year without further warning he gave her a weeks notice to quit his house  mrs owen did not seem the least bit upset when i gave her notice mr allman declared in his evidence at the inquest on the contrary she told me that she had ample means and had only worked latterly for the sake of something to do she added that she had plenty of friends who would look after her for she had a nice little pile to leave to any one who would know how to get the right side of her  nevertheless in spite of this cheerful interview miss bedford the tenant of no 6 studio had stated that when she took her key to the caretakers room at 630 that afternoon she found mrs owen in tears the caretaker refused to be comforted nor would she speak of her trouble to miss bedford  twentyfour hours later she was found dead  the coroners jury returned an open verdict and detectiveinspector jones was charged by the police to make some inquiries about young mr greenhill whose intimacy with the unfortunate woman had been universally commented upon  the detective however pushed his investigations as far as the birkbeck bank there he discovered that after her interview with mr allman mrs owen had withdrawn what money she had on deposit some £800 the result of twentyfive years saving and thrift  but the immediate result of detectiveinspector joness labours was that mr arthur greenhill lithographer was brought before the magistrate at bow street on the charge of being concerned in the death of mrs owen caretaker of the rubens studios percy street  now that magisterial inquiry is one of the few interesting ones which i had the misfortune to miss continued the man in the corner with a nervous shake of the shoulders but you know as well as i do how the attitude of the young prisoner impressed the magistrate and police so unfavourably that with every new witness brought forward his position became more and more unfortunate  yet he was a goodlooking rather coarsely built young fellow with one of those awful cockney accents which literally make one jump but he looked painfully nervous stammered at every word spoken and repeatedly gave answers entirely at random  his father acted as lawyer for him a roughlooking elderly man who had the appearance of a common country attorney rather than of a london solicitor  the police had built up a fairly strong case against the lithographer medical evidence revealed nothing new mrs owen had died from exposure the blow at the back of the head not being sufficiently serious to cause anything but temporary disablement when the medical officer had been called in death had intervened for some time it was quite impossible to say how long whether one hour or five or twelve  the appearance and state of the room when the unfortunate woman was found by mr charles pitt were again gone over in minute detail mrs owens clothes which she had worn during the day were folded neatly on a chair the key of her cupboard was in the pocket of her dress the door had been slightly ajar but both the windows were wide open one of them which had the sashline broken had been fastened up most scientifically with a piece of rope  mrs owen had obviously undressed preparatory to going to bed and the magistrate very naturally soon made the remark how untenable the theory of an accident must be no one in their five senses would undress with a temperature at below zero and the windows wide open  after these preliminary statements the cashier of the birkbeck was called and he related the caretakers visit at the bank  it was then about one oclock he stated mrs owen called and presented a cheque to self for £827 the amount of her balance she seemed exceedingly happy and cheerful and talked about needing plenty of cash as she was going abroad to join her nephew for whom she would in future keep house i warned her about being sufficiently careful with so large a sum and parting from it injudiciously as women of her class are very apt to do she laughingly declared that not only was she careful of it in the present but meant to be so for the faroff future for she intended to go that very day to a lawyers office and to make a will  the cashiers evidence was certainly startling in the extreme since in the widows room no trace of any kind was found of any money against that two of the notes handed over by the bank to mrs owen on that day were cashed by young greenhill on the very morning of her mysterious death one was handed in by him to the west end clothiers company in payment for a suit of clothes and the other he changed at the post office in oxford street  after that all the evidence had of necessity to be gone through again on the subject of young greenhills intimacy with mrs owen he listened to it all with an air of the most painful nervousness his cheeks were positively green his lips seemed dry and parched for he repeatedly passed his tongue over them and when constable e 18 deposed that at 2 am on the morning of february 2nd he had seen the accused and spoken to him at the corner of percy street and tottenham court road young greenhill all but fainted  the contention of the police was that the caretaker had been murdered and robbed during that night before she went to bed that young greenhill had done the murder seeing that he was the only person known to have been intimate with the woman and that it was moreover proved unquestionably that he was in the immediate neighbourhood of the rubens studios at an extraordinarily late hour of the night  his own account of himself and of that same night could certainly not be called very satisfactory mrs owen was a relative of his late mothers he declared he himself was a lithographer by trade with a good deal of time and leisure on his hands he certainly had employed some of that time in taking the old woman to various places of amusement he had on more than one occasion suggested that she should give up menial work and come and live with him but unfortunately she was a great deal imposed upon by her nephew a man of the name of owen who exploited the goodnatured woman in every possible way and who had on more than one occasion made severe attacks upon her savings at the birkbeck bank  severely crossexamined by the prosecuting counsel about this supposed relative of mrs owen greenhill admitted that he did not know himhad in fact never seen him he knew that his name was owen and that was all his chief occupation consisted in sponging on the kindhearted old woman but he only went to see her in the evenings when he presumably knew that she would be alone and invariably after all the tenants of the rubens studios had left for the day  i dont know whether at this point it strikes you at all as it did both magistrate and counsel that there was a direct contradiction in this statement and the one made by the cashier of the birkbeck on the subject of his last conversation with mrs owen i am going abroad to join my nephew for whom i am going to keep house was what the unfortunate woman had said  now greenhill in spite of his nervousness and at times contradictory answers strictly adhered to his point that there was a nephew in london who came frequently to see his aunt  anyway the sayings of the murdered woman could not be taken as evidence in law mr greenhill senior put the objection adding there may have been two nephews which the magistrate and the prosecution were bound to admit  with regard to the night immediately preceding mrs owens death greenhill stated that he had been with her to the theatre had seen her home and had had some supper with her in her room before he left her at 2 am she had of her own accord made him a present of £10 saying i am a sort of aunt to you arthur and if you dont have it bill is sure to get it  she had seemed rather worried in the early part of the evening but later on she cheered up  did she speak at all about this nephew of hers or about her money affairs asked the magistrate  again the young man hesitated but said no she did not mention either owen or her money affairs  if i remember rightly added the man in the corner for recollect i was not present the case was here adjourned but the magistrate would not grant bail greenhill was removed looking more dead than alivethough every one remarked that mr greenhill senior looked determined and not the least worried in the course of his examination on behalf of his son of the medical officer and one or two other witnesses he had very ably tried to confuse them on the subject of the hour at which mrs owen was last known to be alive  he made a very great point of the fact that the usual mornings work was done throughout the house when the inmates arrived was it conceivable he argued that a woman would do that kind of work overnight especially as she was going to the theatre and therefore would wish to dress in her smarter clothes it certainly was a very nice point levelled against the prosecution who promptly retorted just as conceivable as that a woman in those circumstances of life should having done her work undress beside an open window at nine oclock in the morning with the snow beating into the room  now it seems that mr greenhill senior could produce any amount of witnesses who could help to prove a conclusive alibi on behalf of his son if only some time subsequent to that fatal 2 am the murdered woman had been seen alive by some chance passerby  however he was an able man and an earnest one and i fancy the magistrate felt some sympathy for his strenuous endeavours on his sons behalf he granted a weeks adjournment which seemed to satisfy mr greenhill completely  in the meanwhile the papers had talked of and almost exhausted the subject of the mystery in percy street there had been as you no doubt know from personal experience innumerable arguments on the puzzling alternatives  accident  suicide  murder  a week went by and then the case against young greenhill was resumed of course the court was crowded it needed no great penetration to remark at once that the prisoner looked more hopeful and his father quite elated  again a great deal of minor evidence was taken and then came the turn of the defence mr greenhill called mrs hall confectioner of percy street opposite the rubens studios she deposed that at 8 oclock in the morning of february 2nd while she was tidying her shop window she saw the caretaker of the studios opposite as usual on her knees her head and body wrapped in a shawl cleaning her front steps her husband also saw mrs owen and mrs hall remarked to her husband how thankful she was that her own shop had tiled steps which did not need scrubbing on so cold a morning  mr hall confectioner of the same address corroborated this statement and mr greenhill with absolute triumph produced a third witness mrs martin of percy street who from her window on the second floor had at 730 am seen the caretaker shaking mats outside her front door the description this witness gave of mrs owens getup with the shawl round her head coincided point by point with that given by mr and mrs hall  after that mr greenhills task became an easy one his son was at home having his breakfast at 8 oclock that morningnot only himself but his servants would testify to that  the weather had been so bitter that the whole of that day arthur had not stirred from his own fireside mrs owen was murdered after 8 am on that day since she was seen alive by three people at that hour therefore his son could not have murdered mrs owen the police must find the criminal elsewhere or else bow to the opinion originally expressed by the public that mrs owen had met with a terrible untoward accident or that perhaps she may have wilfully sought her own death in that extraordinary and tragic fashion  before young greenhill was finally discharged one or two witnesses were again examined chief among these being the foreman of the glassworks he had turned up at the rubens studios at 9 oclock and been in business all day he averred positively that he did not specially notice any suspiciouslooking individual crossing the hall that day but he remarked with a smile i dont sit and watch every one who goes up and downstairs i am too busy for that the street door is always left open any one can walk in up or down who knows the way  that there was a mystery in connection with mrs owens deathof that the police have remained perfectly convinced whether young greenhill held the key of that mystery or not they have never found out to this day  i could enlighten them as to the cause of the young lithographers anxiety at the magisterial inquiry but i assure you i do not care to do the work of the police for them why should i greenhill will never suffer from unjust suspicions he and his father alonebesides myselfknow in what a terribly tight corner he all but found himself  the young man did not reach home till nearly five oclock that morning his last train had gone he had to walk lost his way and wandered about hampstead for hours think what his position would have been if the worthy confectioners of percy street had not seen mrs owen wrapped up in a shawl on her knees doing the front steps  moreover mr greenhill senior is a solicitor who has a small office in john street bedford row the afternoon before her death mrs owen had been to that office and had there made a will by which she left all her savings to young arthur greenhill lithographer had that will been in other than paternal hands it would have been proved in the natural course of such things and one other link would have been added to the chain which nearly dragged arthur greenhill to the gallowsthe link of a very strong motive  can you wonder that the young man turned livid until such time as it was proved beyond a doubt that the murdered woman was alive hours after he had reached the safe shelter of his home  i saw you smile when i used the word murdered continued the man in the corner growing quite excited now that he was approaching the dénouement of his story i know that the public after the magistrate had discharged arthur greenhill were quite satisfied to think that the mystery in percy street was a case of accidentor suicide  no replied polly there could be no question of suicide for two very distinct reasons  he looked at her with some degree of astonishment she supposed that he was amazed at her venturing to form an opinion of her own  and may i ask what in your opinion these reasons are he asked very sarcastically  to begin with the question of money she saidhas any more of it been traced so far  not another £5 note he said with a chuckle they were all cashed in paris during the exhibition and you have no conception how easy a thing that is to do at any of the hotels or smaller agents de change  that nephew was a clever blackguard she commented  you believe then in the existence of that nephew  why should i doubt it some one must have existed who was sufficiently familiar with the house to go about in it in the middle of the day without attracting any ones attention  in the middle of the day he said with a chuckle  any time after 830 in the morning  so you too believe in the caretaker wrapped up in a shawl cleaning her front steps he queried  but  it never struck you in spite of the training your intercourse with me must have given you that the person who carefully did all the work in the rubens studios laid the fires and carried up the coals merely did it in order to gain time in order that the bitter frost might really and effectually do its work and mrs owen be not missed until she was truly dead  but suggested polly again  it never struck you that one of the greatest secrets of successful crime is to lead the police astray with regard to the time when the crime was committed that was if you remember the great point in the regents park murder  in this case the nephew since we admit his existence wouldeven if he were ever found which is doubtfulbe able to prove as good an alibi as young greenhill  but i dont understand  how the murder was committed he said eagerly surely you can see it all for yourself since you admit the nephewa scamp perhapswho sponges on the goodnatured woman he terrorises and threatens her so much so that she fancies her money is no longer safe even in the birkbeck bank women of that class are apt at times to mistrust the bank of england anyway she withdraws her money who knows what she meant to do with it in the immediate future  in any case she wishes to secure it after her death to a young man whom she likes and who has known how to win her good graces that afternoon the nephew begs entreats for more money they have a row the poor woman is in tears and is only temporarily consoled by a pleasant visit at the theatre  at 2 oclock in the morning young greenhill parts from her two minutes later the nephew knocks at the door he comes with a plausible tale of having missed his last train and asks for a shake down somewhere in the house the goodnatured woman suggests a sofa in one of the studios and then quietly prepares to go to bed the rest is very simple and elementary the nephew sneaks into his aunts room finds her standing in her nightgown he demands money with threats of violence terrified she staggers knocks her head against the gas bracket and falls on the floor stunned while the nephew seeks for her keys and takes possession of the £800 you will admit that the subsequent mise en scèneis worthy of a genius  no struggle not the usual hideous accessories round a crime only the open windows the bitter northeasterly gale and the heavily falling snowtwo silent accomplices as silent as the dead  after that the murderer with perfect presence of mind busies himself in the house doing the work which will ensure that mrs owen shall not be missed at any rate for some time he dusts and tidies some few hours later he even slips on his aunts skirt and bodice wraps his head in a shawl and boldly allows those neighbours who are astir to see what they believe to be mrs owen then he goes back to her room resumes his normal appearance and quietly leaves the house  he may have been seen  he undoubtedly was seen by two or three people but no one thought anything of seeing a man leave the house at that hour it was very cold the snow was falling thickly and as he wore a muffler round the lower part of his face those who saw him would not undertake to know him again  that man was never seen nor heard of again polly asked  he has disappeared off the face of the earth the police are searching for him and perhaps some day they will find himthen society will be rid of one of the most ingenious men of the age     chapter xxxvi  the end   he had paused absorbed in meditation the young girl also was silent some memory too vague as yet to take a definite form was persistently haunting herone thought was hammering away in her brain and playing havoc with her nerves that thought was the inexplicable feeling within her that there was something in connection with that hideous crime which she ought to recollect something whichif she could only remember what it waswould give her the clue to the tragic mystery and for once ensure her triumph over this selfconceited and sarcastic scarecrow in the corner  he was watching her through his great bonerimmed spectacles and she could see the knuckles of his bony hands just above the top of the table fidgeting fidgeting fidgeting till she wondered if there existed another set of fingers in the world which could undo the knots his lean ones made in that tiresome piece of string  then suddenlyà propos of nothing polly rememberedthe whole thing stood before her short and clear like a vivid flash of lightningmrs owen lying dead in the snow beside her open window one of them with a broken sashline tied up most scientifically with a piece of string she remembered the talk there had been at the time about this improvised sashline  that was after young greenhill had been discharged and the question of suicide had been voted an impossibility  polly remembered that in the illustrated papers photographs appeared of this wonderfully knotted piece of string so contrived that the weight of the frame could but tighten the knots and thus keep the window open she remembered that people deduced many things from that improvised sashline chief among these deductions being that the murderer was a sailorso wonderful so complicated so numerous were the knots which secured that windowframe  but polly knew better in her minds eye she saw those fingers rendered doubly nervous by the fearful cerebral excitement grasping at first mechanically even thoughtlessly a bit of twine with which to secure the window then the ruling habit strongest through all the girl could see it the lean and ingenious fingers fidgeting fidgeting with that piece of string tying knot after knot more wonderful more complicated than any she had yet witnessed  if i were you she said without daring to look into that corner where he sat i would break myself of the habit of perpetually making knots in a piece of string  he did not reply and at last polly ventured to look upthe corner was empty and through the glass door beyond the desk where he had just deposited his few coppers she saw the tails of his tweed coat his extraordinary hat his meagre shrivelledup personality fast disappearing down the street  miss polly burton of the evening observer was married the other day to mr richard frobisher of the london mail she has never set eyes on the man in the corner from that day to this   finis
