santa claus     youth    1  burzee  have you heard of the great forest of burzee  nurse used to sing of it when i was a child  she sang of the big treetrunks standing close together with their roots intertwining below the earth and their branches intertwining above it of their rough coating of bark and queer gnarled limbs of the bushy foliage that roofed the entire forest save where the sunbeams found a path through which to touch the ground in little spots and to cast weird and curious shadows over the mosses the lichens and the drifts of dried leaves  the forest of burzee is mighty and grand and awesome to those who steal beneath its shade  coming from the sunlit meadows into its mazes it seems at first gloomy then pleasant and afterward filled with neverending delights  for hundreds of years it has flourished in all its magnificence the silence of its inclosure unbroken save by the chirp of busy chipmunks the growl of wild beasts and the songs of birds  yet burzee has its inhabitantsfor all this  nature peopled it in the beginning with fairies knooks ryls and nymphs  as long as the forest stands it will be a home a refuge and a playground to these sweet immortals who revel undisturbed in its depths  civilization has never yet reached burzee  will it ever i wonder    2  the child of the forest  once so long ago our greatgrandfathers could scarcely have heard it mentioned there lived within the great forest of burzee a woodnymph named necile  she was closely related to the mighty queen zurline and her home was beneath the shade of a widespreading oak  once every year on budding day when the trees put forth their new buds necile held the golden chalice of ak to the lips of the queen who drank therefrom to the prosperity of the forest  so you see she was a nymph of some importance and moreover it is said she was highly regarded because of her beauty and grace  when she was created she could not have told queen zurline could not have told the great ak himself could not have told  it was long ago when the world was new and nymphs were needed to guard the forests and to minister to the wants of the young trees  then on some day not remembered necile sprang into being radiant lovely straight and slim as the sapling she was created to guard  her hair was the color that lines a chestnutbur her eyes were blue in the sunlight and purple in the shade her cheeks bloomed with the faint pink that edges the clouds at sunset her lips were full red pouting and sweet  for costume she adopted oakleaf green all the woodnymphs dress in that color and know no other so desirable  her dainty feet were sandalclad while her head remained bare of covering other than her silken tresses  neciles duties were few and simple  she kept hurtful weeds from growing beneath her trees and sapping the earthfood required by her charges  she frightened away the gadgols who took evil delight in flying against the treetrunks and wounding them so that they drooped and died from the poisonous contact  in dry seasons she carried water from the brooks and pools and moistened the roots of her thirsty dependents  that was in the beginning  the weeds had now learned to avoid the forests where woodnymphs dwelt the loathsome gadgols no longer dared come nigh the trees had become old and sturdy and could bear the drought better than when freshsprouted  so neciles duties were lessened and time grew laggard while succeeding years became more tiresome and uneventful than the nymphs joyous spirit loved  truly the forestdwellers did not lack amusement  each full moon they danced in the royal circle of the queen  there were also the feast of nuts the jubilee of autumn tintings the solemn ceremony of leaf shedding and the revelry of budding day  but these periods of enjoyment were far apart and left many weary hours between  that a woodnymph should grow discontented was not thought of by neciles sisters  it came upon her only after many years of brooding but when once she had settled in her mind that life was irksome she had no patience with her condition and longed to do something of real interest and to pass her days in ways hitherto undreamed of by forest nymphs  the law of the forest alone restrained her from going forth in search of adventure  while this mood lay heavy upon pretty necile it chanced that the great ak visited the forest of burzee and allowed the woodnymphs as was their wontto lie at his feet and listen to the words of wisdom that fell from his lips  ak is the master woodsman of the world he sees everything and knows more than the sons of men  that night he held the queens hand for he loved the nymphs as a father loves his children and necile lay at his feet with many of her sisters and earnestly harkened as he spoke  we live so happily my fair ones in our forest glades said ak stroking his grizzled beard thoughtfully that we know nothing of the sorrow and misery that fall to the lot of those poor mortals who inhabit the open spaces of the earth  they are not of our race it is true yet compassion well befits beings so fairly favored as ourselves often as i pass by the dwelling of some suffering mortal i am tempted to stop and banish the poor things misery  yet suffering in moderation is the natural lot of mortals and it is not our place to interfere with the laws of nature  nevertheless said the fair queen nodding her golden head at the master woodsman it would not be a vain guess that ak has often assisted these hapless mortals  ak smiled  sometimes he replied when they are very youngchildren the mortals call themi have stopped to rescue them from misery  the men and women i dare not interfere with they must bear the burdens nature has imposed upon them  but the helpless infants the innocent children of men have a right to be happy until they become fullgrown and able to bear the trials of humanity  so i feel i am justified in assisting them  not long agoa year maybei found four poor children huddled in a wooden hut slowly freezing to death  their parents had gone to a neighboring village for food and had left a fire to warm their little ones while they were absent  but a storm arose and drifted the snow in their path so they were long on the road  meantime the fire went out and the frost crept into the bones of the waiting children  poor things murmured the queen softly  what did you do  i called nelko bidding him fetch wood from my forests and breathe upon it until the fire blazed again and warmed the little room where the children lay  then they ceased shivering and fell asleep until their parents came  i am glad you did thus said the good queen beaming upon the master and necile who had eagerly listened to every word echoed in a whisper i too am glad  and this very night continued ak as i came to the edge of burzee i heard a feeble cry which i judged came from a human infant  i looked about me and found close to the forest a helpless babe lying quite naked upon the grasses and wailing piteously  not far away screened by the forest crouched shiegra the lioness intent upon devouring the infant for her evening meal  and what did you do ak asked the queen breathlessly  not much being in a hurry to greet my nymphs  but i commanded shiegra to lie close to the babe and to give it her milk to quiet its hunger  and i told her to send word throughout the forest to all beasts and reptiles that the child should not be harmed  i am glad you did thus said the good queen again in a tone of relief but this time necile did not echo her words for the nymph filled with a strange resolve had suddenly stolen away from the group  swiftly her lithe form darted through the forest paths until she reached the edge of mighty burzee when she paused to gaze curiously about her  never until now had she ventured so far for the law of the forest had placed the nymphs in its inmost depths  necile knew she was breaking the law but the thought did not give pause to her dainty feet  she had decided to see with her own eyes this infant ak had told of for she had never yet beheld a child of man  all the immortals are fullgrown there are no children among them  peering through the trees necile saw the child lying on the grass  but now it was sweetly sleeping having been comforted by the milk drawn from shiegra  it was not old enough to know what peril means if it did not feel hunger it was content  softly the nymph stole to the side of the babe and knelt upon the sward her long robe of rose leaf color spreading about her like a gossamer cloud  her lovely countenance expressed curiosity and surprise but most of all a tender womanly pity  the babe was newborn chubby and pink  it was entirely helpless  while the nymph gazed the infant opened its eyes smiled upon her and stretched out two dimpled arms  in another instant necile had caught it to her breast and was hurrying with it through the forest paths    3  the adoption  the master woodsman suddenly rose with knitted brows  there is a strange presence in the forest he declared  then the queen and her nymphs turned and saw standing before them necile with the sleeping infant clasped tightly in her arms and a defiant look in her deep blue eyes  and thus for a moment they remained the nymphs filled with surprise and consternation but the brow of the master woodsman gradually clearing as he gazed intently upon the beautiful immortal who had wilfully broken the law  then the great ak to the wonder of all laid his hand softly on neciles flowing locks and kissed her on her fair forehead  for the first time within my knowledge said he gently a nymph has defied me and my laws yet in my heart can i find no word of chiding what is your desire necile  let me keep the child she answered beginning to tremble and falling on her knees in supplication  here in the forest of burzee where the human race has never yet penetrated questioned ak  here in the forest of burzee replied the nymph boldly  it is my home and i am weary for lack of occupation  let me care for the babe see how weak and helpless it is  surely it can not harm burzee nor the master woodsman of the world  but the law child the law cried ak sternly  the law is made by the master woodsman returned necile if he bids me care for the babe he himself has saved from death who in all the world dare oppose me  queen zurline who had listened intently to this conversation clapped her pretty hands gleefully at the nymphs answer  you are fairly trapped o ak she exclaimed laughing  now i pray you give heed to neciles petition  the woodsman as was his habit when in thought stroked his grizzled beard slowly  then he said  she shall keep the babe and i will give it my protection  but i warn you all that as this is the first time i have relaxed the law so shall it be the last time  never more to the end of the world shall a mortal be adopted by an immortal  otherwise would we abandon our happy existence for one of trouble and anxiety  good night my nymphs  then ak was gone from their midst and necile hurried away to her bower to rejoice over her newfound treasure    4  claus  another day found neciles bower the most popular place in the forest the nymphs clustered around her and the child that lay asleep in her lap with expressions of curiosity and delight  nor were they wanting in praises for the great aks kindness in allowing necile to keep the babe and to care for it  even the queen came to peer into the innocent childish face and to hold a helpless chubby fist in her own fair hand  what shall we call him necile she asked smiling  he must have a name you know  let him be called claus answered necile for that means a little one  rather let him be called neclaus returned the queen for that will mean neciles little one  the nymphs clapped their hands in delight and neclaus became the infants name although necile loved best to call him claus and in afterdays many of her sisters followed her example  necile gathered the softest moss in all the forest for claus to lie upon and she made his bed in her own bower  of food the infant had no lack  the nymphs searched the forest for belludders which grow upon the goatree and when opened are found to be filled with sweet milk and the softeyed does willingly gave a share of their milk to support the little stranger while shiegra the lioness often crept stealthily into neciles bower and purred softly as she lay beside the babe and fed it  so the little one flourished and grew big and sturdy day by day while necile taught him to speak and to walk and to play  his thoughts and words were sweet and gentle for the nymphs knew no evil and their hearts were pure and loving  he became the pet of the forest for aks decree had forbidden beast or reptile to molest him and he walked fearlessly wherever his will guided him  presently the news reached the other immortals that the nymphs of burzee had adopted a human infant and that the act had been sanctioned by the great ak  therefore many of them came to visit the little stranger looking upon him with much interest  first the ryls who are first cousins to the woodnymphs although so differently formed  for the ryls are required to watch over the flowers and plants as the nymphs watch over the forest trees  they search the wide world for the food required by the roots of the flowering plants while the brilliant colors possessed by the fullblown flowers are due to the dyes placed in the soil by the ryls which are drawn through the little veins in the roots and the body of the plants as they reach maturity  the ryls are a busy people for their flowers bloom and fade continually but they are merry and lighthearted and are very popular with the other immortals  next came the knooks whose duty it is to watch over the beasts of the world both gentle and wild  the knooks have a hard time of it since many of the beasts are ungovernable and rebel against restraint  but they know how to manage them after all and you will find that certain laws of the knooks are obeyed by even the most ferocious animals their anxieties make the knooks look old and worn and crooked and their natures are a bit rough from associating with wild creatures continually yet they are most useful to humanity and to the world in general as their laws are the only laws the forest beasts recognize except those of the master woodsman  then there were the fairies the guardians of mankind who were much interested in the adoption of claus because their own laws forbade them to become familiar with their human charges  there are instances on record where the fairies have shown themselves to human beings and have even conversed with them but they are supposed to guard the lives of mankind unseen and unknown and if they favor some people more than others it is because these have won such distinction fairly as the fairies are very just and impartial  but the idea of adopting a child of men had never occurred to them because it was in every way opposed to their laws  so their curiosity was intense to behold the little stranger adopted by necile and her sister nymphs  claus looked upon the immortals who thronged around him with fearless eyes and smiling lips  he rode laughingly upon the shoulders of the merry ryls he mischievously pulled the gray beards of the lowbrowed knooks  he rested his curly head confidently upon the dainty bosom of the fairy queen herself  and the ryls loved the sound of his laughter the knooks loved his courage the fairies loved his innocence  the boy made friends of them all and learned to know their laws intimately  no forest flower was trampled beneath his feet lest the friendly ryls should be grieved  he never interfered with the beasts of the forest lest his friends the knooks should become angry  the fairies he loved dearly but knowing nothing of mankind he could not understand that he was the only one of his race admitted to friendly intercourse with them  indeed claus came to consider that he alone of all the forest people had no like nor fellow  to him the forest was the world  he had no idea that millions of toiling striving human creatures existed  and he was happy and content    some people have spelled this name nicklaus and others nicolas    which is the reason that santa claus is still known in some lands    as st nicolas  but of course neclaus is his right name and    claus the nickname given him by his adopted mother the fair nymph    necile    5  the master woodsman  years pass swiftly in burzee for the nymphs have no need to regard time in any way  even centuries make no change in the dainty creatures ever and ever they remain the same immortal and unchanging  claus however being mortal grew to manhood day by day  necile was disturbed presently to find him too big to lie in her lap and he had a desire for other food than milk  his stout legs carried him far into burzees heart where he gathered supplies of nuts and berries as well as several sweet and wholesome roots which suited his stomach better than the belludders  he sought neciles bower less frequently till finally it became his custom to return thither only to sleep  the nymph who had come to love him dearly was puzzled to comprehend the changed nature of her charge and unconsciously altered her own mode of life to conform to his whims  she followed him readily through the forest paths as did many of her sister nymphs explaining as they walked all the mysteries of the gigantic wood and the habits and nature of the living things which dwelt beneath its shade  the language of the beasts became clear to little claus but he never could understand their sulky and morose tempers  only the squirrels the mice and the rabbits seemed to possess cheerful and merry natures yet would the boy laugh when the panther growled and stroke the bears glossy coat while the creature snarled and bared its teeth menacingly the growls and snarls were not for claus he well knew so what did they matter  he could sing the songs of the bees recite the poetry of the woodflowers and relate the history of every blinking owl in burzee he helped the ryls to feed their plants and the knooks to keep order among the animals  the little immortals regarded him as a privileged person being especially protected by queen zurline and her nymphs and favored by the great ak himself  one day the master woodsman came back to the forest of burzee  he had visited in turn all his forests throughout the world and they were many and broad  not until he entered the glade where the queen and her nymphs were assembled to greet him did ak remember the child he had permitted necile to adopt  then he found sitting familiarly in the circle of lovely immortals a broadshouldered stalwart youth who when erect stood fully as high as the shoulder of the master himself  ak paused silent and frowning to bend his piercing gaze upon claus the clear eyes met his own steadfastly and the woodsman gave a sigh of relief as he marked their placid depths and read the youths brave and innocent heart  nevertheless as ak sat beside the fair queen and the golden chalice filled with rare nectar passed from lip to lip the master woodsman was strangely silent and reserved and stroked his beard many times with a thoughtful motion  with morning he called claus aside in kindly fashion saying  bid good by for a time to necile and her sisters for you shall accompany me on my journey through the world  the venture pleased claus who knew well the honor of being companion of the master woodsman of the world  but necile wept for the first time in her life and clung to the boys neck as if she could not bear to let him go  the nymph who had mothered this sturdy youth was still as dainty as charming and beautiful as when she had dared to face ak with the babe clasped to her breast nor was her love less great  ak beheld the two clinging together seemingly as brother and sister to one another and again he wore his thoughtful look    6  claus discovers humanity  taking claus to a small clearing in the forest the master said place your hand upon my girdle and hold fast while we journey through the air for now shall we encircle the world and look upon many of the haunts of those men from whom you are descended  these words caused claus to marvel for until now he had thought himself the only one of his kind upon the earth yet in silence he grasped firmly the girdle of the great ak his astonishment forbidding speech  then the vast forest of burzee seemed to fall away from their feet and the youth found himself passing swiftly through the air at a great height  ere long there were spires beneath them while buildings of many shapes and colors met their downward view  it was a city of men and ak pausing to descend led claus to its inclosure  said the master  so long as you hold fast to my girdle you will remain unseen by all mankind though seeing clearly yourself  to release your grasp will be to separate yourself forever from me and your home in burzee  one of the first laws of the forest is obedience and claus had no thought of disobeying the masters wish  he clung fast to the girdle and remained invisible  thereafter with each moment passed in the city the youths wonder grew he who had supposed himself created differently from all others now found the earth swarming with creatures of his own kind  indeed said ak the immortals are few but the mortals are many  claus looked earnestly upon his fellows  there were sad faces gay and reckless faces pleasant faces anxious faces and kindly faces all mingled in puzzling disorder  some worked at tedious tasks some strutted in impudent conceit some were thoughtful and grave while others seemed happy and content  men of many natures were there as everywhere and claus found much to please him and much to make him sad  but especially he noted the childrenfirst curiously then eagerly then lovingly  ragged little ones rolled in the dust of the streets playing with scraps and pebbles  other children gaily dressed were propped upon cushions and fed with sugarplums  yet the children of the rich were not happier than those playing with the dust and pebbles it seemed to claus  childhood is the time of mans greatest content said ak following the youths thoughts  tis during these years of innocent pleasure that the little ones are most free from care  tell me said claus why do not all these babies fare alike  because they are born in both cottage and palace returned the master  the difference in the wealth of the parents determines the lot of the child  some are carefully tended and clothed in silks and dainty linen others are neglected and covered with rags  yet all seem equally fair and sweet said claus thoughtfully  while they are babesyes agreed ak  their joy is in being alive and they do not stop to think  in after years the doom of mankind overtakes them and they find they must struggle and worry work and fret to gain the wealth that is so dear to the hearts of men  such things are unknown in the forest where you were reared  claus was silent a moment  then he asked  why was i reared in the forest among those who are not of my race  then ak in gentle voice told him the story of his babyhood how he had been abandoned at the forests edge and left a prey to wild beasts and how the loving nymph necile had rescued him and brought him to manhood under the protection of the immortals  yet i am not of them said claus musingly  you are not of them returned the woodsman  the nymph who cared for you as a mother seems now like a sister to you by and by when you grow old and gray she will seem like a daughter  yet another brief span and you will be but a memory while she remains necile  then why if man must perish is he born demanded the boy  everything perishes except the world itself and its keepers answered ak  but while life lasts everything on earth has its use  the wise seek ways to be helpful to the world for the helpful ones are sure to live again  much of this claus failed to understand fully but a longing seized him to become helpful to his fellows and he remained grave and thoughtful while they resumed their journey  they visited many dwellings of men in many parts of the world watching farmers toil in the fields warriors dash into cruel fray and merchants exchange their goods for bits of white and yellow metal  and everywhere the eyes of claus sought out the children in love and pity for the thought of his own helpless babyhood was strong within him and he yearned to give help to the innocent little ones of his race even as he had been succored by the kindly nymph  day by day the master woodsman and his pupil traversed the earth ak speaking but seldom to the youth who clung steadfastly to his girdle but guiding him into all places where he might become familiar with the lives of human beings  and at last they returned to the grand old forest of burzee where the master set claus down within the circle of nymphs among whom the pretty necile anxiously awaited him  the brow of the great ak was now calm and peaceful but the brow of claus had become lined with deep thought  necile sighed at the change in her fosterson who until now had been ever joyous and smiling and the thought came to her that never again would the life of the boy be the same as before this eventful journey with the master    7  claus leaves the forest  when good queen zurline had touched the golden chalice with her fair lips and it had passed around the circle in honor of the travelers return the master woodsman of the world who had not yet spoken turned his gaze frankly upon claus and said  well  the boy understood and rose slowly to his feet beside necile  once only his eyes passed around the familiar circle of nymphs every one of whom he remembered as a loving comrade but tears came unbidden to dim his sight so he gazed thereafter steadfastly at the master  i have been ignorant said he simply until the great ak in his kindness taught me who and what i am  you who live so sweetly in your forest bowers ever fair and youthful and innocent are no fit comrades for a son of humanity  for i have looked upon man finding him doomed to live for a brief space upon earth to toil for the things he needs to fade into old age and then to pass away as the leaves in autumn yet every man has his mission which is to leave the world better in some way than he found it  i am of the race of men and mans lot is my lot  for your tender care of the poor forsaken babe you adopted as well as for your loving comradeship during my boyhood my heart will ever overflow with gratitude  my fostermother here he stopped and kissed neciles white forehead i shall love and cherish while life lasts  but i must leave you to take my part in the endless struggle to which humanity is doomed and to live my life in my own way  what will you do asked the queen gravely  i must devote myself to the care of the children of mankind and try to make them happy he answered  since your own tender care of a babe brought to me happiness and strength it is just and right that i devote my life to the pleasure of other babes  thus will the memory of the loving nymph necile be planted within the hearts of thousands of my race for many years to come and her kindly act be recounted in song and in story while the world shall last  have i spoken well o master  you have spoken well returned ak and rising to his feet he continued yet one thing must not be forgotten  having been adopted as the child of the forest and the playfellow of the nymphs you have gained a distinction which forever separates you from your kind therefore when you go forth into the world of men you shall retain the protection of the forest and the powers you now enjoy will remain with you to assist you in your labors  in any need you may call upon the nymphs the ryls the knooks and the fairies and they will serve you gladly  i the master woodsman of the world have said it and my word is the law  claus looked upon ak with grateful eyes  this will make me mighty among men he replied  protected by these kind friends i may be able to make thousands of little children happy i will try very hard to do my duty and i know the forest people will give me their sympathy and help  we will said the fairy queen earnestly  we will cried the merry ryls laughing  we will shouted the crooked knooks scowling  we will exclaimed the sweet nymphs proudly  but necile said nothing  she only folded claus in her arms and kissed him tenderly  the world is big continued the boy turning again to his loyal friends but men are everywhere  i shall begin my work near my friends so that if i meet with misfortune i can come to the forest for counsel or help  with that he gave them all a loving look and turned away  there was no need to say good by by for him the sweet wild life of the forest was over  he went forth bravely to meet his doomthe doom of the race of manthe necessity to worry and work  but ak who knew the boys heart was merciful and guided his steps   coming through burzee to its eastern edge claus reached the laughing valley of hohaho  on each side were rolling green hills and a brook wandered midway between them to wind afar off beyond the valley  at his back was the grim forest at the far end of the valley a broad plain  the eyes of the young man which had until now reflected his grave thoughts became brighter as he stood silent looking out upon the laughing valley  then on a sudden his eyes twinkled as stars do on a still night and grew merry and wide  for at his feet the cowslips and daisies smiled on him in friendly regard the breeze whistled gaily as it passed by and fluttered the locks on his forehead the brook laughed joyously as it leaped over the pebbles and swept around the green curves of its banks the bees sang sweet songs as they flew from dandelion to daffodil the beetles chirruped happily in the long grass and the sunbeams glinted pleasantly over all the scene  here cried claus stretching out his arms as if to embrace the valley will i make my home  that was many many years ago  it has been his home ever since  it is his home now     manhood    1  the laughing valley  when claus came the valley was empty save for the grass the brook the wildflowers the bees and the butterflies  if he would make his home here and live after the fashion of men he must have a house  this puzzled him at first but while he stood smiling in the sunshine he suddenly found beside him old nelko the servant of the master woodsman  nelko bore an ax strong and broad with blade that gleamed like burnished silver  this he placed in the young mans hand then disappeared without a word  claus understood and turning to the forests edge he selected a number of fallen treetrunks which he began to clear of their dead branches he would not cut into a living tree  his life among the nymphs who guarded the forest had taught him that a live tree is sacred being a created thing endowed with feeling  but with the dead and fallen trees it was different  they had fulfilled their destiny as active members of the forest community and now it was fitting that their remains should minister to the needs of man  the ax bit deep into the logs at every stroke  it seemed to have a force of its own and claus had but to swing and guide it  when shadows began creeping over the green hills to lie in the valley overnight the young man had chopped many logs into equal lengths and proper shapes for building a house such as he had seen the poorer classes of men inhabit  then resolving to await another day before he tried to fit the logs together claus ate some of the sweet roots he well knew how to find drank deeply from the laughing brook and lay down to sleep on the grass first seeking a spot where no flowers grew lest the weight of his body should crush them  and while he slumbered and breathed in the perfume of the wondrous valley the spirit of happiness crept into his heart and drove out all terror and care and misgivings  never more would the face of claus be clouded with anxieties never more would the trials of life weigh him down as with a burden  the laughing valley had claimed him for its own  would that we all might live in that delightful placebut then maybe it would become overcrowded  for ages it had awaited a tenant was it chance that led young claus to make his home in this happy vale or may we guess that his thoughtful friends the immortals had directed his steps when he wandered away from burzee to seek a home in the great world  certain it is that while the moon peered over the hilltop and flooded with its soft beams the body of the sleeping stranger the laughing valley was filled with the queer crooked shapes of the friendly knooks  these people spoke no words but worked with skill and swiftness  the logs claus had trimmed with his bright ax were carried to a spot beside the brook and fitted one upon another and during the night a strong and roomy dwelling was built  the birds came sweeping into the valley at daybreak and their songs so seldom heard in the deep wood aroused the stranger  he rubbed the web of sleep from his eyelids and looked around  the house met his gaze  i must thank the knooks for this said he gratefully  then he walked to his dwelling and entered at the doorway  a large room faced him having a fireplace at the end and a table and bench in the middle beside the fireplace was a cupboard  another doorway was beyond claus entered here also and saw a smaller room with a bed against the wall and a stool set near a small stand  on the bed were many layers of dried moss brought from the forest  indeed it is a palace exclaimed the smiling claus  i must thank the good knooks again for their knowledge of mans needs as well as for their labors in my behalf  he left his new home with a glad feeling that he was not quite alone in the world although he had chosen to abandon his forest life friendships are not easily broken and the immortals are everywhere  upon reaching the brook he drank of the pure water and then sat down on the bank to laugh at the mischievous gambols of the ripples as they pushed one another against rocks or crowded desperately to see which should first reach the turn beyond  and as they raced away he listened to the song they sang    rushing pushing on we go   not a wave may gently flow     all are too excited     evry drop delighted   turns to spray in merry play   as we tumble on our way   next claus searched for roots to eat while the daffodils turned their little eyes up to him laughingly and lisped their dainty song    blooming fairly growing rarely     never flowerets were so gay   perfume breathing joy bequeathing     as our colors we display   it made claus laugh to hear the little things voice their happiness as they nodded gracefully on their stems  but another strain caught his ear as the sunbeams fell gently across his face and whispered    here is gladness that our rays     warm the valley through the days   here is happiness to give     comfort unto all who live   yes cried claus in answer there is happiness and joy in all things here  the laughing valley is a valley of peace and goodwill  he passed the day talking with the ants and beetles and exchanging jokes with the lighthearted butterflies  and at night he lay on his bed of soft moss and slept soundly  then came the fairies merry but noiseless bringing skillets and pots and dishes and pans and all the tools necessary to prepare food and to comfort a mortal  with these they filled cupboard and fireplace finally placing a stout suit of wool clothing on the stool by the bedside  when claus awoke he rubbed his eyes again and laughed and spoke aloud his thanks to the fairies and the master woodsman who had sent them with eager joy he examined all his new possessions wondering what some might be used for  but in the days when he had clung to the girdle of the great ak and visited the cities of men his eyes had been quick to note all the manners and customs of the race to which he belonged so he guessed from the gifts brought by the fairies that the master expected him hereafter to live in the fashion of his fellowcreatures  which means that i must plow the earth and plant corn he reflected so that when winter comes i shall have garnered food in plenty  but as he stood in the grassy valley he saw that to turn up the earth in furrows would be to destroy hundreds of pretty helpless flowers as well as thousands of the tender blades of grass  and this he could not bear to do  therefore he stretched out his arms and uttered a peculiar whistle he had learned in the forest afterward crying  ryls of the field flowerscome to me  instantly a dozen of the queer little ryls were squatting upon the ground before him and they nodded to him in cheerful greeting  claus gazed upon them earnestly  your brothers of the forest he said i have known and loved many years  i shall love you also when we have become friends  to me the laws of the ryls whether those of the forest or of the field are sacred  i have never wilfully destroyed one of the flowers you tend so carefully but i must plant grain to use for food during the cold winter and how am i to do this without killing the little creatures that sing to me so prettily of their fragrant blossoms  the yellow ryl he who tends the buttercups made answer  fret not friend claus  the great ak has spoken to us of you  there is better work for you in life than to labor for food and though not being of the forest ak has no command over us nevertheless are we glad to favor one he loves  live therefore to do the good work you are resolved to undertake  we the field ryls will attend to your food supplies  after this speech the ryls were no longer to be seen and claus drove from his mind the thought of tilling the earth  when next he wandered back to his dwelling a bowl of fresh milk stood upon the table bread was in the cupboard and sweet honey filled a dish beside it  a pretty basket of rosy apples and newplucked grapes was also awaiting him  he called out thanks my friends to the invisible ryls and straightway began to eat of the food  thereafter when hungry he had but to look into the cupboard to find goodly supplies brought by the kindly ryls  and the knooks cut and stacked much wood for his fireplace  and the fairies brought him warm blankets and clothing  so began his life in the laughing valley with the favor and friendship of the immortals to minister to his every want    2  how claus made the first toy  truly our claus had wisdom for his good fortune but strengthened his resolve to befriend the little ones of his own race  he knew his plan was approved by the immortals else they would not have favored him so greatly  so he began at once to make acquaintance with mankind  he walked through the valley to the plain beyond and crossed the plain in many directions to reach the abodes of men  these stood singly or in groups of dwellings called villages and in nearly all the houses whether big or little claus found children  the youngsters soon came to know his merry laughing face and the kind glance of his bright eyes and the parents while they regarded the young man with some scorn for loving children more than their elders were content that the girls and boys had found a playfellow who seemed willing to amuse them  so the children romped and played games with claus and the boys rode upon his shoulders and the girls nestled in his strong arms and the babies clung fondly to his knees  wherever the young man chanced to be the sound of childish laughter followed him and to understand this better you must know that children were much neglected in those days and received little attention from their parents so that it became to them a marvel that so goodly a man as claus devoted his time to making them happy  and those who knew him were you may be sure very happy indeed  the sad faces of the poor and abused grew bright for once the cripple smiled despite his misfortune the ailing ones hushed their moans and the grieved ones their cries when their merry friend came nigh to comfort them  only at the beautiful palace of the lord of lerd and at the frowning castle of the baron braun was claus refused admittance  there were children at both places but the servants at the palace shut the door in the young strangers face and the fierce baron threatened to hang him from an iron hook on the castle walls  whereupon claus sighed and went back to the poorer dwellings where he was welcome  after a time the winter drew near  the flowers lived out their lives and faded and disappeared the beetles burrowed far into the warm earth the butterflies deserted the meadows and the voice of the brook grew hoarse as if it had taken cold  one day snowflakes filled all the air in the laughing valley dancing boisterously toward the earth and clothing in pure white raiment the roof of clauss dwelling  at night jack frost rapped at the door  come in cried claus  come out answered jack for you have a fire inside  so claus came out  he had known jack frost in the forest and liked the jolly rogue even while he mistrusted him  there will be rare sport for me tonight claus shouted the sprite isnt this glorious weather  i shall nip scores of noses and ears and toes before daybreak  if you love me jack spare the children begged claus  and why asked the other in surprise  they are tender and helpless answered claus  but i love to nip the tender ones declared jack  the older ones are tough and tire my fingers  the young ones are weak and can not fight you said claus  true agreed jack thoughtfully  well i will not pinch a child this nightif i can resist the temptation he promised  good night claus  good night  the young man went in and closed the door and jack frost ran on to the nearest village  claus threw a log on the fire which burned up brightly  beside the hearth sat blinkie a big cat give him by peter the knook  her fur was soft and glossy and she purred neverending songs of contentment  i shall not see the children again soon said claus to the cat who kindly paused in her song to listen  the winter is upon us the snow will be deep for many days and i shall be unable to play with my little friends  the cat raised a paw and stroked her nose thoughtfully but made no reply  so long as the fire burned and claus sat in his easy chair by the hearth she did not mind the weather  so passed many days and many long evenings  the cupboard was always full but claus became weary with having nothing to do more than to feed the fire from the big woodpile the knooks had brought him  one evening he picked up a stick of wood and began to cut it with his sharp knife  he had no thought at first except to occupy his time and he whistled and sang to the cat as he carved away portions of the stick  puss sat up on her haunches and watched him listening at the same time to her masters merry whistle which she loved to hear even more than her own purring songs  claus glanced at puss and then at the stick he was whittling until presently the wood began to have a shape and the shape was like the head of a cat with two ears sticking upward  claus stopped whistling to laugh and then both he and the cat looked at the wooden image in some surprise  then he carved out the eyes and the nose and rounded the lower part of the head so that it rested upon a neck  puss hardly knew what to make of it now and sat up stiffly as if watching with some suspicion what would come next  claus knew  the head gave him an idea  he plied his knife carefully and with skill forming slowly the body of the cat which he made to sit upon its haunches as the real cat did with her tail wound around her two front legs  the work cost him much time but the evening was long and he had nothing better to do  finally he gave a loud and delighted laugh at the result of his labors and placed the wooden cat now completed upon the hearth opposite the real one  puss thereupon glared at her image raised her hair in anger and uttered a defiant mew  the wooden cat paid no attention and claus much amused laughed again  then blinkie advanced toward the wooden image to eye it closely and smell of it intelligently  eyes and nose told her the creature was wood in spite of its natural appearance so puss resumed her seat and her purring but as she neatly washed her face with her padded paw she cast more than one admiring glance at her clever master  perhaps she felt the same satisfaction we feel when we look upon good photographs of ourselves  the cats master was himself pleased with his handiwork without knowing exactly why  indeed he had great cause to congratulate himself that night and all the children throughout the world should have joined him rejoicing  for claus had made his first toy    3  how the ryls colored the toys  a hush lay on the laughing valley now  snow covered it like a white spread and pillows of downy flakes drifted before the dwelling where claus sat feeding the blaze of the fire  the brook gurgled on beneath a heavy sheet of ice and all living plants and insects nestled close to mother earth to keep warm  the face of the moon was hid by dark clouds and the wind delighting in the wintry sport pushed and whirled the snowflakes in so many directions that they could get no chance to fall to the ground  claus heard the wind whistling and shrieking in its play and thanked the good knooks again for his comfortable shelter  blinkie washed her face lazily and stared at the coals with a look of perfect content the toy cat sat opposite the real one and gazed straight ahead as toy cats should  suddenly claus heard a noise that sounded different from the voice of the wind  it was more like a wail of suffering and despair  he stood up and listened but the wind growing boisterous shook the door and rattled the windows to distract his attention  he waited until the wind was tired and then still listening he heard once more the shrill cry of distress  quickly he drew on his coat pulled his cap over his eyes and opened the door  the wind dashed in and scattered the embers over the hearth at the same time blowing blinkies fur so furiously that she crept under the table to escape  then the door was closed and claus was outside peering anxiously into the darkness  the wind laughed and scolded and tried to push him over but he stood firm  the helpless flakes stumbled against his eyes and dimmed his sight but he rubbed them away and looked again  snow was everywhere white and glittering  it covered the earth and filled the air  the cry was not repeated  claus turned to go back into the house but the wind caught him unawares and he stumbled and fell across a snowdrift  his hand plunged into the drift and touched something that was not snow  this he seized and pulling it gently toward him found it to be a child the next moment he had lifted it in his arms and carried it into the house  the wind followed him through the door but claus shut it out quickly he laid the rescued child on the hearth and brushing away the snow he discovered it to be weekum a little boy who lived in a house beyond the valley  claus wrapped a warm blanket around the little one and rubbed the frost from its limbs  before long the child opened his eyes and seeing where he was smiled happily  then claus warmed milk and fed it to the boy slowly while the cat looked on with sober curiosity  finally the little one curled up in his friends arms and sighed and fell asleep and claus filled with gladness that he had found the wanderer held him closely while he slumbered  the wind finding no more mischief to do climbed the hill and swept on toward the north  this gave the weary snowflakes time to settle down to earth and the valley became still again  the boy having slept well in the arms of his friend opened his eyes and sat up  then as a child will he looked around the room and saw all that it contained  your cat is a nice cat claus he said at last  let me hold it  but puss objected and ran away  the other cat wont run claus continued the boy  let me hold that one  claus placed the toy in his arms and the boy held it lovingly and kissed the tip of its wooden ear  how did you get lost in the storm weekum asked claus  i started to walk to my aunties house and lost my way answered weekum  were you frightened  it was cold said weekum and the snow got in my eyes so i could not see  then i kept on till i fell in the snow without knowing where i was and the wind blew the flakes over me and covered me up  claus gently stroked his head and the boy looked up at him and smiled  im all right now said weekum  yes replied claus happily  now i will put you in my warm bed and you must sleep until morning when i will carry you back to your mother  may the cat sleep with me asked the boy  yes if you wish it to answered claus  its a nice cat weekum said smiling as claus tucked the blankets around him and presently the little one fell asleep with the wooden toy in his arms  when morning came the sun claimed the laughing valley and flooded it with his rays so claus prepared to take the lost child back to its mother  may i keep the cat claus asked weekum  its nicer than real cats it doesnt run away or scratch or bite  may i keep it  yes indeed answered claus pleased that the toy he had made could give pleasure to the child  so he wrapped the boy and the wooden cat in a warm cloak perching the bundle upon his own broad shoulders and then he tramped through the snow and the drifts of the valley and across the plain beyond to the poor cottage where weekums mother lived  see mama cried the boy as soon as they entered ive got a cat  the good woman wept tears of joy over the rescue of her darling and thanked claus many times for his kind act  so he carried a warm and happy heart back to his home in the valley  that night he said to puss i believe the children will love the wooden cats almost as well as the real ones and they cant hurt them by pulling their tails and ears  ill make another  so this was the beginning of his great work  the next cat was better made than the first  while claus sat whittling it out the yellow ryl came in to make him a visit and so pleased was he with the mans skill that he ran away and brought several of his fellows  there sat the red ryl the black ryl the green ryl the blue ryl and the yellow ryl in a circle on the floor while claus whittled and whistled and the wooden cat grew into shape  if it could be made the same color as the real cat no one would know the difference said the yellow ryl thoughtfully  the little ones maybe would not know the difference replied claus pleased with the idea  i will bring you some of the red that i color my roses and tulips with cried the red ryl and then you can make the cats lips and tongue red  i will bring some of the green that i color my grasses and leaves with said the green ryl and then you can color the cats eyes green  they will need a bit of yellow also remarked the yellow ryl i must fetch some of the yellow that i use to color my buttercups and goldenrods with  the real cat is black said the black ryl i will bring some of the black that i use to color the eyes of my pansies with and then you can paint your wooden cat black  i see you have a blue ribbon around blinkies neck added the blue ryl  i will get some of the color that i use to paint the bluebells and forgetmenots with and then you can carve a wooden ribbon on the toy cats neck and paint it blue  so the ryls disappeared and by the time claus had finished carving out the form of the cat they were all back with the paints and brushes  they made blinkie sit upon the table that claus might paint the toy cat just the right color and when the work was done the ryls declared it was exactly as good as a live cat  that is to all appearances added the red ryl  blinkie seemed a little offended by the attention bestowed upon the toy and that she might not seem to approve the imitation cat she walked to the corner of the hearth and sat down with a dignified air  but claus was delighted and as soon as morning came he started out and tramped through the snow across the valley and the plain until he came to a village  there in a poor hut near the walls of the beautiful palace of the lord of lerd a little girl lay upon a wretched cot moaning with pain  claus approached the child and kissed her and comforted her and then he drew the toy cat from beneath his coat where he had hidden it and placed it in her arms  ah how well he felt himself repaid for his labor and his long walk when he saw the little ones eyes grow bright with pleasure  she hugged the kitty tight to her breast as if it had been a precious gem and would not let it go for a single moment  the fever was quieted the pain grew less and she fell into a sweet and refreshing sleep  claus laughed and whistled and sang all the way home  never had he been so happy as on that day  when he entered his house he found shiegra the lioness awaiting him since his babyhood shiegra had loved claus and while he dwelt in the forest she had often come to visit him at neciles bower  after claus had gone to live in the laughing valley shiegra became lonely and ill at ease and now she had braved the snowdrifts which all lions abhor to see him once more  shiegra was getting old and her teeth were beginning to fall out while the hairs that tipped her ears and tail had changed from tawnyyellow to white  claus found her lying on his hearth and he put his arms around the neck of the lioness and hugged her lovingly  the cat had retired into a far corner  she did not care to associate with shiegra  claus told his old friend about the cats he had made and how much pleasure they had given weekum and the sick girl  shiegra did not know much about children indeed if she met a child she could scarcely be trusted not to devour it  but she was interested in claus new labors and said  these images seem to me very attractive  yet i can not see why you should make cats which are very unimportant animals  suppose now that i am here you make the image of a lioness the queen of all beasts  then indeed your children will be happyand safe at the same time  claus thought this was a good suggestion  so he got a piece of wood and sharpened his knife while shiegra crouched upon the hearth at his feet  with much care he carved the head in the likeness of the lioness even to the two fierce teeth that curved over her lower lip and the deep frowning lines above her wideopen eyes  when it was finished he said  you have a terrible look shiegra  then the image is like me she answered for i am indeed terrible to all who are not my friends  claus now carved out the body with shiegras long tail trailing behind it  the image of the crouching lioness was very lifelike  it pleases me said shiegra yawning and stretching her body gracefully  now i will watch while you paint  he brought the paints the ryls had given him from the cupboard and colored the image to resemble the real shiegra  the lioness placed her big padded paws upon the edge of the table and raised herself while she carefully examined the toy that was her likeness  you are indeed skillful she said proudly  the children will like that better than cats im sure  then snarling at blinkie who arched her back in terror and whined fearfully she walked away toward her forest home with stately strides    4  how little mayrie became frightened  the winter was over now and all the laughing valley was filled with joyous excitement  the brook was so happy at being free once again that it gurgled more boisterously than ever and dashed so recklessly against the rocks that it sent showers of spray high in the air  the grass thrust its sharp little blades upward through the mat of dead stalks where it had hidden from the snow but the flowers were yet too timid to show themselves although the ryls were busy feeding their roots  the sun was in remarkably good humor and sent his rays dancing merrily throughout the valley  claus was eating his dinner one day when he heard a timid knock on his door  come in he called  no one entered but after a pause came another rapping  claus jumped up and threw open the door  before him stood a small girl holding a smaller brother fast by the hand  is you tlaus she asked shyly  indeed i am my dear he answered with a laugh as he caught both children in his arms and kissed them  you are very welcome and you have come just in time to share my dinner  he took them to the table and fed them with fresh milk and nutcakes when they had eaten enough he asked  why have you made this long journey to see me  i wants a tat replied little mayrie and her brother who had not yet learned to speak many words nodded his head and exclaimed like an echo tat  oh you want my toy cats do you returned claus greatly pleased to discover that his creations were so popular with children  the little visitors nodded eagerly  unfortunately he continued i have but one cat now ready for i carried two to children in the town yesterday  and the one i have shall be given to your brother mayrie because he is the smaller and the next one i make shall be for you  the boys face was bright with smiles as he took the precious toy claus held out to him but little mayrie covered her face with her arm and began to sob grievously  iii wants a tttat now she wailed  her disappointment made claus feel miserable for a moment  then he suddenly remembered shiegra  dont cry darling he said soothingly i have a toy much nicer than a cat and you shall have that  he went to the cupboard and drew out the image of the lioness which he placed on the table before mayrie  the girl raised her arm and gave one glance at the fierce teeth and glaring eyes of the beast and then uttering a terrified scream she rushed from the house  the boy followed her also screaming lustily and even dropping his precious cat in his fear  for a moment claus stood motionless being puzzled and astonished then he threw shiegras image into the cupboard and ran after the children calling to them not to be frightened  little mayrie stopped in her flight and her brother clung to her skirt but they both cast fearful glances at the house until claus had assured them many times that the beast had been locked in the cupboard  yet why were you frightened at seeing it he asked  it is only a toy to play with  its bad said mayrie decidedly ananjust horrid an not a bit nice like tats  perhaps you are right returned claus thoughtfully  but if you will return with me to the house i will soon make you a pretty cat  so they timidly entered the house again having faith in their friends words and afterward they had the joy of watching claus carve out a cat from a bit of wood and paint it in natural colors  it did not take him long to do this for he had become skillful with his knife by this time and mayrie loved her toy the more dearly because she had seen it made  after his little visitors had trotted away on their journey homeward claus sat long in deep thought  and he then decided that such fierce creatures as his friend the lioness would never do as models from which to fashion his toys  there must be nothing to frighten the dear babies he reflected and while i know shiegra well and am not afraid of her it is but natural that children should look upon her image with terror  hereafter i will choose such mildmannered animals as squirrels and rabbits and deer and lambkins from which to carve my toys for then the little ones will love rather than fear them  he began his work that very day and before bedtime had made a wooden rabbit and a lamb  they were not quite so lifelike as the cats had been because they were formed from memory while blinkie had sat very still for claus to look at while he worked  but the new toys pleased the children nevertheless and the fame of claus playthings quickly spread to every cottage on plain and in village  he always carried his gifts to the sick or crippled children but those who were strong enough walked to the house in the valley to ask for them so a little path was soon worn from the plain to the door of the toymakers cottage  first came the children who had been playmates of claus before he began to make toys  these you may be sure were well supplied  then children who lived farther away heard of the wonderful images and made journeys to the valley to secure them  all little ones were welcome and never a one went away emptyhanded  this demand for his handiwork kept claus busily occupied but he was quite happy in knowing the pleasure he gave to so many of the dear children  his friends the immortals were pleased with his success and supported him bravely  the knooks selected for him clear pieces of soft wood that his knife might not be blunted in cutting them the ryls kept him supplied with paints of all colors and brushes fashioned from the tips of timothy grasses the fairies discovered that the workman needed saws and chisels and hammers and nails as well as knives and brought him a goodly array of such tools  claus soon turned his living room into a most wonderful workshop  he built a bench before the window and arranged his tools and paints so that he could reach everything as he sat on his stool  and as he finished toy after toy to delight the hearts of little children he found himself growing so gay and happy that he could not refrain from singing and laughing and whistling all the day long  its because i live in the laughing valley where everything else laughs said claus  but that was not the reason    5  how bessie blithesome came to the laughing valley  one day as claus sat before his door to enjoy the sunshine while he busily carved the head and horns of a toy deer he looked up and discovered a glittering cavalcade of horsemen approaching through the valley  when they drew nearer he saw that the band consisted of a score of menatarms clad in bright armor and bearing in their hands spears and battleaxes  in front of these rode little bessie blithesome the pretty daughter of that proud lord of lerd who had once driven claus from his palace  her palfrey was pure white its bridle was covered with glittering gems and its saddle draped with cloth of gold richly broidered  the soldiers were sent to protect her from harm while she journeyed  claus was surprised but he continued to whittle and to sing until the cavalcade drew up before him  then the little girl leaned over the neck of her palfrey and said  please mr claus i want a toy  her voice was so pleading that claus jumped up at once and stood beside her  but he was puzzled how to answer her request  you are a rich lords daughter said he and have all that you desire  except toys added bessie  there are no toys in all the world but yours  and i make them for the poor children who have nothing else to amuse them continued claus  do poor children love to play with toys more than rich ones asked bessie  i suppose not said claus thoughtfully  am i to blame because my father is a lord  must i be denied the pretty toys i long for because other children are poorer than i she inquired earnestly  im afraid you must dear he answered for the poor have nothing else with which to amuse themselves  you have your pony to ride your servants to wait on you and every comfort that money can procure  but i want toys cried bessie wiping away the tears that forced themselves into her eyes  if i can not have them i shall be very unhappy  claus was troubled for her grief recalled to him the thought that his desire was to make all children happy without regard to their condition in life  yet while so many poor children were clamoring for his toys he could not bear to give one to them to bessie blithesome who had so much already to make her happy  listen my child said he gently all the toys i am now making are promised to others  but the next shall be yours since your heart so longs for it  come to me again in two days and it shall be ready for you  bessie gave a cry of delight and leaning over her ponys neck she kissed claus prettily upon his forehead  then calling to her menatarms she rode gaily away leaving claus to resume his work  if i am to supply the rich children as well as the poor ones he thought i shall not have a spare moment in the whole year  but is it right i should give to the rich  surely i must go to necile and talk with her about this matter  so when he had finished the toy deer which was very like a deer he had known in the forest glades he walked into burzee and made his way to the bower of the beautiful nymph necile who had been his foster mother  she greeted him tenderly and lovingly listening with interest to his story of the visit of bessie blithesome  and now tell me said he shall i give toys to rich children  we of the forest know nothing of riches she replied  it seems to me that one child is like another child since they are all made of the same clay and that riches are like a gown which may be put on or taken away leaving the child unchanged  but the fairies are guardians of mankind and know mortal children better than i  let us call the fairy queen  this was done and the queen of the fairies sat beside them and heard claus relate his reasons for thinking the rich children could get along without his toys and also what the nymph had said  necile is right declared the queen for whether it be rich or poor a childs longings for pretty playthings are but natural  rich bessies heart may suffer as much grief as poor mayries she can be just as lonely and discontented and just as gay and happy  i think friend claus it is your duty to make all little ones glad whether they chance to live in palaces or in cottages  your words are wise fair queen replied claus and my heart tells me they are as just as they are wise  hereafter all children may claim my services  then he bowed before the gracious fairy and kissing neciles red lips went back into his valley  at the brook he stopped to drink and afterward he sat on the bank and took a piece of moist clay in his hands while he thought what sort of toy he should make for bessie blithesome  he did not notice that his fingers were working the clay into shape until glancing downward he found he had unconsciously formed a head that bore a slight resemblance to the nymph necile  at once he became interested  gathering more of the clay from the bank he carried it to his house  then with the aid of his knife and a bit of wood he succeeded in working the clay into the image of a toy nymph with skillful strokes he formed long waving hair on the head and covered the body with a gown of oakleaves while the two feet sticking out at the bottom of the gown were clad in sandals  but the clay was soft and claus found he must handle it gently to avoid ruining his pretty work  perhaps the rays of the sun will draw out the moisture and cause the clay to become hard he thought  so he laid the image on a flat board and placed it in the glare of the sun  this done he went to his bench and began painting the toy deer and soon he became so interested in the work that he forgot all about the clay nymph  but next morning happening to notice it as it lay on the board he found the sun had baked it to the hardness of stone and it was strong enough to be safely handled  claus now painted the nymph with great care in the likeness of necile giving it deepblue eyes white teeth rosy lips and ruddybrown hair the gown he colored oakleaf green and when the paint was dry claus himself was charmed with the new toy  of course it was not nearly so lovely as the real necile but considering the material of which it was made claus thought it was very beautiful  when bessie riding upon her white palfrey came to his dwelling next day claus presented her with the new toy  the little girls eyes were brighter than ever as she examined the pretty image and she loved it at once and held it close to her breast as a mother does to her child  what is it called claus she asked  now claus knew that nymphs do not like to be spoken of by mortals so he could not tell bessie it was an image of necile he had given her but as it was a new toy he searched his mind for a new name to call it by and the first word he thought of he decided would do very well  it is called a dolly my dear he said to bessie  i shall call the dolly my baby returned bessie kissing it fondly and i shall tend it and care for it just as nurse cares for me  thank you very much claus your gift has made me happier than i have ever been before  then she rode away hugging the toy in her arms and claus seeing her delight thought he would make another dolly better and more natural than the first  he brought more clay from the brook and remembering that bessie had called the dolly her baby he resolved to form this one into a babys image  that was no difficult task to the clever workman and soon the baby dolly was lying on the board and placed in the sun to dry  then with the clay that was left he began to make an image of bessie blithesome herself  this was not so easy for he found he could not make the silken robe of the lords daughter out of the common clay  so he called the fairies to his aid and asked them to bring him colored silks with which to make a real dress for the clay image  the fairies set off at once on their errand and before nightfall they returned with a generous supply of silks and laces and golden threads  claus now became impatient to complete his new dolly and instead of waiting for the next days sun he placed the clay image upon his hearth and covered it over with glowing coals  by morning when he drew the dolly from the ashes it had baked as hard as if it had lain a full day in the hot sun  now our claus became a dressmaker as well as a toymaker  he cut the lavender silk and nearly sewed it into a beautiful gown that just fitted the new dolly  and he put a lace collar around its neck and pink silk shoes on its feet  the natural color of baked clay is a light gray but claus painted the face to resemble the color of flesh and he gave the dolly bessies brown eyes and golden hair and rosy cheeks  it was really a beautiful thing to look upon and sure to bring joy to some childish heart  while claus was admiring it he heard a knock at his door and little mayrie entered  her face was sad and her eyes red with continued weeping  why what has grieved you my dear asked claus taking the child in his arms  iveivebwoke my tat sobbed mayrie  how he inquired his eyes twinkling  ii dwopped him an bwoke off hims tail ananthen i dwopped him an bwoke off hims ear  anan now hims all spoilt  claus laughed  never mind mayrie dear he said  how would you like this new dolly instead of a cat  mayrie looked at the silkrobed dolly and her eyes grew big with astonishment  oh tlaus she cried clapping her small hands together with rapture tan i have at booful lady  do you like it he asked  i love it said she  its better an tats  then take it dear and be careful not to break it  mayrie took the dolly with a joy that was almost reverent and her face dimpled with smiles as she started along the path toward home    6  the wickedness of the awgwas  i must now tell you something about the awgwas that terrible race of creatures which caused our good claus so much trouble and nearly succeeded in robbing the children of the world of their earliest and best friend  i do not like to mention the awgwas but they are a part of this history and can not be ignored  they were neither mortals nor immortals but stood midway between those classes of beings  the awgwas were invisible to ordinary people but not to immortals  they could pass swiftly through the air from one part of the world to another and had the power of influencing the minds of human beings to do their wicked will  they were of gigantic stature and had coarse scowling countenances which showed plainly their hatred of all mankind  they possessed no consciences whatever and delighted only in evil deeds  their homes were in rocky mountainous places from whence they sallied forth to accomplish their wicked purposes  the one of their number that could think of the most horrible deed for them to do was always elected the king awgwa and all the race obeyed his orders  sometimes these creatures lived to become a hundred years old but usually they fought so fiercely among themselves that many were destroyed in combat and when they died that was the end of them mortals were powerless to harm them and the immortals shuddered when the awgwas were mentioned and always avoided them  so they flourished for many years unopposed and accomplished much evil  i am glad to assure you that these vile creatures have long since perished and passed from earth but in the days when claus was making his first toys they were a numerous and powerful tribe  one of the principal sports of the awgwas was to inspire angry passions in the hearts of little children so that they quarreled and fought with one another  they would tempt boys to eat of unripe fruit and then delight in the pain they suffered they urged little girls to disobey their parents and then would laugh when the children were punished  i do not know what causes a child to be naughty in these days but when the awgwas were on earth naughty children were usually under their influence  now when claus began to make children happy he kept them out of the power of the awgwas for children possessing such lovely playthings as he gave them had no wish to obey the evil thoughts the awgwas tried to thrust into their minds  therefore one year when the wicked tribe was to elect a new king they chose an awgwa who proposed to destroy claus and take him away from the children  there are as you know fewer naughty children in the world since claus came to the laughing valley and began to make his toys said the new king as he squatted upon a rock and looked around at the scowling faces of his people  why bessie blithesome has not stamped her foot once this month nor has mayries brother slapped his sisters face or thrown the puppy into the rainbarrel  little weekum took his bath last night without screaming or struggling because his mother had promised he should take his toy cat to bed with him  such a condition of affairs is awful for any awgwa to think of and the only way we can direct the naughty actions of children is to take this person claus away from them  good good cried the big awgwas in a chorus and they clapped their hands to applaud the speech of the king  but what shall we do with him asked one of the creatures  i have a plan replied the wicked king and what his plan was you will soon discover  that night claus went to bed feeling very happy for he had completed no less than four pretty toys during the day and they were sure he thought to make four little children happy  but while he slept the band of invisible awgwas surrounded his bed bound him with stout cords and then flew away with him to the middle of a dark forest in far off ethop where they laid him down and left him  when morning came claus found himself thousands of miles from any human being a prisoner in the wild jungle of an unknown land  from the limb of a tree above his head swayed a huge python one of those reptiles that are able to crush a mans bones in their coils  a few yards away crouched a savage panther its glaring red eyes fixed full on the helpless claus  one of those monstrous spotted spiders whose sting is death crept stealthily toward him over the matted leaves which shriveled and turned black at its very touch  but claus had been reared in burzee and was not afraid  come to me ye knooks of the forest he cried and gave the low peculiar whistle that the knooks know  the panther which was about to spring upon its victim turned and slunk away  the python swung itself into the tree and disappeared among the leaves  the spider stopped short in its advance and hid beneath a rotting log  claus had no time to notice them for he was surrounded by a band of harshfeatured knooks more crooked and deformed in appearance than any he had ever seen  who are you that call on us demanded one in a gruff voice  the friend of your brothers in burzee answered claus  i have been brought here by my enemies the awgwas and left to perish miserably yet now i implore your help to release me and to send me home again  have you the sign asked another  yes said claus  they cut his bonds and with his free arms he made the secret sign of the knooks  instantly they assisted him to stand upon his feet and they brought him food and drink to strengthen him  our brothers of burzee make queer friends grumbled an ancient knook whose flowing beard was pure white  but he who knows our secret sign and signal is entitled to our help whoever he may be  close your eyes stranger and we will conduct you to your home  where shall we seek it  tis in the laughing valley answered claus shutting his eyes  there is but one laughing valley in the known world so we can not go astray remarked the knook  as he spoke the sound of his voice seemed to die away so claus opened his eyes to see what caused the change  to his astonishment he found himself seated on the bench by his own door with the laughing valley spread out before him  that day he visited the woodnymphs and related his adventure to queen zurline and necile  the awgwas have become your enemies said the lovely queen thoughtfully so we must do all we can to protect you from their power  it was cowardly to bind him while he slept remarked necile with indignation  the evil ones are ever cowardly answered zurline but our friends slumber shall not be disturbed again  the queen herself came to the dwelling of claus that evening and placed her seal on every door and window to keep out the awgwas  and under the seal of queen zurline was placed the seal of the fairies and the seal of the ryls and the seals of the knooks that the charm might become more powerful  and claus carried his toys to the children again and made many more of the little ones happy  you may guess how angry the king awgwa and his fierce band were when it was known to them that claus had escaped from the forest of ethop  they raged madly for a whole week and then held another meeting among the rocks  it is useless to carry him where the knooks reign said the king for he has their protection  so let us cast him into a cave of our own mountains where he will surely perish  this was promptly agreed to and the wicked band set out that night to seize claus  but they found his dwelling guarded by the seals of the immortals and were obliged to go away baffled and disappointed  never mind said the king he does not sleep always  next day as claus traveled to the village across the plain where he intended to present a toy squirrel to a lame boy he was suddenly set upon by the awgwas who seized him and carried him away to the mountains  there they thrust him within a deep cavern and rolled many huge rocks against the entrance to prevent his escape  deprived thus of light and food and with little air to breathe our claus was indeed in a pitiful plight  but he spoke the mystic words of the fairies which always command their friendly aid and they came to his rescue and transported him to the laughing valley in the twinkling of an eye  thus the awgwas discovered they might not destroy one who had earned the friendship of the immortals so the evil band sought other means of keeping claus from bringing happiness to children and so making them obedient  whenever claus set out to carry his toys to the little ones an awgwa who had been set to watch his movements sprang upon him and snatched the toys from his grasp  and the children were no more disappointed than was claus when he was obliged to return home disconsolate  still he persevered and made many toys for his little friends and started with them for the villages  and always the awgwas robbed him as soon as he had left the valley  they threw the stolen playthings into one of their lonely caverns and quite a heap of toys accumulated before claus became discouraged and gave up all attempts to leave the valley  then children began coming to him since they found he did not go to them but the wicked awgwas flew around them and caused their steps to stray and the paths to become crooked so never a little one could find a way into the laughing valley  lonely days now fell upon claus for he was denied the pleasure of bringing happiness to the children whom he had learned to love  yet he bore up bravely for he thought surely the time would come when the awgwas would abandon their evil designs to injure him  he devoted all his hours to toymaking and when one plaything had been completed he stood it on a shelf he had built for that purpose  when the shelf became filled with rows of toys he made another one and filled that also  so that in time he had many shelves filled with gay and beautiful toys representing horses dogs cats elephants lambs rabbits and deer as well as pretty dolls of all sizes and balls and marbles of baked clay painted in gay colors  often as he glanced at this array of childish treasures the heart of good old claus became sad so greatly did he long to carry the toys to his children  and at last because he could bear it no longer he ventured to go to the great ak to whom he told the story of his persecution by the awgwas and begged the master woodsman to assist him    7  the great battle between good and evil  ak listened gravely to the recital of claus stroking his beard the while with the slow graceful motion that betokened deep thought  he nodded approvingly when claus told how the knooks and fairies had saved him from death and frowned when he heard how the awgwas had stolen the childrens toys  at last he said  from the beginning i have approved the work you are doing among the children of men and it annoys me that your good deeds should be thwarted by the awgwas  we immortals have no connection whatever with the evil creatures who have attacked you  always have we avoided them and they in turn have hitherto taken care not to cross our pathway but in this matter i find they have interfered with one of our friends and i will ask them to abandon their persecutions as you are under our protection  claus thanked the master woodsman most gratefully and returned to his valley while ak who never delayed carrying out his promises at once traveled to the mountains of the awgwas  there standing on the bare rocks he called on the king and his people to appear  instantly the place was filled with throngs of the scowling awgwas and their king perching himself on a point of rock demanded fiercely  who dares call on us  it is i the master woodsman of the world responded ak  here are no forests for you to claim cried the king angrily  we owe no allegiance to you nor to any immortal  that is true replied ak calmly  yet you have ventured to interfere with the actions of claus who dwells in the laughing valley and is under our protection  many of the awgwas began muttering at this speech and their king turned threateningly on the master woodsman  you are set to rule the forests but the plains and the valleys are ours he shouted  keep to your own dark woods  we will do as we please with claus  you shall not harm our friend in any way replied ak  shall we not asked the king impudently  you will see  our powers are vastly superior to those of mortals and fully as great as those of immortals  it is your conceit that misleads you said ak sternly  you are a transient race passing from life into nothingness  we who live forever pity but despise you  on earth you are scorned by all and in heaven you have no place  even the mortals after their earth life enter another existence for all time and so are your superiors  how then dare you who are neither mortal nor immortal refuse to obey my wish  the awgwas sprang to their feet with menacing gestures but their king motioned them back  never before he cried to ak while his voice trembled with rage has an immortal declared himself the master of the awgwas  never shall an immortal venture to interfere with our actions again  for we will avenge your scornful words by killing your friend claus within three days  nor you nor all the immortals can save him from our wrath  we defy your powers  begone master woodsman of the world  in the country of the awgwas you have no place  it is war declared ak with flashing eyes  it is war returned the king savagely  in three days your friend will be dead  the master turned away and came to his forest of burzee where he called a meeting of the immortals and told them of the defiance of the awgwas and their purpose to kill claus within three days  the little folk listened to him quietly  what shall we do asked ak  these creatures are of no benefit to the world said the prince of the knooks we must destroy them  their lives are devoted only to evil deeds said the prince of the ryls  we must destroy them  they have no conscience and endeavor to make all mortals as bad as themselves said the queen of the fairies  we must destroy them  they have defied the great ak and threaten the life of our adopted son said beautiful queen zurline  we must destroy them  the master woodsman smiled  you speak well said he  these awgwas we know to be a powerful race and they will fight desperately yet the outcome is certain  for we who live can never die even though conquered by our enemies while every awgwa who is struck down is one foe the less to oppose us prepare then for battle and let us resolve to show no mercy to the wicked  thus arose that terrible war between the immortals and the spirits of evil which is sung of in fairyland to this very day  the king awgwa and his band determined to carry out the threat to destroy claus  they now hated him for two reasons he made children happy and was a friend of the master woodsman  but since aks visit they had reason to fear the opposition of the immortals and they dreaded defeat  so the king sent swift messengers to all parts of the world to summon every evil creature to his aid  and on the third day after the declaration of war a mighty army was at the command of the king awgwa  there were three hundred asiatic dragons breathing fire that consumed everything it touched  these hated mankind and all good spirits  and there were the threeeyed giants of tatary a host in themselves who liked nothing better than to fight  and next came the black demons from patalonia with great spreading wings like those of a bat which swept terror and misery through the world as they beat upon the air  and joined to these were the goozzlegoblins with long talons as sharp as swords with which they clawed the flesh from their foes  finally every mountain awgwa in the world had come to participate in the great battle with the immortals  the king awgwa looked around upon this vast army and his heart beat high with wicked pride for he believed he would surely triumph over his gentle enemies who had never before been known to fight  but the master woodsman had not been idle  none of his people was used to warfare yet now that they were called upon to face the hosts of evil they willingly prepared for the fray  ak had commanded them to assemble in the laughing valley where claus ignorant of the terrible battle that was to be waged on his account was quietly making his toys  soon the entire valley from hill to hill was filled with the little immortals  the master woodsman stood first bearing a gleaming ax that shone like burnished silver  next came the ryls armed with sharp thorns from bramblebushes  then the knooks bearing the spears they used when they were forced to prod their savage beasts into submission the fairies dressed in white gauze with rainbowhued wings bore golden wands and the woodnymphs in their uniforms of oakleaf green carried switches from ash trees as weapons  loud laughed the awgwa king when he beheld the size and the arms of his foes  to be sure the mighty ax of the woodsman was to be dreaded but the sweetfaced nymphs and pretty fairies the gentle ryls and crooked knooks were such harmless folk that he almost felt shame at having called such a terrible host to oppose them  since these fools dare fight he said to the leader of the tatary giants i will overwhelm them with our evil powers  to begin the battle he poised a great stone in his left hand and cast it full against the sturdy form of the master woodsman who turned it aside with his ax  then rushed the threeeyed giants of tatary upon the knooks and the goozzlegoblins upon the ryls and the firebreathing dragons upon the sweet fairies  because the nymphs were aks own people the band of awgwas sought them out thinking to overcome them with ease  but it is the law that while evil unopposed may accomplish terrible deeds the powers of good can never be overthrown when opposed to evil well had it been for the king awgwa had he known the law  his ignorance cost him his existence for one flash of the ax borne by the master woodsman of the world cleft the wicked king in twain and rid the earth of the vilest creature it contained  greatly marveled the tatary giants when the spears of the little knooks pierced their thick walls of flesh and sent them reeling to the ground with howls of agony  woe came upon the sharptaloned goblins when the thorns of the ryls reached their savage hearts and let their lifeblood sprinkle all the plain  and afterward from every drop a thistle grew  the dragons paused astonished before the fairy wands from whence rushed a power that caused their fiery breaths to flow back on themselves so that they shriveled away and died  as for the awgwas they had scant time to realize how they were destroyed for the ash switches of the nymphs bore a charm unknown to any awgwa and turned their foes into clods of earth at the slightest touch  when ak leaned upon his gleaming ax and turned to look over the field of battle he saw the few giants who were able to run disappearing over the distant hills on their return to tatary  the goblins had perished every one as had the terrible dragons while all that remained of the wicked awgwas was a great number of earthen hillocks dotting the plain  and now the immortals melted from the valley like dew at sunrise to resume their duties in the forest while ak walked slowly and thoughtfully to the house of claus and entered  you have many toys ready for the children said the woodsman and now you may carry them across the plain to the dwellings and the villages without fear  will not the awgwas harm me asked claus eagerly  the awgwas said ak have perished   now i will gladly have done with wicked spirits and with fighting and bloodshed  it was not from choice that i told of the awgwas and their allies and of their great battle with the immortals  they were part of this history and could not be avoided    8  the first journey with the reindeer  those were happy days for claus when he carried his accumulation of toys to the children who had awaited them so long  during his imprisonment in the valley he had been so industrious that all his shelves were filled with playthings and after quickly supplying the little ones living near by he saw he must now extend his travels to wider fields  remembering the time when he had journeyed with ak through all the world he know children were everywhere and he longed to make as many as possible happy with his gifts  so he loaded a great sack with all kinds of toys slung it upon his back that he might carry it more easily and started off on a longer trip than he had yet undertaken  wherever he showed his merry face in hamlet or in farmhouse he received a cordial welcome for his fame had spread into far lands  at each village the children swarmed about him following his footsteps wherever he went and the women thanked him gratefully for the joy he brought their little ones and the men looked upon him curiously that he should devote his time to such a queer occupation as toymaking but every one smiled on him and gave him kindly words and claus felt amply repaid for his long journey  when the sack was empty he went back again to the laughing valley and once more filled it to the brim  this time he followed another road into a different part of the country and carried happiness to many children who never before had owned a toy or guessed that such a delightful plaything existed  after a third journey so far away that claus was many days walking the distance the store of toys became exhausted and without delay he set about making a fresh supply  from seeing so many children and studying their tastes he had acquired several new ideas about toys  the dollies were he had found the most delightful of all playthings for babies and little girls and often those who could not say dolly would call for a doll in their sweet baby talk  so claus resolved to make many dolls of all sizes and to dress them in brightcolored clothing  the older boysand even some of the girlsloved the images of animals so he still made cats and elephants and horses  and many of the little fellows had musical natures and longed for drums and cymbals and whistles and horns  so he made a number of toy drums with tiny sticks to beat them with and he made whistles from the willow trees and horns from the bogreeds and cymbals from bits of beaten metal  all this kept him busily at work and before he realized it the winter season came with deeper snows than usual and he knew he could not leave the valley with his heavy pack  moreover the next trip would take him farther from home than every before and jack frost was mischievous enough to nip his nose and ears if he undertook the long journey while the frost king reigned  the frost king was jacks father and never reproved him for his pranks  so claus remained at his workbench but he whistled and sang as merrily as ever for he would allow no disappointment to sour his temper or make him unhappy  one bright morning he looked from his window and saw two of the deer he had known in the forest walking toward his house  claus was surprised not that the friendly deer should visit him but that they walked on the surface of the snow as easily as if it were solid ground notwithstanding the fact that throughout the valley the snow lay many feet deep  he had walked out of his house a day or two before and had sunk to his armpits in a drift  so when the deer came near he opened the door and called to them  good morning flossie  tell me how you are able to walk on the snow so easily  it is frozen hard answered flossie  the frost king has breathed on it said glossie coming up and the surface is now as solid as ice  perhaps remarked claus thoughtfully i might now carry my pack of toys to the children  is it a long journey asked flossie  yes it will take me many days for the pack is heavy answered claus  then the snow would melt before you could get back said the deer you must wait until spring claus  claus sighed  had i your fleet feet said he i could make the journey in a day  but you have not returned glossie looking at his own slender legs with pride  perhaps i could ride upon your back claus ventured to remark after a pause  oh no our backs are not strong enough to bear your weight said flossie decidedly  but if you had a sledge and could harness us to it we might draw you easily and your pack as well  ill make a sledge exclaimed claus  will you agree to draw me if i do  well replied flossie we must first go and ask the knooks who are our guardians for permission but if they consent and you can make a sledge and harness we will gladly assist you  then go at once cried claus eagerly  i am sure the friendly knooks will give their consent and by the time you are back i shall be ready to harness you to my sledge  flossie and glossie being deer of much intelligence had long wished to see the great world so they gladly ran over the frozen snow to ask the knooks if they might carry claus on his journey  meantime the toymaker hurriedly began the construction of a sledge using material from his woodpile  he made two long runners that turned upward at the front ends and across these nailed short boards to make a platform  it was soon completed but was as rude in appearance as it is possible for a sledge to be  the harness was more difficult to prepare but claus twisted strong cords together and knotted them so they would fit around the necks of the deer in the shape of a collar  from these ran other cords to fasten the deer to the front of the sledge  before the work was completed glossie and flossie were back from the forest having been granted permission by will knook to make the journey with claus provided they would to burzee by daybreak the next morning  that is not a very long time said flossie but we are swift and strong and if we get started by this evening we can travel many miles during the night  claus decided to make the attempt so he hurried on his preparations as fast as possible  after a time he fastened the collars around the necks of his steeds and harnessed them to his rude sledge  then he placed a stool on the little platform to serve as a seat and filled a sack with his prettiest toys  how do you intend to guide us asked glossie  we have never been out of the forest before except to visit your house so we shall not know the way  claus thought about that for a moment  then he brought more cords and fastened two of them to the spreading antlers of each deer one on the right and the other on the left  those will be my reins said claus and when i pull them to the right or to the left you must go in that direction  if i do not pull the reins at all you may go straight ahead  very well answered glossie and flossie and then they asked are you ready  claus seated himself upon the stool placed the sack of toys at his feet and then gathered up the reins  all ready he shouted away we go  the deer leaned forward lifted their slender limbs and the next moment away flew the sledge over the frozen snow  the swiftness of the motion surprised claus for in a few strides they were across the valley and gliding over the broad plain beyond  the day had melted into evening by the time they started for swiftly as claus had worked many hours had been consumed in making his preparations  but the moon shone brightly to light their way and claus soon decided it was just as pleasant to travel by night as by day  the deer liked it better for although they wished to see something of the world they were timid about meeting men and now all the dwellers in the towns and farmhouses were sound asleep and could not see them  away and away they sped on and on over the hills and through the valleys and across the plains until they reached a village where claus had never been before  here he called on them to stop and they immediately obeyed  but a new difficulty now presented itself for the people had locked their doors when they went to bed and claus found he could not enter the houses to leave his toys  i am afraid my friends we have made our journey for nothing said he for i shall be obliged to carry my playthings back home again without giving them to the children of this village  whats the matter asked flossie  the doors are locked answered claus and i can not get in  glossie looked around at the houses  the snow was quite deep in that village and just before them was a roof only a few feet above the sledge  a broad chimney which seemed to glossie big enough to admit claus was at the peak of the roof  why dont you climb down that chimney asked glossie  claus looked at it  that would be easy enough if i were on top of the roof he answered  then hold fast and we will take you there said the deer and they gave one bound to the roof and landed beside the big chimney  good cried claus well pleased and he slung the pack of toys over his shoulder and got into the chimney  there was plenty of soot on the bricks but he did not mind that and by placing his hands and knees against the sides he crept downward until he had reached the fireplace  leaping lightly over the smoldering coals he found himself in a large sittingroom where a dim light was burning  from this room two doorways led into smaller chambers  in one a woman lay asleep with a baby beside her in a crib  claus laughed but he did not laugh aloud for fear of waking the baby then he slipped a big doll from his pack and laid it in the crib  the little one smiled as if it dreamed of the pretty plaything it was to find on the morrow and claus crept softly from the room and entered at the other doorway  here were two boys fast asleep with their arms around each others neck  claus gazed at them lovingly a moment and then placed upon the bed a drum two horns and a wooden elephant  he did not linger now that his work in this house was done but climbed the chimney again and seated himself on his sledge  can you find another chimney he asked the reindeer  easily enough replied glossie and flossie  down to the edge of the roof they raced and then without pausing leaped through the air to the top of the next building where a huge oldfashioned chimney stood  dont be so long this time called flossie or we shall never get back to the forest by daybreak  claus made a trip down this chimney also and found five children sleeping in the house all of whom were quickly supplied with toys  when he returned the deer sprang to the next roof but on descending the chimney claus found no children there at all  that was not often the case in this village however so he lost less time than you might suppose in visiting the dreary homes where there were no little ones  when he had climbed down the chimneys of all the houses in that village and had left a toy for every sleeping child claus found that his great sack was not yet half emptied  onward friends he called to the deer we must seek another village  so away they dashed although it was long past midnight and in a surprisingly short time they came to a large city the largest claus had ever visited since he began to make toys  but nothing daunted by the throng of houses he set to work at once and his beautiful steeds carried him rapidly from one roof to another only the highest being beyond the leaps of the agile deer  at last the supply of toys was exhausted and claus seated himself in the sledge with the empty sack at his feet and turned the heads of glossie and flossie toward home  presently flossie asked  what is that gray streak in the sky  it is the coming dawn of day answered claus surprised to find that it was so late  good gracious exclaimed glossie then we shall not be home by daybreak and the knooks will punish us and never let us come again  we must race for the laughing valley and make our best speed returned flossie so hold fast friend claus  claus held fast and the next moment was flying so swiftly over the snow that he could not see the trees as they whirled past  up hill and down dale swift as an arrow shot from a bow they dashed and claus shut his eyes to keep the wind out of them and left the deer to find their own way  it seemed to him they were plunging through space but he was not at all afraid  the knooks were severe masters and must be obeyed at all hazards and the gray streak in the sky was growing brighter every moment  finally the sledge came to a sudden stop and claus who was taken unawares tumbled from his seat into a snowdrift  as he picked himself up he heard the deer crying  quick friend quick  cut away our harness  he drew his knife and rapidly severed the cords and then he wiped the moisture from his eyes and looked around him  the sledge had come to a stop in the laughing valley only a few feet he found from his own door  in the east the day was breaking and turning to the edge of burzee he saw glossie and flossie just disappearing in the forest    9  santa claus  claus thought that none of the children would ever know where the toys came from which they found by their bedsides when they wakened the following morning  but kindly deeds are sure to bring fame and fame has many wings to carry its tidings into far lands so for miles and miles in every direction people were talking of claus and his wonderful gifts to children  the sweet generousness of his work caused a few selfish folk to sneer but even these were forced to admit their respect for a man so gentlenatured that he loved to devote his life to pleasing the helpless little ones of his race  therefore the inhabitants of every city and village had been eagerly watching the coming of claus and remarkable stories of his beautiful playthings were told the children to keep them patient and contented  when on the morning following the first trip of claus with his deer the little ones came running to their parents with the pretty toys they had found and asked from whence they came they was but one reply to the question  the good claus must have been here my darlings for his are the only toys in all the world  but how did he get in asked the children  at this the fathers shook their heads being themselves unable to understand how claus had gained admittance to their homes but the mothers watching the glad faces of their dear ones whispered that the good claus was no mortal man but assuredly a saint and they piously blessed his name for the happiness he had bestowed upon their children  a saint said one with bowed head has no need to unlock doors if it pleases him to enter our homes  and afterward when a child was naughty or disobedient its mother would say  you must pray to the good santa claus for forgiveness  he does not like naughty children and unless you repent he will bring you no more pretty toys  but santa claus himself would not have approved this speech  he brought toys to the children because they were little and helpless and because he loved them  he knew that the best of children were sometimes naughty and that the naughty ones were often good  it is the way with children the world over and he would not have changed their natures had he possessed the power to do so  and that is how our claus became santa claus  it is possible for any man by good deeds to enshrine himself as a saint in the hearts of the people    10  christmas eve  the day that broke as claus returned from his night ride with glossie and flossie brought to him a new trouble  will knook the chief guardian of the deer came to him surly and illtempered to complain that he had kept glossie and flossie beyond daybreak in opposition to his orders  yet it could not have been very long after daybreak said claus  it was one minute after answered will knook and that is as bad as one hour  i shall set the stinging gnats on glossie and flossie and they will thus suffer terribly for their disobedience  dont do that begged claus  it was my fault  but will knook would listen to no excuses and went away grumbling and growling in his illnatured way  for this reason claus entered the forest to consult necile about rescuing the good deer from punishment  to his delight he found his old friend the master woodsman seated in the circle of nymphs  ak listened to the story of the night journey to the children and of the great assistance the deer had been to claus by drawing his sledge over the frozen snow  i do not wish my friends to be punished if i can save them said the toymaker when he had finished the relation  they were only one minute late and they ran swifter than a bird flies to get home before daybreak  ak stroked his beard thoughtfully a moment and then sent for the prince of the knooks who rules all his people in burzee and also for the queen of the fairies and the prince of the ryls  when all had assembled claus told his story again at aks command and then the master addressed the prince of the knooks saying  the good work that claus is doing among mankind deserves the support of every honest immortal  already he is called a saint in some of the towns and before long the name of santa claus will be lovingly known in every home that is blessed with children  moreover he is a son of our forest so we owe him our encouragement  you ruler of the knooks have known him these many years am i not right in saying he deserves our friendship  the prince crooked and sour of visage as all knooks are looked only upon the dead leaves at his feet and muttered you are the master woodsman of the world  ak smiled but continued in soft tones it seems that the deer which are guarded by your people can be of great assistance to claus and as they seem willing to draw his sledge i beg that you will permit him to use their services whenever he pleases  the prince did not reply but tapped the curled point of his sandal with the tip of his spear as if in thought  then the fairy queen spoke to him in this way if you consent to aks request i will see that no harm comes to your deer while they are away from the forest  and the prince of the ryls added for my part i will allow to every deer that assists claus the privilege of eating my casa plants which give strength and my grawle plants which give fleetness of foot and my marbon plants which give long life  and the queen of the nymphs said the deer which draw the sledge of claus will be permitted to bathe in the forest pool of nares which will give them sleek coats and wonderful beauty  the prince of the knooks hearing these promises shifted uneasily on his seat for in his heart he hated to refuse a request of his fellow immortals although they were asking an unusual favor at his hands and the knooks are unaccustomed to granting favors of any kind  finally he turned to his servants and said  call will knook  when surly will came and heard the demands of the immortals he protested loudly against granting them  deer are deer said he and nothing but deer  were they horses it would be right to harness them like horses  but no one harnesses deer because they are free wild creatures owing no service of any sort to mankind  it would degrade my deer to labor for claus who is only a man in spite of the friendship lavished on him by the immortals  you have heard said the prince to ak  there is truth in what will says  call glossie and flossie returned the master  the deer were brought to the conference and ak asked them if they objected to drawing the sledge for claus  no indeed replied glossie we enjoyed the trip very much  and we tried to get home by daybreak added flossie but were unfortunately a minute too late  a minute lost at daybreak doesnt matter said ak  you are forgiven for that delay  provided it does not happen again said the prince of the knooks sternly  and will you permit them to make another journey with me asked claus eagerly  the prince reflected while he gazed at will who was scowling and at the master woodsman who was smiling  then he stood up and addressed the company as follows  since you all urge me to grant the favor i will permit the deer to go with claus once every year on christmas eve provided they always return to the forest by daybreak  he may select any number he pleases up to ten to draw his sledge and those shall be known among us as reindeer to distinguish them from the others  and they shall bathe in the pool of nares and eat the casa and grawle and marbon plants and shall be under the especial protection of the fairy queen  and now cease scowling will knook for my words shall be obeyed  he hobbled quickly away through the trees to avoid the thanks of claus and the approval of the other immortals and will looking as cross as ever followed him  but ak was satisfied knowing that he could rely on the promise of the prince however grudgingly given and glossie and flossie ran home kicking up their heels delightedly at every step  when is christmas eve claus asked the master  in about ten days he replied  then i can not use the deer this year said claus thoughtfully for i shall not have time enough to make my sackful of toys  the shrewd prince foresaw that responded ak and therefore named christmas eve as the day you might use the deer knowing it would cause you to lose an entire year  if i only had the toys the awgwas stole from me said claus sadly i could easily fill my sack for the children  where are they asked the master  i do not know replied claus but the wicked awgwas probably hid them in the mountains  ak turned to the fairy queen  can you find them he asked  i will try she replied brightly  then claus went back to the laughing valley to work as hard as he could and a band of fairies immediately flew to the mountain that had been haunted by the awgwas and began a search for the stolen toys  the fairies as we well know possess wonderful powers but the cunning awgwas had hidden the toys in a deep cave and covered the opening with rocks so no one could look in  therefore all search for the missing playthings proved in vain for several days and claus who sat at home waiting for news from the fairies almost despaired of getting the toys before christmas eve  he worked hard every moment but it took considerable time to carve out and to shape each toy and to paint it properly so that on the morning before christmas eve only half of one small shelf above the window was filled with playthings ready for the children  but on this morning the fairies who were searching in the mountains had a new thought  they joined hands and moved in a straight line through the rocks that formed the mountain beginning at the topmost peak and working downward so that no spot could be missed by their bright eyes and at last they discovered the cave where the toys had been heaped up by the wicked awgwas  it did not take them long to burst open the mouth of the cave and then each one seized as many toys as he could carry and they all flew to claus and laid the treasure before him  the good man was rejoiced to receive just in the nick of time such a store of playthings with which to load his sledge and he sent word to glossie and flossie to be ready for the journey at nightfall  with all his other labors he had managed to find time since the last trip to repair the harness and to strengthen his sledge so that when the deer came to him at twilight he had no difficulty in harnessing them  we must go in another direction tonight he told them where we shall find children i have never yet visited  and we must travel fast and work quickly for my sack is full of toys and running over the brim  so just as the moon arose they dashed out of the laughing valley and across the plain and over the hills to the south  the air was sharp and frosty and the starlight touched the snowflakes and made them glitter like countless diamonds  the reindeer leaped onward with strong steady bounds and claus heart was so light and merry that he laughed and sang while the wind whistled past his ears       with a ho ho ho       and a ha ha ha   and a ho ho ha ha hee       now away we go       oer the frozen snow   as merry as we can be   jack frost heard him and came racing up with his nippers but when he saw it was claus he laughed and turned away again  the mother owls heard him as he passed near a wood and stuck their heads out of the hollow places in the treetrunks but when they saw who it was they whispered to the owlets nestling near them that it was only santa claus carrying toys to the children  it is strange how much those mother owls know  claus stopped at some of the scattered farmhouses and climbed down the chimneys to leave presents for the babies  soon after he reached a village and worked merrily for an hour distributing playthings among the sleeping little ones  then away again he went signing his joyous carol       now away we go       oer the gleaming snow   while the deer run swift and free       for to girls and boys       we carry the toys   that will fill their hearts with glee   the deer liked the sound of his deep bass voice and kept time to the song with their hoofbeats on the hard snow but soon they stopped at another chimney and santa claus with sparkling eyes and face brushed red by the wind climbed down its smoky sides and left a present for every child the house contained  it was a merry happy night  swiftly the deer ran and busily their driver worked to scatter his gifts among the sleeping children  but the sack was empty at last and the sledge headed homeward and now again the race with daybreak began  glossie and flossie had no mind to be rebuked a second time for tardiness so they fled with a swiftness that enabled them to pass the gale on which the frost king rode and soon brought them to the laughing valley  it is true when claus released his steeds from their harness the eastern sky was streaked with gray but glossie and flossie were deep in the forest before day fairly broke  claus was so wearied with his nights work that he threw himself upon his bed and fell into a deep slumber and while he slept the christmas sun appeared in the sky and shone upon hundreds of happy homes where the sound of childish laughter proclaimed that santa claus had made them a visit  god bless him  it was his first christmas eve and for hundreds of years since then he has nobly fulfilled his mission to bring happiness to the hearts of little children    11  how the first stockings were hung by the chimneys  when you remember that no child until santa claus began his travels had ever known the pleasure of possessing a toy you will understand how joy crept into the homes of those who had been favored with a visit from the good man and how they talked of him day by day in loving tones and were honestly grateful for his kindly deeds  it is true that great warriors and mighty kings and clever scholars of that day were often spoken of by the people but no one of them was so greatly beloved as santa claus because none other was so unselfish as to devote himself to making others happy  for a generous deed lives longer than a great battle or a kings decree of a scholars essay because it spreads and leaves its mark on all nature and endures through many generations  the bargain made with the knook prince changed the plans of claus for all future time for being able to use the reindeer on but one night of each year he decided to devote all the other days to the manufacture of playthings and on christmas eve to carry them to the children of the world  but a years work would he knew result in a vast accumulation of toys so he resolved to build a new sledge that would be larger and stronger and betterfitted for swift travel than the old and clumsy one  his first act was to visit the gnome king with whom he made a bargain to exchange three drums a trumpet and two dolls for a pair of fine steel runners curled beautifully at the ends  for the gnome king had children of his own who living in the hollows under the earth in mines and caverns needed something to amuse them  in three days the steel runners were ready and when claus brought the playthings to the gnome king his majesty was so greatly pleased with them that he presented claus with a string of sweettoned sleighbells in addition to the runners  these will please glossie and flossie said claus as he jingled the bells and listened to their merry sound  but i should have two strings of bells one for each deer  bring me another trumpet and a toy cat replied the king and you shall have a second string of bells like the first  it is a bargain cried claus and he went home again for the toys  the new sledge was carefully built the knooks bringing plenty of strong but thin boards to use in its construction  claus made a high rounding dashboard to keep off the snow cast behind by the fleet hoofs of the deer and he made high sides to the platform so that many toys could be carried and finally he mounted the sledge upon the slender steel runners made by the gnome king  it was certainly a handsome sledge and big and roomy  claus painted it in bright colors although no one was likely to see it during his midnight journeys and when all was finished he sent for glossie and flossie to come and look at it  the deer admired the sledge but gravely declared it was too big and heavy for them to draw  we might pull it over the snow to be sure said glossie but we would not pull it fast enough to enable us to visit the faraway cities and villages and return to the forest by daybreak  then i must add two more deer to my team declared claus after a moments thought  the knook prince allowed you as many as ten  why not use them all asked flossie  then we could speed like the lightning and leap to the highest roofs with ease  a team of ten reindeer cried claus delightedly  that will be splendid  please return to the forest at once and select eight other deer as like yourselves as possible  and you must all eat of the casa plant to become strong and of the grawle plant to become fleet of foot and of the marbon plant that you may live long to accompany me on my journeys  likewise it will be well for you to bathe in the pool of nares which the lovely queen zurline declares will render you rarely beautiful  should you perform these duties faithfully there is no doubt that on next christmas eve my ten reindeer will be the most powerful and beautiful steeds the world has ever seen  so glossie and flossie went to the forest to choose their mates and claus began to consider the question of a harness for them all  in the end he called upon peter knook for assistance for peters heart is as kind as his body is crooked and he is remarkably shrewd as well  and peter agreed to furnish strips of tough leather for the harness  this leather was cut from the skins of lions that had reached such an advanced age that they died naturally and on one side was tawny hair while the other side was cured to the softness of velvet by the deft knooks  when claus received these strips of leather he sewed them neatly into a harness for the ten reindeer and it proved strong and serviceable and lasted him for many years  the harness and sledge were prepared at odd times for claus devoted most of his days to the making of toys  these were now much better than the first ones had been for the immortals often came to his house to watch him work and to offer suggestions  it was neciles idea to make some of the dolls say papa and mama  it was a thought of the knooks to put a squeak inside the lambs so that when a child squeezed them they would say baaaaa  and the fairy queen advised claus to put whistles in the birds so they could be made to sing and wheels on the horses so children could draw them around  many animals perished in the forest from one cause or another and their fur was brought to claus that he might cover with it the small images of beasts he made for playthings  a merry ryl suggested that claus make a donkey with a nodding head which he did and afterward found that it amused the little ones immensely  and so the toys grew in beauty and attractiveness every day until they were the wonder of even the immortals  when another christmas eve drew near there was a monster load of beautiful gifts for the children ready to be loaded upon the big sledge  claus filled three sacks to the brim and tucked every corner of the sledgebox full of toys besides  then at twilight the ten reindeer appeared and flossie introduced them all to claus  they were racer and pacer reckless and speckless fearless and peerless and ready and steady who with glossie and flossie made up the ten who have traversed the world these hundreds of years with their generous master  they were all exceedingly beautiful with slender limbs spreading antlers velvety dark eyes and smooth coats of fawn color spotted with white  claus loved them at once and has loved them ever since for they are loyal friends and have rendered him priceless service  the new harness fitted them nicely and soon they were all fastened to the sledge by twos with glossie and flossie in the lead  these wore the strings of sleighbells and were so delighted with the music they made that they kept prancing up and down to make the bells ring  claus now seated himself in the sledge drew a warm robe over his knees and his fur cap over his ears and cracked his long whip as a signal to start  instantly the ten leaped forward and were away like the wind while jolly claus laughed gleefully to see them run and shouted a song in his big hearty voice        with a ho ho ho       and a ha ha ha   and a ho ho ha ha hee       now away we go       oer the frozen snow   as merry as we can be        there are many joys       in our load of toys   as many a child will know       well scatter them wide       on our wild night ride   oer the crisp and sparkling snow   now it was on this same christmas eve that little margot and her brother dick and her cousins ned and sara who were visiting at margots house came in from making a snow man with their clothes damp their mittens dripping and their shoes and stockings wet through and through  they were not scolded for margots mother knew the snow was melting but they were sent early to bed that their clothes might be hung over chairs to dry  the shoes were placed on the red tiles of the hearth where the heat from the hot embers would strike them and the stockings were carefully hung in a row by the chimney directly over the fireplace  that was the reason santa claus noticed them when he came down the chimney that night and all the household were fast asleep  he was in a tremendous hurry and seeing the stockings all belonged to children he quickly stuffed his toys into them and dashed up the chimney again appearing on the roof so suddenly that the reindeer were astonished at his agility  i wish they would all hang up their stockings he thought as he drove to the next chimney  it would save me a lot of time and i could then visit more children before daybreak  when margot and dick and ned and sara jumped out of bed next morning and ran downstairs to get their stockings from the fireplace they were filled with delight to find the toys from santa claus inside them  in face i think they found more presents in their stockings than any other children of that city had received for santa claus was in a hurry and did not stop to count the toys  of course they told all their little friends about it and of course every one of them decided to hang his own stockings by the fireplace the next christmas eve  even bessie blithesome who made a visit to that city with her father the great lord of lerd heard the story from the children and hung her own pretty stockings by the chimney when she returned home at christmas time  on his next trip santa claus found so many stockings hung up in anticipation of his visit that he could fill them in a jiffy and be away again in half the time required to hunt the children up and place the toys by their bedsides  the custom grew year after year and has always been a great help to santa claus  and with so many children to visit he surely needs all the help we are able to give him    12  the first christmas tree  claus had always kept his promise to the knooks by returning to the laughing valley by daybreak but only the swiftness of his reindeer has enabled him to do this for he travels over all the world  he loved his work and he loved the brisk night ride on his sledge and the gay tinkle of the sleighbells  on that first trip with the ten reindeer only glossie and flossie wore bells but each year thereafter for eight years claus carried presents to the children of the gnome king and that goodnatured monarch gave him in return a string of bells at each visit so that finally every one of the ten deer was supplied and you may imagine what a merry tune the bells played as the sledge sped over the snow  the childrens stockings were so long that it required a great many toys to fill them and soon claus found there were other things besides toys that children love  so he sent some of the fairies who were always his good friends into the tropics from whence they returned with great bags full of oranges and bananas which they had plucked from the trees  and other fairies flew to the wonderful valley of phunnyland where delicious candies and bonbons grow thickly on the bushes and returned laden with many boxes of sweetmeats for the little ones  these things santa claus on each christmas eve placed in the long stockings together with his toys and the children were glad to get them you may be sure  there are also warm countries where there is no snow in winter but claus and his reindeer visited them as well as the colder climes for there were little wheels inside the runners of his sledge which permitted it to run as smoothly over bare ground as on the snow  and the children who lived in the warm countries learned to know the name of santa claus as well as those who lived nearer to the laughing valley  once just as the reindeer were ready to start on their yearly trip a fairy came to claus and told him of three little children who lived beneath a rude tent of skins on a broad plain where there were no trees whatever  these poor babies were miserable and unhappy for their parents were ignorant people who neglected them sadly  claus resolved to visit these children before he returned home and during his ride he picked up the bushy top of a pine tree which the wind had broken off and placed it in his sledge  it was nearly morning when the deer stopped before the lonely tent of skins where the poor children lay asleep  claus at once planted the bit of pine tree in the sand and stuck many candles on the branches then he hung some of his prettiest toys on the tree as well as several bags of candies  it did not take long to do all this for santa claus works quickly and when all was ready he lighted the candles and thrusting his head in at the opening of the tent he shouted  merry christmas little ones  with that he leaped into his sledge and was out of sight before the children rubbing the sleep from their eyes could come out to see who had called them  you can imagine the wonder and joy of those little ones who had never in their lives known a real pleasure before when they saw the tree sparkling with lights that shone brilliant in the gray dawn and hung with toys enough to make them happy for years to come  they joined hands and danced around the tree shouting and laughing until they were obliged to pause for breath  and their parents also came out to look and wonder and thereafter had more respect and consideration for their children since santa claus had honored them with such beautiful gifts  the idea of the christmas tree pleased claus and so the following year he carried many of them in his sledge and set them up in the homes of poor people who seldom saw trees and placed candles and toys on the branches  of course he could not carry enough trees in one load of all who wanted them but in some homes the fathers were able to get trees and have them all ready for santa claus when he arrived and these the good claus always decorated as prettily as possible and hung with toys enough for all the children who came to see the tree lighted  these novel ideas and the generous manner in which they were carried out made the children long for that one night in the year when their friend santa claus should visit them and as such anticipation is very pleasant and comforting the little ones gleaned much happiness by wondering what would happen when santa claus next arrived  perhaps you remember that stern baron braun who once drove claus from his castle and forbade him to visit his children  well many years afterward when the old baron was dead and his son ruled in his place the new baron braun came to the house of claus with his train of knights and pages and henchmen and dismounting from his charger bared his head humbly before the friend of children  my father did not know your goodness and worth he said and therefore threatened to hang you from the castle walls  but i have children of my own who long for a visit from santa claus and i have come to beg that you will favor them hereafter as you do other children  claus was pleased with this speech for castle braun was the only place he had never visited and he gladly promised to bring presents to the barons children the next christmas eve  the baron went away contented and claus kept his promise faithfully  thus did this man through very goodness conquer the hearts of all and it is no wonder he was ever merry and gay for there was no home in the wide world where he was not welcomed more royally than any king     old age    1  the mantle of immortality  and now we come to a turningpoint in the career of santa claus and it is my duty to relate the most remarkable that has happened since the world began or mankind was created  we have followed the life of claus from the time he was found a helpless infant by the woodnymph necile and reared to manhood in the great forest of burzee  and we know how he began to make toys for children and how with the assistance and goodwill of the immortals he was able to distribute them to the little ones throughout the world  for many years he carried on this noble work for the simple hardworking life he led gave him perfect health and strength  and doubtless a man can live longer in the beautiful laughing valley where there are no cares and everything is peaceful and merry than in any other part of the world  but when many years had rolled away santa claus grew old  the long beard of golden brown that once covered his cheeks and chin gradually became gray and finally turned to pure white  his hair was white too and there were wrinkles at the corners of his eyes which showed plainly when he laughed  he had never been a very tall man and now he became fat and waddled very much like a duck when he walked  but in spite of these things he remained as lively as ever and was just as jolly and gay and his kind eyes sparkled as brightly as they did that first day when he came to the laughing valley  yet a time is sure to come when every mortal who has grown old and lived his life is required to leave this world for another so it is no wonder that after santa claus had driven his reindeer on many and many a christmas eve those stanch friends finally whispered among themselves that they had probably drawn his sledge for the last time  then all the forest of burzee became sad and all the laughing valley was hushed for every living thing that had known claus had used to love him and to brighten at the sound of his footsteps or the notes of his merry whistle  no doubt the old mans strength was at last exhausted for he made no more toys but lay on his bed as in a dream  the nymph necile she who had reared him and been his fostermother was still youthful and strong and beautiful and it seemed to her but a short time since this aged graybearded man had lain in her arms and smiled on her with his innocent baby lips  in this is shown the difference between mortals and immortals  it was fortunate that the great ak came to the forest at this time necile sought him with troubled eyes and told him of the fate that threatened their friend claus  at once the master became grave and he leaned upon his ax and stroked his grizzled beard thoughtfully for many minutes  then suddenly he stood up straight and poised his powerful head with firm resolve and stretched out his great right arm as if determined on doing some mighty deed  for a thought had come to him so grand in its conception that all the world might well bow before the master woodsman and honor his name forever  it is well known that when the great ak once undertakes to do a thing he never hesitates an instant  now he summoned his fleetest messengers and sent them in a flash to many parts of the earth  and when they were gone he turned to the anxious necile and comforted her saying  be of good heart my child our friend still lives  and now run to your queen and tell her that i have summoned a council of all the immortals of the world to meet with me here in burzee this night  if they obey and harken unto my words claus will drive his reindeer for countless ages yet to come  at midnight there was a wondrous scene in the ancient forest of burzee where for the first time in many centuries the rulers of the immortals who inhabit the earth were gathered together  there was the queen of the water sprites whose beautiful form was as clear as crystal but continually dripped water on the bank of moss where she sat  and beside her was the king of the sleep fays who carried a wand from the end of which a fine dust fell all around so that no mortal could keep awake long enough to see him as mortal eyes were sure to close in sleep as soon as the dust filled them  and next to him sat the gnome king whose people inhabit all that region under the earths surface where they guard the precious metals and the jewel stones that lie buried in rock and ore  at his right hand stood the king of the sound imps who had wings on his feet for his people are swift to carry all sounds that are made  when they are busy they carry the sounds but short distances for there are many of them but sometimes they speed with the sounds to places miles and miles away from where they are made  the king of the sound imps had an anxious and careworn face for most people have no consideration for his imps and especially the boys and girls make a great many unnecessary sounds which the imps are obliged to carry when they might be better employed  the next in the circle of immortals was the king of the wind demons slender of frame restless and uneasy at being confined to one place for even an hour  once in a while he would leave his place and circle around the glade and each time he did this the fairy queen was obliged to untangle the flowing locks of her golden hair and tuck them back of her pink ears  but she did not complain for it was not often that the king of the wind demons came into the heart of the forest  after the fairy queen whose home you know was in old burzee came the king of the light elves with his two princes flash and twilight at his back he never went anywhere without his princes for they were so mischievous that he dared not let them wander alone  prince flash bore a lightningbolt in his right hand and a horn of gunpowder in his left and his bright eyes roved constantly around as if he longed to use his blinding flashes  prince twilight held a great snuffer in one hand and a big black cloak in the other and it is well known that unless twilight is carefully watched the snuffers or the cloak will throw everything into darkness and darkness is the greatest enemy the king of the light elves has  in addition to the immortals i have named were the king of the knooks who had come from his home in the jungles of india and the king of the ryls who lived among the gay flowers and luscious fruits of valencia sweet queen zurline of the woodnymphs completed the circle of immortals  but in the center of the circle sat three others who possessed powers so great that all the kings and queens showed them reverence  these were ak the master woodsman of the world who rules the forests and the orchards and the groves and kern the master husbandman of the world who rules the grain fields and the meadows and the gardens and bo the master mariner of the world who rules the seas and all the craft that float thereon  and all other immortals are more or less subject to these three  when all had assembled the master woodsman of the world stood up to address them since he himself had summoned them to the council  very clearly he told them the story of claus beginning at the time when as a babe he had been adopted a child of the forest and telling of his noble and generous nature and his lifelong labors to make children happy  and now said ak when he had won the love of all the world the spirit of death is hovering over him  of all men who have inhabited the earth none other so well deserves immortality for such a life can not be spared so long as there are children of mankind to miss him and to grieve over his loss  we immortals are the servants of the world and to serve the world we were permitted in the beginning to exist but what one of us is more worthy of immortality than this man claus who so sweetly ministers to the little children  he paused and glanced around the circle to find every immortal listening to him eagerly and nodding approval  finally the king of the wind demons who had been whistling softly to himself cried out  what is your desire o ak  to bestow upon claus the mantle of immortality said ak boldly  that this demand was wholly unexpected was proved by the immortals springing to their feet and looking into each others face with dismay and then upon ak with wonder  for it was a grave matter this parting with the mantle of immortality  the queen of the water sprites spoke in her low clear voice and the words sounded like raindrops splashing upon a windowpane  in all the world there is but one mantle of immortality she said  the king of the sound fays added  it has existed since the beginning and no mortal has ever dared to claim it  and the master mariner of the world arose and stretched his limbs saying  only by the vote of every immortal can it be bestowed upon a mortal  i know all this answered ak quietly  but the mantle exists and if it was created as you say in the beginning it was because the supreme master knew that some day it would be required  until now no mortal has deserved it but who among you dares deny that the good claus deserves it  will you not all vote to bestow it upon him  they were silent still looking upon one another questioningly  of what use is the mantle of immortality unless it is worn demanded ak  what will it profit any one of us to allow it to remain in its lonely shrine for all time to come  enough cried the gnome king abruptly  we will vote on the matter yes or no  for my part i say yes  and i said the fairy queen promptly and ak rewarded her with a smile  my people in burzee tell me they have learned to love him therefore i vote to give claus the mantle said the king of the ryls  he is already a comrade of the knooks announced the ancient king of that band  let him have immortality  let him have itlet him have it sighed the king of the wind demons  why not asked the king of the sleep fays  he never disturbs the slumbers my people allow humanity  let the good claus be immortal  i do not object said the king of the sound imps  nor i murmured the queen of the water sprites  if claus does not receive the mantle it is clear none other can ever claim it remarked the king of the light elves so let us have done with the thing for all time  the woodnymphs were first to adopt him said queen zurline  of course i shall vote to make him immortal  ak now turned to the master husbandman of the world who held up his right arm and said yes  and the master mariner of the world did likewise after which ak with sparkling eyes and smiling face cried out  i thank you fellow immortals  for all have voted yes and so to our dear claus shall fall the one mantle of immortality that it is in our power to bestow  let us fetch it at once said the fay king im in a hurry  they bowed assent and instantly the forest glade was deserted  but in a place midway between the earth and the sky was suspended a gleaming crypt of gold and platinum aglow with soft lights shed from the facets of countless gems  within a high dome hung the precious mantle of immortality and each immortal placed a hand on the hem of the splendid robe and said as with one voice  we bestow this mantle upon claus who is called the patron saint of children  at this the mantle came away from its lofty crypt and they carried it to the house in the laughing valley  the spirit of death was crouching very near to the bedside of claus and as the immortals approached she sprang up and motioned them back with an angry gesture  but when her eyes fell upon the mantle they bore she shrank away with a low moan of disappointment and quitted that house forever  softly and silently the immortal band dropped upon claus the precious mantle and it closed about him and sank into the outlines of his body and disappeared from view  it became a part of his being and neither mortal nor immortal might ever take it from him  then the kings and queens who had wrought this great deed dispersed to their various homes and all were well contented that they had added another immortal to their band  and claus slept on the red blood of everlasting life coursing swiftly through his veins and on his brow was a tiny drop of water that had fallen from the evermelting gown of the queen of the water sprites and over his lips hovered a tender kiss that had been left by the sweet nymph necile  for she had stolen in when the others were gone to gaze with rapture upon the immortal form of her foster son    2  when the world grew old  the next morning when santa claus opened his eyes and gazed around the familiar room which he had feared he might never see again he was astonished to find his old strength renewed and to feel the red blood of perfect health coursing through his veins  he sprang from his bed and stood where the bright sunshine came in through his window and flooded him with its merry dancing rays  he did not then understand what had happened to restore to him the vigor of youth but in spite of the fact that his beard remained the color of snow and that wrinkles still lingered in the corners of his bright eyes old santa claus felt as brisk and merry as a boy of sixteen and was soon whistling contentedly as he busied himself fashioning new toys  then ak came to him and told of the mantle of immortality and how claus had won it through his love for little children  it made old santa look grave for a moment to think he had been so favored but it also made him glad to realize that now he need never fear being parted from his dear ones  at once he began preparations for making a remarkable assortment of pretty and amusing playthings and in larger quantities than ever before for now that he might always devote himself to this work he decided that no child in the world poor or rich should hereafter go without a christmas gift if he could manage to supply it  the world was new in the days when dear old santa claus first began toymaking and won by his loving deeds the mantle of immortality and the task of supplying cheering words sympathy and pretty playthings to all the young of his race did not seem a difficult undertaking at all  but every year more and more children were born into the world and these when they grew up began spreading slowly over all the face of the earth seeking new homes so that santa claus found each year that his journeys must extend farther and farther from the laughing valley and that the packs of toys must be made larger and ever larger  so at length he took counsel with his fellow immortals how his work might keep pace with the increasing number of children that none might be neglected  and the immortals were so greatly interested in his labors that they gladly rendered him their assistance  ak gave him his man kilter the silent and swift  and the knook prince gave him peter who was more crooked and less surly than any of his brothers and the ryl prince gave him nuter the sweetest tempered ryl ever known  and the fairy queen gave him wisk that tiny mischievous but lovable fairy who knows today almost as many children as does santa claus himself  with these people to help make the toys and to keep his house in order and to look after the sledge and the harness santa claus found it much easier to prepare his yearly load of gifts and his days began to follow one another smoothly and pleasantly  yet after a few generations his worries were renewed for it was remarkable how the number of people continued to grow and how many more children there were every year to be served  when the people filled all the cities and lands of one country they wandered into another part of the world and the men cut down the trees in many of the great forests that had been ruled by ak and with the wood they built new cities and where the forests had been were fields of grain and herds of browsing cattle  you might think the master woodsman would rebel at the loss of his forests but not so  the wisdom of ak was mighty and farseeing  the world was made for men said he to santa claus and i have but guarded the forests until men needed them for their use  i am glad my strong trees can furnish shelter for mens weak bodies and warm them through the cold winters  but i hope they will not cut down all the trees for mankind needs the shelter of the woods in summer as much as the warmth of blazing logs in winter  and however crowded the world may grow i do not think men will ever come to burzee nor to the great black forest nor to the wooded wilderness of braz unless they seek their shades for pleasure and not to destroy their giant trees  by and by people made ships from the treetrunks and crossed over oceans and built cities in far lands but the oceans made little difference to the journeys of santa claus  his reindeer sped over the waters as swiftly as over land and his sledge headed from east to west and followed in the wake of the sun  so that as the earth rolled slowly over santa claus had all of twentyfour hours to encircle it each christmas eve and the speedy reindeer enjoyed these wonderful journeys more and more  so year after year and generation after generation and century after century the world grew older and the people became more numerous and the labors of santa claus steadily increased  the fame of his good deeds spread to every household where children dwelt  and all the little ones loved him dearly and the fathers and mothers honored him for the happiness he had given them when they too were young and the aged grandsires and granddames remembered him with tender gratitude and blessed his name    3  the deputies of santa claus  however there was one evil following in the path of civilization that caused santa claus a vast amount of trouble before he discovered a way to overcome it  but fortunately it was the last trial he was forced to undergo  one christmas eve when his reindeer had leaped to the top of a new building santa claus was surprised to find that the chimney had been built much smaller than usual  but he had no time to think about it just then so he drew in his breath and made himself as small as possible and slid down the chimney  i ought to be at the bottom by this time he thought as he continued to slip downward but no fireplace of any sort met his view and by and by he reached the very end of the chimney which was in the cellar  this is odd he reflected much puzzled by this experience  if there is no fireplace what on earth is the chimney good for  then he began to climb out again and found it hard workthe space being so small  and on his way up he noticed a thin round pipe sticking through the side of the chimney but could not guess what it was for  finally he reached the roof and said to the reindeer  there was no need of my going down that chimney for i could find no fireplace through which to enter the house  i fear the children who live there must go without playthings this christmas  then he drove on but soon came to another new house with a small chimney  this caused santa claus to shake his head doubtfully but he tried the chimney nevertheless and found it exactly like the other moreover he nearly stuck fast in the narrow flue and tore his jacket trying to get out again so although he came to several such chimneys that night he did not venture to descend any more of them  what in the world are people thinking of to build such useless chimneys he exclaimed  in all the years i have traveled with my reindeer i have never seen the like before  true enough but santa claus had not then discovered that stoves had been invented and were fast coming into use  when he did find it out he wondered how the builders of those houses could have so little consideration for him when they knew very well it was his custom to climb down chimneys and enter houses by way of the fireplaces  perhaps the men who built those houses had outgrown their own love for toys and were indifferent whether santa claus called on their children or not  whatever the explanation might be the poor children were forced to bear the burden of grief and disappointment  the following year santa claus found more and more of the newfashioned chimneys that had no fireplaces and the next year still more  the third year so numerous had the narrow chimneys become he even had a few toys left in his sledge that he was unable to give away because he could not get to the children  the matter had now become so serious that it worried the good man greatly and he decided to talk it over with kilter and peter and nuter and wisk  kilter already knew something about it for it had been his duty to run around to all the houses just before christmas and gather up the notes and letters to santa claus that the children had written telling what they wished put in their stockings or hung on their christmas trees  but kilter was a silent fellow and seldom spoke of what he saw in the cities and villages  the others were very indignant  those people act as if they do not wish their children to be made happy said sensible peter in a vexed tone  the idea of shutting out such a generous friend to their little ones  but it is my intention to make children happy whether their parents wish it or not returned santa claus  years ago when i first began making toys children were even more neglected by their parents than they are now so i have learned to pay no attention to thoughtless or selfish parents but to consider only the longings of childhood  you are right my master said nuter the ryl many children would lack a friend if you did not consider them and try to make them happy  then declared the laughing wisk we must abandon any thought of using these newfashioned chimneys but become burglars and break into the houses some other way  what way asked santa claus  why walls of brick and wood and plaster are nothing to fairies  i can easily pass through them whenever i wish and so can peter and nuter and kilter  is it not so comrades  i often pass through the walls when i gather up the letters said kilter and that was a long speech for him and so surprised peter and nuter that their big round eyes nearly popped out of their heads  therefore continued the fairy you may as well take us with you on your next journey and when we come to one of those houses with stoves instead of fireplaces we will distribute the toys to the children without the need of using a chimney  that seems to me a good plan replied santa claus well pleased at having solved the problem  we will try it next year  that was how the fairy the pixie the knook and the ryl all rode in the sledge with their master the following christmas eve and they had no trouble at all in entering the newfashioned houses and leaving toys for the children that lived in them  and their deft services not only relieved santa claus of much labor but enabled him to complete his own work more quickly than usual so that the merry party found themselves at home with an empty sledge a full hour before daybreak  the only drawback to the journey was that the mischievous wisk persisted in tickling the reindeer with a long feather to see them jump and santa claus found it necessary to watch him every minute and to tweak his long ears once or twice to make him behave himself  but taken all together the trip was a great success and to this day the four little folk always accompany santa claus on his yearly ride and help him in the distribution of his gifts  but the indifference of parents which had so annoyed the good saint did not continue very long and santa claus soon found they were really anxious he should visit their homes on christmas eve and leave presents for their children  so to lighten his task which was fast becoming very difficult indeed old santa decided to ask the parents to assist him  get your christmas trees all ready for my coming he said to them and then i shall be able to leave the presents without loss of time and you can put them on the trees when i am gone  and to others he said see that the childrens stockings are hung up in readiness for my coming and then i can fill them as quick as a wink  and often when parents were kind and goodnatured santa claus would simply fling down his package of gifts and leave the fathers and mothers to fill the stockings after he had darted away in his sledge  i will make all loving parents my deputies cried the jolly old fellow and they shall help me do my work  for in this way i shall save many precious minutes and few children need be neglected for lack of time to visit them  besides carrying around the big packs in his swiftflying sledge old santa began to send great heaps of toys to the toyshops so that if parents wanted larger supplies for their children they could easily get them and if any children were by chance missed by santa claus on his yearly rounds they could go to the toyshops and get enough to make them happy and contented  for the loving friend of the little ones decided that no child if he could help it should long for toys in vain  and the toyshops also proved convenient whenever a child fell ill and needed a new toy to amuse it and sometimes on birthdays the fathers and mothers go to the toyshops and get pretty gifts for their children in honor of the happy event  perhaps you will now understand how in spite of the bigness of the world santa claus is able to supply all the children with beautiful gifts  to be sure the old gentleman is rarely seen in these days but it is not because he tries to keep out of sight i assure you  santa claus is the same loving friend of children that in the old days used to play and romp with them by the hour and i know he would love to do the same now if he had the time  but you see he is so busy all the year making toys and so hurried on that one night when he visits our homes with his packs that he comes and goes among us like a flash and it is almost impossible to catch a glimpse of him  and although there are millions and millions more children in the world than there used to be santa claus has never been known to complain of their increasing numbers  the more the merrier he cries with his jolly laugh and the only difference to him is the fact that his little workmen have to make their busy fingers fly faster every year to satisfy the demands of so many little ones  in all this world there is nothing so beautiful as a happy child says good old santa claus and if he had his way the children would all be beautiful for all would be happy
