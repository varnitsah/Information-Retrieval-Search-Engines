page 376 was drawn by wl taylor the vignette was etched by charles h woodbury     introductory note   the publication of uncle toms cabin though much more than an incident in an authors career seems to have determined mrs stowe more surely in her purpose to devote herself to literature during the summer following its appearance she was in andover making over the house which she and her husband were to occupy upon leaving brunswick and yet busy as she was she was writing articles for the independent and the national era the following extract from a letter written at that time july 29 1852 intimates that she already was sketching the outline of the story which later grew into the pearl of orrs island  i seem to have so much to fill my time and yet there is my maine story waiting however i am composing it every day only i greatly need living studies for the filling in of my sketches there is old jonas my fish father a sturdy independent fisherman farmer who in his youth sailed all over the world and made up his mind about everything in his old age he attends prayermeetings and reads the missionary herald he also has plenty of money in an old brown seachest he is a great heart with an inflexible will and iron muscles i must go to orrs island and see him again the story seems to have remained in her mind for we are told by her son that she worked upon it by turns with the ministers wooing  it was not however until eight years later after the ministers wooing had been published and agnes of sorrento was well begun that she took up her old story in earnest and set about making it into a short serial it would seem that her first intention was to confine herself to a sketch of the childhood of her chief characters with a view to delineating the influences at work upon them but as she herself expressed it out of the simple history of the little pearl of orrs island as it had shaped itself in her mind rose up a captain kittridge with his garrulous yarns and misses roxy and ruey given to talk and a whole pigeon roost of yet undreamed of fancies and dreams which would insist on being written so it came about that the story as originally planned came to a stopping place at the end of chapter xvii as the reader may see when he reaches that place the childish life of her characters ended there and a lapse of ten years was assumed before their story was taken up again in the next chapter the book when published had no chapter headings these have been supplied in the present edition     the pearl of orrs island     chapter i  naomi   on the road to the kennebec below the town of bath in the state of maine might have been seen on a certain autumnal afternoon a onehorse wagon in which two persons were sitting one was an old man with the peculiarly hard but expressive physiognomy which characterizes the seafaring population of the new england shores a clear blue eye evidently practiced in habits of keen observation white hair bronzed weatherbeaten cheeks and a face deeply lined with the furrows of shrewd thought and anxious care were points of the portrait that made themselves felt at a glance  by his side sat a young woman of twoandtwenty of a marked and peculiar personal appearance her hair was black and smoothly parted on a broad forehead to which a pair of penciled dark eyebrows gave a striking and definite outline beneath lay a pair of large black eyes remarkable for tremulous expression of melancholy and timidity the cheek was white and bloodless as a snowberry though with the clear and perfect oval of good health the mouth was delicately formed with a certain sad quiet in its lines which indicated a habitually repressed and sensitive nature  the dress of this young person as often happens in new england was in refinement and even elegance a marked contrast to that of her male companion and to the humble vehicle in which she rode there was not only the most fastidious neatness but a delicacy in the choice of colors an indication of elegant tastes in the whole arrangement and the quietest suggestion in the world of an acquaintance with the usages of fashion which struck one oddly in those wild and dreary surroundings on the whole she impressed one like those fragile wildflowers which in april cast their fluttering shadows from the mossy crevices of the old new england granitean existence in which colorless delicacy is united to a sort of elastic hardihood of life fit for the rocky soil and harsh winds it is born to encounter  the scenery of the road along which the two were riding was wild and bare only savins and mulleins with their dark pyramids or white spires of velvet leaves diversified the sandy wayside but out at sea was a wide sweep of blue reaching far to the open ocean which lay rolling tossing and breaking into white caps of foam in the bright sunshine for two or three days a northeast storm had been raging and the sea was in all the commotion which such a general upturning creates  the two travelers reached a point of elevated land where they paused a moment and the man drew up the jogging stiffjointed old farmhorse and raised himself upon his feet to look out at the prospect  there might be seen in the distance the blue kennebec sweeping out toward the ocean through its picturesque rocky shores docked with cedars and other dusky evergreens which were illuminated by the orange and flamecolored trees of indian summer here and there scarlet creepers swung long trailing garlands over the faces of the dark rock and fringes of goldenrod above swayed with the brisk blowing wind that was driving the blue waters seaward in face of the upcoming ocean tidea conflict which caused them to rise in great foamcrested waves there are two channels into this river from the open sea navigable for ships which are coming in to the city of bath one is broad and shallow the other narrow and deep and these are divided by a steep ledge of rocks  where the spectators of this scene were sitting they could see in the distance a ship borne with tremendous force by the rising tide into the mouth of the river and encountering a northwest wind which had succeeded the gale as northwest winds often do on this coast the ship from what might be observed in the distance seemed struggling to make the wider channel but was constantly driven off by the baffling force of the wind  there she is naomi said the old fisherman eagerly to his companion coming right in the young woman was one of the sort that never start and never exclaim but with all deeper emotions grow still the color slowly mounted into her cheek her lips parted and her eyes dilated with a wide bright expression her breathing came in thick gasps but she said nothing  the old fisherman stood up in the wagon his coarse butternutcolored coatflaps fluttering and snapping in the breeze while his interest seemed to be so intense in the efforts of the ship that he made involuntary and eager movements as if to direct her course a moment passed and his keen practiced eye discovered a change in her movements for he cried out involuntarily  dont take the narrow channel today and a moment after o lord o lord have mercythere they go look look look  and in fact the ship rose on a great wave clear out of the water and the next second seemed to leap with a desperate plunge into the narrow passage for a moment there was a shivering of the masts and the rigging and she went down and was gone  theyre split to pieces cried the fisherman oh my poor girlmy poor girltheyre gone o lord have mercy  the woman lifted up no voice but as one who has been shot through the heart falls with no cry she fell backa mist rose up over her great mournful eyesshe had fainted  the story of this wreck of a homebound ship just entering the harbor is yet told in many a family on this coast a few hours after the unfortunate crew were washed ashore in all the joyous holiday rig in which they had attired themselves that morning to go to their sisters wives and mothers  this is the first scene in our story     chapter ii  mara   down near the end of orrs island facing the open ocean stands a brown house of the kind that the natives call leanto or linterone of those large comfortable structures barren in the ideal but rich in the practical which the workingman of new england can always command the waters of the ocean came up within a rod of this house and the sound of its moaning waves was even now filling the clear autumn starlight evidently something was going on within for candles fluttered and winked from window to window like fireflies in a dark meadow and sounds as of quick footsteps and the flutter of brushing garments might be heard  something unusual is certainly going on within the dwelling of zephaniah pennel tonight  let us enter the dark frontdoor we feel our way to the right where a solitary ray of light comes from the chink of a halfopened door here is the front room of the house set apart as its place of especial social hilarity and sanctitythe best room with its low studded walls white dimity windowcurtains rag carpet and polished wood chairs it is now lit by the dim gleam of a solitary tallow candle which seems in the gloom to make only a feeble circle of light around itself leaving all the rest of the apartment in shadow  in the centre of the room stretched upon a table and covered partially by a seacloak lies the body of a man of twentyfivelies too evidently as one of whom it is written he shall return to his house no more neither shall his place know him any more a splendid manhood has suddenly been called to forsake that lifeless form leaving it like a deserted palace beautiful in its desolation the hair dripping with the salt wave curled in glossy abundance on the finelyformed head the flat broad brow the closed eye with its long black lashes the firm manly mouth the stronglymoulded chinall all were sealed with that seal which is never to be broken till the great resurrection day  he was lying in a full suit of broadcloth with a white vest and smart blue necktie fastened with a pin in which was some braided hair under a crystal all his clothing as well as his hair was saturated with seawater which trickled from time to time and struck with a leaden and dropping sound into a sullen pool which lay under the table  this was the body of james lincoln shipmaster of the brig flying scud who that morning had dressed himself gayly in his stateroom to go on shore and meet his wifesinging and jesting as he did so  this is all that you have to learn in the room below but as we stand there we hear a trampling of feet in the apartment abovethe quick yet careful opening and shutting of doorsand voices come and go about the house and whisper consultations on the stairs now comes the roll of wheels and the doctors gig drives up to the door and as he goes creaking up with his heavy boots we will follow and gain admission to the dimlylighted chamber  two gossips are sitting in earnest whispering conversation over a small bundle done up in an old flannel petticoat to them the doctor is about to address himself cheerily but is repelled by sundry signs and sounds which warn him not to speak moderating his heavy boots as well as he is able to a pace of quiet he advances for a moment and the petticoat is unfolded for him to glance at its contents while a low eager whispered conversation attended with much headshaking warns him that his first duty is with somebody behind the checked curtains of a bed in the farther corner of the room he steps on tiptoe and draws the curtain and there with closed eye and cheek as white as wintry snow lies the same face over which passed the shadow of death when that illfated ship went down  this woman was wife to him who lies below and within the hour has been made mother to a frail little human existence which the storm of a great anguish has driven untimely on the shores of lifea precious pearl cast up from the past eternity upon the wet waveribbed sand of the present now weary with her moanings and beaten out with the wrench of a double anguish she lies with closed eyes in that passive apathy which precedes deeper shadows and longer rest  over against her on the other side of the bed sits an aged woman in an attitude of deep dejection and the old man we saw with her in the morning is standing with an anxious awestruck face at the foot of the bed  the doctor feels the pulse of the woman or rather lays an inquiring finger where the slightest thread of vital current is scarcely throbbing and shakes his head mournfully the touch of his hand rouses herher large wild melancholy eyes fix themselves on him with an inquiring glance then she shivers and moans  oh doctor doctorjamie jamie  come come said the doctor cheer up my girl youve got a fine little daughterthe lord mingles mercies with his afflictions  her eyes closed her head moved with a mournful but decided dissent  a moment after she spoke in the sad old words of the hebrew scripture  call her not naomi call her mara for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me  and as she spoke there passed over her face the sharp frost of the last winter but even as it passed there broke out a smile as if a flower had been thrown down from paradise and she said  not my will but thy will and so was gone  aunt roxy and aunt ruey were soon left alone in the chamber of death  shell make a beautiful corpse said aunt roxy surveying the still white form contemplatively with her head in an artistic attitude  she was a pretty girl said aunt ruey dear me what a providence i member the weddn down in that lower room and what a handsome couple they were  they were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their deaths they were not divided said aunt roxy sententiously  what was it she said did ye hear said aunt ruey  she called the baby mary  ah sure enough her mothers name afore her what a still softlyspoken thing she always was  a pity the poor baby didnt go with her said aunt roxy sevenmonths children are so hard to raise  tis a pity said the other  but babies will live and all the more when everybody says that it is a pity they should life goes on as inexorably in this world as death it was ordered by the will above that out of these two graves should spring one frail trembling autumn flowerthe mara whose poor little roots first struck deep in the salt bitter waters of our mortal life     chapter iii  the baptism and the burial   now i cannot think of anything more unlikely and uninteresting to make a story of than that old brown linter house of captain zephaniah pennel down on the south end of orrs island  zephaniah and mary pennel like zacharias and elizabeth are a pair of worthy godfearing people walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless but that is no great recommendation to a world gaping for sensation and calling for something stimulating this worthy couple never read anything but the bible the missionary herald and the christian mirrornever went anywhere except in the round of daily business he owned a fishingsmack in which he labored after the apostolic fashion and she washed and ironed and scrubbed and brewed and baked in her contented round week in and out the only recreation they ever enjoyed was the going once a week in good weather to a prayermeeting in a little old brown schoolhouse about a mile from their dwelling and making a weekly excursion every sunday in their fishing craft to the church opposite on harpswell neck  to be sure zephaniah had read many wide leaves of gods great book of nature for like most maine seacaptains he had been wherever ship can goto all usual and unusual ports his hard shrewd weatherbeaten visage had been seen looking over the railings of his brig in the port of genoa swept round by its splendid crescent of palaces and its snowcrested apennines it had looked out in the lagoons of venice at that wavy floor which in evening seems a sea of glass mingled with fire and out of which rise temples and palaces and churches and distant silvery alps like so many fabrics of dreamland he had been through the skagerrack and cattegatinto the baltic and away round to archangel and there chewed a bit of chip and considered and calculated what bargains it was best to make he had walked the streets of calcutta in his shirtsleeves with his best sunday vest backed with black glazed cambric which six months before came from the hands of miss roxy and was pronounced by her to be as good as any tailor could make and in all these places he was just zephaniah pennela chip of old mainethrifty careful shrewd honest godfearing and carrying an instinctive knowledge of men and things under a face of rustic simplicity  it was once returning from one of his voyages that he found his wife with a blackeyed curlyheaded little creature who called him papa and climbed on his knee nestled under his coat rifled his pockets and woke him every morning by pulling open his eyes with little fingers and jabbering unintelligible dialects in his ears  we will call this child naomi wife he said after consulting his old bible for that means pleasant and im sure i never see anything beat her for pleasantness i never knew as children was so engagin  it was to be remarked that zephaniah after this made shorter and shorter voyages being somehow conscious of a string around his heart which pulled him harder and harder till one sunday when the little naomi was five years old he said to his wife  i hope i aint apervertin scriptur nor nuthin but i cant help thinkin of one passage the kingdom of heaven is like a merchantman seeking goodly pearls and when he hath found one pearl of great price for joy thereof he goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that pearl well mary ive been and sold my brig last week he said folding his daughters little quiet head under his coat cause it seems to me the lords given us this pearl of great price and its enough for us i dont want to be rambling round the world after riches well have a little farm down on orrs island and ill have a little fishingsmack and well live and be happy together  and so mary who in those days was a pretty young married woman felt herself rich and happyno duchess richer or happier the two contentedly delved and toiled and the little naomi was their princess the wise men of the east at the feet of an infant offering gifts gold frankincense and myrrh is just a parable of what goes on in every house where there is a young child all the hard and the harsh and the common and the disagreeable is for the parentsall the bright and beautiful for their child  when the fishingsmack went to portland to sell mackerel there came home in zephaniahs fishy coat pocket strings of coral beads tiny gaiter boots brilliant silks and ribbons for the little fairy princesshis pearl of the island and sometimes when a stray party from the neighboring town of brunswick came down to explore the romantic scenery of the solitary island they would be startled by the apparition of this still graceful darkeyed child exquisitely dressed in the best and brightest that the shops of a neighboring city could affordsitting like some tropical bird on a lonely rock where the sea came dashing up into the edges of arbor vitæ or tripping along the wet sands for shells and seaweed  many children would have been spoiled by such unlimited indulgence but there are natures sent down into this harsh world so timorous and sensitive and helpless in themselves that the utmost stretch of indulgence and kindness is needed for their developmentlike plants which the warmest shelf of the greenhouse and the most careful watch of the gardener alone can bring into flower the pale child with her large lustrous dark eyes and sensitive organization was nursed and brooded into a beautiful womanhood and then found a protector in a highspirited manly young shipmaster and she became his wife  and now we see in the best roomthe walls lined with serious facesmen women and children that have come to pay the last tribute of sympathy to the living and the dead the house looked so utterly alone and solitary in that wild seagirt island that one would have as soon expected the seawaves to rise and walk in as so many neighbors but they had come from neighboring points crossing the glassy sea in their little crafts whose white sails looked like millers wings or walking miles from distant parts of the island  some writer calls a funeral one of the amusements of a new england population must we call it an amusement to go and see the acted despair of medea or the dying agonies of poor adrienne lecouvreur it is something of the same awful interest in lifes tragedy which makes an untaught and primitive people gather to a funerala tragedy where there is no actingand one which each one feels must come at some time to his own dwelling  be that as it may here was a roomful not only aunt roxy and aunt ruey who by a prescriptive right presided over all the births deaths and marriages of the neighborhood but there was captain kittridge a long dry weatherbeaten old seacaptain who sat as if tied in a double bowknot with his little fussy old wife with a great leghorn bonnet and eyes like black glass beads shining through in the bows of her horn spectacles and her hymnbook in her hand ready to lead the psalm there were aunts uncles cousins and brethren of the deceased and in the midst stood two coffins where the two united in death lay sleeping tenderly as those to whom rest is good all was still as death except a chance whisper from some busy neighbor or a creak of an old ladys great black fan or the fizz of a fly down the windowpane and then a stifled sound of deepdrawn breath and weeping from under a cloud of heavy black crape veils that were together in the group which countrypeople call the mourners  a gleam of autumn sunlight streamed through the white curtains and fell on a silver baptismal vase that stood on the mothers coffin as the minister rose and said the ordinance of baptism will now be administered a few moments more and on a baby brow had fallen a few drops of water and the little pilgrim of a new life had been called mara in the name of the father son and holy ghostthe minister slowly repeating thereafter those beautiful words of holy writ a father of the fatherless is god in his holy habitationas if the baptism of that bereaved one had been a solemn adoption into the infinite heart of the lord  with something of the quaint pathos which distinguishes the primitive and biblical people of that lonely shore the minister read the passage in ruth from which the name of the little stranger was drawn and which describes the return of the bereaved naomi to her native land his voice trembled and there were tears in many eyes as he read and it came to pass as she came to bethlehem all the city was moved about them and they said is this naomi and she said unto them call me not naomi call me mara for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me i went out full and the lord hath brought me home again empty why then call ye me naomi seeing the lord hath testified against me and the almighty hath afflicted me  deep heavy sobs from the mourners were for a few moments the only answer to these sad words till the minister raised the old funeral psalm of new england      why do we mourn departing friends       or shake at deaths alarms     tis but the voice that jesus sends       to call them to his arms      are we not tending upward too       as fast as time can move     and should we wish the hours more slow       that bear us to our love  the words rose in old chinathat strange wild warble whose quaintly blended harmonies might have been learned of moaning seas or wailing winds so strange and grand they rose full of that intense pathos which rises over every defect of execution and as they sung zephaniah pennel straightened his tall form before bowed on his hands and looked heavenward his cheeks wet with tears but something sublime and immortal shining upward through his blue eyes and at the last verse he came forward involuntarily and stood by his dead and his voice rose over all the others as he sung      then let the last loud trumpet sound       and bid the dead arise     awake ye nations under ground       ye saints ascend the skies  the sunbeam through the windowcurtain fell on his silver hair and they that looked beheld his face as it were the face of an angel he had gotten a sight of the city whose foundation is jasper and whose every gate is a separate pearl     chapter iv  aunt roxy and aunt ruey   the sea lay like an unbroken mirror all around the pinegirt lonely shores of orrs island tall kingly spruces wore their regal crowns of cones high in air sparkling with diamonds of clear exuded gum vast old hemlocks of primeval growth stood darkling in their forest shadows their branches hung with long hoary moss while feathery larches turned to brilliant gold by autumn frosts lighted up the darker shadows of the evergreens it was one of those hazy calm dissolving days of indian summer when everything is so quiet that the faintest kiss of the wave on the beach can be heard and white clouds seem to faint into the blue of the sky and soft swathing bands of violet vapor make all earth look dreamy and give to the sharp clearcut outlines of the northern landscape all those mysteries of light and shade which impart such tenderness to italian scenery  the funeral was over the tread of many feet bearing the heavy burden of two broken lives had been to the lonely graveyard and had come back againeach footstep lighter and more unconstrained as each one went his way from the great old tragedy of death to the common cheerful walks of life  the solemn black clock stood swaying with its eternal ticktock ticktock in the kitchen of the brown house on orrs island there was there that sense of a stillness that can be feltsuch as settles down on a dwelling when any of its inmates have passed through its doors for the last time to go whence they shall not return the best room was shut up and darkened with only so much light as could fall through a little heartshaped hole in the windowshutterfor except on solemn visits or prayer meetings or weddings or funerals that room formed no part of the daily family scenery  the kitchen was clean and ample with a great open fireplace and wide stone hearth and oven on one side and rows of oldfashioned splintbottomed chairs against the wall a table scoured to snowy whiteness and a little workstand whereon lay the bible the missionary herald and the weekly christian mirror before named formed the principal furniture one feature however must not be forgottena great seachest which had been the companion of zephaniah through all the countries of the earth old and battered and unsightly it looked yet report said that there was good store within of that which men for the most part respect more than anything else and indeed it proved often when a deed of grace was to be donewhen a woman was suddenly made a widow in a coast gale or a fishingsmack was run down in the fogs off the banks leaving in some neighboring cottage a family of orphansin all such cases the opening of this seachest was an event of good omen to the bereaved for zephaniah had a large heart and a large hand and was apt to take it out full of silver dollars when once it went in so the ark of the covenant could not have been looked on with more reverence than the neighbors usually showed to captain pennels seachest  the afternoon sun is shining in a square of light through the open kitchendoor whence one dreamily disposed might look far out to sea and behold ships coming and going in every variety of shape and size  but aunt roxy and aunt ruey who for the present were sole occupants of the premises were not people of the dreamy kind and consequently were not gazing off to sea but attending to very terrestrial matters that in all cases somebody must attend to the afternoon was warm and balmy but a few smouldering sticks were kept in the great chimney and thrust deep into the embers was a mongrel species of snubnosed teapot which fumed strongly of catniptea a little of which gracious beverage miss roxy was preparing in an oldfashioned cracked india china teacup tasting it as she did so with the air of a connoisseur  apparently this was for the benefit of a small something in long white clothes that lay face downward under a little blanket of very blue new flannel and which something aunt roxy when not otherwise engaged constantly patted with a gentle tattoo in tune to the steady trot of her knee all babies knew miss roxys tattoo on their backs and never thought of taking it in ill part on the contrary it had a vital and mesmeric effect of sovereign force against colic and all other disturbers of the nursery and never was infant known so pressed with those internal troubles which infants cry about as not speedily to give over and sink to slumber at this soothing appliance  at a little distance sat aunt ruey with a quantity of black crape strewed on two chairs about her very busily employed in getting up a mourningbonnet at which she snipped and clipped and worked zealously singing in a high cracked voice from time to time certain verses of a funeral psalm  miss roxy and miss ruey toothacre were two brisk old bodies of the feminine gender and singular number well known in all the region of harpswell neck and middle bay and such was their fame that it had even reached the town of brunswick eighteen miles away  they were of that class of females who might be denominated in the old testament language cunning womenthat is gifted with an infinite diversity of practical faculty which made them an essential requisite in every family for miles and miles around it was impossible to say what they could not do they could make dresses and make shirts and vests and pantaloons and cut out boys jackets and braid straw and bleach and trim bonnets and cook and wash and iron and mend could upholster and quilt could nurse all kinds of sicknesses and in default of a doctor who was often miles away were supposed to be infallible medical oracles many a human being had been ushered into life under their auspicestrotted chirruped in babyhood on their knees clothed by their handiwork in garments gradually enlarging from year to year watched by them in the last sickness and finally arrayed for the long repose by their hands  these universally useful persons receive among us the title of aunt by a sort of general consent showing the strong ties of relationship which bind them to the whole human family they are nobodys aunts in particular but aunts to human nature generally the idea of restricting their usefulness to any one family would strike dismay through a whole community nobody would be so unprincipled as to think of such a thing as having their services more than a week or two at most your country factotum knows better than anybody else how absurd it would be      to give to a part what was meant for mankind  nobody knew very well the ages of these useful sisters in that cold clear severe climate of the north the roots of human existence are hard to strike but if once people do take to living they come in time to a place where they seem never to grow any older but can always be found like last years mullein stalks upright dry and seedy warranted to last for any length of time  miss roxy toothacre who sits trotting the baby is a tall thin angular woman with sharp black eyes and hair once black but now well streaked with gray these ravages of time however were concealed by an ample mohair frisette of glossy blackness woven on each side into a heap of stiff little curls which pushed up her cap border in rather a bristling and decisive way in all her movements and personal habits even to her tone of voice and manner of speaking miss roxy was vigorous spicy and decided her mind on all subjects was made up and she spoke generally as one having authority and who should if she should not was she not a sort of priestess and sibyl in all the most awful straits and mysteries of life how many births and weddings and deaths had come and gone under her jurisdiction and amid weeping or rejoicing was not miss roxy still the masterspiritconsulted referred to by allwas not her word law and precedent her younger sister miss ruey a pliant cozy easytobeentreated personage plump and cushiony revolved around her as a humble satellite miss roxy looked on miss ruey as quite a frisky young thing though under her ample frisette of carroty hair her head might be seen white with the same snow that had powdered that of her sister aunt ruey had a face much resembling the kind of one you may see reader by looking at yourself in the convex side of a silver milkpitcher if you try the experiment this description will need no further amplification  the two almost always went together for the variety of talent comprised in their stock could always find employment in the varying wants of a family while one nursed the sick the other made clothes for the well and thus they were always chippering and chatting to each other like a pair of antiquated housesparrows retailing over harmless gossips and moralizing in that gentle jogtrot which befits serious old women in fact they had talked over everything in nature and said everything they could think of to each other so often that the opinions of one were as like those of the other as two sides of a peapod but as often happens in cases of the sort this was not because the two were in all respects exactly alike but because the stronger one had mesmerized the weaker into consent  miss roxy was the masterspirit of the two and like the great coining machine of a mint came down with her own sharp heavy stamp on every opinion her sister put out she was matteroffact positive and declarative to the highest degree while her sister was naturally inclined to the elegiac and the pathetic indulging herself in sentimental poetry and keeping a store thereof in her threadcase which she had cut from the christian mirror miss roxy sometimes in her brusque way popped out observations on life and things with a droll hard quaintness that took ones breath a little yet never failed to have a sharp crystallization of truthfrosty though it were she was one of those sensible practical creatures who tear every veil and lay their fingers on every spot in pure businesslike goodwill and if we shiver at them at times as at the first plunge of a cold bath we confess to an invigorating power in them after all  well now said miss roxy giving a decisive push to the teapot which buried it yet deeper in the embers aint it all a strange kind o providence that this ere little thing is left behind so and then their callin on her by such a strange mournful kind of namemara i thought sure as could be twas mary till the minister read the passage from scriptur seems to me its kind o odd id call it maria or id put an ann on to it maraann now wouldnt sound so strange  its a scriptur name sister said aunt ruey and that ought to be enough for us  well i dont know said aunt roxy now there was miss jones down on mure pint called her twins tiglathpileser and shalmaneserscriptur names both but i never liked em the boys used to call em tiggy and shally so no mortal could guess they was scriptur  well said aunt ruey drawing a sigh which caused her plump proportions to be agitated in gentle waves taint much matter after all what they call the little thing for taint tall likely its goin to livecried and worried all night and kep asuckin my cheek and my nightgown poor little thing this eres a baby that wont get along without its mother what mis pennels agoin to do with it when we is gone im sure i dont know it comes kind o hard on old people to be broke o their rest if its goin to be called home its a pity as i said it didnt go with its mother  and save the expense of another funeral said aunt roxy now when mis pennels sister asked her what she was going to do with naomis clothes i couldnt help wonderin when she said she should keep em for the child  she had a sight of things naomi did said aunt ruey nothin was never too much for her i dont believe that capn pennel ever went to bath or portland without havin it in his mind to bring naomi somethin  yes and she had a faculty of puttin of em on said miss roxy with a decisive shake of the head naomi was a still girl but her faculty was uncommon and i tell you ruey taint everybody hes faculty as hes things  the poor capn said miss ruey he seemed greatly supported at the funeral but hes dreadful broke down since i went into naomis room this morning and there the old man was asittin by her bed and he had a pair of her shoes in his handyou know what a leetle bit of a foot she had i never saw nothin look so kind o solitary as that poor old man did  well said miss roxy she was a masterhand for keepin things naomi was her drawers is just a sight shes got all the little presents and things they ever give her since she was a baby in one drawer theres a little pair of red shoes there that she had when she want moren five year old you member ruey the capn brought em over from portland when we was to the house amakin mis pennels figured black silk that he brought from calcutty you member they cost just five and sixpence but law the capn he never grudged the money when twas for naomi and so shes got all her husbands keepsakes and things just as nice as when he give em to her  its real affectin said miss ruey i cant all the while help athinkin of the psalm      so fades the lovely blooming flower     frail smiling solace of an hour     so quick our transient comforts fly     and pleasure only blooms to die  yes said miss roxy and ruey i was athinkin whether or no it want best to pack away them things cause naomi hadnt fixed no baby drawers and we seem to want some  i was kind o hintin that to mis pennel this morning said ruey but she cant seem to want to have em touched  well we may just as well come to such things first as last said aunt roxy cause if the lord takes our friends he does take em and we cant lose em and have em too and we may as well give right up at first and done with it that they are gone and weve got to do without em and not to be hangin on to keep things just as they was  so i was atellin mis pennel said miss ruey but shell come to it by and by i wish the baby might live and kind o grow up into her mothers place  well said miss roxy i wish it might but thered be a sight o trouble fetchin on it up folks can do pretty well with children when theyre young and spry if they do get em up nights but come to grandchildren its pretty tough  im athinkin sister said miss ruey taking off her spectacles and rubbing her nose thoughtfully whether or no cows milk aint goin to be too hearty for it its such a pindlin little thing now mis badger she brought up a sevenmonths child and she told me she gave it nothin but these ere little seed cookies wet in water and it throve nicelyand the seed is good for wind  oh dont tell me none of mis badgers stories said miss roxy i dont believe in em cows is the lords ordinances for bringing up babies thats lost their mothers it stands to reason they should beand babies that cant eat milk why they cant be fetched up but babies can eat milk and this un will if it lives and if it cant it wont live so saying miss roxy drummed away on the little back of the party in question authoritatively as if to pound in a wholesome conviction at the outset  i hope said miss ruey holding up a strip of black crape and looking through it from end to end so as to test its capabilities i hope the capn and mis pennelll get some support at the prayermeetin this afternoon  its the right place to go to said miss roxy with decision  mis pennel said this mornin that she was just beat out tryin to submit and the more she said thy will be done the more she didnt seem to feel it  thems common feelins among mourners ruey these ere forty years that ive been round nussin and layinout and tendin funerals ive watched peoples exercises peoples sometimes supported wonderfully just at the time and maybe at the funeral but the three or four weeks after most everybody if theys to say what they feel is unreconciled  the capn he dont say nothin said miss ruey  no he dont but he looks it in his eyes said miss roxy hes one of the kind o mourners as takes it deep that kind dont cry its a kind o dry deep pain thems the worst to get over itsometimes they just says nothin and in about six months they send for you to nuss em in consumption or somethin now mis pennel she can cry and she can talkwell shell get over it but he wont get no support unless the lord reaches right down and lifts him up over the world ive seen that happen sometimes and i tell you ruey that sort makes powerful christians  at that moment the old pair entered the door zephaniah pennel came and stood quietly by the pillow where the little form was laid and lifted a corner of the blanket the tiny head was turned to one side showing the soft warm cheek and the little hand was holding tightly a morsel of the flannel blanket he stood swallowing hard for a few moments at last he said with deep humility to the wise and mighty woman who held her ill tell you what it is miss roxy ill give all there is in my old chest yonder if youll only make herlive     chapter v  the kittridges   it did live the little life so frail so unprofitable in every mere material view so precious in the eyes of love expanded and flowered at last into fair childhood not without much watching and weariness many a night the old fisherman walked the floor with the little thing in his arms talking to it that jargon of tender nonsense which fairies bring as lovegifts to all who tend a cradle many a day the good little old grandmother called the aid of gossips about her trying various experiments of catnip and sweet fern and bayberry and other teas of rustic reputation for baby frailties  at the end of three years the two graves in the lonely graveyard were sodded and cemented down by smooth velvet turf and playing round the door of the brown houses was a slender child with ways and manners so still and singular as often to remind the neighbors that she was not like other childrena bud of hope and joybut the outcome of a great sorrowa pearl washed ashore by a mighty uprooting tempest they that looked at her remembered that her fathers eye had never beheld her and her baptismal cup had rested on her mothers coffin  she was small of stature beyond the wont of children of her age and moulded with a fine waxen delicacy that won admiration from all eyes her hair was curly and golden but her eyes were dark like her mothers and the lids drooped over them in that manner which gives a peculiar expression of dreamy wistfulness every one of us must remember eyes that have a strange peculiar expression of pathos and desire as if the spirit that looked out of them were pressed with vague remembrances of a past or but dimly comprehended the mystery of its present life even when the baby lay in its cradle and its dark inquiring eyes would follow now one object and now another the gossips would say the child was longing for something and miss roxy would still further venture to predict that that child always would long and never would know exactly what she was after  that dignitary sits at this minute enthroned in the kitchen corner looking majestically over the pressboard on her knee where she is pressing the next years sunday vest of zephaniah pennel as she makes her heavy tailors goose squeak on the work her eyes follow the little delicate fairy form which trips about the kitchen busily and silently arranging a little grotto of gold and silver shells and seaweed the child sings to herself as she works in a low chant like the prattle of a brook but ever and anon she rests her little arms on a chair and looks through the open kitchendoor far far off where the horizon line of the blue sea dissolves in the blue sky  see that child now roxy said miss ruey who sat stitching beside her do look at her eyes shes as handsome as a pictur but t aint an ordinary look she has neither she seems a contented little thing but what makes her eyes always look so kind o wishful  want her mother always alongin and alookin to sea and watchin the ships afore she was born said miss roxy and didnt her heart break afore she was born babies like that is marked always they dont know what ails em nor nobody  its her mother shes after said miss ruey  the lord only knows said miss roxy but them kind o children always seem homesick to go back where they come from theyre mostly grave and oldfashioned like this un if they gets past seven years why they live but its always in em to long they dont seem to be really unhappy neither but if anythings ever the matter with em it seems a great deal easier for em to die than to live some say its the mothers longin after em makes em feel so and some say its them longin after their mothers but dear knows ruey what anything is or what makes anything childrens mysterious thats my mind  mara dear said miss ruey interrupting the childs steady lookout what you thinking of  me want somefin said the little one  thats what shes always sayin said miss roxy  me want somebody to pay wis continued the little one  want somebody to play with said old dame pennel as she came in from the backroom with her hands yet floury with kneading bread sure enough she does our house stands in such a lonesome place and there aint any children but i never saw such a quiet little thingalways still and always busy  ill take her down with me to capn kittridges said miss roxy and let her play with their little girl shell chirk her up ill warrant shes a regular little witch sally is but shell chirk her up it aint good for children to be so still and oldfashioned children ought to be children sally takes to mara just cause shes so different  well now you may said dame pennel to be sure he cant bear her out of his sight a minute after he comes in but after all old folks cant be company for children  accordingly that afternoon the little mara was arrayed in a little blue flounced dress which stood out like a balloon made by miss roxy in firstrate style from a french fashionplate her golden hair was twined in manifold curls by dame pennel who restricted in her ideas of ornamentation spared nevertheless neither time nor money to enhance the charms of this single ornament to her dwelling mara was her picturegallery who gave her in the twentyfour hours as many murillos or greuzes as a lover of art could desire and as she tied over the childs golden curls a little flat hat and saw her go dancing off along the seasands holding to miss roxys bony finger she felt she had in her what galleries of pictures could not buy  it was a good mile to the one story gambrelroofed cottage where lived captain kittridgethe long lean brown man with his good wife of the great leghorn bonnet round black bead eyes and psalmbook whom we told you of at the funeral the captain too had followed the sea in his early life but being not as he expressed it very rugged in time changed his ship for a tight little cottage on the seashore and devoted himself to boatbuilding which he found sufficiently lucrative to furnish his brown cottage with all that his wifes heart desired besides extra money for knickknacks when she chose to go up to brunswick or over to portland to shop  the captain himself was a welcome guest at all the firesides round being a chatty body and disposed to make the most of his foreign experiences in which he took the usual advantages of a traveler in fact it was said whether slanderously or not that the captains yarns were spun to order and as when pressed to relate his foreign adventures he always responded with what would you like to hear it was thought that he fabricated his article to suit his market in short there was no species of experience finny fishy or aquaticno legend of strange and unaccountable incident of fire or floodno romance of foreign scenery and productions to which his tongue was not competent when he had once seated himself in a double bowknot at a neighbors evening fireside  his good wife a sharpeyed literal body and a vigorous churchmember felt some concern of conscience on the score of these narrations for being their constant auditor she better than any one else could perceive the variations and discrepancies of text which showed their mythical character and oftentimes her black eyes would snap and her knittingneedles rattle with an admonitory vigor as he went on and sometimes she would unmercifully come in at the end of a narrative with  well now the capns told them ar stories till he begins to blieve em himself i think  but works of fiction as we all know if only well gotten up have always their advantages in the hearts of listeners over plain homely truth and so captain kittridges yarns were marketable fireside commodities still despite the skepticisms which attended them  the afternoon sunbeams at this moment are painting the gambrelroof with a golden brown it is september again as it was three years ago when our story commenced and the sea and sky are purple and amethystine with its italian haziness of atmosphere  the brown house stands on a little knoll about a hundred yards from the open ocean behind it rises a ledge of rocks where cedars and hemlocks make deep shadows into which the sun shoots golden shafts of light illuminating the scarlet feathers of the sumach which throw themselves jauntily forth from the crevices while down below in deep damp mossy recesses rise ferns which autumn has just begun to tinge with yellow and brown the little knoll where the cottage stood had on its right hand a tiny bay where the ocean water made up amid picturesque rocksshaggy and solemn here trees of the primeval forest grand and lordly looked down silently into the waters which ebbed and flowed daily into this little pool every variety of those beautiful evergreens which feather the coast of maine and dip their wings in the very spray of its ocean foam found here a representative there were aspiring black spruces crowned on the very top with heavy coronets of cones there were balsamic firs whose young buds breathe the scent of strawberries there were cedars black as midnight clouds and white pines with their swaying plumage of needlelike leaves strewing the ground beneath with a golden fragrant matting and there were the gigantic widewinged hemlocks hundreds of years old and with long swaying gray beards of moss looking white and ghostly under the deep shadows of their boughs and beneath creeping round trunk and matting over stones were many and many of those wild beautiful things which embellish the shadows of these northern forests long feathery wreaths of what are called groundpines ran here and there in little ruffles of green and the princes pine raised its oriental feather with a mimic cone on the top as if it conceived itself to be a grownup tree whole patches of partridgeberry wove their evergreen matting dotted plentifully with brilliant scarlet berries here and there the rocks were covered with a curiously inwoven tapestry of moss overshot with the exquisite vine of the linnea borealis which in early spring rings its two fairy bells on the end of every spray while elsewhere the wrinkled leaves of the mayflower wove themselves through and through deep beds of moss meditating silently thoughts of the thousand little cups of pink shell which they had it in hand to make when the time of miracles should come round next spring  nothing in short could be more quaintly fresh wild and beautiful than the surroundings of this little cove which captain kittridge had thought fit to dedicate to his boatbuilding operationswhere he had set up his tarkettle between two great rocks above the highest tidemark and where at the present moment he had a boat upon the stocks  mrs kittridge at this hour was sitting in her clean kitchen very busily engaged in ripping up a silk dress which miss roxy had engaged to come and make into a new one and as she ripped she cast now and then an eye at the face of a tall black clock whose solemn ticktock was the only sound that could be heard in the kitchen  by her side on a low stool sat a vigorous healthy girl of six years whose employment evidently did not please her for her wellmarked black eyebrows were bent in a frown and her large black eyes looked surly and wrathful and one versed in childrens grievances could easily see what the matter wasshe was turning a sheet perhaps happy young female reader you dont know what that ismost likely not for in these degenerate days the strait and narrow ways of selfdenial formerly thought so wholesome for little feet are quite grassgrown with neglect childhood nowadays is unceasingly fêted and caressed the principal difficulty of the grown people seeming to be to discover what the little dears wanta thing not always clear to the little dears themselves but in old times turning sheets was thought a most especial and wholesome discipline for young girls in the first place because it took off the hands of their betters a very uninteresting and monotonous labor and in the second place because it was such a long straight unending turnpike that the youthful travelers once started thereupon could go on indefinitely without requiring guidance and direction of their elders for these reasons also the task was held in special detestation by children in direct proportion to their amount of life and their ingenuity and love of variety a dull child took it tolerably well but to a lively energetic one it was a perfect torture  i dont see the use of sewing up sheets one side and ripping up the other at last said sally breaking the monotonous ticktock of the clock by an observation which has probably occurred to every child in similar circumstances  sally kittridge if you say another word about that ar sheet ill whip you was the very explicit rejoinder and there was a snap of mrs kittridges black eyes that seemed to make it likely that she would keep her word it was answered by another snap from the sixyearold eyes as sally comforted herself with thinking that when she was a woman shed speak her mind out in pay for all this  at this moment a burst of silvery childlaughter rang out and there appeared in the doorway illuminated by the afternoon sunbeams the vision of miss roxys tall lank figure with the little goldenhaired bluerobed fairy hanging like a gay butterfly upon the tip of a thornbush sally dropped the sheet and clapped her hands unnoticed by her mother who rose to pay her respects to the cunning woman of the neighborhood  well now miss roxy i was mazin afraid you wernt acomin id just been an got my silk ripped up and didnt know how to get a step farther without you  well i was finishin up capn pennels best pantaloons said miss roxy and ive got em along so ruey can go on with em and i told mis pennel i must come to you if twas only for a day and i fetched the little girl down cause the little things so kind o lonesome like i thought sally could play with her and chirk her up a little  well sally said mrs kittridge stick in your needle fold up your sheet put your thimble in your workpocket and then you may take the little mara down to the cove to play but be sure you dont let her go near the tar nor wet her shoes dye hear  yes maam said sally who had sprung up in light and radiance like a translated creature at this unexpected turn of fortune and performed the welcome orders with a celerity which showed how agreeable they were and then stooping and catching the little one in her arms disappeared through the door with the golden curls fluttering over her own crowblack hair  the fact was that sally at that moment was as happy as human creature could be with a keenness of happiness that children who have never been made to turn sheets of a bright afternoon can never realize the sun was yet an hour high as she saw by the flash of her shrewd timekeeping eye and she could bear her little prize down to the cove and collect unknown quantities of gold and silver shells and starfish and saladdish shells and white pebbles for her besides quantities of well turned shavings brown and white from the pile which constantly was falling under her fathers joiners bench and with which she would make long extemporaneous tresses so that they might play at being mermaids like those that she had heard her father tell about in some of his seastories  now railly sally what you got there said captain kittridge as he stood in his shirtsleeves peering over his joiners bench to watch the little one whom sally had dumped down into a nest of clean white shavings wal wal i should think youd astolen the big doll i see in a shopwindow the last time i was to portland so this is pennels little girlpoor child  yes father and we want some nice shavings  stay a bit ill make ye a few apurpose said the old man reaching his long bony arm with the greatest ease to the farther part of his bench and bringing up a board from which he proceeded to roll off shavings in fine satin rings which perfectly delighted the hearts of the children and made them dance with glee and truth to say reader there are coarser and homelier things in the world than a well turned shaving  there go now he said when both of them stood with both hands full go now and play and mind you dont let the baby wet her feet sally them shoes o hern must have cost fiveandsixpence at the very least  that sunny hour before sundown seemed as long to sally as the whole seam of the sheet for childhoods joys are all pure gold and as she ran up and down the white sands shouting at every shell she found or darted up into the overhanging forest for checkerberries and groundpine all the sorrows of the morning came no more into her remembrance  the little mara had one of those sensitive excitable natures on which every external influence acts with immediate power stimulated by the society of her energetic buoyant little neighbor she no longer seemed wishful or pensive but kindled into a perfect flame of wild delight and gamboled about the shore like a blue and goldwinged fly while her bursts of laughter made the squirrels and blue jays look out inquisitively from their fastnesses in the old evergreens gradually the sunbeams faded from the pines and the waves of the tide in the little cove came in solemnly tinted with purple flaked with orange and crimson borne in from a great rippling sea of fire into which the sun had just sunk  mercy on usthem children said miss roxy  hes bringin em along said mrs kittridge as she looked out of the window and saw the tall lank form of the captain with one child seated on either shoulder and holding on by his head  the two children were both in the highest state of excitement but never was there a more marked contrast of nature the one seemed a perfect type of welldeveloped childish health and vigor good solid flesh and bones with glowing skin brilliant eyes shining teeth wellknit supple limbsvigorously and healthily beautiful while the other appeared one of those aerial mixtures of cloud and fire whose radiance seems scarcely earthly a physiologist looking at the child would shake his head seeing one of those perilous organizations all nerve and brain which come to life under the clear stimulating skies of america and burning with the intensity of lighted phosphorus waste themselves too early  the little mara seemed like a fairy sprite possessed with a wild spirit of glee she laughed and clapped her hands incessantly and when set down on the kitchenfloor spun round like a little elf and that night it was late and long before her wide wakeful eyes could be veiled in sleep  company jist sets this ere child crazy said miss roxy its jist her lonely way of livin a pity mis pennel hadnt another child to keep company along with her  mis pennel oughter be trainin of her up to work said mrs kittridge sally could oversew and hem when she want moren three years old nothin straightens out children like work mis pennel she just keeps that ar child to look at  all children aint alike mis kittridge said miss roxy sententiously this un aint like your sally a hen and a bumblebee cant be fetched up alike fix it how you will     chapter vi  grandparents   zephaniah pennel came back to his house in the evening after miss roxy had taken the little mara away he looked for the flowery face and golden hair as he came towards the door and put his hand in his vestpocket where he had deposited a small store of very choice shells and sea curiosities thinking of the widening of those dark soft eyes when he should present them  wheres mara was the first inquiry after he had crossed the threshold  why roxys been an taken her down to capn kittridges to spend the night said miss ruey roxys gone to help mis kittridge to turn her spotted gray and black silk we was talking this mornin whether no t would turn cause i thought the spot was overshot and wouldnt make up on the wrong side but roxy she says its one of them ar calcutty silks that has two sides to em like the one you bought miss pennel that we made up for her you know and miss ruey arose and gave a finishing snap to the sunday pantaloons which she had been left to finish offwhich snap said as plainly as words could say that there was a good job disposed of  zephaniah stood looking as helpless as animals of the male kind generally do when appealed to with such prolixity on feminine details in reply to it all only he asked meekly  wheres mary  mis pennel why shes up chamber shell be down in a minute she said she thought shed have time afore supper to get to the bottom of the big chist and see if that ere vest pattern aint there and them sticks o twist for the buttonholes cause roxy she says she never see nothin so rotten as that ere twist weve been aworkin with that mis pennel got over to portland its a clear cheat and mis pennel she give moren half a cent a stick more for t than what roxy got for her up to brunswick so you see these ere portland stores charge up and their things want lookin after  here mrs pennel entered the room the captain addressing her eagerly  how came you to let aunt roxy take mara off so far and be gone so long  why law me captain pennel the little thing seems kind o lonesome chilen want chilen miss roxy says shes altogether too sort o still and oldfashioned and must have childs company to chirk her up and so she took her down to play with sally kittridge theres no manner of danger or harm in it and shell be back tomorrow afternoon and mara will have a real good time  wal now really said the good man but its mazin lonesome  capn pennel youre gettin to make an idol of that ere child said miss ruey we have to watch our hearts it minds me of the hymn      the fondness of a creatures love       how strong it strikes the sense     thither the warm affections move       nor can we call them hence  miss rueys mode of getting off poetry in a sort of highpitched canter with a strong thump on every accented syllable might have provoked a smile in more sophisticated society but zephaniah listened to her with deep gravity and answered  im fraid theres truth in what you say aunt ruey when her mother was called away i thought that was a warning i never should forget but now i seem to be like jonahim restin in the shadow of my gourd and my heart is glad because of it i kind o trembled at the prayer meetin when we was asingin      the dearest idol i have known       whateer that idol be     help me to tear it from thy throne       and worship only thee  yes said miss ruey roxy says if the lord should take us up short on our prayers it would make sad work with us sometimes  somehow said mrs pennel it seems to me just her mother over again she dont look like her i think her hair and complexion comes from the badger blood my mother had that sort o hair and skinbut then she has ways like naomiand it seems as if the lord had kind o given naomi back to us so i hope shes goin to be spared to us  mrs pennel had one of those naturesgentle trustful and hopeful because not very deep she was one of the little children of the world whose faith rests on childlike ignorance and who know not the deeper needs of deeper natures such see only the sunshine and forget the storm  this conversation had been going on to the accompaniment of a clatter of plates and spoons and dishes and the fizzling of sausages prefacing the evening meal to which all now sat down after a lengthened grace from zephaniah  theres a tremendous gale abrewin he said as they sat at table i noticed the clouds tonight as i was comin home and somehow i felt kind o as if i wanted all our folks snug indoors  why law husband capn kittridges house is as good as ours if it does blow you never can seem to remember that houses dont run aground or strike on rocks in storms  the capn puts me in mind of old capn jeduth scranton said miss ruey that built that queer house down by middle bay the capn he would insist on havin ont jist like a ship and the closetshelves had holes for the tumblers and dishes and he had all his tables and chairs battened down and so when it came a gale they say the old capn used to sit in his chair and hold on to hear the wind blow  well i tell you said captain those that has followed the seas hears the wind with different ears from landspeople when you lie with only a plank between you and eternity and hear the voice of the lord on the waters it dont sound as it does on shore  and in truth as they were speaking a fitful gust swept by the house wailing and screaming and rattling the windows and after it came the heavy hollow moan of the surf on the beach like the wild angry howl of some savage animal just beginning to be lashed into fury  sure enough the wind is rising said miss ruey getting up from the table and flattening her snub nose against the windowpane dear me how dark it is mercy on us how the waves come inall of a sheet of foam i pity the ships thats comin on coast such a night  the storm seemed to have burst out with a sudden fury as if myriads of howling demons had all at once been loosened in the air now they piped and whistled with eldritch screech round the corners of the housenow they thundered down the chimneyand now they shook the door and rattled the casementand anon mustering their forces with wild ado seemed to career over the house and sail high up into the murky air the dash of the rising tide came with successive crash upon crash like the discharge of heavy artillery seeming to shake the very house and the spray borne by the wind dashed whizzing against the windowpanes  zephaniah rising from supper drew up the little stand that had the family bible on it and the three old timeworn people sat themselves as seriously down to evening worship as if they had been an extensive congregation they raised the old psalmtune which our fathers called complaint and the cracked wavering voices of the women with the deep rough bass of the old seacaptain rose in the uproar of the storm with a ghostly strange wildness like the scream of the curlew or the wailing of the wind      spare us o lord aloud we pray       nor let our sun go down at noon     thy years are an eternal day       and must thy children die so soon  miss ruey valued herself on singing a certain weird and exalted part which in ancient days used to be called counter and which wailed and gyrated in unimaginable heights of the scale much as you may hear a shrill finevoiced wind over a chimneytop but altogether the deep and earnest gravity with which the three filled up the pauses in the storm with their quaint minor key had something singularly impressive when the singing was over zephaniah read to the accompaniment of wind and sea the words of poetry made on old hebrew shores in the dim gray dawn of the world  the voice of the lord is upon the waters the god of glory thundereth the lord is upon many waters the voice of the lord shaketh the wilderness the lord shaketh the wilderness of kadesh the lord sitteth upon the floods yea the lord sitteth king forever the lord will give strength to his people yea the lord will bless his people with peace  how natural and homeborn sounded this old piece of oriental poetry in the ears of the three the wilderness of kadesh with its great cedars was doubtless orrs island where even now the goodly fellowship of blackwinged trees were groaning and swaying and creaking as the breath of the lord passed over them  and the three old people kneeling by their smouldering fireside amid the general uproar zephaniah began in the words of a prayer which moses the man of god made long ago under the shadows of egyptian pyramids lord thou hast been our dwellingplace in all generations before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting thou art god  we hear sometimes in these days that the bible is no more inspired of god than many other books of historic and poetic merit it is a fact however that the bible answers a strange and wholly exceptional purpose by thousands of firesides on all shores of the earth and till some other book can be found to do the same thing it will not be surprising if a belief of its divine origin be one of the ineffaceable ideas of the popular mind it will be a long while before a translation from homer or a chapter in the koran or any of the beauties of shakespeare will be read in a stormy night on orrs island with the same sense of a divine presence as the psalms of david or the prayer of moses the man of god  boom boom whats that said zephaniah starting as they rose up from prayer hark again thats a guntheres a ship in distress  poor souls said miss ruey its an awful night  the captain began to put on his seacoat  you aint agoin out said his wife  i must go out along the beach a spell and see if i can hear any more of that ship  mercy on us the windll blow you over said aunt ruey  i rayther think ive stood wind before in my day said zephaniah a grim smile stealing over his weatherbeaten cheeks in fact the man felt a sort of secret relationship to the storm as if it were in some manner a family connectiona wild roystering cousin who drew him out by a rough attraction of comradeship  well at any rate said mrs pennel producing a large tin lantern perforated with many holes in which she placed a tallow candle take this with you and dont stay out long  the kitchen door opened and the first gust of wind took off the old mans hat and nearly blew him prostrate he came back and shut the door i ought to have known better he said knotting his pockethandkerchief over his head after which he waited for a momentary lull and went out into the storm  miss ruey looked through the windowpane and saw the light go twinkling far down into the gloom and ever and anon came the mournful boom of distant guns  certainly there is a ship in trouble somewhere she said  he never can be easy when he hears these guns said mrs pennel but what can he do or anybody in such a storm the wind blowing right on to shore  i shouldnt wonder if capn kittridge should be out on the beach too said miss ruey but laws he aint much more than one of these ere old grasshoppers you see after frost comes well any way there aint much help in man if a ship comes ashore in such a gale as this such a dark night too  its kind o lonesome to have poor little mara away such a night as this is said mrs pennel but who would athought it this afternoon when aunt roxy took her  i member my grandmother had a silver creampitcher that come ashore in a storm on mare pint said miss ruey as she sat trotting her knittingneedles grandther found it half full of sand under a knot of seaweed way up on the beach it had a coat of arms on itmight have belonged to some grand family that pitcher in the toothacre family yet  i remember when i was a girl said mrs pennel seeing the hull of a ship that went on eagle island it run way up in a sort of gully between two rocks and lay there years they split pieces off it sometimes to make fires when they wanted to make a chowder down on the beach  my aunt lois toothacre that lives down by middle bay said miss ruey used to tell about a dreadful blow they had once in time of the equinoctial storm and what was remarkable she insisted that she heard a baby cryin out in the stormshe heard it just as plain as could be  laws amercy said mrs pennel nervously it was nothing but the windit always screeches like a child crying or maybe it was the seals seals will cry just like babes  so they told her but noshe insisted she knew the differenceit was a baby well what do you think when the storm cleared off they found a babys cradle washed ashore sure enough  but they didnt find any baby said mrs pennel nervously  no they searched the beach far and near and that cradle was all they found aunt lois took it init was a very good cradle and she took it to use but every time there came up a gale that ar cradle would rock rock jist as if somebody was asittin by it and you could stand across the room and see there want nobody there  you make me all of a shiver said mrs pennel  this of course was just what miss ruey intended and she went on  wal you see they kind o got used to it they found there want no harm come of its rockin and so they didnt mind but aunt lois had a sister cerinthy that was a weakly girl and had the janders cerinthy was one of the sort thats born with veils over their faces and can see sperits and one time cerinthy was avisitin lois after her second baby was born and there came up a blow and cerinthy comes out of the keepinroom where the cradle was astandin and says sister says she whos that woman sittin rockin the cradle and aunt lois says she why there aint nobody that ar cradle always will rock in a gale but ive got used to it and dont mind it well says cerinthy jist as true as you live i just saw a woman with a silk gown on and long black hair ahangin down and her face was pale as a sheet sittin rockin that ar cradle and she looked round at me with her great black eyes kind o mournful and wishful and then she stooped down over the cradle well says lois i aint goin to have no such doins in my house and she went right in and took up the baby and the very next day she jist had the cradle split up for kindlin and that night if youll believe when they was aburnin of it they heard jist as plain as could be a baby scream scream screamin round the house but after that they never heard it no more  i dont like such stories said dame pennel specially tonight when maras away i shall get to hearing all sorts of noises in the wind i wonder when capn pennel will be back  and the good woman put more wood on the fire and as the tongues of flame streamed up high and clear she approached her face to the windowpane and started back with half a scream as a pale anxious visage with sad dark eyes seemed to approach her it took a moment or two for her to discover that she had seen only the reflection of her own anxious excited face the pitchy blackness without having converted the window into a sort of dark mirror  miss ruey meanwhile began solacing herself by singing in her chimneycorner a very favorite sacred melody which contrasted oddly enough with the driving storm and howling sea      haste my beloved haste away     cut short the hours of thy delay     fly like the bounding hart or roe     over the hills where spices grow  the tune was called invitationone of those profusely florid in runs and trills and quavers which delighted the ears of a former generation and miss ruey innocently unconscious of the effect of old age on her voice ran them up and down and out and in in a way that would have made a laugh had there been anybody there to notice or to laugh  i remember singin that ar to mary jane wilson the very night she died said aunt ruey stopping she wanted me to sing to her and it was jist between two and three in the mornin there was jist the least red streak of daylight and i opened the window and sat there and sung and when i come to over the hills where spices grow i looked round and there was a change in mary jane and i went to the bed and says she very bright aunt ruey the beloved has come and she was gone afore i could raise her up on her pillow i always think of mary jane at them words if ever there was a brokenhearted crittur took home it was her  at this moment mrs pennel caught sight through the window of the gleam of the returning lantern and in a moment captain pennel entered dripping with rain and spray  why capn youre een amost drowned said aunt ruey  how long have you been gone you must have been a great ways said mrs pennel  yes i have been down to capn kittridges i met kittridge out on the beach we heard the guns plain enough but couldnt see anything i went on down to kittridges to get a look at little mara  well shes all well enough said mrs pennel anxiously  oh yes well enough miss roxy showed her to me in the trundlebed long with sally the little thing was lying smiling in her sleep with her cheek right up against sallys i took comfort looking at her i couldnt help thinking so he giveth his beloved sleep     chapter vii  from the sea   during the night and storm the little mara had lain sleeping as quietly as if the cruel sea that had made her an orphan from her birth were her kindtempered old grandfather singing her to sleep as he often didwith a somewhat hoarse voice truly but with ever an undertone of protecting love but toward daybreak there came very clear and bright into her childish mind a dream having that vivid distinctness which often characterizes the dreams of early childhood  she thought she saw before her the little cove where she and sally had been playing the day before with its broad sparkling white beach of sand curving round its blue seamirror and studded thickly with gold and silver shells she saw the boat of captain kittridge upon the stocks and his tarkettle with the smouldering fires flickering under it but as often happens in dreams a certain rainbow vividness and clearness invested everything and she and sally were jumping for joy at the beautiful things they found on the beach  suddenly there stood before them a woman dressed in a long white garment she was very pale with sweet serious dark eyes and she led by the hand a blackeyed boy who seemed to be crying and looking about as for something lost she dreamed that she stood still and the woman came toward her looking at her with sweet sad eyes till the child seemed to feel them in every fibre of her frame the woman laid her hand on her head as if in blessing and then put the boys hand in hers and said take him mara he is a playmate for you and with that the little boys face flashed out into a merry laugh the woman faded away and the three children remained playing together gathering shells and pebbles of a wonderful brightness so vivid was this vision that the little one awoke laughing with pleasure and searched under her pillows for the strange and beautiful things that she had been gathering in dreamland  whats mara looking after said sally sitting up in her trundlebed and speaking in the patronizing motherly tone she commonly used to her little playmate  all gone pitty boyall gone said the child looking round regretfully and shaking her golden head pitty lady all gone  how queer she talks said sally who had awakened with the project of building a sheethouse with her fairy neighbor and was beginning to loosen the upper sheet and dispose the pillows with a view to this species of architecture come mara lets make a pretty house she said  pitty boy out dereout dere said the little one pointing to the window with a deeper expression than ever of wishfulness in her eyes  come sally kittridge get up this minute said the voice of her mother entering the door at this moment and here put these clothes on to mara the child mustnt run round in her best its strange now mary pennel never thinks of such things  sally who was of an efficient temperament was preparing energetically to second these commands of her mother and endue her little neighbor with a coarse brown stuff dress somewhat faded and patched which she herself had outgrown when of maras age with shoes which had been coarsely made to begin with and very much battered by time but quite to her surprise the child generally so passive and tractable opposed a most unexpected and desperate resistance to this operation she began to cry and to sob and shake her curly head throwing her tiny hands out in a wild species of freakish opposition which had notwithstanding a quaint and singular grace about it while she stated her objections in all the little english at her command  mara dont wantmara want pitty boo desand pitty shoes  why was ever anything like it said mrs kittridge to miss roxy as they both were drawn to the door by the outcry heres this child wont have decent everyday clothes put on hershe must be kept dressed up like a princess now that ars french calico said mrs kittridge holding up the controverted blue dress and that ar never cost a cent under fiveandsixpence a yard it takes a yard and a half to make it and it must have been a good days work to make it up call that threeandsixpence more and with them pearl buttons and thread and all that ar dress never cost less than a dollar and seventyfive and here shes goin to run out every day in it  well well said miss roxy who had taken the sobbing fair one in her lap you know mis kittridge this eres a kind o pet lamb an oldfolks darling and things be with her as they be and we cant make her over and shes such a nervous little thing we mustnt cross her saying which she proceeded to dress the child in her own clothes  if you had a good large checked apron i wouldnt mind putting that on her added miss roxy after she had arrayed the child  heres one said mrs kittridge that may save her clothes some  miss roxy began to put on the wholesome garment but rather to her mortification the little fairy began to weep again in a most heartbroken manner  dont want chet apon  why dont mara want nice checked apron said miss roxy in that extra cheerful tone by which children are to be made to believe they have mistaken their own mind  dont want it with a decided wave of the little hand is too pitty to wear chet apon  well well said mrs kittridge rolling up her eyes did i ever no i never did if there aint depraved natur acomin out early well if she says shes pretty now whatll it be when shes fifteen  shell learn to tell a lie about it by that time said miss roxy and say she thinks shes horrid the child is pretty and the truth comes uppermost with her now  haw haw haw burst with a great crash from captain kittridge who had come in behind and stood silently listening during this conversation thats musical now come here my little maid you are too pretty for checked aprons and no mistake and seizing the child in his long arms he tossed her up like a butterfly while her sunny curls shone in the morning light  theres one comfort about the child miss kittridge said aunt roxy shes one of them that dirt wont stick to i never knew her to stain or tear her clothesshe always come in jist so nice  she aint much like sally then said mrs kittridge that girlll run through more clothes only last week she walked the crown out of my old black straw bonnet and left it hanging on the top of a blackberrybush  wal wal said captain kittridge as to dressin this ere childwhy ef pennels a mind to dress her in cloth of gold its none of our business hes rich enough for all he wants to do and so lets eat our breakfast and mind our own business  after breakfast captain kittridge took the two children down to the cove to investigate the state of his boat and tarkettle set high above the highest tidemark the sun had risen gloriously the sky was of an intense vivid blue and only great snowy islands of clouds lying in silver banks on the horizon showed vestiges of last nights storm the whole wide sea was one glorious scene of forming and dissolving mountains of blue and purple breaking at the crest into brilliant silver all round the island the waves were constantly leaping and springing into jets and columns of brilliant foam throwing themselves high up in silvery cataracts into the very arms of the solemn evergreen forests which overhung the shore  the sands of the little cove seemed harder and whiter than ever and were thickly bestrewn with the shells and seaweed which the upturnings of the night had brought in there lay what might have been fringes and fragments of seagods vesturesblue crimson purple and orange seaweeds wreathed in tangled ropes of kelp and seagrass or lying separately scattered on the sands the children ran wildly shouting as they began gathering seatreasures and sally with the air of an experienced hand in the business untwisted the coils of rosy seaweed from which every moment she disengaged some new treasure in some rarer shell or smoother pebble  suddenly the child shook out something from a knotted mass of seagrass which she held up with a perfect shriek of delight it was a bracelet of hair fastened by a brilliant clasp of green sparkling stones such as she had never seen before she redoubled her cries of delight as she saw it sparkle between her and the sun calling upon her father  father father do come here and see what ive found  he came quickly and took the bracelet from the childs hand but at the same moment looking over her head he caught sight of an object partially concealed behind a projecting rock he took a step forward and uttered an exclamation  well well sure enough poor things  there lay bedded in sand and seaweed a woman with a little boy clasped in her arms both had been carefully lashed to a spar but the child was held to the bosom of the woman with a pressure closer than any knot that mortal hands could tie both were deep sunk in the sand into which had streamed the womans long dark hair which sparkled with glittering morsels of sand and pebbles and with those tiny brilliant yellow shells which are so numerous on that shore  the woman was both young and beautiful the forehead damp with oceanspray was like sculptured marblethe eyebrows dark and decided in their outline but the long heavy black fringes had shut down as a solemn curtain over all the history of mortal joy or sorrow that those eyes had looked upon a weddingring gleamed on the marble hand but the sea had divorced all human ties and taken her as a bride to itself and in truth it seemed to have made to her a worthy bed for she was all folded and inwreathed in sand and shells and seaweeds and a great weirdlooking leaf of kelp some yards in length lay twined around her like a shroud the child that lay in her bosom had hair and face and eyelashes like her own and his little hands were holding tightly a portion of the black dress which she wore  coldcoldstone dead was the muttered exclamation of the old seaman as he bent over the woman  she must have struck her head there he mused as he laid his finger on a dark bruised spot on her temple he laid his hand on the childs heart and put one finger under the arm to see if there was any lingering vital heat and then hastily cut the lashings that bound the pair to the spar and with difficulty disengaged the child from the cold clasp in which dying love had bound him to a heart which should beat no more with mortal joy or sorrow  sally after the first moment had run screaming toward the house with all a childs forward eagerness to be the bearer of news but the little mara stood looking anxiously with a wishful earnestness of face  pitty boypitty boycome she said often but the old man was so busy he scarcely regarded her  now capn kittridge do tell said miss roxy meeting him in all haste with a capborder stiff in air while dame kittridge exclaimed  now you dont well well didnt i say that was a ship last night and what a solemnizing thought it was that souls might be goin into eternity  we must have blankets and hot bottles right away said miss roxy who always took the earthly view of matters and who was in her own person a personified humane society miss kittridge you jist dip out your dishwater into the smallest tub and well put him in stand away mara sally you take her out of the way well fetch this child to perhaps ive fetched em to when theys seemed to be dead as doornails  capn kittridge youre sure the womans dead  laws yes she had a blow right on her temple here theres no bringing her to till the resurrection  well then you jist go and get capn pennel to come down and help you and get the body into the house and well attend to layin it out by and by tell ruey to come down  aunt roxy issued her orders with all the military vigor and precision of a general in case of a sudden attack it was her habit sickness and death were her opportunities where they were she felt herself at home and she addressed herself to the task before her with undoubting faith  before many hours a pair of large dark eyes slowly emerged from under the blackfringed lids of the little drowned boythey rolled dreamily round for a moment and dropped again in heavy languor  the little mara had with the quiet persistence which formed a trait in her baby character dragged stools and chairs to the back of the bed which she at last succeeded in scaling and sat opposite to where the child lay grave and still watching with intense earnestness the process that was going on at the moment when the eyes had opened she stretched forth her little arms and said eagerly pitty boy comeand then as they closed again she dropped her hands with a sigh of disappointment yet before night the little stranger sat up in bed and laughed with pleasure at the treasures of shells and pebbles which the children spread out on the bed before him  he was a vigorous wellmade handsome child with brilliant eyes and teeth but the few words that he spoke were in a language unknown to most present captain kittridge declared it to be spanish and that a call which he most passionately and often repeated was for his mother but he was of that happy age when sorrow can be easily effaced and the efforts of the children called forth joyous smiles when his playthings did not go to his liking he showed sparkles of a fiery irascible spirit  the little mara seemed to appropriate him in feminine fashion as a chosen idol and graven image she gave him at once all her slender stock of infantine treasures and seemed to watch with an ecstatic devotion his every movementoften repeating as she looked delightedly around pitty boy come  she had no words to explain the strange dream of the morning it lay in her struggling for expression and giving her an interest in the newcomer as in something belonging to herself whence it camewhence come multitudes like it which spring up as strange enchanted flowers every now and then in the dull material pathway of lifewho knows it may be that our present faculties have among them a rudimentary one like the germs of wings in the chrysalis by which the spiritual world becomes sometimes an object of perception there may be natures in which the walls of the material are so fine and translucent that the spiritual is seen through them as through a glass darkly it may be too that the love which is stronger than death has a power sometimes to make itself heard and felt through the walls of our mortality when it would plead for the defenseless ones it has left behind all these things may bewho knows                                       there said miss roxy coming out of the keepingroom at sunset i wouldnt ask to see a betterlookin corpse that ar woman was a sight to behold this morning i guess i shook a double handful of stones and them little shells out of her hairnow she reely looks beautiful captain kittridge has made a coffin out o some cedarboards he happened to have and i lined it with bleached cotton and stuffed the pillow nice and full and when we come to get her in she reely will look lovely  i spose mis kittridge youll have the funeral tomorrowits sunday  why yes aunt roxyi think everybody must want to improve such a dispensation have you took little mara in to look at the corpse  well no said miss roxy mis pennels gettin ready to take her home  i think its an opportunity we ought to improve said mrs kittridge to learn children what death is i think we cant begin to solemnize their minds too young  at this moment sally and the little mara entered the room  come here children said mrs kittridge taking a hand of either one and leading them to the closed door of the keepingroom ive got somethin to show you  the room looked ghostly and dimthe rays of light fell through the closed shutter on an object mysteriously muffled in a white sheet  sallys bright face expressed only the vague curiosity of a child to see something new but the little mara resisted and hung back with all her force so that mrs kittridge was obliged to take her up and hold her  she folded back the sheet from the chill and wintry form which lay so icily lonely and cold sally walked around it and gratified her curiosity by seeing it from every point of view and laying her warm busy hand on the lifeless and cold one but mara clung to mrs kittridge with eyes that expressed a distressed astonishment the good woman stooped over and placed the childs little hand for a moment on the icy forehead the little one gave a piercing scream and struggled to get away and as soon as she was put down she ran and hid her face in aunt roxys dress sobbing bitterly  that childll grow up to follow vanity said mrs kittridge her little head is full of dress now and she hates anything seriousits easy to see that  the little mara had no words to tell what a strange distressful chill had passed up her arm and through her brain as she felt that icy cold of deaththat cold so different from all others it was an impression of fear and pain that lasted weeks and months so that she would start out of sleep and cry with a terror which she had not yet a sufficiency of language to describe  you seem to forget mis kittridge that this ere child aint rugged like our sally said aunt roxy as she raised the little mara in her arms she was a sevenmonths baby and hard to raise at all and a shivery scary little creature  well then she ought to be hardened said dame kittridge but mary pennel never had no sort of idea of bringin up children twas jist so with naomithe girl never had no sort o resolution and she just died for want o resolutionthats what came of it i tell ye childrens got to learn to take the world as it is and taint no use bringin on em up too tender teach em to begin as theyve got to go outthats my maxim  mis kittridge said aunt roxy theres reason in all things and theres difference in children whats ones meats anothers pison you couldnt fetch up mis pennels children and she couldnt fetch up yournso lets say no more bout it  im always atellin my wife that ar said captain kittridge shes always wantin to make everybody over after her pattern  capn kittridge i dont think you need to speak resumed his wife when such a loud providence is aknockin at your door i think youd better be asearchin your own hearthere it is the eleventh hour and you haint come into the lords vineyard yet  oh come come mis kittridge dont twit a feller afore folks said the captain im goin over to harpswell neck this blessed minute after the minister to tend the funeralso well let him preach     chapter viii  the seen and the unseen   life on any shore is a dull affairever degenerating into commonplace and this may account for the eagerness with which even a great calamity is sometimes accepted in a neighborhood as affording wherewithal to stir the deeper feelings of our nature thus though mrs kittridge was by no means a hardhearted woman and would not for the world have had a ship wrecked on her particular account yet since a ship had been wrecked and a body floated ashore at her very door as it were it afforded her no inconsiderable satisfaction to dwell on the details and to arrange for the funeral  it was something to talk about and to think of and likely to furnish subjectmatter for talk for years to come when she should go out to tea with any of her acquaintances who lived at middle bay or maquoit or harpswell neck for although in those daysthe number of lighthouses being much smaller than it is nowit was no uncommon thing for ships to be driven on shore in storms yet this incident had undeniably more that was stirring and romantic in it than any within the memory of any teatable gossip in the vicinity mrs kittridge therefore looked forward to the funeral services on sunday afternoon as to a species of solemn fête which imparted a sort of consequence to her dwelling and herself notice of it was to be given out in meeting after service and she might expect both keepingroom and kitchen to be full mrs pennel had offered to do her share of christian and neighborly kindness in taking home to her own dwelling the little boy in fact it became necessary to do so in order to appease the feelings of the little mara who clung to the new acquisition with most devoted fondness and wept bitterly when he was separated from her even for a few moments therefore in the afternoon of the day when the body was found mrs pennel who had come down to assist went back in company with aunt ruey and the two children  the september evening set in brisk and chill and the cheerful fire that snapped and roared up the ample chimney of captain kittridges kitchen was a pleasing feature the days of our story were before the advent of those sullen gnomes the airtights or even those more sociable and cheery domestic genii the cookingstoves they were the days of the genial open kitchenfire with the crane the pothooks and trammelswhere hissed and boiled the social teakettle where steamed the huge dinnerpot in whose ample depths beets carrots potatoes and turnips boiled in jolly sociability with the pork or corned beef which they were destined to flank at the coming meal  on the present evening miss roxy sat bolt upright as was her wont in one corner of the fireplace with her spectacles on her nose and an unwonted show of candles on the little stand beside her having resumed the task of the silk dress which had been for a season interrupted mrs kittridge with her spectacles also mounted was carefully and warily runningup breadths stopping every few minutes to examine her work and to inquire submissively of miss roxy if it will do  captain kittridge sat in the other corner busily whittling on a little boat which he was shaping to please sally who sat on a low stool by his side with her knitting evidently more intent on what her father was producing than on the evening task of ten bouts which her mother exacted before she could freely give her mind to anything on her own account as sally was rigorously sent to bed exactly at eight oclock it became her to be diligent if she wished to do anything for her own amusement before that hour  and in the next room cold and still was lying that faded image of youth and beauty which the sea had so strangely given up without a name without a history without a single accompaniment from which her past could even be surmisedthere she lay sealed in eternal silence  its strange said captain kittridge as he whittled awayits very strange we dont find anything more of that ar ship ive been all up and down the beach alookin there was a spar and some broken bits of boards and timbers come ashore down on the beach but nothin to speak of  it wont be known till the sea gives up its dead said miss roxy shaking her head solemnly and therell be a great givin up then im athinkin  yes indeed said mrs kittridge with an emphatic nod  father said sally how many many things there must be at the bottom of the seaso many ships are sunk with all their fine things on board why dont people contrive some way to go down and get them  they do child said captain kittridge they have divingbells and men go down in em with caps over their faces and long tubes to get the air through and they walk about on the bottom of the ocean  did you ever go down in one father  why yes child to be sure and strange enough it was to be sure there you could see great big sea critters with ever so many eyes and long arms swimming right up to catch you and all you could do would be to muddy the water on the bottom so they couldnt see you  i never heard of that capn kittridge said his wife drawing herself up with a reproving coolness  wal mis kittridge you haint heard of everything that ever happened said the captain imperturbably though you do know a sight  and how does the bottom of the ocean look father said sally  laws child why trees and bushes grow there just as they do on land and great plantsblue and purple and green and yellow and lots of great pearls lie round ive seen em big as chippinbirds eggs  capn kittridge said his wife  i have and big as robins eggs too but them was off the coast of ceylon and malabar and way round the equator said the captain prudently resolved to throw his romance to a sufficient distance  its a pity you didnt get a few of them pearls said his wife with an indignant appearance of scorn  i did get lots on em and traded em off to the nabobs in the interior for cashmere shawls and india silks and sich said the captain composedly and brought em home and sold em at a good figure too  oh father said sally earnestly i wish you had saved just one or two for us  laws child i wish now i had said the captain goodnaturedly why when i was in india i went up to lucknow and benares and round and saw all the nabobs and biggumswhy they dont make no more of gold and silver and precious stones than we do of the shells we find on the beach why ive seen one of them fellers with a diamond in his turban as big as my fist  capn kittridge what are you telling said his wife once more  factas big as my fist said the captain obdurately and all the clothes he wore was jist a stiff crust of pearls and precious stones i tell you he looked like something in the revelationsa real new jerusalem look he had  i call that ar talk wicked capn kittridge usin scriptur that ar way said his wife  why dont it tell about all sorts of gold and precious stones in the revelations said the captain thats all i meant them ar countries off in asia aint like ournstands to reason they shouldnt be thems scripture countries and everything is different there  father didnt you ever get any of those splendid things said sally  laws yes child why i had a great green ring an emerald that one of the princes giv me and ever so many pearls and diamonds i used to go with em rattlin loose in my vest pocket i was young and gay in them days and thought of bringin of em home for the gals but somehow i always got opportunities for swappin of em off for goods and sich that ar shawl your mother keeps in her camfire chist was what i got for one on em  well well said mrs kittridge theres never any catchin you cause youve been where we havent  youve caught me once and that oughtr do said the captain with unruffled goodnature i tell you sally your mother was the handsomest gal in harpswell in them days  i should think you was too old for such nonsense capn said mrs kittridge with a toss of her head and a voice that sounded far less inexorable than her former admonition in fact though the old captain was as unmanageable under his wifes fireside régime as any brisk old cricket that skipped and sang around the hearth and though he hopped over all moral boundaries with a cheerful alertness of conscience that was quite discouraging still there was no resisting the spell of his inexhaustible goodnature  by this time he had finished the little boat and to sallys great delight began sailing it for her in a pail of water  i wonder said mrs kittridge whats to be done with that ar child i suppose the selectmen will take care ont itll be brought up by the town  i shouldnt wonder said miss roxy if capn pennel should adopt it  you dont think so said mrs kittridge twould be taking a great care and expense on their hands at their time of life  i wouldnt want no better fun than to bring up that little shaver said captain kittridge hes a bright un i promise you  you capn kittridge i wonder you can talk so said his wife its an awful responsibility and i wonder you dont think whether or no youre fit for it  why down here on the shore id as lives undertake a boy as a newfoundland pup said the captain plenty in the sea to eat drink and wear that ar young un may be the staff of their old age yet  you see said miss roxy i think theyll adopt it to be company for little mara theyre bound up in her and the little thing pines bein alone  well they make a real graven image of that ar child said mrs kittridge and fairly bow down to her and worship her  well its natural said miss roxy besides the little thing is cunnin shes about the cunninest little crittur that i ever saw and has such enticin ways  the fact was as the reader may perceive that miss roxy had been thawed into an unusual attachment for the little mara and this affection was beginning to spread a warming element though her whole being it was as if a rough granite rock had suddenly awakened to a passionate consciousness of the beauty of some fluttering white anemone that nestled in its cleft and felt warm thrills running through all its veins at every tender motion and shadow a word spoken against the little one seemed to rouse her combativeness nor did dame kittridge bear the child the slightest illwill but she was one of those naturally caretaking people whom providence seems to design to perform the picket duties for the rest of society and who therefore challenge everybody and everything to stand and give an account of themselves miss roxy herself belonged to this class but sometimes found herself so stoutly overhauled by the guns of mrs kittridges battery that she could only stand modestly on the defensive  one of mrs kittridges favorite hobbies was education or as she phrased it the fetchin up of children which she held should be performed to the letter of the old stiff rule in this manner she had already trained up six sons who were all following their fortunes upon the seas and on this account she had no small conceit of her abilities and when she thought she discerned a lamb being left to frisk heedlessly out of bounds her zeal was stirred to bring it under proper sheepfold regulations  come sally its eight oclock said the good woman  sallys dark brows lowered over her large black eyes and she gave an appealing look to her father  law mother let the child sit up a quarter of an hour later jist for once  capn kittridge if i was to hear to you thered never be no rule in this house sally you go long this minute and be sure you put your knittin away in its place  the captain gave a humorous nod of submissive goodnature to his daughter as she went out in fact putting sally to bed was taking away his plaything and leaving him nothing to do but study faces in the coals or watch the fleeting sparks which chased each other in flocks up the sooty back of the chimney  it was saturday night and the morrow was sundaynever a very pleasant prospect to the poor captain who having unfortunately no spiritual tastes found it very difficult to get through the day in compliance with his wifes views of propriety for he alas soared no higher in his aims  i blieve on the hull polly ill go to bed too said he suddenly starting up  well father your clean shirt is in the righthand corner of the upper drawer and your sunday clothes on the back of the chair by the bed  the fact was that the captain promised himself the pleasure of a long conversation with sally who nestled in the trundlebed under the paternal couch to whom he could relate long manycolored yarns without the danger of interruption from her mothers sharp truthseeking voice  a moralist might perhaps be puzzled exactly what account to make of the captains disposition to romancing and embroidery in all real matteroffact transactions as between man and man his word was as good as anothers and he was held to be honest and just in his dealings it was only when he mounted the stilts of foreign travel that his paces became so enormous perhaps after all a rude poetic and artistic faculty possessed the man he might have been a humbler phase of the mute inglorious milton perhaps his narrations required the privileges and allowances due to the inventive arts generally certain it was that in common with other artists he required an atmosphere of sympathy and confidence in which to develop himself fully and when left alone with children his mind ran such riot that the bounds between the real and unreal became foggier than the banks of newfoundland  the two women sat up and the night wore on apace while they kept together that customary vigil which it was thought necessary to hold over the lifeless casket from which an immortal jewel had recently been withdrawn  i relly did hope said mrs kittridge mournfully that this ere solemn providence would have been sent home to the capns mind but he seems jist as light and triflin as ever  there dont nobody see these ere things unless theys effectually called said miss roxy and the capns time aint come  its gettin to be tward the eleventh hour said mrs kittridge as i was atellin him this afternoon  well said miss roxy you know      while the lamp holds out to burn     the vilest sinner may return  yes i know that said mrs kittridge rising and taking up the candle dont you think aunt roxy we may as well give a look in there at the corpse  it was past midnight as they went together into the keepingroom all was so still that the clash of the rising tide and the ticking of the clock assumed that solemn and mournful distinctness which even tones less impressive take on in the nightwatches miss roxy went mechanically through with certain arrangements of the white drapery around the cold sleeper and uncovering the face and bust for a moment looked critically at the still unconscious countenance  not one thing to let us know who or what she is she said that boy if he lives would give a good deal to know some day  what is it ones duty to do about this bracelet said mrs kittridge taking from a drawer the article in question which had been found on the beach in the morning  well i spose it belongs to the child whatever its worth said miss roxy  then if the pennels conclude to take him i may as well give it to them said mrs kittridge laying it back in the drawer  miss roxy folded the cloth back over the face and the two went out into the kitchen the fire had sunk lowthe crickets were chirruping gleefully mrs kittridge added more wood and put on the teakettle that their watching might be refreshed by the aid of its talkative and inspiring beverage the two solemn hardvisaged women drew up to each other by the fire and insensibly their very voices assumed a tone of drowsy and confidential mystery  if this ere poor woman was hopefully pious and could see what was goin on here said mrs kittridge it would seem to be a comfort to her that her child has fallen into such good hands it seems amost a pity she couldnt know it  how do you know she dont said miss roxy brusquely  why you know the hymn said mrs kittridge quoting those somewhat saddusaical lines from the popular psalmbook      the living know that they must die     but all the dead forgotten lie     their memory and their senses gone     alike unknowing and unknown  well i dont know bout that said miss roxy flavoring her cup of tea hymnbook aint scriptur and im pretty sure that ar aint true always and she nodded her head as if she could say more if she chose  now miss roxys reputation of vast experience in all the facts relating to those last fateful hours which are the only certain event in every human existence caused her to be regarded as a sort of delphic oracle in such matters and therefore mrs kittridge not without a share of the latent superstition to which each human heart must confess at some hours drew confidentially near to miss roxy and asked if she had anything particular on her mind  well mis kittridge said miss roxy i aint one of the sort as likes to make a talk of what ive seen but mebbe if i was ive seen some things as remarkable as anybody i tell you mis kittridge folks dont tend the sick and dyin bed year in and out at all hours day and night and not see some remarkable things thats my opinion  well miss roxy did you ever see a sperit  i wont say as i have and i wont say as i havent said miss roxy only as i have seen some remarkable things  there was a pause in which mrs kittridge stirred her tea looking intensely curious while the old kitchenclock seemed to tick with one of those fits of loud insistence which seem to take clocks at times when all is still as if they had something that they were getting ready to say pretty soon if nobody else spoke  but miss roxy evidently had something to say and so she began  mis kittridge this eres a very particular subject to be talkin of ive had opportunities to observe that most havent and i dont care if i jist say to you that im pretty sure spirits that has left the body do come to their friends sometimes  the clock ticked with still more empressement and mrs kittridge glared through the horn bows of her glasses with eyes of eager curiosity  now you remember capn titcombs wife that died fifteen years ago when her husband had gone to archangel and you remember that he took her son john out with himand of all her boys john was the one she was particular sot on  yes and john died at archangel i remember that  jes so said miss roxy laying her hand on mrs kittridges he died at archangel the very day his mother died and jist the hour for the capn had it down in his logbook  you dont say so  yes i do well now said miss roxy sinking her voice this ere was remarkable mis titcomb was one of the fearful sort tho one of the best women that ever lived our minister used to call her mis muchafraidyou know in the pilgrims progressbut he was satisfied with her evidences and told her so she used to say she was afraid of the dark valley and she told our minister so when he went out that ar last day he called and his last words as he stood with his hand on the knob of the door was mis titcomb the lord will find ways to bring you thro the dark valley well she sunk away about three oclock in the morning i remember the time cause the capns chronometer watch that he left with her lay on the stand for her to take her drops by i heard her kind o restless and i went up and i saw she was struck with death and she looked sort o anxious and distressed  oh aunt roxy says she its so dark who will go with me and in a minute her whole face brightened up and says she john is going with me and she jist gave the least little sigh and never breathed no moreshe jist died as easy as a bird i told our minister of it next morning and he asked if id made a note of the hour and i told him i had and says he you did right aunt roxy  what did he seem to think of it  well he didnt seem inclined to speak freely miss roxy says he all naturs in the lords hands and theres no saying why he uses this or that them thats strong enough to go by faith he lets em but theres no saying what he wont do for the weak ones  want the capn overcome when you told him said mrs kittridge  indeed he was he was jist as white as a sheet  miss roxy now proceeded to pour out another cup of tea and having mixed and flavored it she looked in a weird and sibylline manner across it and inquired  mis kittridge do you remember that ar mr wadkins that come to brunswick twenty years ago in president averills days  yes i remember the pale thin longnosed gentleman that used to sit in president averills pew at church nobody knew who he was or where he came from the college students used to call him thaddeus of warsaw nobody knew who he was but the president cause he could speak all the foreign tonguesone about as well as another but the president he knew his story and said he was a good man and he used to stay to the sacrament regular i remember  yes said miss roxy he used to live in a room all alone and keep himself folks said he was quite a gentleman too and fond of reading  i heard capn atkins tell said mrs kittridge how they came to take him up on the shores of holland you see when he was somewhere in a port in denmark some men come to him and offered him a pretty good sum of money if hed be at such a place on the coast of holland on such a day and take whoever should come so the capn he went and sure enough on that day there come a troop of men on horseback down to the beach with this man and they all bid him goodby and seemed to make much of him but he never told em nothin on board ship only he seemed kind o sad and pinin  well said miss roxy ruey and i we took care o that man in his last sickness and we watched with him the night he died and there was something quite remarkable  do tell now said mrs kittridge  well you see said miss roxy hed been low and poorly all day kind o tossin and restless and a little lightheaded and the doctor said he thought he wouldnt last till morning and so ruey and i we set up with him and between twelve and one ruey said she thought shed jist lop down a few minutes on the old sofa at the foot of the bed and i made me a cup of tea like as im adoin now and set with my back to him  well said mrs kittridge eagerly  well you see he kept atossin and throwin off the clothes and i kept agettin up to straighten em and once he threw out his arms and something bright fell out on to the pillow and i went and looked and it was a likeness that he wore by a ribbon round his neck it was a womana real handsome oneand she had on a lownecked black dress of the cut they used to call marie louise and she had a string of pearls round her neck and her hair curled with pearls in it and very wide blue eyes well you see i didnt look but a minute before he seemed to wake up and he caught at it and hid it in his clothes well i went and sat down and i grew kind o sleepy over the fire but pretty soon i heard him speak out very clear and kind o surprised in a tongue i didnt understand and i looked round  miss roxy here made a pause and put another lump of sugar into her tea  well said mrs kittridge ready to burst with curiosity  well now i dont like to tell about these ere things and you mustnt never speak about it but as sure as you live polly kittridge i see that ar very woman standin at the back of the bed right in the partin of the curtains jist as she looked in the picturblue eyes and curly hair and pearls on her neck and black dress  what did you do said mrs kittridge  do why i jist held my breath and looked and in a minute it kind o faded away and i got up and went to the bed but the man was gone he lay there with the pleasantest smile on his face that ever you see and i woke up ruey and told her about it  mrs kittridge drew a long breath what do you think it was  well said miss roxy i know what i think but i dont think best to tell i told doctor meritts and he said there were more things in heaven and earth than folks knew aboutand so i think                                       meanwhile on this same evening the little mara frisked like a household fairy round the hearth of zephaniah pennel  the boy was a stronglimbed merryhearted little urchin and did full justice to the abundant hospitalities of mrs pennels teatable and after supper little mara employed herself in bringing apronful after apronful of her choicest treasures and laying them down at his feet his great black eyes flashed with pleasure and he gamboled about the hearth with his new playmate in perfect forgetfulness apparently of all the past night of fear and anguish  when the great family bible was brought out for prayers and little mara composed herself on a low stool by her grandmothers side he however did not conduct himself as a babe of grace he resisted all miss rueys efforts to make him sit down beside her and stood staring with his great black irreverent eyes during the biblereading and laughed out in the most inappropriate manner when the psalmsinging began and seemed disposed to mingle incoherent remarks of his own even in the prayers  this is a pretty selfwilled youngster said miss ruey as they rose from the exercises and i shouldnt think hed been used to religious privileges  perhaps not said zephaniah pennel but who can say but what this providence is a message of the lord to ussuch as pharaohs daughter sent about moses take this child and bring him up for me  id like to take him if i thought i was capable said mrs pennel timidly it seems a real providence to give mara some company the poor child pines so for want of it  well then mary if you say so we will bring him up with our little mara said zephaniah drawing the child toward him may the lord bless him he added laying his great brown hands on the shining black curls of the child     chapter ix  moses   sunday morning rose clear and bright on harpswell bay the whole sea was a waveless blue lookingglass streaked with bands of white and flecked with sailing cloudshadows from the skies above orrs island with its blueblack spruces its silver firs its golden larches its scarlet sumachs lay on the bosom of the deep like a great manycolored gem on an enchanted mirror a vague dreamlike sense of rest and sabbath stillness seemed to brood in the air the very sprucetrees seemed to know that it was sunday and to point solemnly upward with their dusky fingers and the small tidewaves that chased each other up on the shelly beach or broke against projecting rocks seemed to do it with a chastened decorum as if each bluehaired wave whispered to his brother be stillbe still  yes sunday it was along all the beautiful shores of mainenetted in green and azure by its thousand islands all glorious with their majestic pines all musical and silvery with the caresses of the seawaves that loved to wander and lose themselves in their numberless shelly coves and tiny beaches among their cedar shadows  not merely as a burdensome restraint or a weary endurance came the shadow of that puritan sabbath it brought with it all the sweetness that belongs to rest all the sacredness that hallows home all the memories of patient thrift of sober order of chastened yet intense family feeling of calmness purity and selfrespecting dignity which distinguish the puritan household it seemed a solemn pause in all the sights and sounds of earth and he whose moral nature was not yet enough developed to fill the blank with visions of heaven was yet wholesomely instructed by his weariness into the secret of his own spiritual poverty  zephaniah pennel in his best sunday clothes with his hard visage glowing with a sort of interior tenderness ministered this morning at his familyaltarone of those thousand priests of gods ordaining that tend the sacred fire in as many families of new england he had risen with the morning star and been forth to meditate and came in with his mind softened and glowing the trancelike calm of earth and sea found a solemn answer with him as he read what a poet wrote by the seashores of the mediterranean ages ago bless the lord o my soul o lord my god thou art very great thou art clothed with honor and majesty who coverest thyself with light as with a garment who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters who maketh the clouds his chariot who walketh upon the wings of the wind the trees of the lord are full of sap the cedars of lebanon which he hath planted where the birds make their nests as for the stork the firtrees are her house o lord how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all  ages ago the cedars that the poet saw have rotted into dust and from their cones have risen generations of others widewinged and grand but the words of that poet have been wafted like seed to our days and sprung up in flowers of trust and faith in a thousand households  well now said miss ruey when the morning rite was over mis pennel i spose you and the capn will be wantin to go to the meetin so dont you gin yourseves a mite of trouble about the children for ill stay at home with em the little feller was starty and fretful in his sleep last night and didnt seem to be quite well  no wonder poor dear said mrs pennel its a wonder children can forget as they do  yes said miss ruey you know them lines in the english reader      gay hope is theirs by fancy led       least pleasing when possessed     the tear forgot as soon as shed       the sunshine of the breast  them lines allys seemed to me affectin  miss rueys sentiment was here interrupted by a loud cry from the bedroom and something between a sneeze and a howl  massy what is that ar young un up to she exclaimed rushing into the adjoining bedroom  there stood the young master hopeful of our story with streaming eyes and muchbedaubed face having just after much labor succeeded in making miss rueys snuffbox fly open which he did with such force as to send the contents in a perfect cloud into eyes nose and mouth the scene of struggling and confusion that ensued cannot be described the washings and wipings and sobbings and exhortings and the sympathetic sobs of the little mara formed a small tempest for the time being that was rather appalling  well this eres a youngster thats agoin to make work said miss ruey when all things were tolerably restored seems to make himself at home first thing  poor little dear said mrs pennel in the excess of lovingkindness i hope he will hes welcome im sure  not to my snuffbox said miss ruey who had felt herself attacked in a very tender point  hes got the notion of lookin into things pretty early said captain pennel with an indulgent smile  well aunt ruey said mrs pennel when this disturbance was somewhat abated i feel kind o sorry to deprive you of your privileges today  oh never mind me said miss ruey briskly ive got the big bible and i can sing a hymn or two by myself my voice aint quite what it used to be but then i get a good deal of pleasure out of it aunt ruey it must be known had in her youth been one of the foremost leaders in the singers seats and now was in the habit of speaking of herself much as a retired prima donna might whose past successes were yet in the minds of her generation  after giving a look out of the window to see that the children were within sight she opened the big bible at the story of the ten plagues of egypt and adjusting her horn spectacles with a sort of sideway twist on her little pug nose she seemed intent on her sunday duties a moment after she looked up and said i dont know but i must send a message by you over to mis deacon badger about a worldly matter if tis sunday but ive been thinkin mis pennel that therell have to be clothes made up for this ere child next week and so perhaps roxy and i had better stop here a day or two longer and you tell mis badger that well come to her a wednesday and so shell have time to have that new pressboard donethe old one used to pester me so  well ill remember said mrs pennel  it seems amost impossible to prevent ones thoughts wanderin sundays said aunt ruey but i couldnt help athinkin i could get such a nice pair o trousers out of them old sunday ones of the capns in the garret i was alookin at em last thursday and thinkin what a pity twas you hadnt nobody to cut down for but this ere young uns going to be such a tearer hell want somethin real stout but ill try and put it out of my mind till monday mis pennel youll be sure to ask mis titcomb how harriets toothache is and whether them drops cured her that i gin her last sunday and ef youll jist look in a minute at major broads and tell em to use bayberry wax for his blister its so healin and do jist ask if sallys babys eyetooth has come through yet  well aunt ruey ill try to remember all said mrs pennel as she stood at the glass in her bedroom carefully adjusting the respectable black silk shawl over her shoulders and tying her neat bonnetstrings  i spose said aunt ruey that the notice of the funeralll be gin out after sermon  yes i think so said mrs pennel  its another loud call said miss ruey and i hope it will turn the young people from their thoughts of dress and vanitytheres mary jane sanborn was all took up with gettin feathers and velvet for her fall bonnet i dont think i shall get no bonnet this year till snow comes my bonnets respectable enoughdont you think so  certainly aunt ruey it looks very well  well ill have the pork and beans and brownbread all hot on table agin you come back said miss ruey and then after dinner well all go down to the funeral together mis pennel theres one thing on my mindwhat you goin to call this ere boy  father and ive been thinkin that over said mrs pennel  wouldnt think of givn him the capns name said aunt ruey  he must have a name of his own said captain pennel come here sonny he called to the child who was playing just beside the door  the child lowered his head shook down his long black curls and looked through them as elfishly as a skye terrier but showed no inclination to come  one thing he hasnt learned evidently said captain pennel and that is to mind  here he said turning to the boy with a little of the tone he had used of old on the quarterdeck and taking his small hand firmly  the child surrendered and let the good man lift him on his knee and stroke aside the clustering curls the boy then looked fixedly at him with his great gloomy black eyes his little firmset mouth and bridled china perfect little miniature of proud manliness  whats your name little boy  the great eyes continued looking in the same solemn quiet  law he dont understand a word said zephaniah putting his hand kindly on the childs head our tongue is all strange to him kittridge says hes a spanish child may be from the west indies but nobody knowswe never shall know his name  well i dare say it was some popish nonsense or other said aunt ruey and now hes come to a land of christian privileges we ought to give him a good scripture name and start him well in the world  lets call him moses said zephaniah because we drew him out of the water  now did i ever said miss ruey theres something in the bible to fit everything aint there  i like moses because i had a brother of that name said mrs pennel  the child had slid down from his protectors knee and stood looking from one to the other gravely while this discussion was going on what change of destiny was then going on for him in this simple formula of adoption none could tell but surely never orphan stranded on a foreign shore found home with hearts more true and loving  well wife i suppose we must be goin said zephaniah  about a stones throw from the open door the little fishingcraft lay courtesying daintily on the small tidewaves that came licking up the white pebbly shore mrs pennel seated herself in the end of the boat and a pretty placid picture she was with her smooth parted hair her modest cool drab bonnet and her bright hazel eyes in which was the sabbath calm of a loving and tender heart zephaniah loosed the sail and the two children stood on the beach and saw them go off a pleasant little wind carried them away and back on the breeze came the sound of zephaniahs sundaymorning psalm      lord in the morning thou shalt hear       my voice ascending high     to thee will i direct my prayer       to thee lift up mine eye      unto thy house will i resort       to taste thy mercies there     i will frequent thy holy court       and worship in thy fear  the surface of the glassy bay was dotted here and there with the white sails of other little craft bound for the same point and for the same purpose it was as pleasant a sight as one might wish to see  left in charge of the house miss ruey drew a long breath took a consoling pinch of snuff sang bridgewater in an uncommonly high key and then began reading in the prophecies with her good head full of the daughter of zion and the house of israel and judah she was recalled to terrestrial things by loud screams from the barn accompanied by a general flutter and cackling among the hens  away plodded the good soul and opening the barndoor saw the little boy perched on the top of the haymow screaming and shriekinghis face the picture of dismaywhile poor little maras cries came in a more muffled manner from some unexplored lower region in fact she was found to have slipped through a hole in the haymow into the nest of a very domestic sittinghen whose clamors at the invasion of her family privacy added no little to the general confusion  the little princess whose nicety as to her dress and sensitiveness as to anything unpleasant about her pretty person we have seen was lifted up streaming with tears and broken eggs but otherwise not seriously injured having fallen on the very substantial substratum of hay which dame poulet had selected as the foundation of her domestic hopes  well now did i ever said miss ruey when she had ascertained that no bones were broken if that ar young un isnt a limb i declare fort i pity mis pennelshe dont know what shes undertook how upon arth the critter managed to get mara on to the hay im sure i cant tellthat ar little thing never got into no such scrapes before  far from seeming impressed with any wholesome remorse of conscience the little culprit frowned fierce defiance at miss ruey when after having repaired the damages of little maras toilet she essayed the good old plan of shutting him into the closet he fought and struggled so fiercely that aunt rueys carroty frisette came off in the skirmish and her headgear always rather original assumed an aspect verging on the supernatural miss ruey thought of philistines and moabites and all the other terrible people she had been reading about that morning and came as near getting into a passion with the little elf as so goodhumored and christian an old body could possibly do human virtue is frail and every one has some vulnerable point the old roman senator could not control himself when his beard was invaded and the like sensitiveness resides in an old womans cap and when young master irreverently clawed off her sunday best aunt ruey in her confusion of mind administered a sound cuff on either ear  little mara who had screamed loudly through the whole scene now conceiving that her precious newfound treasure was endangered flew at poor miss ruey with both little hands and throwing her arms round her boy as she constantly called him she drew him backward and looked defiance at the common enemy miss ruey was dumbstruck  i declare fort i blieve hes bewitched her she said stupefied having never seen anything like the martial expression which now gleamed from those soft brown eyes why mara dearputty little mara  but mara was busy wiping away the angry tears that stood on the hot glowing cheeks of the boy and offering her little rosebud of a mouth to kiss him as she stood on tiptoe  poor boyno kiemaras boy she said mara love boy and then giving an angry glance at aunt ruey who sat much disheartened and confused she struck out her little pearly hand and cried go waygo way naughty  the child jabbered unintelligibly and earnestly to mara and she seemed to have the air of being perfectly satisfied with his view of the case and both regarded miss ruey with frowning looks under these peculiar circumstances the good soul began to bethink her of some mode of compromise and going to the closet took out a couple of slices of cake which she offered to the little rebels with pacificatory words  mara was appeased at once and ran to aunt ruey but the boy struck the cake out of her hand and looked at her with steady defiance the little one picked it up and with much chippering and many little feminine manoeuvres at last succeeded in making him taste it after which appetite got the better of his valorous resolutionshe ate and was comforted and after a little time the three were on the best possible footing and miss ruey having smoothed her hair and arranged her frisette and cap began to reflect upon herself as the cause of the whole disturbance if she had not let them run while she indulged in reading and singing this would not have happened so the toilful good soul kept them at her knee for the next hour or two while they looked through all the pictures in the old family bible                                       the evening of that day witnessed a crowded funeral in the small rooms of captain kittridge mrs kittridge was in her glory solemn and lugubrious to the last degree she supplied in her own proper person the want of the whole corps of mourners who generally attract sympathy on such occasions but what drew artless pity from all was the unconscious orphan who came in led by mrs pennel by the one hand and with the little mara by the other  the simple rite of baptism administered to the wondering little creature so strongly recalled that other scene three years before that mrs pennel hid her face in her handkerchief and zephaniahs firm hand shook a little as he took the boy to offer him to the rite the child received the ceremony with a look of grave surprise put up his hand quickly and wiped the holy drops from his brow as if they annoyed him and shrinking back seized hold of the gown of mrs pennel his great beauty and still more the air of haughty defiant firmness with which he regarded the company drew all eyes and many were the whispered comments  pennelll have his hands full with that ar chap said captain kittridge to miss roxy  mrs kittridge darted an admonitory glance at her husband to remind him that she was looking at him and immediately he collapsed into solemnity  the evening sunbeams slanted over the blackberry bushes and mullein stalks of the graveyard when the lonely voyager was lowered to the rest from which she should not rise till the heavens be no more as the purple sea at that hour retained no trace of the ships that had furrowed its waves so of this mortal traveler no trace remained not even in that infant soul that was to her so passionately dear     chapter x  the minister   mrs kittridges advantages and immunities resulting from the shipwreck were not yet at an end not only had one of the most solemn providences known within the memory of the neighborhood fallen out at her doornot only had the most interesting funeral that had occurred for three or four years taken place in her parlor but she was still further to be distinguished in having the minister to tea after the performances were all over to this end she had risen early and taken down her best china teacups which had been marked with her and her husbands joint initials in canton and which only came forth on high and solemn occasions in view of this probable distinction on saturday immediately after the discovery of the calamity mrs kittridge had found time to rush to her kitchen and make up a loaf of poundcake and some doughnuts that the great occasion which she foresaw might not find her below her reputation as a forehanded housewife  it was a fine golden hour when the minister and funeral train turned away from the grave unlike other funerals there was no draught on the sympathies in favor of mournersno wife or husband or parent left a heart in that grave and so when the rites were all over they turned with the more cheerfulness back into life from the contrast of its freshness with those shadows into which for the hour they had been gazing  the rev theophilus sewell was one of the few ministers who preserved the costume of a former generation with something of that imposing dignity with which in earlier times the habits of the clergy were invested he was tall and majestic in stature and carried to advantage the powdered wig and threecornered hat the broadskirted coat kneebreeches high shoes and plated buckles of the ancient costume there was just a sufficient degree of the formality of olden times to give a certain quaintness to all he said and did he was a man of a considerable degree of talent force and originality and in fact had been held in his day to be one of the most promising graduates of harvard university but being a good man he had proposed to himself no higher ambition than to succeed to the pulpit of his father in harpswell  his parish included not only a somewhat scattered seafaring population on the mainland but also the care of several islands like many other of the new england clergy of those times he united in himself numerous different offices for the benefit of the people whom he served as there was neither lawyer nor physician in the town he had acquired by his reading and still more by his experience enough knowledge in both these departments to enable him to administer to the ordinary wants of a very healthy and peaceable people  it was said that most of the deeds and legal conveyances in his parish were in his handwriting and in the medical line his authority was only rivaled by that of miss roxy who claimed a very obvious advantage over him in a certain class of cases from the fact of her being a woman which was still further increased by the circumstance that the good man had retained steadfastly his bachelor estate so of course miss roxy used to say poor man what could he know about a woman you know  this state of bachelorhood gave occasion to much surmising but when spoken to about it he was accustomed to remark with gallantry that he should have too much regard for any lady whom he could think of as a wife to ask her to share his straitened circumstances his income indeed consisted of only about two hundred dollars a year but upon this he and a very brisk cheerful maiden sister contrived to keep up a thrifty and comfortable establishment in which everything appeared to be pervaded by a spirit of quaint cheerfulness  in fact the man might be seen to be an original in his way and all the springs of his life were kept oiled by a quiet humor which sometimes broke out in playful sparkles despite the gravity of the pulpit and the awfulness of the cocked hat he had a placid way of amusing himself with the quaint and picturesque side of life as it appeared in all his visitings among a very primitive yet very shrewdminded people  there are those people who possess a peculiar faculty of mingling in the affairs of this life as spectators as well as actors it does not of course suppose any coldness of nature or want of human interest or sympathynay it often exists most completely with people of the tenderest human feeling it rather seems to be a kind of distinct faculty working harmoniously with all the others but he who possesses it needs never to be at a loss for interest or amusement he is always a spectator at a tragedy or comedy and sees in real life a humor and a pathos beyond anything he can find shadowed in books  mr sewell sometimes in his pastoral visitations took a quiet pleasure in playing upon these simple minds and amusing himself with the odd harmonies and singular resolutions of chords which started out under his fingers surely he had a right to something in addition to his limited salary and this innocent unsuspected entertainment helped to make up the balance for his many labors  his sister was one of the besthearted and most unsuspicious of the class of female idolaters and worshiped her brother with the most undoubting faith and devotionwholly ignorant of the constant amusement she gave him by a thousand little feminine peculiarities which struck him with a continual sense of oddity it was infinitely diverting to him to see the solemnity of her interest in his shirts and stockings and sunday clothes and to listen to the subtle distinctions which she would draw between best and secondbest and everyday to receive her somewhat prolix admonition how he was to demean himself in respect of the wearing of each one for miss emily sewell was a gentlewoman and held rigidly to various traditions of gentility which had been handed down in the sewell family and which afforded her brother too much quiet amusement to be disturbed he would not have overthrown one of her quiddities for the world it would be taking away a part of his capital in existence  miss emily was a trim genteel little person with dancing black eyes and cheeks which had the roses of youth well dried into them it was easy to see that she had been quite pretty in her days and her neat figure her brisk little vivacious ways her unceasing goodnature and kindness of heart still made her an object both of admiration and interest in the parish she was great in drying herbs and preparing recipes in knitting and sewing and cutting and contriving in saving every possible snip and chip either of food or clothing and no less liberal was she in bestowing advice and aid in the parish where she moved about with all the sense of consequence which her brothers position warranted  the fact of his bachelorhood caused his relations to the female part of his flock to be even more shrouded in sacredness and mystery than is commonly the case with the great man of the parish but miss emily delighted to act as interpreter she was charmed to serve out to the willing ears of his parish from time to time such scraps of information as regarded his life habits and opinions as might gratify their ever new curiosity instructed by her all the good wives knew the difference between his very best long silk stocking and his second best and how carefully the first had to be kept under lock and key where he could not get at them for he was understood good as he was to have concealed in him all the thriftless and pernicious inconsiderateness of the male nature ready at any moment to break out into unheardof improprieties but the good man submitted himself to miss emilys rule and suffered himself to be led about by her with an air of half whimsical consciousness  mrs kittridge that day had felt the full delicacy of the compliment when she ascertained by a hasty glance before the first prayer that the good man had been brought out to her funeral in all his very best things not excepting the long silk stockings for she knew the secondbest pair by means of a certain skillful darn which miss emily had once shown her which commemorated the spot where a hole had been the absence of this darn struck to mrs kittridges heart at once as a delicate attention  mis simpkins said mrs kittridge to her pastor as they were seated at the teatable told me that she wished when you were going home that you would call in to see mary jane she couldnt come out to the funeral on account of a dreffle sore throat i was tellin on her to gargle it with blackberryroot teadont you think that is a good gargle mr sewell  yes i think it a very good gargle replied the minister gravely  mash rosemary is the gargle that i always use said miss roxy it cleans out your throat so  marsh rosemary is a very excellent gargle said mr sewell  why brother dont you think that rose leaves and vitriol is a good gargle said little miss emily i always thought that you liked rose leaves and vitriol for a gargle  so i do said the imperturbable mr sewell drinking his tea with the air of a sphinx  well now youll have to tell which on em will be most likely to cure mary jane said captain kittridge or therell be a pullin of caps im thinkin or else the poor girl will have to drink them all which is generally the way  there wont any of them cure mary janes throat said the minister quietly  why brother why mr sewell why you dont burst in different tones from each of the women  i thought you said that blackberryroot tea was good said mrs kittridge  i understood that you proved of mash rosemary said miss roxy touched in her professional pride  and i am sure brother that i have heard you say often and often that there wasnt a better gargle than rose leaves and vitriol said miss emily  you are quite right ladies all of you i think these are all good garglesexcellent ones  but i thought you said that they didnt do any good said all the ladies in a breath  no they dontnot the least in the world said mr sewell but they are all excellent gargles and as long as people must have gargles i think one is about as good as another  now you have got it said captain kittridge  brother you do say the strangest things said miss emily  well i must say said miss roxy it is a new idea to me long as ive been nussin and i nussed through one season of scarlet fever when sometimes there was five died in one house and if mash rosemary didnt do good then i should like to know what did  so would a good many others said the minister  law now miss roxy you musnt mind him do you know that i believe he says these sort of things just to hear us talk of course he wouldnt think of puttin his experience against yours  but mis kittridge said miss emily with a view of summoning a less controverted subject what a beautiful little boy that was and what a striking providence that brought him into such a good family  yes said mrs kittridge but im sure i dont see what mary pennel is goin to do with that boy for she aint got no more government than a twisted towstring  oh the capn hell lend a hand said miss roxy it wont be easy gettin roun him capn bears a pretty steady hand when he sets out to drive  well said miss emily i do think that bringin up children is the most awful responsibility and i always wonder when i hear that any one dares to undertake it  it requires a great deal of resolution certainly said mrs kittridge im sure i used to get amost discouraged when my boys was young they was a reglar set of wild asss colts she added not perceiving the reflection on their paternity  but the countenance of mr sewell was all aglow with merriment which did not break into a smile  wal mis kittridge said the captain strikes me that youre gettin pussonal  no i aint neither said the literal mrs kittridge ignorant of the cause of the amusement which she saw around her but you want no help to me you know you was always off to sea and the whole wear and tear ont came on me  well well polly alls well that ends well dont you think so mr sewell  i havent much experience in these matters said mr sewell politely  no indeed thats what he hasnt for he never will have a child round the house that he dont turn everything topsyturvy for them said miss emily  but i was going to remark said mr sewell that a friend of mine said once that the woman that had brought up six boys deserved a seat among the martyrs and that is rather my opinion  wal polly if you git up there i hope youll keep a seat for me  capn kittridge what levity said his wife  i didnt begin it anyhow said the captain  miss emily interposed and led the conversation back to the subject what a pity it is she said that this poor childs family can never know anything about him there may be those who would give all the world to know what has become of him and when he comes to grow up how sad he will feel to have no father and mother  sister said mr sewell you cannot think that a child brought up by captain pennel and his wife would ever feel as without father and mother  why no brother to be sure not theres no doubt he will have everything done for him that a child could but then its a loss to lose ones real home  it may be a gracious deliverance said mr sewellwho knows we may as well take a cheerful view and think that some kind wave has drifted the child away from an unfortunate destiny to a family where we are quite sure he will be brought up industriously and soberly and in the fear of god  well i never thought of that said miss roxy  miss emily looking at her brother saw that he was speaking with a suppressed vehemence as if some inner fountain of recollection at the moment were disturbed but miss emily knew no more of the deeper parts of her brothers nature than a little bird that dips its beak into the sunny waters of some spring knows of its depths of coldness and shadow  mis pennel was asayin to me said mrs kittridge that i should ask you what was to be done about the bracelet they found we dont know whether tis real gold and precious stones or only glass and pinchbeck capn kittridge he thinks its real and if tis why then the question is whether or no to try to sell it or keep it for the boy agin he grows up it may help find out who and what he is  and why should he want to find out said mr sewell why should he not grow up and think himself the son of captain and mrs pennel what better lot could a boy be born to  that may be brother but it cant be kept from him everybody knows how he was found and you may be sure every bird of the air will tell him and hell grow up restless and wanting to know mis kittridge have you got the bracelet handy  the fact was little miss emily was just dying with curiosity to set her dancing black eyes upon it  here it is said mrs kittridge taking it from a drawer  it was a bracelet of hair of some curious foreign workmanship a green enameled serpent studded thickly with emeralds and with eyes of ruby was curled around the clasp a crystal plate covered a wide flat braid of hair on which the letters dm were curiously embroidered in a cipher of seed pearls the whole was in style and workmanship quite different from any jewelry which ordinarily meets ones eye  but what was remarkable was the expression in mr sewells face when this bracelet was put into his hand miss emily had risen from table and brought it to him leaning over him as she did so and he turned his head a little to hold it in the light from the window so that only she remarked the sudden expression of blank surprise and startled recognition which fell upon it he seemed like a man who chokes down an exclamation and rising hastily he took the bracelet to the window and standing with his back to the company seemed to examine it with the minutest interest after a few moments he turned and said in a very composed tone as if the subject were of no particular interest  it is a singular article so far as workmanship is concerned the value of the gems in themselves is not great enough to make it worth while to sell it it will be worth more as a curiosity than anything else it will doubtless be an interesting relic to keep for the boy when he grows up  well mr sewell you keep it said mrs kittridge the pennels told me to give it into your care  i shall commit it to emily here women have a native sympathy with anything in the jewelry line shell be sure to lay it up so securely that she wont even know where it is herself  brother  come emily said mr sewell your hens will all go to roost on the wrong perch if you are not at home to see to them so if the captain will set us across to harpswell i think we may as well be going  why whats your hurry said mrs kittridge  well said mr sewell firstly theres the hens secondly the pigs and lastly the cow besides i shouldnt wonder if some of emilys admirers should call on her this eveningnever any saying when captain broad may come in  now brother you are too bad said miss emily as she bustled about her bonnet and shawl now thats all made up out of whole cloth captain broad called last week a monday to talk to you about the pews and hardly spoke a word to me you oughtnt to say such things cause it raises reports  ah well then i wont again said her brother i believe after all it was captain badger that called twice  brother  and left you a basket of apples the second time  brother you know he only called to get some of my hoarhound for mehitables cough  oh yes i remember  if you dont take care said miss emily ill tell where you call  come miss emily you must not mind him said miss roxy we all know his ways  and now took place the grand leavetaking which consisted first of the three womens standing in a knot and all talking at once as if their very lives depended upon saying everything they could possibly think of before they separated while mr sewell and captain kittridge stood patiently waiting with the resigned air which the male sex commonly assume on such occasions and when after two or three come emilys the group broke up only to form again on the doorstep where they were at it harder than ever and a third occasion of the same sort took place at the bottom of the steps mr sewell was at last obliged by main force to drag his sister away in the middle of a sentence  miss emily watched her brother shrewdly all the way home but all traces of any uncommon feeling had passed away and yet with the restlessness of female curiosity she felt quite sure that she had laid hold of the end of some skein of mystery could she only find skill enough to unwind it  she took up the bracelet and held it in the fading evening light and broke into various observations with regard to the singularity of the workmanship her brother seemed entirely absorbed in talking with captain kittridge about the brig anna maria which was going to be launched from pennels wharf next wednesday but she therefore internally resolved to lie in wait for the secret in that confidential hour which usually preceded going to bed therefore as soon as she had arrived at their quiet dwelling she put in operation the most seducing little fire that ever crackled and snapped in a chimney well knowing that nothing was more calculated to throw light into any hidden or concealed chamber of the soul than that enlivening blaze which danced so merrily on her wellpolished andirons and made the old chintz sofa and the timeworn furniture so rich in remembrances of family comfort  she then proceeded to divest her brother of his wig and his dresscoat and to induct him into the flowing ease of a studygown crowning his wellshaven head with a black cap and placing his slippers before the corner of a sofa nearest the fire she observed him with satisfaction sliding into his seat and then she trotted to a closet with a glass door in the corner of the room and took down an old quaintlyshaped silver cup which had been an heirloom in their family and was the only piece of plate which their modern domestic establishment could boast and with this down cellar she tripped her little heels tapping lightly on each stair and the hum of a song coming back after her as she sought the ciderbarrel up again she came and set the silver cup with its clear amber contents down by the fire and then busied herself in making just the crispest nicest square of toast to be eaten with it for miss emily had conceived the idea that some little ceremony of this sort was absolutely necessary to do away all possible ill effects from a days labor and secure an uninterrupted nights repose having done all this she took her knittingwork and stationed herself just opposite to her brother  it was fortunate for miss emily that the era of daily journals had not yet arisen upon the earth because if it had after all her care and pains her brother would probably have taken up the evening paper and holding it between his face and her have read an hour or so in silence but mr sewell had not this resort he knew perfectly well that he had excited his sisters curiosity on a subject where he could not gratify it and therefore he took refuge in a kind of mild abstracted air of quietude which bid defiance to all her little suggestions  after in vain trying every indirect form miss emily approached the subject more pointedly i thought that you looked very much interested in that poor woman today  she had an interesting face said her brother dryly  was it like anybody that you ever saw said miss emily  her brother did not seem to hear her but taking the tongs picked up the two ends of a stick that had just fallen apart and arranged them so as to make a new blaze  miss emily was obliged to repeat her question whereat he started as one awakened out of a dream and said  why yes he didnt know but she did there were a good many women with black eyes and black hairmrs kittridge for instance  why i dont think that she looked like mrs kittridge in the least said miss emily warmly  oh well i didnt say she did said her brother looking drowsily at his watch why emily its getting rather late  what made you look so when i showed you that bracelet said miss emily determined now to push the war to the heart of the enemys country  look how said her brother leisurely moistening a bit of toast in his cider  why i never saw anybody look more wild and astonished than you did for a minute or two  i did did i said her brother in the same indifferent tone my dear child what an active imagination you have did you ever look through a prism emily  why no theophilus what do you mean  well if you should you would see everybody and everything with a nice little bordering of rainbow around them now the rainbow isnt on the things but in the prism  well whats that to the purpose said miss emily rather bewildered  why just this you women are so nervous and excitable that you are very apt to see your friends and the world in general with some coloring just as unreal i am sorry for you childie but really i cant help you to get up a romance out of this bracelet well goodnight emily take good care of yourself and go to bed and mr sewell went to his room leaving poor miss emily almost persuaded out of the sight of her own eyes     chapter xi  little adventurers   the little boy who had been added to the family of zephaniah pennel and his wife soon became a source of grave solicitude to that mild and longsuffering woman for as the reader may have seen he was a resolute selfwilled little elf and whatever his former life may have been it was quite evident that these traits had been developed without any restraint  mrs pennel whose whole domestic experience had consisted in rearing one very sensitive and timid daughter who needed for her development only an extreme of tenderness and whose conscientiousness was a law unto herself stood utterly confounded before the turbulent little spirit to which her lovingkindness had opened so ready an asylum and she soon discovered that it is one thing to take a human being to bring up and another to know what to do with it after it is taken  the child had the instinctive awe of zephaniah which his manly nature and habits of command were fitted to inspire so that morning and evening when he was at home he was demure enough but while the good man was away all day and sometimes on fishing excursions which often lasted a week there was a chronic state of domestic warfarea succession of skirmishes pitched battles long treaties with divers articles of capitulation ending as treaties are apt to do in open rupture on the first convenient opportunity  mrs pennel sometimes reflected with herself mournfully and with many selfdisparaging sighs what was the reason that young master somehow contrived to keep her far more in awe of him than he was of her was she not evidently as yet at least bigger and stronger than he able to hold his rebellious little hands to lift and carry him and to shut him up if so she willed in a dark closet and even to administer to him that discipline of the birch which mrs kittridge often and forcibly recommended as the great secret of her family prosperity was it not her duty as everybody told her to break his will while he was younga duty which hung like a millstone round the peaceable creatures neck and weighed her down with a distressing sense of responsibility  now mrs pennel was one of the people to whom selfsacrifice is constitutionally so much a nature that selfdenial for her must have consisted in standing up for her own rights or having her own way when it crossed the will and pleasure of any one around her all she wanted of a child or in fact of any human creature was something to love and serve we leave it entirely to theologians to reconcile such facts with the theory of total depravity but it is a fact that there are a considerable number of women of this class their life would flow on very naturally if it might consist only in giving never in withholdingonly in praise never in blameonly in acquiescence never in conflict and the chief comfort of such women in religion is that it gives them at last an object for love without criticism and for whom the utmost degree of selfabandonment is not idolatry but worship  mrs pennel would gladly have placed herself and all she possessed at the disposition of the children they might have broken her china dug in the garden with her silver spoons made turf alleys in her best room drummed on her mahogany teatable filled her muslin drawer with their choicest shells and seaweed only mrs pennel knew that such kindness was no kindness and that in the dreadful word responsibility familiar to every new england mothers ear there lay an awful summons to deny and to conflict where she could so much easier have conceded  she saw that the tyrant little will would reign without mercy if it reigned at all and ever present with her was the uneasy sense that it was her duty to bring this erratic little comet within the laws of a wellordered solar systema task to which she felt about as competent as to make a new ring for saturn then too there was a secret feeling if the truth must be told of what mrs kittridge would think about it for duty is never more formidable than when she gets on the cap and gown of a neighbor and mrs kittridge with her resolute voice and declamatory family government had always been a secret source of uneasiness to poor mrs pennel who was one of those sensitive souls who can feel for a mile or more the sphere of a stronger neighbor during all the years that they had lived side by side there had been this shadowy unconfessed feeling on the part of poor mrs pennel that mrs kittridge thought her deficient in her favorite virtue of resolution as in fact in her inmost soul she knew she wasbut who wants to have ones weak places looked into by the sharp eyes of a neighbor who is strong precisely where we are weak the trouble that one neighbor may give to another simply by living within a mile of one is incredible but until this new accession to her family mrs pennel had always been able to comfort herself with the idea that the child under her particular training was as wellbehaved as any of those of her more demonstrative friend but now all this consolation had been put to flight she could not meet mrs kittridge without most humiliating recollections  on sundays when those sharp black eyes gleamed upon her through the rails of the neighboring pew her very soul shrank within her as she recollected all the compromises and defeats of the week before it seemed to her that mrs kittridge saw it allhow she had ingloriously bought peace with gingerbread instead of maintaining it by rightful authorityhow young master had sat up till nine oclock on divers occasions and even kept little mara up for his lordly pleasure  how she trembled at every movement of the child in the pew dreading some patent and open impropriety which should bring scandal on her government this was the more to be feared as the first effort to initiate the youthful neophyte in the decorums of the sanctuary had proved anything but a successinsomuch that zephaniah pennel had been obliged to carry him out from the church therefore poor mrs pennel was thankful every sunday when she got her little charge home without any distinct scandal and breach of the peace  but after all he was such a handsome and engaging little wretch attracting all eyes wherever he went and so full of saucy drolleries that it seemed to mrs pennel that everything and everybody conspired to help her spoil him there are two classes of human beings in this world one class seem made to give love and the other to take it now mrs pennel and mara belonged to the first class and little master moses to the latter  it was perhaps of service to the little girl to give to her delicate shrinking highly nervous organization the constant support of a companion so courageous so richly blooded and highly vitalized as the boy seemed to be there was a fervid tropical richness in his air that gave one a sense of warmth in looking at him and made his oriental name seem in goodkeeping he seemed an exotic that might have waked up under fervid egyptian suns and been found cradled among the lotus blossoms of old nile and the fair goldenhaired girl seemed to be gladdened by his companionship as if he supplied an element of vital warmth to her being she seemed to incline toward him as naturally as a needle to a magnet  the childs quickness of ear and the facility with which he picked up english were marvelous to observe evidently he had been somewhat accustomed to the sound of it before for there dropped out of his vocabulary after he began to speak phrases which would seem to betoken a longer familiarity with its idioms than could be equally accounted for by his present experience though the english evidently was not his native language there had yet apparently been some effort to teach it to him although the terror and confusion of the shipwreck seemed at first to have washed every former impression from his mind  but whenever any attempt was made to draw him to speak of the past of his mother or of where he came from his brow lowered gloomily and he assumed that kind of moody impenetrable gravity which children at times will so strangely put on and which baffle all attempts to look within them zephaniah pennel used to call it putting up his deadlights perhaps it was the dreadful association of agony and terror connected with the shipwreck that thus confused and darkened the mirror of his mind the moment it was turned backward but it was thought wisest by his new friends to avoid that class of subjects altogetherindeed it was their wish that he might forget the past entirely and remember them as his only parents  miss roxy and miss ruey came duly as appointed to initiate the young pilgrim into the habiliments of a yankee boy endeavoring at the same time to drop into his mind such seeds of moral wisdom as might make the internal economy in time correspond to the exterior but miss roxy declared that of all the children that ever she see he beat all for finding out new mischiefthe moment youd make him understand he mustnt do one thing he was right at another  one of his exploits however had very nearly been the means of cutting short the materials of our story in the outset  it was a warm sunny afternoon and the three women being busy together with their stitching had tied a sunbonnet on little mara and turned the two loose upon the beach to pick up shells all was serene and quiet and retired and no possible danger could be apprehended so up and down they trotted till the spirit of adventure which ever burned in the breast of little moses caught sight of a small canoe which had been moored just under the shadow of a cedarcovered rock forthwith he persuaded his little neighbor to go into it and for a while they made themselves very gay rocking it from side to side  the tide was going out and each retreating wave washed the boat up and down till it came into the boys curly head how beautiful it would be to sail out as he had seen men doand so with much puffing and earnest tugging of his little brown hands the boat at last was loosed from her moorings and pushed out on the tide when both children laughed gayly to find themselves swinging and balancing on the amber surface and watching the rings and sparkles of sunshine and the white pebbles below little moses was glorioushis adventures had begunand with a fairyprincess in his boat he was going to stretch away to some of the islands of dreamland he persuaded mara to give him her pink sunbonnet which he placed for a pennon on a stick at the end of the boat while he made a vehement dashing with another first on one side of the boat and then on the otherspattering the water in diamond showers to the infinite amusement of the little maiden  meanwhile the tide waves danced them out and still outward and as they went farther and farther from shore the more glorious felt the boy he had got mara all to himself and was going away with her from all grown people who wouldnt let children do as they pleasedwho made them sit still in prayertime and took them to meeting and kept so many things which they must not touch or open or play with two white seagulls came flying toward the children and they stretched their little arms in welcome nothing doubting but these fair creatures were coming at once to take passage with them for fairyland but the birds only dived and shifted and veered turning their silvery sides toward the sun and careering in circles round the children a brisk little breeze that came hurrying down from the land seemed disposed to favor their unsubstantial enterprisefor your winds being a fanciful uncertain tribe of people are always for falling in with anything that is contrary to common sense so the wind trolled them merrily along nothing doubting that there might be time if they hurried to land their boat on the shore of some of the lowbanked red clouds that lay in the sunset where they could pick up shellsblue and pink and purpleenough to make them rich for life the children were all excitement at the rapidity with which their little bark danced and rocked as it floated outward to the broad open ocean at the blue freshening waves at the silverglancing gulls at the floating whitewinged ships and at vague expectations of going rapidly somewhere to something more beautiful still and what is the happiness of the brightest hours of grown people more than this  roxy said aunt ruey innocently seems to me i havent heard nothin o them children lately theyre so still im fraid theres some mischief  well ruey you jist go and give a look at em said miss roxy i declare that boy i never know what he will do next but there didnt seem to be nothin to get into out there but the sea and the beach is so shelving a body cant well fall into that  alas good miss roxy the children are at this moment tilting up and down on the waves half a mile out to sea as airily happy as the seagulls and little moses now thinks with glorious scorn of you and your pressboard as of grim shadows of restraint and bondage that shall never darken his free life more  both miss roxy and mrs pennel were however startled into a paroxysm of alarm when poor miss ruey came screaming as she entered the door  as sure as youre alive them chilen are off in the boattheyre out to sea sure as im alive what shall we do the boatll upset and the sharksll get em  miss roxy ran to the window and saw dancing and courtesying on the blue waves the little pinnace with its fanciful pink pennon fluttered gayly by the indiscreet and flattering wind  poor mrs pennel ran to the shore and stretched her arms wildly as if she would have followed them across the treacherous blue floor that heaved and sparkled between them  oh mara mara oh my poor little girl oh poor children  well if ever i see such a young un as that soliloquized miss roxy from the chamberwindow there they be dancin and giggitin about theyll have the boat upset in a minit and the sharks are waitin for em no doubt i blieve that ar young uns helped by the evil onenot a boat round else id push off after em well i dont see but we must trust in the lordthere dont seem to be much else to trust to said the spinster as she drew her head in grimly  to say the truth there was some reason for the terror of these most fearful suggestions for not far from the place where the children embarked was zephaniahs fishdrying ground and multitudes of sharks came up with every rising tide allured by the offal that was here constantly thrown into the sea two of these prowlers outwardbound from their quest were even now assiduously attending the little boat and the children derived no small amusement from watching their motions in the pellucid waterthe boy occasionally almost upsetting the boat by valorous plunges at them with his stick it was the most exhilarating and piquant entertainment he had found for many a day and little mara laughed in chorus at every lunge that he made  what would have been the end of it all it is difficult to say had not some mortal power interfered before they had sailed finally away into the sunset but it so happened on this very afternoon rev mr sewell was out in a boat busy in the very apostolic employment of catching fish and looking up from one of the contemplative pauses which his occupation induced he rubbed his eyes at the apparition which presented itself a tiny little shell of a boat came drifting toward him in which was a blackeyed boy with cheeks like a pomegranate and lustrous tendrils of silky dark hair and a little goldenhaired girl white as a waterlily and looking ethereal enough to have risen out of the seafoam both were in the very sparkle and effervescence of that fanciful glee which bubbles up from the golden untried fountains of early childhood mr sewell at a glance comprehended the whole and at once overhauling the tiny craft he broke the spell of fairyland and constrained the little people to return to the confines dull and dreary of real and actual life  neither of them had known a doubt or a fear in that joyous trance of forbidden pleasure which shadowed with so many fears the wiser and more farseeing heads and hearts of the grown people nor was there enough language yet in common between the two classes to make the little ones comprehend the risk they had run perhaps so do our elder brothers in our fathers house look anxiously out when we are sailing gayly over lifes seaover unknown depthsamid threatening monstersbut want words to tell us why what seems so bright is so dangerous  duty herself could not have worn a more rigid aspect than miss roxy as she stood on the beach pressboard in hand for she had forgotten to lay it down in the eagerness of her anxiety she essayed to lay hold of the little hand of moses to pull him from the boat but he drew back and looking at her with a world of defiance in his great eyes jumped magnanimously upon the beach the spirit of sir francis drake and of christopher columbus was swelling in his little body and was he to be brought under by a dryvisaged woman with a pressboard in fact nothing is more ludicrous about the escapades of children than the utter insensibility they feel to the dangers they have run and the light esteem in which they hold the deep tragedy they create  that night when zephaniah in his evening exercise poured forth most fervent thanksgivings for the deliverance while mrs pennel was sobbing in her handkerchief miss roxy was much scandalized by seeing the young cause of all the disturbance sitting upon his heels regarding the emotion of the kneeling party with his wide bright eyes without a wink of compunction  well for her part she said she hoped capn pennel would be blessed in takin that ar boy but she was sure she didnt see much that looked like it now                                       the rev mr sewell fished no more that day for the draught from fairyland with which he had filled his boat brought up many thoughts into his mind which he pondered anxiously  strange ways of god he thought that should send to my door this child and should wash upon the beach the only sign by which he could be identified to what end or purpose hath the lord a will in this matter and what is it  so he thought as he slowly rowed homeward and so did his thoughts work upon him that half way across the bay to harpswell he slackened his oar without knowing it and the boat lay drifting on the purple and goldtinted mirror like a speck between two eternities under such circumstances even heads that have worn the clerical wig for years at times get a little dizzy and dreamy perhaps it was because of the impression made upon him by the sudden apparition of those great dark eyes and sable curls that he now thought of the boy that he had found floating that afternoon looking as if some tropical flower had been washed landward by a monsoon and as the boat rocked and tilted and the minister gazed dreamily downward into the wavering rings of purple orange and gold which spread out and out from it gradually it seemed to him that a face much like the childs formed itself in the waters but it was the face of a girl young and radiantly beautiful yet with those same eyes and curlshe saw her distinctly with her thousand rings of silky hair bound with strings of pearls and clasped with strange gems and she raised one arm imploringly to him and on the wrist he saw the bracelet embroidered with seed pearls and the letters dm ah dolores he said well wert thou called so poor dolores i cannot help thee  what am i dreaming of said the rev mr sewell it is my thursday evening lecture on justification and emily has got tea ready and here i am catching cold out on the bay     chapter xii  sea tales   mr sewell as the reader may perhaps have inferred was of a nature profoundly secretive it was in most things quite as pleasant for him to keep matters to himself as it was to miss emily to tell them to somebody else she resembled more than anything one of those trotting chattering little brooks that enliven the back lot of many a new england home while he was like one of those wells you shall sometimes see by a deserted homestead so long unused that ferns and lichens feather every stone down to the dark cool water  dear to him was the stillness and coolness of inner thoughts with which no stranger intermeddles dear to him every pendent fernleaf of memory every dripping moss of old recollection and though the waters of his soul came up healthy and refreshing enough when one really must have them yet one had to go armed with bucket and line and draw them upthey never flowed one of his favorite maxims was that the only way to keep a secret was never to let any one suspect that you have one and as he had one now he had as you have seen done his best to baffle and put to sleep the feminine curiosity of his sister  he rather wanted to tell her too for he was a goodnatured brother and would have liked to have given her the amount of pleasure the confidence would have produced but then he reflected with dismay on the number of women in his parish with whom miss emily was on teadrinking termshe thought of the wondrous solvent powers of that beverage in whose amber depths so many resolutions yea and solemn vows of utter silence have been dissolved like cleopatras pearls he knew that an infusion of his secret would steam up from every cup of tea emily should drink for six months to come till gradually every particle would be dissolved and float in the air of common fame no it would not do  you would have thought however that something was the matter with mr sewell had you seen him after he retired for the night after he had so very indifferently dismissed the subject of miss emilys inquiries for instead of retiring quietly to bed as had been his habit for years at that hour he locked his door and then unlocked a desk of private papers and emptied certain pigeonholes of their contents and for an hour or two sat unfolding and looking over old letters and papers and when all this was done he pushed them from him and sat for a long time buried in thoughts which went down very very deep into that dark and mossy well of which we have spoken  then he took a pen and wrote a letter and addressed it to a direction for which he had searched through many piles of paper and having done so seemed to ponder uncertainly whether to send it or not the harpswell postoffice was kept in mr silas perrits store and the letters were every one of them carefully and curiously investigated by all the gossips of the village and as this was addressed to st augustine in florida he foresaw that before sunday the news would be in every mouth in the parish that the minister had written to so and so in florida and what do you spose its about  no no he said to himself that will never do but at all events there is no hurry and he put back the papers in order put the letter with them and locking his desk looked at his watch and found it to be two oclock and so he went to bed to think the matter over  now there may be some reader so simple as to feel a portion of miss emilys curiosity but my friend restrain it for mr sewell will certainly as we foresee become less rather than more communicative on this subject as he thinks upon it nevertheless whatever it be that he knows or suspects it is something which leads him to contemplate with more than usual interest this little mortal waif that has so strangely come ashore in his parish he mentally resolves to study the child as minutely as possible without betraying that he has any particular reason for being interested in him  therefore in the latter part of this mild november afternoon which he has devoted to pastoral visiting about two months after the funeral he steps into his little sailboat and stretches away for the shores of orrs island he knows the sun will be down before he reaches there but he sees in the opposite horizon the spectral shadowy moon only waiting for daylight to be gone to come out calm and radiant like a saintly friend neglected in the flush of prosperity who waits patiently to enliven our hours of darkness  as his boatkeel grazed the sands on the other side a shout of laughter came upon his oar from behind a cedarcovered rock and soon emerged captain kittridge as long and lean and brown as the ancient mariner carrying little mara on one shoulder while sally and little moses pennel trotted on before  it was difficult to say who in this whole group was in the highest spirits the fact was that mrs kittridge had gone to a teadrinking over at maquoit and left the captain as housekeeper and general overseer and little mara and moses and sally had been gloriously keeping holiday with him down by the boatcove where to say the truth few shavings were made except those necessary to adorn the childrens heads with flowing suits of curls of a most extraordinary effect the aprons of all of them were full of these most unsubstantial specimens of woody treasure which hung out in long festoons looking of a yellow transparency in the evening light but the delight of the children in their acquisitions was only equaled by that of grownup people in possessions equally fanciful in value  the mirth of the little party however came to a sudden pause as they met the minister mara clung tight to the captains neck and looked out slyly under her curls but the little moses made a step forward and fixed his bold dark inquisitive eyes upon him the fact was that the minister had been impressed upon the boy in his few visits to the meeting as such a grand and mysterious reason for good behavior that he seemed resolved to embrace the first opportunity to study him close at hand  well my little man said mr sewell with an affability which he could readily assume with children you seem to like to look at me  i do like to look at you said the boy gravely continuing to fix his great black eyes upon him  i see you do my little fellow  are you the lord said the child solemnly  am i what  the lord said the boy  no indeed my lad said mr sewell smiling why what put that into your little head  i thought you were said the boy still continuing to study the pastor with attention miss roxy said so  its curious what notions chilen will get in their heads said captain kittridge they put this and that together and think it over and come out with such queer things  but said the minister i have brought something for you all saying which he drew from his pocket three little brightcheeked apples and gave one to each child and then taking the hand of the little moses in his own he walked with him toward the housedoor  mrs pennel was sitting in her clean kitchen busily spinning at the little wheel and rose flushed with pleasure at the honor that was done her  pray walk in mr sewell she said rising and leading the way toward the penetralia of the best room  now mrs pennel i am come here for a good sitdown by your kitchenfire this evening said mr sewell emily has gone out to sit with old mrs broad who is laid up with the rheumatism and so i am turned loose to pick up my living on the parish and you must give me a seat for a while in your kitchen corner best rooms are always cold  the ministers right said captain kittridge when rooms aint much set in folks never feel so kind o natural in em so you jist let me put on a good backlog and forestick and build up a fire to tell stories by this evening my wifes gone out to tea too he said with an elastic skip  and in a few moments the captain had produced in the great cavernous chimney a foundation for a fire that promised breadth solidity and continuance a great backlog embroidered here and there with tufts of green or grayish moss was first flung into the capacious arms of the fireplace and a smaller log placed above it now all you young uns go out and bring in chips said the captain theres capital ones out to the woodpile  mr sewell was pleased to see the flash that came from the eyes of little moses at this order how energetically he ran before the others and came with glowing cheeks and distended arms throwing down great white chips with their green mossy bark scattering tufts on the floor good said he softly to himself as he leaned on the top of his goldheaded cane theres energy ambition muscle and he nodded his head once or twice to some internal decision  there said the captain rising out of a perfect whirlwind of chips and pine kindlings with which in his zeal he had bestrown the wide black stone hearth and pointing to the tongues of flame that were leaping and blazing up through the crevices of the dry pine wood which he had intermingled plentifully with the more substantial fuelthere mis pennel aint i a masterhand at a fire but im really sorry ive dirtied your floor he said as he brushed down his pantaloons which were covered with bits of grizzly moss and looked on the surrounding desolations give me a broom i can sweep up now as well as any woman  oh never mind said mrs pennel laughing ill sweep up  well now mis pennel youre one of the women that dont get put out easy aint ye said the captain still contemplating his fire with a proud and watchful eye  law me he exclaimed glancing through the window theres the capn acomin im jist goin to give a look at what hes brought in come chilen and the captain disappeared with all three of the children at his heels to go down to examine the treasures of the fishingsmack  mr sewell seated himself cozily in the chimney corner and sank into a state of halfdreamy reverie his eyes fixed on the fairest sight one can see of a frosty autumn twilighta crackling woodfire  mrs pennel moved softfooted to and fro arraying her teatable in her own finest and pure damask and bringing from hidden stores her best china and newest silver her choicest sweetmeats and cakewhatever was fairest and nicest in her houseto honor her unexpected guest  mr sewells eyes followed her occasionally about the room with an expression of pleased and curious satisfaction he was taking it all in as an artistic picturethat simple kindly hearth with its mossy logs yet steaming with the moisture of the wild woods the table so neat so cheery with its many little delicacies and refinements of appointment and its ample varieties to tempt the appetite and then the captain coming in yet fresh and hungry from his afternoons toil with the children trotting before him  and this is the inheritance he comes into he murmured healthywholesomecheerfulsecure how much better than hot stifling luxury  here the ministers meditations were interrupted by the entrance of all the children joyful and loquacious little moses held up a string of mackerel with their graceful bodies and elegantly cut fins  just a specimen of the best mary said captain pennel i thought id bring em for miss emily  miss emily will be a thousand times obliged to you said mr sewell rising up  as to mara and sally they were reveling in apronfuls of shells and seaweed which they bustled into the other room to bestow in their spacious babyhouse  and now after due time for zephaniah to assume a land toilet all sat down to the evening meal  after supper was over the captain was besieged by the children little mara mounted first into his lap and nestled herself quietly under his coatmoses and sally stood at each knee  come now said moses you said you would tell us about the mermen tonight  yes and the mermaids said sally tell them all you told me the other night in the trundlebed  sally valued herself no little on the score of the captains talent as a romancer  you see moses she said volubly father saw mermen and mermaids a plenty of them in the west indies  oh never mind about em now said captain kittridge looking at mr sewells corner  why not father mother isnt here said sally innocently  a smile passed round the faces of the company and mr sewell said come captain no modesty we all know you have as good a faculty for telling a story as for making a fire  do tell me what mermen are said moses  wal said the captain sinking his voice confidentially and hitching his chair a little around mermen and maids is a kind o people that have their world jist like ourn only its down in the bottom of the sea cause the bottom of the sea has its mountains and its valleys and its trees and its bushes and it stands to reason there should be people there too  moses opened his broad black eyes wider than usual and looked absorbed attention  tell em about how you saw em said sally  wal yes said captain kittridge once when i was to the bahamasit was one sunday morning in june the first sunday in the monthwe cast anchor pretty nigh a reef of coral and i was jist asittin down to read my bible when up comes a merman over the side of the ship all dressed as fine as any old beau that ever ye see with cocked hat and silk stockings and shoebuckles and his clothes were seagreen and his shoebuckles shone like diamonds  do you suppose they were diamonds really said sally  wal child i didnt ask him but i shouldnt be surprised from all i know of their ways if they was said the captain who had now got so wholly into the spirit of his fiction that he no longer felt embarrassed by the ministers presence nor saw the look of amusement with which he was listening to him in his chimneycorner but as i was sayin he came up to me and made the politest bow that ever ye see and says he capn kittridge i presume and says i yes sir im sorry to interrupt your reading says he and says i oh no matter sir but says he if you would only be so good as to move your anchor youve cast anchor right before my frontdoor and my wife and family cant get out to go to meetin  why do they go to meeting in the bottom of the sea said moses  law bless you sonny yes why sunday morning when the sea was all still i used to hear the bassviol asoundin down under the waters jist as plain as could beand psalms and preachin ive reason to think theres as many hopefully pious mermaids as there be folks said the captain  but said moses you said the anchor was before the frontdoor so the family couldnt get outhow did the merman get out  oh he got out of the scuttle on the roof said the captain promptly  and did you move your anchor said moses  why child yes to be sure i did he was such a gentleman i wanted to oblige himit shows you how important it is always to be polite said the captain by way of giving a moral turn to his narrative  mr sewell during the progress of this story examined the captain with eyes of amused curiosity his countenance was as fixed and steady and his whole manner of reciting as matteroffact and collected as if he were relating some of the everyday affairs of his boatbuilding  wal sally said the captain rising after his yarn had proceeded for an indefinite length in this manner you and i must be goin i promised your ma you shouldnt be up late and we have a long walk homebesides its time these little folks was in bed  the children all clung round the captain and could hardly be persuaded to let him go  when he was gone mrs pennel took the little ones to their nest in an adjoining room  mr sewell approached his chair to that of captain pennel and began talking to him in a tone of voice so low that we have never been able to make out exactly what he was saying whatever it might be however it seemed to give rise to an anxious consultation i did not think it advisable to tell any one this but yourself captain pennel it is for you to decide in view of the probabilities i have told you what you will do  well said zephaniah since you leave it to me i say let us keep him it certainly seems a marked providence that he has been thrown upon us as he has and the lord seemed to prepare a way for him in our hearts i am well able to afford it and mis pennel she agrees to it and on the whole i dont think wed best go back on our steps besides our little mara has thrived since he came under our roof he is to be sure kind o masterful and i shall have to take him off mis pennels hands before long and put him into the sloop but after all there seems to be the makin of a man in him and when we are called away why hell be as a brother to poor little mara yes i think its best as t is  the minister as he flitted across the bay by moonlight felt relieved of a burden his secret was locked up as safe in the breast of zephaniah pennel as it could be in his own     chapter xiii  boy and girl   zephaniah pennel was what might be called a hebrew of the hebrews  new england in her earlier days founding her institutions on the hebrew scriptures bred better jews than moses could because she read moses with the amendments of christ  the state of society in some of the districts of maine in these days much resembled in its spirit that which moses labored to produce in ruder ages it was entirely democratic simple grave hearty and sinceresolemn and religious in its daily tone and yet as to all material good full of wholesome thrift and prosperity perhaps taking the average mass of the people a more healthful and desirable state of society never existed its better specimens had a simple doric grandeur unsurpassed in any age the bringing up a child in this state of society was a far more simple enterprise than in our modern times when the factious wants and aspirations are so much more developed  zephaniah pennel was as high as anybody in the land he owned not only the neat little schooner brilliant with divers small fishingboats but also a snug farm adjoining the brown house together with some fresh juicy pasturelots on neighboring islands where he raised mutton unsurpassed even by the english southdown and wool which furnished homespun to clothe his family on all everyday occasions  mrs pennel to be sure had silks and satins and flowered india chintz and even a cashmere shawl the fruits of some of her husbands earlier voyages which were however carefully stowed away for occasions so high and mighty that they seldom saw the light not to wear best things every day was a maxim of new england thrift as little disputed as any verse of the catechism and so mrs pennel found the stuff gown of her own dyeing and spinning so respectable for most purposes that it figured even in the meetinghouse itself except on the very finest of sundays when heaven and earth seemed alike propitious a person can well afford to wear homespun stuff to meeting who is buoyed up by a secret consciousness of an abundance of fine things that could be worn if one were so disposed and everybody respected mrs pennels homespun the more because they thought of the things she didnt wear  as to advantages of education the island like all other new england districts had its common school where one got the key of knowledgefor having learned to read write and cipher the young fellow of those regions commonly regarded himself as in possession of all that a man needs to help himself to any further acquisitions he might desire the boys then made fishing voyages to the banks and those who were so disposed took their books with them if a boy did not wish to be bored with study there was nobody to force him but if a bright one saw visions of future success in life lying through the avenues of knowledge he found many a leisure hour to pore over his books and work out the problems of navigation directly over the element they were meant to control  four years having glided by since the commencement of our story we find in the brown house of zephaniah pennel a tall wellknit handsome boy of ten years who knows no fear of wind or sea who can set you over from orrs island to harpswell either in sail or rowboat he thinks as well as any man living who knows every rope of the schooner brilliant and fancies he could command it as well as father himself and is supporting himself this spring during the tamer drudgeries of driving plough and dropping potatoes with the glorious vision of being taken this year on the annual trip to the banks which comes on after planting he reads fluentlywitness the robinson crusoe which never departs from under his pillow and goldsmiths history of greece and rome which good mr sewell has lent himand he often brings shrewd criticisms on the character and course of romulus or alexander into the common current of everyday life in a way that brings a smile over the grave face of zephaniah and makes mrs pennel think the boy certainly ought to be sent to college  as for mara she is now a child of seven still adorned with long golden curls still looking dreamily out of soft hazel eyes into some unknown future not her own she has no dreams for herselfthey are all for moses for his sake she has learned all the womanly little accomplishments which mrs kittridge has dragooned into sally she knits his mittens and his stockings and hems his pockethandkerchiefs and aspires to make his shirts all herself whatever book moses reads forthwith she aspires to read too and though three years younger reads with a far more precocious insight  her little form is slight and frail and her cheek has a clear transparent brilliancy quite different from the rounded one of the boy she looks not exactly in ill health but has that sort of transparent appearance which one fancies might be an attribute of fairies and sylphs all her outward senses are finer and more acute than his and finer and more delicate all the attributes of her mind those who contend against giving woman the same education as man do it on the ground that it would make the woman unfeminine as if nature had done her work so slightly that it could be so easily raveled and knit over in fact there is a masculine and a feminine element in all knowledge and a man and a woman put to the same study extract only what their nature fits them to see so that knowledge can be fully orbed only when the two unite in the search and share the spoils  when moses was full of romulus and numa mara pondered the story of the nymph egeriasweet parable in which lies all we have been saying her trust in him was boundless he was a constant hero in her eyes and in her he found a steadfast believer as to all possible feats and exploits to which he felt himself competent for the boy often had privately assured her that he could command the brilliant as well as father himself  spring had already come loosing the chains of ice in all the bays and coves round harpswell orrs island maquoit and middle bay the magnificent spruces stood forth in their galadresses tipped on every point with vivid emerald the silver firs exuded from their tender shoots the fragrance of ripe pineapple the white pines shot forth long weird fingers at the end of their fringy boughs and even every little mimic evergreen in the shadows at their feet was made beautiful by the addition of a vivid border of green on the sombre coloring of its last years leaves arbutus fragrant with its clean wholesome odors gave forth its thousand dewy pink blossoms and the trailing linnea borealis hung its pendent twin bells round every mossy stump and old rock damp with green forest mould the green and vermilion matting of the partridgeberry was impearled with white velvet blossoms the checkerberry hung forth a translucent bell under its varnished green leaf and a thousand more fairy bells white or red hung on blueberry and huckleberry bushes the little pearl of orrs island had wandered many an hour gathering bouquets of all these to fill the brown house with sweetness when her grandfather and moses should come in from work  the love of flowers seemed to be one of her earliest characteristics and the young spring flowers of new england in their airy delicacy and fragility were much like herself and so strong seemed the affinity between them that not only mrs pennels best india china vases on the keepingroom mantel were filled but here stood a tumbler of scarlet rock columbine and there a bowl of blue and white violets and in another place a saucer of shelltinted crowfoot blue liverwort and white anemone so that zephaniah pennel was wont to say there wasnt a drink of water to be got for maras flowers but he always said it with a smile that made his weatherbeaten hard features look like a rock lit up by a sunbeam little mara was the pearl of the old seamans life every finer particle of his nature came out in her concentrated and polished and he often wondered at a creature so ethereal belonging to himas if down on some shaggy seagreen rock an old pearl oyster should muse and marvel on the strange silvery mystery of beauty that was growing in the silence of his heart  but may has passed the arbutus and the linnea are gone from the woods and the pine tips have grown into young shoots which wilt at noon under a direct reflection from sun and sea and the blue sky has that metallic clearness and brilliancy which distinguishes those regions and the planting is at last over and this very morning moses is to set off in the brilliant for his first voyage to the banks glorious knight he the world all before him and the blood of ten years racing and throbbing in his veins as he talks knowingly of hooks and sinkers and bait and lines and wears proudly the red flannel shirt which mara had just finished for him  how i do wish i were going with you she says i could do something couldnt itake care of your hooks or something  pooh said moses sublimely regarding her while he settled the collar of his shirt youre a girl and what can girls do at sea you never like to catch fishit always makes you cry to see em flop  oh yes poor fish said mara perplexed between her sympathy for the fish and her desire for the glory of her hero which must be founded on their pain i cant help feeling sorry when they gasp so  well and what do you suppose you would do when the men are pulling up twenty and forty pounder said moses striding sublimely why they flop so theyd knock you over in a minute  do they oh moses do be careful what if they should hurt you  hurt me said moses laughing thats a good one id like to see a fish that could hurt me  do hear that boy talk said mrs pennel to her husband as they stood within their chamberdoor  yes yes said captain pennel smiling hes full of the matter i believe hed take the command of the schooner this morning if id let him  the brilliant lay all this while courtesying on the waves which kissed and whispered to the little coquettish craft a fairer june morning had not risen on the shores that week the blue mirror of the ocean was all dotted over with the tiny white sails of fishingcraft bound on the same errand and the breeze that was just crisping the waters had the very spirit of energy and adventure in it  everything and everybody was now on board and she began to spread her fair wings and slowly and gracefully to retreat from the shore little moses stood on the deck his black curls blowing in the wind and his large eyes dancing with excitementhis clear olive complexion and glowing cheeks well set off by his red shirt  mrs pennel stood with mara on the shore to see them go the fair little goldenhaired ariadne shaded her eyes with one arm and stretched the other after her theseus till the vessel grew smaller and finally seemed to melt away into the eternal blue many be the wives and lovers that have watched those little fishingcraft as they went gayly out like this but have waited longtoo longand seen them again no more in night and fog they have gone down under the keel of some ocean packet or indiaman and sunk with brave hearts and hands like a bubble in the mighty waters yet mrs pennel did not turn back to her house in apprehension of this her husband had made so many voyages and always returned safely that she confidently expected before long to see them home again  the next sunday the seat of zephaniah pennel was vacant in church according to custom a note was put up asking prayers for his safe return and then everybody knew that he was gone to the banks and as the roguish handsome face of moses was also missing miss roxy whispered to miss ruey there captain pennels took moses on his first voyage we must contrive to call round on mis pennel afore long shell be lonesome  sunday evening mrs pennel was sitting pensively with little mara by the kitchen hearth where they had been boiling the teakettle for their solitary meal they heard a brisk step without and soon captain and mrs kittridge made their appearance  good evening mis pennel said the captain is atellin my good woman we must come down and see how yous agetting along its raly a work of necessity and mercy proper for the lords day rather lonesome now the captains gone aint ye took little moses too i see wasnt at meetin today so i says mis kittridge well just step down and chirk em up a little  i didnt really know how to come said mrs kittridge as she allowed mrs pennel to take her bonnet but aunt roxys to our house now and she said shed see to sally so youve let the boy go to the banks hes young aint he for that  not a bit of it said captain kittridge why i was off to the banks long afore i was his age and a capital time we had of it too golly how them fish did bite we stood up to our knees in fish before wed fished half an hour  mara who had always a shy affinity for the captain now drew towards him and climbed on his knee did the wind blow very hard she said  what my little maid  does the wind blow at the banks  why yes my little girl that it does sometimes but then there aint the least danger our craft ride out storms like live creatures ive stood it out in gales that was tight enough im sure member once i turned in tween twelve and one and hadnt moren got asleep afore i came clump out of my berth and found everything upside down and stead of goin upstairs to get on deck i had to go right down fact was that ere vessel jist turned clean over in the water and come right side up like a duck  well now capn i wouldnt be tellin such a story as that said his helpmeet  why polly what do you know about it you never was to sea we did turn clear over for i member i saw a bunch of seaweed big as a peck measure stickin top of the mast next day jist shows how safe them ar little fishing craft isfor all they look like an eggshell on the mighty deep as parson sewell calls it  i was very much pleased with mr sewells exercise in prayer this morning said mrs kittridge it must have been a comfort to you mis pennel  it was to be sure said mrs pennel  puts me in mind of poor mary jane simpson her husband went out you know last june and haint been heard of since mary jane dont really know whether to put on mourning or not  law i dont think mary jane need give up yet said the captain member one year i was out we got blowed clear up to baffins bay and got shut up in the ice and had to go ashore and live jist as we could among them esquimaux didnt get home for a year old folks had clean giv us up dont need never despair of folks gone to sea for theys sure to turn up first or last  but i hope said mara apprehensively that grandpapa wont get blown up to baffins bay ive seen that on his chartits a good ways  and then theres them ere icebergs said mrs kittridge im always fraid of running into them in the fog  law said captain kittridge ive met em bigger than all the colleges up to brunswickgreat white bears on emhungry as time in the primer once we came kersmash on to one of em and if the flying betsey hadnt been made of whalebone and injerrubber shed abeen stove all to pieces them white bears they was so hungry that they stood there with the water jist runnin out of their chops in a perfect stream  oh dear dear said mara with wide round eyes what will moses do if they get on the icebergs  yes said mrs kittridge looking solemnly at the child through the black bows of her spectacles we can truly say      dangers stand thick through all the ground         to push us to the tomb  as the hymnbook says  the kindhearted captain feeling the fluttering heart of little mara and seeing the tears start in her eyes addressed himself forthwith to consolation oh never you mind mara he said there wont nothing hurt em look at me why ive been everywhere on the face of the earth ive been on icebergs and among white bears and indians and seen storms that would blow the very hair off your head and here i am dry and tight as ever youll see em back before long  the cheerful laugh with which the captain was wont to chorus his sentences sounded like the crackling of dry pine wood on the social hearth one would hardly hear it without being lightened in heart and little mara gazed at his long dry ropy figure and wrinkled thin face as a sort of monument of hope and his uproarious laugh which mrs kittridge sometimes ungraciously compared to the crackling of thorns under a pot seemed to her the most delightful thing in the world  mary jane was atellin me resumed mrs kittridge that when her husband had been out a month she dreamed she see him and three other men afloatin on an iceberg  laws said captain kittridge thats jist what my old mother dreamed about me and twas true enough too till we got off the ice on to the shore up in the esquimaux territory as i was atellin so you tell mary jane she neednt look out for a second husband yet for that ar dreams a sartin sign hell be back  capn kittridge said his helpmeet drawing herself up and giving him an austere glance over her spectacles how often must i tell you that there is subjects which shouldnt be treated with levity  whos been atreatin of em with levity said the captain im sure i aint mary janes goodlookin and theres plenty of young fellows as sees it as well as me i declare she looked as pretty as any young gal when she ris up in the singers seats today put me in mind of you polly when i first come home from the injies  oh come now capn kittridge were gettin too old for that sort o talk  we aint too old be we mara said the captain trotting the little girl gayly on his knee and we aint afraid of icebergs and no sich be we i tell you theys a fine sight of a bright day they has millions of steeples all white and glistering like the new jerusalem and the white bears have capital times trampin round on em wouldnt little mara like a great nice white bear to ride on with his white fur so soft and warm and a saddle made of pearls and a gold bridle  you havent seen any little girls ride so said mara doubtfully  i shouldnt wonder if i had but you see mis kittridge there she wont let me tell all i know said the captain sinking his voice to a confidential tone you jist wait till we get alone  but you are sure said mara confidingly in return that white bears will be kind to moses  lord bless you yes child the kindest critturs in the world they be if you only get the right side of em said the captain  oh yes because said mara i know how good a wolf was to romulus and remus once and nursed them when they were cast out to die i read that in the roman history  jist so said the captain enchanted at this historic confirmation of his apocrypha  and so said mara if moses should happen to get on an iceberg a bear might take care of him you know  jist so jist so said the captain so dont you worry your little curly head one bit some time when you come down to see sally well go down to the cove and ill tell you lots of stories about chilen that have been fetched up by white bears jist like romulus and whats his name there  come mis kittridge added the cheery captain you and i mustnt be keepin the folks up till nine oclock  well now said mrs kittridge in a doleful tone as she began to put on her bonnet mis pennel you must keep up your spiritsits ones duty to take cheerful views of things im sure manys the night when the captains been gone to sea ive laid and shook in my bed hearin the wind blow and thinking what if i should be left a lone widow  thered abeen a dozen fellows awanting to get you in six months polly interposed the captain well goodnight mis pennel therell be a splendid haul of fish at the banks this year or theres no truth in signs come my little mara got a kiss for the dry old daddy thats my good girl well good night and the lord bless you  and so the cheery captain took up his line of march homeward leaving little maras head full of dazzling visions of the land of romance to which moses had gone she was yet on that shadowy boundary between the dreamland of childhood and the real land of life so all things looked to her quite possible and gentle white bears with warm soft fur and pearl and gold saddles walked through her dreams and the victorious curls of moses appeared with his bright eyes and cheeks over glittering pinnacles of frost in the iceland     chapter xiv  the enchanted island   june and july passed and the lonely two lived a quiet life in the brown house everything was so still and fairno sound but the coming and going tide and the swaying wind among the pinetrees and the tick of the clock and the whirr of the little wheel as mrs pennel sat spinning in her door in the mild weather mara read the roman history through again and began it a third time and read over and over again the stories and prophecies that pleased her in the bible and pondered the woodcuts and texts in a very old edition of Æsops fables and as she wandered in the woods picking fragrant bayberries and gathering hemlock checkerberry and sassafras to put in the beer which her grandmother brewed she mused on the things that she read till her little mind became a tabernacle of solemn quaint dreamy forms where old judean kings and prophets and roman senators and warriors marched in and out in shadowy rounds she invented long dramas and conversations in which they performed imaginary parts and it would not have appeared to the child in the least degree surprising either to have met an angel in the woods or to have formed an intimacy with some talking wolf or bear such as she read of in Æsops fables  one day as she was exploring the garret she found in an old barrel of castoff rubbish a bit of reading which she begged of her grandmother for her own it was the play of the tempest torn from an old edition of shakespeare and was in that delightfully fragmentary condition which most particularly pleases children because they conceive a mutilated treasure thus found to be more especially their own propertysomething like a rare wildflower or seashell the pleasure which thoughtful and imaginative children sometimes take in reading that which they do not and cannot fully comprehend is one of the most common and curious phenomena of childhood  and so little mara would lie for hours stretched out on the pebbly beach with the broad open ocean before her and the whispering pines and hemlocks behind her and pore over this poem from which she collected dim delightful images of a lonely island an old enchanter a beautiful girl and a spirit not quite like those in the bible but a very probable one to her mode of thinking as for old caliban she fancied him with a face much like that of a huge skatefish she had once seen drawn ashore in one of her grandfathers nets and then there was the beautiful young prince ferdinand much like what moses would be when he was grown upand how glad she would be to pile up his wood for him if any old enchanter should set him to work  one attribute of the child was a peculiar shamefacedness and shyness about her inner thoughts and therefore the wonder that this new treasure excited the host of surmises and dreams to which it gave rise were never mentioned to anybody that it was all of it as much authentic fact as the roman history she did not doubt but whether it had happened on orrs island or some of the neighboring ones she had not exactly made up her mind she resolved at her earliest leisure to consult captain kittridge on the subject wisely considering that it much resembled some of his fishy and aquatic experiences  some of the little songs fixed themselves in her memory and she would hum them as she wandered up and down the beach      come unto these yellow sands       and then take hands     courtsied when you have and kissed       the wild waves whist     foot it featly here and there     and sweet sprites the burthen bear  and another which pleased her still more      full fathom five thy father lies       of his bones are coral made     those are pearls that were his eyes       nothing of him that can fade     but doth suffer a seachange     into something rich and strange     seanymphs hourly ring his knell     hark now i hear themdingdong bell  these words she pondered very long gravely revolving in her little head whether they described the usual course of things in the mysterious underworld that lay beneath that blue spangled floor of the sea whether everybodys eyes changed to pearl and their bones to coral if they sunk down there and whether the seanymphs spoken of were the same as the mermaids that captain kittridge had told of had he not said that the bell rung for church of a sunday morning down under the waters  mara vividly remembered the scene on the seabeach the finding of little moses and his mother the dream of the pale lady that seemed to bring him to her and not one of the conversations that had transpired before her among different gossips had been lost on her quiet listening little ears these pale still children that play without making any noise are deep wells into which drop many things which lie long and quietly on the bottom and come up in after years whole and new when everybody else has forgotten them  so she had heard surmises as to the remaining crew of that unfortunate ship where perhaps moses had a father and sometimes she wondered if he were lying fathoms deep with seanymphs ringing his knell and whether moses ever thought about him and yet she could no more have asked him a question about it than if she had been born dumb she decided that she should never show him this poetryit might make him feel unhappy  one bright afternoon when the sea lay all dead asleep and the long steady respiration of its tides scarcely disturbed the glassy tranquillity of its bosom mrs pennel sat at her kitchendoor spinning when captain kittridge appeared  good afternoon mis pennel how ye gettin along  oh pretty well captain wont you walk in and have a glass of beer  well thank you said the captain raising his hat and wiping his forehead i be pretty dry its a fact  mrs pennel hastened to a cask which was kept standing in a corner of the kitchen and drew from thence a mug of her own homebrewed fragrant with the smell of juniper hemlock and wintergreen which she presented to the captain who sat down in the doorway and discussed it in leisurely sips  wal spose its most time to be lookin for em home aint it he said  i am lookin every day said mrs pennel involuntarily glancing upward at the sea  at the word appeared the vision of little mara who rose up like a spirit from a dusky corner where she had been stooping over her reading  why little mara said the captain you ris up like a ghost all of a sudden i thought yous out to play i come down apurpose arter you mis kittridge has gone shoppin up to brunswick and left sally a stent to do and i promised her if shed clap to and do it quick id go up and fetch you down and wed have a play in the cove  maras eyes brightened as they always did at this prospect and mrs pennel said well im glad to have the child go she seems so kind o still and lonesome since moses went away really one feels as if that boy took all the noise there was with him i get tired myself sometimes hearing the clock tick mara when shes alone takes to her book more thans good for a child  she does does she well well see about that come little mara get on your sunbonnet sallys sewin fast as ever she can and were goin to dig some clams and make a fire and have a chowder thatll be nice wont it dont you want to come too mis pennel  oh thank you captain but ive got so many things on hand to do afore they come home i dont really think i can ill trust mara to you any day  mara had run into her own little room and secured her precious fragment of treasure which she wrapped up carefully in her handkerchief resolving to enlighten sally with the story and to consult the captain on any nice points of criticism arrived at the cove they found sally already there in advance of them clapping her hands and dancing in a manner which made her black elflocks fly like those of a distracted creature  now sally said the captain imitating in a humble way his wifes manner are you sure youve finished your work well  yes father every stitch ont  and stuck in your needle and folded it up and put it in the drawer and put away your thimble and shet the drawer and all the rest ont said the captain  yes father said sally gleefully ive done everything i could think of  cause you know your mall be arter ye if you dont leave everything straight  oh never you fear father ive done it all half an hour ago and ive found the most capital bed of clams just round the point here and you take care of mara there and make up a fire while i dig em if she comes shell be sure to wet her shoes or spoil her frock or something  wal she likes no better fun now said the captain watching sally as she disappeared round the rock with a bright tin pan  he then proceeded to construct an extemporary fireplace of loose stones and to put together chips and shavings for the firein which work little mara eagerly assisted but the fire was crackling and burning cheerily long before sally appeared with her clams and so the captain with a pile of hemlock boughs by his side sat on a stone feeding the fire leisurely from time to time with crackling boughs now was the time for mara to make her inquiries her heart beat she knew not why for she was full of those little timidities and shames that so often embarrass children in their attempts to get at the meanings of things in this great world where they are such ignorant spectators  captain kittridge she said at last do the mermaids toll any bells for people when they are drowned  now the captain had never been known to indicate the least ignorance on any subject in heaven or earth which any one wished his opinion on he therefore leisurely poked another great crackling bough of green hemlock into the fire and yankeelike answered one question by asking another  what put that into your curly pate he said  a book ive been reading says they dothat is seanymphs do aint seanymphs and mermaids the same thing  wal i guess they be pretty much said the captain rubbing down his pantaloons yes they be he added after reflection  and when people are drowned how long does it take for their bones to turn into coral and their eyes into pearl said little mara  well that depends upon circumstances said the captain who wasnt going to be posed but let me jist see your book youve been reading these things out of  i found it in a barrel up garret and grandma gave it to me said mara unrolling her handkerchief its a beautiful bookit tells about an island and there was an old enchanter lived on it and he had one daughter and there was a spirit they called ariel whom a wicked old witch fastened in a split of a pinetree till the enchanter got him out he was a beautiful spirit and rode in the curled clouds and hung in flowersbecause he could make himself big or little you see  ah yes i see to be sure said the captain nodding his head  well that about seanymphs ringing his knell is here mara added beginning to read the passage with wide dilated eyes and great emphasis you see she went on speaking very fast this enchanter had been a prince and a wicked brother had contrived to send him to sea with his poor little daughter in a ship so leaky that the very rats had left it  bad business that said the captain attentively  well said mara they got cast ashore on this desolate island where they lived together but once when a ship was going by on the sea that had his wicked brother and his sona real good handsome young princein it why then he made a storm by magic arts  jist so said the captain thats been often done to my sartin knowledge  and he made the ship be wrecked and all the people thrown ashore but there wasnt any of em drowned and this handsome prince heard ariel singing this song about his father and it made him think he was dead  well what became of em interposed sally who had come up with her pan of clams in time to hear this story to which she had listened with breathless interest  oh the beautiful young prince married the beautiful young lady said mara  wal said the captain who by this time had found his soundings that youve been atellin is what they call a play and ive seen em act it at a theatre when i was to liverpool once i know all about it shakespeare wrote it and hes a great english poet  but did it ever happen said mara trembling between hope and fear is it like the bible and roman history  why no said captain kittridge not exactly but things jist like it you know mermaids and sich is common in foreign parts and they has funerals for drowned sailors member once when we was sailing near the bermudas by a reef where the lively fanny went down and i heard a kind o dingdonginand the waters there is clear as the skyand i looked down and see the coral all agrowin and the seaplants awavin as handsome as a pictur and the mermaids they was asingin it was beautiful they sung kind o mournful and jack hubbard he would have it they was asingin for the poor fellows that was alyin there round under the seaweed  but said mara did you ever see an enchanter that could make storms  wal there be witches and conjurers that make storms member once when we was crossin the line about twelve oclock at night there was an old man with a long white beard that shone like silver came and stood at the masthead and he had a pitchfork in one hand and a lantern in the other and there was great balls of fire as big as my fist came out all round in the rigging and ill tell you if we didnt get a blow that ar night i thought to my soul we should all go to the bottom  why said mara her eyes staring with excitement that was just like this shipwreck and twas ariel made those balls of fire he says so he said he flamed amazement all over the ship  ive heard miss roxy tell about witches that made storms said sally  the captain leisurely proceeded to open the clams separating from the shells the contents which he threw into a pan meanwhile placing a black pot over the fire in which he had previously arranged certain slices of salt pork which soon began frizzling in the heat  now sally you peel them potatoes and mind you slice em thin he said and sally soon was busy with her work  yes said the captain going on with his part of the arrangement there was old polly twitchell that lived in that ar old tumbledown house on mure pint people used to say she brewed storms and went to sea in a sieve  went in a sieve said both children why a sieve wouldnt swim  no more it wouldnt in any christian way said the captain but that was to show what a great witch she was  but this was a good enchanter said mara and he did it all by a book and a rod  yes yes said the captain that ars the genl way magicians do ever since mosess time in egypt member once i was to alexandria in egypt and i saw a magician there that could jist see everything you ever did in your life in a drop of ink that he held in his hand  he could father  to be sure he could told me all about the old folks at home and described our house as natural as if hed abeen there he used to carry snakes round with hima kind so pison that it was certain death to have em bite you but he played with em as if they was kittens  well said mara my enchanter was a king and when he got through all he wanted and got his daughter married to the beautiful young prince he said he would break his staff and deeper than plummet sounded he would bury his book  it was pretty much the best thing he could do said the captain because the bible is agin such things  is it said mara why he was a real good man  oh well you know we all on us does what aint quite right sometimes when we gets pushed up said the captain who now began arranging the clams and sliced potatoes in alternate layers with seabiscuit strewing in salt and pepper as he went on and in a few moments a smell fragrant to hungry senses began to steam upward and sally began washing and preparing some mammoth clamshells to serve as ladles and plates for the future chowder  mara who sat with her morsel of a book in her lap seemed deeply pondering the past conversation at last she said what did you mean by saying youd seen em act that at a theatre  why they make it all seem real and they have a shipwreck and you see it all jist right afore your eyes  and the enchanter and ariel and caliban and all said mara  yes all ontplain as printing  why that is by magic aint it said mara  no they hes ways to jist make it up butadded the captain sally you neednt say nothin to your ma bout the theatre cause she wouldnt think is fit to go to meetin for six months arter if she heard ont  why aint theatres good said sally  wal theres a middlin sight o bad things in em said the captain that i must say but as long as folks is folks why they will be folksybut theres never any makin women folk understand about them ar things  i am sorry they are bad said mara i want to see them  wal wal said the captain on the hull ive seen real things a good deal more wonderful than all their shows and they haint no makeblieve to em but theatres is takin arter all but sally mind you dont say nothin to mis kittridge  a few moments more and all discussion was lost in preparations for the meal and each one receiving a portion of the savory stew in a large shell made a spoon of a small cockle and with some slices of bread and butter the evening meal went off merrily the sun was sloping toward the ocean the wide blue floor was bedropped here and there with rosy shadows of sailing clouds suddenly the captain sprang up calling out  sure as im alive there they be  who exclaimed the children  why captain pennel and moses dont you see  and in fact on the outer circle of the horizon came drifting a line of small whitebreasted vessels looking like so many doves  thems em said the captain while mara danced for joy  how soon will they be here  afore long said the captain so mara i guess youll want to be getting hum     chapter xv  the home coming   mrs pennel too had seen the white dovelike cloud on the horizon and had hurried to make biscuits and conduct other culinary preparations which should welcome the wanderers home  the sun was just dipping into the great blue seaa round ball of fireand sending long slanting tracks of light across the top of each wave when a boat was moored at the beach and the minister sprang outnot in his suit of ceremony but attired in fishermans garb  good afternoon mrs pennel he said i was out fishing and i thought i saw your husbands schooner in the distance i thought id come and tell you  thank you mr sewell i thought i saw it but i was not certain do come in the captain would be delighted to see you here  we miss your husband in our meetings said mr sewell it will be good news for us all when he comes home he is one of those i depend on to help me preach  im sure you dont preach to anybody who enjoys it more said mrs pennel he often tells me that the greatest trouble about his voyages to the banks is that he loses so many sanctuary privileges though he always keeps sunday on his ship and reads and sings his psalms but he says after all theres nothing like going to mount zion  and little moses has gone on his first voyage said the minister  yes indeed the child has been teasing to go for more than a year finally the capn told him if hed be faithful in the ploughing and planting he should go you see hes rather unsteady and apt to be off after other thingsvery different from mara whatever you give her to do she always keeps at it till its done  and pray where is the little lady said the minister is she gone  well capn kittridge came in this afternoon to take her down to see sally the capns always so fond of mara and she has always taken to him ever since she was a baby  the captain is a curious creature said the minister smiling  mrs pennel smiled also and it is to be remarked that nobody ever mentioned the poor captains name without the same curious smile  the capn is a goodhearted obliging creature said mrs pennel and a masterhand for telling stories to the children  yes a perfect arabian nights entertainment said mr sewell  well i really believe the capn believes his own stories said mrs pennel he always seems to and certainly a more obliging man and a kinder neighbor couldnt be he has been in and out almost every day since ive been alone to see if i wanted anything he would insist on chopping wood and splitting kindlings for me though i told him the capn and moses had left a plenty to last till they came home  at this moment the subject of their conversation appeared striding along the beach with a large red lobster in one hand while with the other he held little mara upon his shoulder she the while clapping her hands and singing merrily as she saw the brilliant out on the open blue sea its white sails looking of a rosy purple in the evening light careering gayly homeward  there is captain kittridge this very minute said mrs pennel setting down a teacup she had been wiping and going to the door  good evening mis pennel said the captain i spose you see your folks are comin i brought down one of these ere ready biled cause i thought it might make out your supper  thank you captain you must stay and take some with us  wal me and the children have pooty much done our supper said the captain we made a real fustrate chowder down there to the cove but ill jist stay and see what the capns luck is massy he added as he looked in at the door if you haint got the minister there wal now i come jist as i be he added with a glance down at his clothes  never mind captain said mr sewell im in my fishingclothes so were even  as to little mara she had run down to the beach and stood so near the sea that every dash of the tidewave forced her little feet to tread an inch backward stretching out her hands eagerly toward the schooner which was standing straight toward the small wharf not far from their door already she could see on deck figures moving about and her sharp little eyes made out a small personage in a red shirt that was among the most active soon all the figures grew distinct and she could see her grandfathers gray head and alert active form and could see by the signs he made that he had perceived the little blowy figure that stood with hair streaming in the wind like some flower bent seaward  and now they are come nearer and moses shouts and dances on the deck and the captain and mrs pennel come running from the house down to the shore and a few minutes more and all are landed safe and sound and little mara is carried up to the house in her grandfathers arms while captain kittridge stops to have a few moments gossip with ben halliday and tom scranton before they go to their own restingplaces  meanwhile moses loses not a moment in boasting of his heroic exploits to mara  oh mara youve no idea what times weve had i can fish equal to any of em and i can take in sail and tend the helm like anything and i know all the names of everything and you ought to have seen us catch fish why they bit just as fast as we could throw and it was just throw and bitethrow and bitethrow and bite and my hands got blistered pulling in but i didnt mind iti was determined no one should beat me  oh did you blister your hands said mara pitifully  oh to be sure now you girls think thats a dreadful thing but we men dont mind it my hands are getting so hard youve no idea and mara we caught a great shark  a sharkoh how dreadful isnt he dangerous  dangerous i guess not we served him out i tell you hell never eat any more people i tell you the old wretch  but poor shark it isnt his fault that he eats people he was made so said mara unconsciously touching a deep theological mystery  well i dont know but he was said moses but sharks that we catch never eat any more ill bet you  oh moses did you see any icebergs  icebergs yes we passed right by onea real grand one  were there any bears on it  bears no we didnt see any  captain kittridge says there are white bears live on em  oh captain kittridge said moses with a toss of superb contempt if youre going to believe all he says youve got your hands full  why moses you dont think he tells lies said mara the tears actually starting in her eyes i think he is real good and tells nothing but the truth  well well you are young yet said moses turning away with an air of easy grandeur and only a girl besides he added  mara was nettled at this speech first it pained her to have her childs faith shaken in anything and particularly in her good old friend the captain and next she felt with more force than ever she did before the continual disparaging tone in which moses spoke of her girlhood  im sure she said to herself he oughtnt to feel so about girls and women there was deborah was a prophetess and judged israel and there was egeriashe taught numa pompilius all his wisdom  but it was not the little maidens way to speak when anything thwarted or hurt her but rather to fold all her feelings and thoughts inward as some insects with fine gauzy wings draw them under a coat of horny concealment somehow there was a shivering sense of disappointment in all this meeting with moses she had dwelt upon it and fancied so much and had so many things to say to him and he had come home so selfabsorbed and glorious and seemed to have had so little need of or thought for her that she felt a cold sad sinking at her heart and walking away very still and white sat down demurely by her grandfathers knee  well so my little girl is glad grandfathers come he said lifting her fondly in his arms and putting her golden head under his coat as he had been wont to do from infancy grandpa thought a great deal about his little mara  the small heart swelled against his kind faithful old grandpa how much more he thought about her than moses and yet she had thought so much of moses and there he sat this same ungrateful moses brighteyed and rosycheeked full of talk and gayety full of energy and vigor as ignorant as possible of the wound he had given to the little loving heart that was silently brooding under her grandfathers butternutcolored seacoat not only was he ignorant but he had not even those conditions within himself which made knowledge possible all that there was developed of him at present was a fund of energy selfesteem hope courage and daring the love of action life and adventure his life was in the outward and present not in the inward and reflective he was a true tenyear old boy in its healthiest and most animal perfection what she was the small pearl with the golden hair with her frail and highstrung organization her sensitive nerves her halfspiritual fibres her ponderings and marvels and dreams her power of love and yearning for selfdevotion our readers may perhaps have seen but if ever two children or two grown people thus organized are thrown into intimate relations it follows from the very laws of their being that one must hurt the other simply by being itself one must always hunger for what the other has not to give  it was a merry meal however when they all sat down to the teatable once more and mara by her grandfathers side who often stopped what he was saying to stroke her head fondly moses bore a more prominent part in the conversation than he had been wont to do before this voyage and all seemed to listen to him with a kind of indulgence elders often accord to a handsome manly boy in the first flush of some successful enterprise that ignorant confidence in ones self and ones future which comes in lifes first dawn has a sort of mournful charm in experienced eyes who know how much it all amounts to  gradually little mara quieted herself with listening to and admiring him it is not comfortable to have any heartquarrel with ones cherished idol and everything of the feminine nature therefore can speedily find fifty good reasons for seeing ones self in the wrong and ones graven image in the right and little mara soon had said to herself without words that of course moses couldnt be expected to think as much of her as she of him he was handsomer cleverer and had a thousand other things to do and to think ofhe was a boy in short and going to be a glorious man and sail all over the world while she could only hem handkerchiefs and knit stockings and sit at home and wait for him to come back this was about the résumé of life as it appeared to the little one who went on from the moment worshiping her image with more undivided idolatry than ever hoping that by and by he would think more of her  mr sewell appeared to study moses carefully and thoughtfully and encouraged the wild gleeful frankness which he had brought home from his first voyage as a knowing jockey tries the paces of a highmettled colt  did you get any time to read he interposed once when the boy stopped in his account of their adventures  no sir said moses at least he added blushing very deeply i didnt feel like reading i had so much to do and there was so much to see  its all new to him now said captain pennel but when he comes to being as ive been day after day with nothing but sea and sky hell be glad of a book just to break the sameness  laws yes said captain kittridge sailors life aint all applepie as it seems when a boy first goes on a summer trip with his daddynot by no manner o means  but said mara blushing and looking very eagerly at mr sewell moses has read a great deal he read the roman and the grecian history through before he went away and knows all about them  indeed said mr sewell turning with an amused look towards the tiny little champion do you read them too my little maid  yes indeed said mara her eyes kindling i have read them a great deal since moses went awaythem and the bible  mara did not dare to name her newfound treasurethere was something so mysterious about that that she could not venture to produce it except on the score of extreme intimacy  come sit by me little mara said the minister putting out his hand you and i must be friends i see  mr sewell had a certain something of mesmeric power in his eyes which children seldom resisted and with a shrinking movement as if both attracted and repelled the little girl got upon his knee  so you like the bible and roman history he said to her making a little aside for her while a brisk conversation was going on between captain kittridge and captain pennel on the fishing bounty for the year  yes sir said mara blushing in a very guilty way  and which do you like the best  i dont know sir i sometimes think it is the one and sometimes the other  well what pleases you in the roman history  oh i like that about quintus curtius  quintus curtius said mr sewell pretending not to remember  oh dont you remember him why there was a great gulf opened in the forum and the augurs said that the country would not be saved unless some one would offer himself up for it and so he jumped right in all on horseback i think that was grand i should like to have done that said little mara her eyes blazing out with a kind of starry light which they had when she was excited  and how would you have liked it if you had been a roman girl and moses were quintus curtius would you like to have him give himself up for the good of the country  oh no no said mara instinctively shuddering  dont you think it would be very grand of him  oh yes sir  and shouldnt we wish our friends to do what is brave and grand  yes sir but then she added it would be so dreadful never to see him any more and a large tear rolled from the great soft eyes and fell on the ministers hand  come come thought mr sewell this sort of experimenting is too badtoo much nerve here too much solitude too much pinewhispering and seadashing are going to the making up of this little piece of workmanship  tell me he said motioning moses to sit by him how you like the roman history  i like it firstrate said moses the romans were such smashers and beat everybody nobody could stand against them and i like alexander tooi think he was splendid  true boy said mr sewell to himself unreflecting brother of the wind and the sea and all that is vigorous and activeno precocious development of the moral here  now you have come said mr sewell i will lend you another book  thank you sir i love to read them when im at homeits so still here i should be dull if i didnt  maras eyes looked eagerly attentive mr sewell noticed their hungry look when a book was spoken of  and you must read it too my little girl he said  thank you sir said mara i always want to read everything moses does  what book is it said moses  it is called plutarchs lives said the minister it has more particular accounts of the men you read about in history  are there any lives of women said mara  no my dear said mr sewell in the old times women did not get their lives written though i dont doubt many of them were much better worth writing than the mens  i should like to be a great general said moses with a toss of his head  the way to be great lies through books now and not through battles said the minister there is more done with pens than swords so if you want to do anything you must read and study  do you think of giving this boy a liberal education said mr sewell some time later in the evening after moses and mara were gone to bed  depends on the boy said zephaniah ive been up to brunswick and seen the fellows there in the college with a good many of em going to college seems to be just nothing but a sort of ceremony they go because theyre sent and dont learn anything moren they can help thats what i call waste of time and money  but dont you think moses shows some taste for reading and study  pretty well pretty well said zephaniah jist keep him a little hungry not let him get all he wants you see and hell bite the sharper if i want to catch cod i dont begin with flingin over a barrel o bait so with the boys jist bait em with a book here and a book there and kind o let em feel their own way and then if nothin will do but a fellow must go to college give in to himthatd be my way  and a very good one too said mr sewell ill see if i cant bait my hook so as to make moses take after latin this winter i shall have plenty of time to teach him  now theres mara said the captain his face becoming phosphorescent with a sort of mild radiance of pleasure as it usually was when he spoke of her shes real sharp set after books shes ready to fly out of her little skin at the sight of one  that child thinks too much and feels too much and knows too much for her years said mr sewell if she were a boy and you would take her away codfishing as you have moses the seawinds would blow away some of the thinking and her little body would grow stout and her mind less delicate and sensitive but shes a woman he said with a sigh and they are all alike we cant do much for them but let them come up as they will and make the best of it     chapter xvi  the natural and the spiritual   emily said mr sewell did you ever take much notice of that little mara lincoln  no brother why  because i think her a very uncommon child  she is a pretty little creature said miss emily but that is all i know modestblushing to her eyes when a stranger speaks to her  she has wonderful eyes said mr sewell when she gets excited they grow so large and so bright it seems almost unnatural  dear me has she said miss emily in a tone of one who had been called upon to do something about it well she added inquiringly  that little thing is only seven years old said mr sewell and she is thinking and feeling herself all into mere spiritbrain and nerves all active and her little body so frail she reads incessantly and thinks over and over what she reads  well said miss emily winding very swiftly on a skein of black silk and giving a little twitch every now and then to a knot to make it subservient  it was commonly the way when mr sewell began to talk with miss emily that she constantly answered him with the manner of one who expects some immediate practical proposition to flow from every train of thought now mr sewell was one of the reflecting kind of men whose thoughts have a thousand meandering paths that lead nowhere in particular his sisters brisk little wells and ahs and indeeds were sometimes the least bit in the world annoying  what is to be done said miss emily shall we speak to mrs pennel  mrs pennel would know nothing about her  how strangely you talkwho should if she doesnt  i mean she wouldnt understand the dangers of her case  dangers do you think she has any disease she seems to be a healthy child enough im sure she has a lovely color in her cheeks  mr sewell seemed suddenly to become immersed in a book he was reading  there now said miss emily with a little tone of pique thats the way you always do you begin to talk with me and just as i get interested in the conversation you take up a book its too bad  emily said mr sewell laying down his book i think i shall begin to give moses pennel latin lessons this winter  why what do you undertake that for said miss emily you have enough to do without that im sure  he is an uncommonly bright boy and he interests me  now brother you neednt tell me there is some mystery about the interest you take in that child you know there is  i am fond of children said mr sewell dryly  well but you dont take as much interest in other boys i never heard of your teaching any of them latin before  well emily he is an uncommonly interesting child and the providential circumstances under which he came into our neighborhood  providential fiddlesticks said miss emily with heightened color i believe you knew that boys mother  this sudden thrust brought a vivid color into mr sewells cheeks to be interrupted so unceremoniously in the midst of so very proper and ministerial a remark was rather provoking and he answered with some asperity  and suppose i had emily and supposing there were any painful subject connected with this past event you might have sufficient forbearance not to try to make me speak on what i do not wish to talk of  mr sewell was one of your gentle dignified men from whom heaven deliver an inquisitive female friend if such people would only get angry and blow some unbecoming blast one might make something of them but speaking as they always do from the serene heights of immaculate propriety one gets in the wrong before one knows it and has nothing for it but to beg pardon miss emily had however a feminine resource she began to crywisely confining herself to the simple eloquence of tears and sobs mr sewell sat as awkwardly as if he had trodden on a kittens toe or brushed down a china cup feeling as if he were a great horrid clumsy boor and his poor little sister a martyr  come emily he said in a softer tone when the sobs subsided a little  but emily didnt come but went at it with a fresh burst mr sewell had a vision like that which drowning men are said to have in which all miss emilys sisterly devotions stockingdarnings accountkeepings nursings and tendings and infinite selfsacrifices rose up before him and there she wascrying  im sorry i spoke harshly emily come come thats a good girl  im a silly fool said miss emily lifting her head and wiping the tears from her merry little eyes as she went on winding her silk  perhaps he will tell me now she thought as she wound  but he didnt  what i was going to say emily said her brother was that i thought it would be a good plan for little mara to come sometimes with moses and then by observing her more particularly you might be of use to her her little active mind needs good practical guidance like yours  mr sewell spoke in a gentle flattering tone and miss emily was flattered but she soon saw that she had gained nothing by the whole breeze except a little kind of dread which made her inwardly resolve never to touch the knocker of his fortress again but she entered into her brothers scheme with the facile alacrity with which she usually seconded any schemes of his proposing  i might teach her painting and embroidery said miss emily glancing with a satisfied air at a framed piece of her own work which hung over the mantelpiece revealing the state of the fine arts in this country as exhibited in the performances of wellinstructed young ladies of that period miss emily had performed it under the tuition of a celebrated teacher of female accomplishments it represented a white marble obelisk which an inscription in legible india ink letters stated to be sacred to the memory of theophilus sewell etc this obelisk stood in the midst of a ground made very green by an embroidery of different shades of chenille and silk and was overshadowed by an embroidered weepingwillow leaning on it with her face concealed in a plentiful flow of white handkerchief was a female figure in deep mourning designed to represent the desolate widow a young girl in a very black dress knelt in front of it and a very lugubriouslooking young man standing bolt upright on the other side seemed to hold in his hand one end of a wreath of roses which the girl was presenting as an appropriate decoration for the tomb the girl and gentleman were of course the young theophilus and miss emily and the appalling grief conveyed by the expression of their faces was a triumph of the pictorial art  miss emily had in her bedroom a similar funeral trophy sacred to the memory of her deceased motherbesides which there were framed and glazed in the little sittingroom two embroidered shepherdesses standing with rueful faces in charge of certain animals of an uncertain breed between sheep and pigs the poor little soul had mentally resolved to make mara the heiress of all the skill and knowledge of the arts by which she had been enabled to consummate these marvels  she is naturally a ladylike little thing she said to herself and if i know anything of accomplishments she shall have them  just about the time that miss emily came to this resolution had she been clairvoyant she might have seen mara sitting very quietly busy in the solitude of her own room with a little sprig of partridgeberry before her whose round green leaves and brilliant scarlet berries she had been for hours trying to imitate as appeared from the scattered sketches and fragments around her in fact before zephaniah started on his spring fishing he had caught her one day very busy at work of the same kind with bits of charcoal and some colors compounded out of wild berries and so out of his capacious pocket after his return he drew a little box of watercolors and a leadpencil and square of indiarubber which he had bought for her in portland on his way home  hour after hour the child works so still so fervent so earnestgoing over and over time after time her simple ignorant methods to make it look like and stopping at times to give the true artists sigh as the little green and scarlet fragment lies there hopelessly unapproachably perfect ignorantly to herself the hands of the little pilgrim are knocking at the very door where giotto and cimabue knocked in the innocent childlife of italian art  why wont it look round she said to moses who had come in behind her  why mara did you do these said moses astonished why how well they are done i should know in a minute what they were meant for  mara flushed up at being praised by moses but heaved a deep sigh as she looked back  its so pretty that sprig she said if i only could make it just like  why nobody expects that said moses its like enough if people only know what you mean it for but come now get your bonnet and come with me in the boat captain kittridge has just brought down our new one and im going to take you over to eagle island and well take our dinner and stay all day mother says so  oh how nice said the little girl running cheerfully for her sunbonnet  at the housedoor they met mrs pennel with a little closely covered tin pail  heres your dinner children and moses mind and take good care of her  never fear me mother ive been to the banks there wasnt a man there could manage a boat better than i could  yes grandmother said mara you ought to see how strong his arms are i believe he will be like samson one of these days if he keeps on  so away they went it was a glorious august forenoon and the sombre spruces and shaggy hemlocks that dipped and rippled in the waters were penetrated to their deepest recesses with the clear brilliancy of the skya true northern sky without a cloud without even a softening haze defining every outline revealing every minute point cutting with sharp decision the form of every promontory and rock and distant island  the blue of the sea and the blue of the sky were so much the same that when the children had rowed far out the little boat seemed to float midway poised in the centre of an azure sphere with a firmament above and a firmament below mara leaned dreamily over the side of the boat and drew her little hands through the waters as they rippled along to the swift oars strokes and she saw as the waves broke and divided and shivered around the boat a hundred little faces with brown eyes and golden hair gleaming up through the water and dancing away over rippling waves and thought that so the seanymphs might look who came up from the coral caves when they ring the knell of drowned people moses sat opposite to her with his coat off and his heavy black curls more wavy and glossy than ever as the exercise made them damp with perspiration  eagle island lay on the blue sea a tangled thicket of evergreenswhite pine spruce arbor vitæ and fragrant silver firs a little strip of white beach bound it like a silver setting to a gem and there moses at length moored his boat and the children landed the island was wholly solitary and there is something to children quite delightful in feeling that they have a little lonely world all to themselves childhood is itself such an enchanted island separated by mysterious depths from the mainland of nature life and reality  moses had subsided a little from the glorious heights on which he seemed to be in the first flush of his return and he and mara in consequence were the friends of old time it is true he thought himself quite a man but the manhood of a boy is only a tiny masqueradea fantastic dreamy prevision of real manhood it was curious that mara who was by all odds the most precociously developed of the two never thought of asserting herself a woman in fact she seldom thought of herself at all but dreamed and pondered of almost everything else  i declare said moses looking up into a thickbranched rugged old hemlock which stood all shaggy with heavy beards of gray moss drooping from its branches theres an eagles nest up there i mean to go and see and up he went into the gloomy embrace of the old tree crackling the dead branches wrenching off handfuls of gray moss rising higher and higher every once in a while turning and showing to mara his glowing face and curly hair through a dusky green frame of boughs and then mounting again im coming to it he kept exclaiming  meanwhile his proceedings seemed to create a sensation among the feathered housekeepers one of whom rose and sailed screaming away into the air in a moment after there was a swoop of wings and two eagles returned and began flapping and screaming about the head of the boy  mara who stood at the foot of the tree could not see clearly what was going on for the thickness of the boughs she only heard a great commotion and rattling of the branches the scream of the birds and the swooping of their wings and mosess valorous exclamations as he seemed to be laying about him with a branch which he had broken off  at last he descended victorious with the eggs in his pocket mara stood at the foot of the tree with her sunbonnet blown back her hair streaming and her little arms upstretched as if to catch him if he fell  oh i was so afraid she said as he set foot on the ground  afraid pooh whos afraid why you might know the old eagles couldnt beat me  ah well i know how strong you are but you know i couldnt help it but the poor birdsdo hear em scream moses dont you suppose they feel bad  no theyre only mad to think they couldnt beat me i beat them just as the romans used to beat folksi played their nest was a city and i spoiled it  i shouldnt want to spoil cities said mara  thats cause you are a girlim a man and men always like war ive taken one city this afternoon and mean to take a great many more  but moses do you think war is right  right why yes to be sure if it aint its a pity for its all that has ever been done in this world in the bible or out certainly its right i wish i had a gun now id stop those old eagles screeching  but moses we shouldnt want any one to come and steal all our things and then shoot us  how long you do think about things said moses impatient at her pertinacity i am older than you and when i tell you a things right you ought to believe it besides dont you take hens eggs every day in the barn how do you suppose the hens like that  this was a homethrust and for the moment threw the little casuist off the track she carefully folded up the idea and laid it away on the inner shelves of her mind till she could think more about it pliable as she was to all outward appearances the child had her own still interior world where all her little notions and opinions stood up crisp and fresh like flowers that grow in cool shady places if anybody too rudely assailed a thought or suggestion she put forth she drew it back again into this quiet inner chamber and went on reader there are some women of this habit and there is no independence and pertinacity of opinion like that of these seemingly soft quiet creatures whom it is so easy to silence and so difficult to convince mara little and unformed as she yet was belonged to the race of those spirits to whom is deputed the office of the angel in the apocalypse to whom was given the golden rod which measured the new jerusalem infant though she was she had ever in her hands that invisible measuringrod which she was laying to the foundations of all actions and thoughts there may perhaps come a time when the saucy boy who now steps so superbly and predominates so proudly in virtue of his physical strength and daring will learn to tremble at the golden measuringrod held in the hand of a woman  howbeit that is not first which is spiritual but that which is natural moses is the type of the first unreflecting stage of development in which are only the outreachings of active faculties the aspirations that tend toward manly accomplishments seldom do we meet sensitiveness of conscience or discriminating reflection as the indigenous growth of a very vigorous physical development your true healthy boy has the breezy hearty virtues of a newfoundland dog the wild fullness of life of the young racecolt sentiment sensibility delicate perceptions spiritual aspirations are plants of later growth  but there are both of men and women beings born into this world in whom from childhood the spiritual and the reflective predominate over the physical in relation to other human beings they seem to be organized much as birds are in relation to other animals they are the artists the poets the unconscious seers to whom the purer truths of spiritual instruction are open surveying man merely as an animal these sensitively organized beings with their feebler physical powers are imperfect specimens of life looking from the spiritual side they seem to have a noble strength a divine force the types of this latter class are more commonly among women than among men multitudes of them pass away in earlier years and leave behind in many hearts the anxious wonder why they came so fair only to mock the love they kindled they who live to maturity are the priests and priestesses of the spiritual life ordained of god to keep the balance between the rude but absolute necessities of physical life and the higher sphere to which that must at length give place     chapter xvii  lessons   moses felt elevated some inches in the world by the gift of a new latin grammar which had been bought for him in brunswick it was a step upward in life no graduate from a college ever felt more ennobled  wal now i tell ye moses pennel said miss roxy who with her pressboard and big flatiron was making her autumn sojourn in the brown house i tell ye latin aint just what you think tis steppin round so crank you must remember what the king of israel said to benhadad king of syria  i dont remember what did he say  i remember said the soft voice of mara he said let not him that putteth on the harness boast as him that putteth it off  good for you mara said miss roxy if some other folks read their bibles as much as you do theyd know more  between moses and miss roxy there had always been a state of subacute warfare since the days of his first arrival she regarding him as an unhopeful interloper and he regarding her as a grimvisaged interfering gnome whom he disliked with all the intense unreasoning antipathy of childhood  i hate that old woman he said to mara as he flung out of the door  why moses what for said mara who never could comprehend hating anybody  i do hate her and aunt ruey too they are two old scratching cats they hate me and i hate them theyre always trying to bring me down and i wont be brought down  mara had sufficient instinctive insight into the feminine rôle in the domestic concert not to adventure a direct argument just now in favor of her friends and therefore she proposed that they should sit down together under a cedar hard by and look over the first lesson  miss emily invited me to go over with you she said and i should like so much to hear you recite  moses thought this very proper as would any other male person young or old who has been habitually admired by any other female one he did not doubt that as in fishing and rowing and all other things he had undertaken as yet he should win himself distinguished honors  see here he said mr sewell told me i might go as far as i liked and i mean to take all the declensions to begin with theres five of em and i shall learn them for the first lesson then i shall take the adjectives next and next the verbs and so in a fortnight get into reading  mara heaved a sort of sigh she wished she had been invited to share this glorious race but she looked on admiring when moses read in a loud voice penna pennæ pennæ pennam etc  there now i believe ive got it he said handing mara the book and he was perfectly astonished to find that with the book withdrawn he boggled and blundered and stumbled ingloriously in vain mara softly prompted and looked at him with pitiful eyes as he grew red in the face with his efforts to remember  confound it all he said with an angry flush snatching back the book its more trouble than its worth  again he began the repetition saying it very loud and plain he said it over and over till his mind wandered far out to sea and while his tongue repeated penna pennæ he was counting the white sails of the fishingsmacks and thinking of pulling up codfish at the banks  there now mara try me he said and handed her the book again im sure i must know it now  but alas with the book the sounds glided away and penna and pennam and pennis and pennæ were confusedly and indiscriminately mingled he thought it must be maras fault she didnt read right or she told him just as he was going to say it or she didnt tell him right or was he a fool or had he lost his senses  that first declension has been a valley of humiliation to many a sturdy boyto many a bright one too and often it is that the more full of thought and vigor the mind is the more difficult it is to narrow it down to the single dry issue of learning those sounds heinrich heine said the romans would never have found time to conquer the world if they had had to learn their own language but that luckily for them they were born into the knowledge of what nouns form their accusatives in um  long before moses had learned the first declension mara knew it by heart for her intense anxiety for him and the eagerness and zeal with which she listened for each termination fixed them in her mind besides she was naturally of a more quiet and scholarlike turn than hemore intellectually developed moses began to think before that memorable day was through that there was some sense in aunt roxys quotation of the saying of the king of israel and materially to retrench his expectations as to the time it might take to master the grammar but still his pride and will were both committed and he worked away in this new sort of labor with energy  it was a fine frosty november morning when he rowed mara across the bay in a little boat to recite his first lesson to mr sewell  miss emily had provided a plate of seedcake otherwise called cookies for the children as was a kindly custom of old times when the little people were expected miss emily had a dim idea that she was to do something for mara in her own department while moses was reciting his lesson and therefore producing a large sampler displaying every form and variety of markingstitch she began questioning the little girl in a low tone as to her proficiency in that useful accomplishment  presently however she discovered that the child was restless and uneasy and that she answered without knowing what she was saying the fact was that she was listening with her whole soul in her eyes and feeling through all her nerves every word moses was saying she knew all the critical places where he was likely to go wrong and when at last in one place he gave the wrong termination she involuntarily called out the right one starting up and turning towards them in a moment she blushed deeply seeing mr sewell and miss emily both looking at her with surprise  come here pussy said mr sewell stretching out his hand to her can you say this  i believe i could sir  well try it  she went through without missing a word mr sewell then for curiosity heard her repeat all the other forms of the lesson she had them perfectly  very well my little girl he said have you been studying too  i heard moses say them so often said mara in an apologetic manner i couldnt help learning them  would you like to recite with moses every day  oh yes sir so much  well you shall it is better for him to have company  maras face brightened and miss emily looked with a puzzled air at her brother  so she said when the children had gone home i thought you wanted me to take mara under my care i was going to begin and teach her some marking stitches and you put her up to studying latin i dont understand you  well emily the fact is the child has a natural turn for study that no child of her age ought to have and i have done just as people always will with such children theres no sense in it but i wanted to do it you can teach her marking and embroidery all the same it would break her little heart now if i were to turn her back  i do not see of what use latin can be to a woman  of what use is embroidery  why that is an accomplishment  ah indeed said mr sewell contemplating the weeping willow and tombstone trophy with a singular expression which it was lucky for miss emilys peace she did not understand the fact was that mr sewell had at one period of his life had an opportunity of studying and observing minutely some really fine works of art and the remembrance of them sometimes rose up to his mind in the presence of the chefsdoeuvre on which his sister rested with so much complacency it was a part of his quiet interior store of amusement to look at these bits of byzantine embroidery round the room which affected him always with a subtle sense of drollery  you see brother said miss emily it is far better for women to be accomplished than learned  you are quite right in the main said mr sewell only you must let me have my own way just for once one cant be consistent always  so another latin grammar was bought and moses began to feel a secret respect for his little companion that he had never done before when he saw how easily she walked through the labyrinths which at first so confused him before this the comparison had been wholly in points where superiority arose from physical daring and vigor now he became aware of the existence of another kind of strength with which he had not measured himself maras opinion in their mutual studies began to assume a value in his eyes that her opinions on other subjects had never done and she saw and felt with a secret gratification that she was becoming more to him through their mutual pursuit to say the truth it required this fellowship to inspire moses with the patience and perseverance necessary for this species of acquisition his active daring temperament little inclined him to patient quiet study for anything that could be done by two hands he was always ready but to hold hands still and work silently in the inner forces was to him a species of undertaking that seemed against his very nature but then he would do ithe would not disgrace himself before mr sewell and let a girl younger than himself outdo him  but the thing after all that absorbed more of mosess thoughts than all his lessons was the building and rigging of a small schooner at which he worked assiduously in all his leisure moments he had dozens of blocks of wood into which he had cut anchor moulds and the melting of lead the running and shaping of anchors the whittling of masts and spars took up many an hour mara entered into all those things readily and was too happy to make herself useful in hemming the sails  when the schooner was finished they built some ways down by the sea and invited sally kittridge over to see it launched  there he said when the little thing skimmed down prosperously into the sea and floated gayly on the waters when im a man ill have a big ship ill build her and launch her and command her all myself and ill give you and sally both a passage in it and well go off to the east indieswell sail round the world  none of the three doubted the feasibility of this scheme the little vessel they had just launched seemed the visible prophecy of such a future and how pleasant it would be to sail off with the world all before them and winds ready to blow them to any port they might wish  the three children arranged some bread and cheese and doughnuts on a rock on the shore to represent the collation that was usually spread in those parts at a ship launch and felt quite like grown peopleacting life beforehand in that sort of shadowy pantomime which so delights little people happy happy dayswhen ships can be made with a jackknife and anchors run in pine blocks and three children together can launch a schooner and the voyage of the world can all be made in one sunny saturday afternoon  mother says you are going to college said sally to moses  not i indeed said moses as soon as i get old enough im going up to umbagog among the lumberers and im going to cut real splendid timber for my ship and im going to get it on the stocks and have it built to suit myself  what will you call her said sally  i havent thought of that said moses  call her the ariel said mara  what after the spirit you were telling us about said sally  ariel is a pretty name said moses but what is that about a spirit  why said sally mara read us a story about a ship that was wrecked and a spirit called ariel that sang a song about the drowned mariners  mara gave a shy apprehensive glance at moses to see if this allusion called up any painful recollections  no instead of this he was following the motions of his little schooner on the waters with the briskest and most unconcerned air in the world  why didnt you ever show me that story mara said moses  mara colored and hesitated the real reason she dared not say  why she read it to father and me down by the cove said sally the afternoon that you came home from the banks i remember how we saw you coming in dont you mara  what have you done with it said moses  ive got it at home said mara in a faint voice ill show it to you if you want to see it there are such beautiful things in it  that evening as moses sat busy making some alterations in his darling schooner mara produced her treasure and read and explained to him the story he listened with interest though without any of the extreme feeling which mara had thought possible and even interrupted her once in the middle of the celebrated      full fathom five thy father lies  by asking her to hold up the mast a minute while he drove in a peg to make it rake a little more he was evidently thinking of no drowned father and dreaming of no possible seacaves but acutely busy in fashioning a present reality and yet he liked to hear mara read and when she had done told her that he thought it was a prettyquite a pretty story with such a total absence of recognition that the story had any affinities with his own history that mara was quite astonished  she lay and thought about him hours that night after she had gone to bed and he lay and thought about a new way of disposing a pulley for raising a sail which he determined to try the effect of early in the morning  what was the absolute truth in regard to the boy had he forgotten the scenes of his early life the strange catastrophe that cast him into his present circumstances to this we answer that all the efforts of nature during the early years of a healthy childhood are bent on effacing and obliterating painful impressions wiping out from each day the sorrows of the last as the daily tide effaces the furrows on the seashore the child that broods day after day over some fixed idea is so far forth not a healthy one it is natures way to make first a healthy animal and then develop in it gradually higher faculties we have seen our two children unequally matched hitherto because unequally developed there will come a time by and by in the history of the boy when the haze of dreamy curiosity will steam up likewise from his mind and vague yearnings and questionings and longings possess and trouble him but it must be some years hence                                       here for a season we leave both our child friends and when ten years have passed over their headswhen moses shall be twenty and mara seventeenwe will return again to tell their story for then there will be one to tell let us suppose in the interval how moses and mara read virgil with the minister and how mara works a shepherdess with miss emily which astonishes the neighborhoodbut how by herself she learns after divers trials to paint partridge and checkerberry and trailing arbutushow moses makes better and better ships and sally grows up a handsome girl and goes up to brunswick to the high schoolhow captain kittridge tells stories and miss roxy and miss ruey nurse and cut and make and mend for the still rising generationhow there are quiltings and teadrinkings and prayer meetings and sunday sermonshow zephaniah and mary pennel grow old gradually and graciously as the sun rises and sets and the eternal silver tide rises and falls around our little gem orrs island     chapter xviii  sally   now wheres sally kittridge theres the clock striking five and nobody to set the table sally i say sally  why mis kittridge said the captain sallys gone out moren an hour ago and i expect shes gone down to pennels to see mara cause you know she come home from portland today  well if shes come home i spose i may as well give up havin any good of sally for that girl fairly bows down to mara lincoln and worships her  well good reason said the captain there aint a puttier creature breathin im amost a mind to worship her myself  captain kittridge you ought to be ashamed of yourself at your age talking as you do  why laws mother i dont feel my age said the frisky captain giving a sort of skip it dont seem moren yesterday since you and i was acourtin polly what a life you did lead me in them days i think you kep me on the anxious seat a pretty middlin spell  i do wish you wouldnt talk so you ought to be ashamed to be triflin round as you

use of bein gals and young and putty if they cant get together and talk about their new gownds and the fellers that ars what gals is for  i do wish you wouldnt talk in that way before sally father for her head is full of all sorts of vanity now and as to mara i never did see a more slacktwisted flimsy thing than shes grown up to be now sallys learnt to do something thanks to me she can brew and she can make bread and cake and pickles and spin and cut and make but as to mara what does she do why she paints picturs mis pennel was ashowin on me a bluejay she painted and i was athinkin whether she could brile a bird fit to be eat if she tried and she dont know the price of nothin continued mrs kittridge with wasteful profusion of negatives  well said the captain the lord makes some things jist to be looked at their work is to be putty and that ars maras sphere it never seemed to me she was cut out for hard work but shes got sweet ways and kind words for everybody and its as good as a psalm to look at her  and what sort of a wifell she make captain kittridge  a real sweet putty one said the captain persistently  well as to beauty id rather have our sally any day said mrs kittridge and she looks strong and hearty and seems to be good for use  so she is so she is said the captain with fatherly pride sallys the very image of her ma at her ageblack eyes black hair tall and trim as a

bottom of sallys bein up there said mrs kittridge  mis kittridge said the captain i take it you aint the woman as would expect a daughter of your bringin up to be arunnin after any young chap be he who he may said the captain  mrs kittridge for once was fairly silenced by this homethrust nevertheless she did not the less think it quite possible from all that she knew of sally for although that young lady professed great hardness of heart and contempt for all the young male generation of her acquaintance yet she had evidently a turn for observing their waysprobably purely in the way of philosophical inquiry     chapter xix  eighteen   in fact at this very moment our sceneshifter changes the picture away rolls the image of mrs kittridges kitchen with its sanded floor its scoured rows of bright pewter platters its great deep fireplace with wide stone hearth its little lookingglass with a bit of asparagus bush like a green mist over it exeunt the image of mrs kittridge with her hands floury from the bread she has been moulding and the dry ropy lean captain who has been sitting tilting back in a splintbottomed chairand the next scene comes rolling in it is a chamber in the house of zephaniah pennel whose windows present a blue panorama of sea and sky through two windows you look forth into the blue belt of harpswell bay bordered on the farther edge by harpswell neck dotted here and there with houses among which rises the little white meetinghouse like a motherbird among a flock of chickens the third window on the other side of the room looks far out to sea where only a group of low rocky islands interrupts the clear sweep of the horizon line with its blue infinitude of distance  the furniture of this room though of the barest and most frigid simplicity is yet relieved by many of those touches of taste and fancy which the indwelling of a person of sensibility and imagination will shed off upon the physical surroundings the bed was draped with a white spread embroidered with a kind of knotted tracery the working of which was considered among the female accomplishments of those days and over the head of it was a painting of a bunch of crimson and white trillium executed with a fidelity to nature that showed the most delicate gifts of observation over the mantelpiece hung a painting of the bay of genoa which had accidentally found a voyage home in zephaniah pennels seachest and which skillful fingers had surrounded with a frame curiously wrought of moss and seashells two vases of india china stood on the mantel filled with spring flowers crowfoot anemones and liverwort with drooping bells of the twinflower the lookingglass that hung over the table in one corner of the room was fancifully webbed with long drooping festoons of that gray moss which hangs in such graceful wreaths from the boughs of the pines in the deep forest shadows of orrs island on the table below was a collection of books a whole set of shakespeare which zephaniah pennel had bought of a portland bookseller a selection in prose and verse from the best classic writers presented to mara lincoln the flyleaf said by her sincere friend theophilus sewell a virgil much thumbed with an old worn cover which however some adroit fingers had concealed under a coating of delicately marbled paperthere was a latin dictionary a set of plutarchs lives the mysteries of udolpho and sir charles grandison together with edwards on the affections and bostons fourfold statethere was an inkstand curiously contrived from a seashell with pens and paper in that phase of arrangement which betokened frequency of use and lastly a little workbasket containing a long strip of curious and delicate embroidery in which the needle yet hanging showed that the work was in progress  by a table at the sealooking window sits our little mara now grown to the maturity of eighteen summers but retaining still unmistakable signs of identity with the little goldenhaired dreamy excitable fanciful pearl of orrs island  she is not quite of a middle height with something beautiful and childlike about the moulding of her delicate form we still see those sad wistful hazel eyes over which the lids droop with a dreamy languor and whose dark lustre contrasts singularly with the golden hue of the abundant hair which waves in a thousand rippling undulations around her face the impression she produces is not that of paleness though there is no color in her cheek but her complexion has everywhere that delicate pink tinting which one sees in healthy infants and with the least emotion brightens into a fluttering bloom such a bloom is on her cheek at this moment as she is working away copying a bunch of scarlet rockcolumbine which is in a wineglass of water before her every few moments stopping and holding her work at a distance to contemplate its effect at this moment there steps behind her chair a tall lithe figure a face with a rich spanish complexion large black eyes glowing cheeks marked eyebrows and lustrous black hair arranged in shining braids around her head it is our old friend sally kittridge whom common fame calls the handsomest girl of all the region round harpswell maquoit and orrs island in truth a wholesome ruddy blooming creature she was the sight of whom cheered and warmed one like a good fire in december and she seemed to have enough and to spare of the warmest gifts of vitality and joyous animal life she had a wellformed mouth but rather large and a frank laugh which showed all her teeth soundand a fortunate sight it was considering that they were white and even as pearls and the hand that she laid upon maras at this moment though twice as large as that of the little artist was yet in harmony with her vigorous finely developed figure  mara lincoln she said you are a witch a perfect little witch at painting how you can make things look so like i dont see now i could paint the things we painted at miss pluchers but then dear me they didnt look at all like flowers one needed to write under them what they were made for  does this look like to you sally said mara i wish it would to me just see what a beautiful clear color that flower is all i can do i cant make one like it my scarlet and yellows sink dead into the paper  why i think your flowers are wonderful you are a real genius thats what you are i am only a common girl i cant do things as you can  you can do things a thousand times more useful sally i dont pretend to compare with you in the useful arts and i am only a bungler in ornamental ones sally i feel like a useless little creature if i could go round as you can and do business and make bargains and push ahead in the world i should feel that i was good for something but somehow i cant  to be sure you cant said sally laughing i should like to see you try it  now pursued mara in a tone of lamentation i could no more get into a carriage and drive to brunswick as you can than i could fly i cant drive sallysomething is the matter with me and the horses always know it the minute i take the reins they always twitch their ears and stare round into the chaise at me as much as to say what you there and i feel sure they never will mind me and then how you can make those wonderful bargains you do i cant seeyou talk up to the clerks and the men and somehow you talk everybody round but as for me if i only open my mouth in the humblest way to dispute the price everybody puts me down i always tremble when i go into a store and people talk to me just as if i was a little girl and once or twice they have made me buy things that i knew i didnt want just because they will talk me down  oh mara mara said sally laughing till the tears rolled down her cheeks what do you ever go ashopping forof course you ought always to send me why look at this dressreal india chintz do you know i made old pennywhistles clerk up in brunswick give it to me just for the price of common cotton you see there was a yard of it had got faded by lying in the shopwindow and there were one or two holes and imperfections in it and you ought to have heard the talk i made i abused it to right and left and actually at last i brought the poor wretch to believe that he ought to be grateful to me for taking it off his hands well you see the dress ive made of it the imperfections didnt hurt it the least in the world as i managed itand the faded breadth makes a good apron so you see and just so i got that red spotted flannel dress i wore last winter it was motheaten in one or two places and i made them let me have it at halfpricemade exactly as good a dress but after all mara i cant trim a bonnet as you can and i cant come up to your embroidery nor your lacework nor i cant draw and paint as you can and i cant sing like you and then as to all those things you talk with mr sewell about why theyre beyond my depththats all ive got to say now you are made to have poetry written to you and all that kind of thing one reads of in novels nobody would ever think of writing poetry to me now or sending me flowers and rings and such things if a fellow likes me he gives me a quince or a big apple but then mara there aint any fellows round here that are fit to speak to  im sure sally there always is a train following you everywhere at singingschool and thursday lecture  yesbut what do i care for em said sally with a toss of her head why they follow me i dont see i dont do anything to make em and i tell em all that they tire me to death and still they will hang round what is the reason do you suppose  what can it be said mara with a quiet kind of arch drollery which suffused her face as she bent over her painting  well you know i cant bear fellowsi think they are hateful  what even tom hiers said mara continuing her painting  tom hiers do you suppose i care for him he would insist on waiting on me round all last winter taking me over in his boat to portland and up in his sleigh to brunswick but i didnt care for him  well theres jimmy wilson up at brunswick  what that little snip of a clerk you dont suppose i care for him do youonly he almost runs his head off following me round when i go up there shopping hes nothing but a little dressedup yardstick i never saw a fellow yet that id cross the street to have another look at by the by mara miss roxy told me sunday that moses was coming down from umbagog this week  yes he is said mara we are looking for him every day  you must want to see him how long is it since you saw him  it is three years said mara i scarcely know what he is like now i was visiting in boston when he came home from his threeyears voyage and he was gone into the lumbering country when i came back he seems almost a stranger to me  hes pretty goodlooking said sally i saw him on sunday when he was here but he was off on monday and never called on old friends does he write to you often  not very said mara in fact almost never and when he does there is so little in his letters  well i tell you mara you must not expect fellows to write as girls can they dont do it now our boys when they write home they tell the latitude and longitude and soil and productions and such things but if you or i were only there dont you think we should find something more to say of course we shouldfifty thousand little things that they never think of  mara made no reply to this but went on very intently with her painting a close observer might have noticed a suppressed sigh that seemed to retreat far down into her heart sally did not notice it  what was in that sigh it was the sigh of a long deep inner history unwritten and untoldsuch as are transpiring daily by thousands and of which we take no heed     chapter xx  rebellion   we have introduced mara to our readers as she appears in her seventeenth year at the time when she is expecting the return of moses as a young man of twenty but we cannot do justice to the feelings which are roused in her heart by this expectation without giving a chapter or two to tracing the history of moses since we left him as a boy commencing the study of the latin grammar with mr sewell the reader must see the forces that acted upon his early development and what they have made of him  it is common for people who write treatises on education to give forth their rules and theories with a selfsatisfied air as if a human being were a thing to be made up like a batch of bread out of a given number of materials combined by an infallible recipe take your child and do thus and so for a given number of years and he comes out a thoroughly educated individual  but in fact education is in many cases nothing more than a blind struggle of parents and guardians with the evolutions of some strong predetermined character individual obstinate unreceptive and seeking by an inevitable law of its being to develop itself and gain free expression in its own way captain kittridges confidence that he would as soon undertake a boy as a newfoundland pup is good for those whose idea of what is to be done for a human being are only what would be done for a dog namely give food shelter and worldroom and leave each to act out his own nature without let or hindrance  but everybody takes an embryo human being with some plan of ones own what it shall do or be the childs future shall shape out some darling purpose or plan and fulfill some long unfulfilled expectation of the parent and thus though the wind of every generation sweeps its hopes and plans like forestleaves none are whirled and tossed with more piteous moans than those which come out green and fresh to shade the happy springtime of the cradle for the temperaments of children are often as oddly unsuited to parents as if capricious fairies had been filling cradles with changelings  a meek member of the peace society a tender devout poetical clergyman receives an heir from heaven and straightway devotes him to the christian ministry but lo the boy proves a young warhorse neighing for battle burning for gunpowder and guns for bowieknives and revolvers and for every form and expression of physical forcehe might make a splendid trapper an energetic seacaptain a bold daring military man but his whole boyhood is full of rebukes and disciplines for sins which are only the blind effort of the creature to express a nature which his parent does not and cannot understand so again the son that was to have upheld the old proud merchants timehonored firm that should have been mighty in ledgers and great upon change breaks his fathers heart by an unintelligible fancy for weaving poems and romances a father of literary aspirations balked of privileges of early education bends over the cradle of his son with but one idea this child shall have the full advantages of regular collegetraining and so for years he battles with a boy abhorring study and fitted only for a life of outdoor energy and bold adventureon whom latin forms and greek quantities fall and melt aimless and useless as snowflakes on the hide of a buffalo then the secret agoniesthe long years of sorrowful watchings of those gentler nurses of humanity who receive the infant into their bosom out of the void unknown and strive to read its horoscope through the mists of their prayers and tearswhat perplexitieswhat confusion especially is this so in a community where the moral and religious sense is so cultivated as in new england and frail trembling selfdistrustful mothers are told that the shaping and ordering not only of this present life but of an immortal destiny is in their hands  on the whole those who succeed best in the rearing of children are the tolerant and easy persons who instinctively follow nature and accept without much inquiry whatever she sends or that far smaller class wise to discern spirits and apt to adopt means to their culture and development who can prudently and carefully train every nature according to its true and characteristic ideal  zephaniah pennel was a shrewd old yankee whose instincts taught him from the first that the waif that had been so mysteriously washed out of the gloom of the sea into his family was of some different class and lineage from that which might have filled a cradle of his own and of a nature which he could not perfectly understand so he prudently watched and waited only using restraint enough to keep the boy anchored in society and letting him otherwise grow up in the solitary freedom of his lonely seafaring life  the boy was from childhood although singularly attractive of a moody fitful unrestful natureeager earnest but unsteadywith varying phases of imprudent frankness and of the most stubborn and unfathomable secretiveness he was a creature of unreasoning antipathies and attractions as zephaniah pennel said of him he was as full of hitches as an old bureau drawer his peculiar beauty and a certain electrical power of attraction seemed to form a constant circle of protection and forgiveness around him in the home of his fosterparents and great as was the anxiety and pain which he often gave them they somehow never felt the charge of him as a weariness  we left him a boy beginning latin with mr sewell in company with the little mara this arrangement progressed prosperously for a time and the good clergyman all whose ideas of education ran through the halls of a college began to have hopes of turning out a choice scholar but when the boys ship of life came into the breakers of that narrow and intricate channel which divides boyhood from manhood the difficulties that had always attended his guidance and management wore an intensified form how much family happiness is wrecked just then and there how many mothers and sisters hearts are broken in the wild and confused tossings and tearings of that stormy transition a whole new nature is blindly upheaving itself with cravings and clamorings which neither the boy himself nor often surrounding friends understand  a shrewd observer has significantly characterized the period as the time when the boy wishes he were dead and everybody else wishes so too the wretched halffledged halfconscious anomalous creature has all the desires of the man and none of the rights has a double and triple share of nervous edge and intensity in every part of his nature and no definitely perceived objects on which to bestow itand of course all sorts of unreasonable moods and phases are the result  one of the most common signs of this period in some natures is the love of contradiction and oppositiona blind desire to go contrary to everything that is commonly received among the older people the boy disparages the minister quizzes the deacon thinks the schoolmaster an ass and doesnt believe in the bible and seems to be rather pleased than otherwise with the shock and flutter that all these announcements create among peaceably disposed grown people no respectable hen that ever hatched out a brood of ducks was more puzzled what to do with them than was poor mrs pennel when her adopted nursling came into this state was he a boy an immortal soul a reasonable human being or only a handsome goblin sent to torment her  what shall we do with him father said she one sunday to zephaniah as he stood shaving before the little lookingglass in their bedroom he cant be governed like a child and he wont govern himself like a man  zephaniah stopped and strapped his razor reflectively  we must cast out anchor and wait for day he answered prayer is a long rope with a strong hold  it was just at this critical period of life that moses pennel was drawn into associations which awoke the alarm of all his friends and from which the characteristic willfulness of his nature made it difficult to attempt to extricate him  in order that our readers may fully understand this part of our history we must give some few particulars as to the peculiar scenery of orrs island and the state of the country at this time  the coast of maine as we have elsewhere said is remarkable for a singular interpenetration of the sea with the land forming amid its dense primeval forests secluded bays narrow and deep into which vessels might float with the tide and where they might nestle unseen and unsuspected amid the dense shadows of the overhanging forest  at this time there was a very brisk business done all along the coast of maine in the way of smuggling small vessels lightly built and swift of sail would run up into these sylvan fastnesses and there make their deposits and transact their business so as entirely to elude the vigilance of government officers  it may seem strange that practices of this kind should ever have obtained a strong foothold in a community peculiar for its rigid morality and its orderly submission to law but in this case as in many others contempt of law grew out of weak and unworthy legislation the celebrated embargo of jefferson stopped at once the whole trade of new england and condemned her thousand ships to rot at the wharves and caused the ruin of thousands of families  the merchants of the country regarded this as a flagrant highhanded piece of injustice expressly designed to cripple new england commerce and evasions of this unjust law found everywhere a degree of sympathy even in the breasts of welldisposed and conscientious people in resistance to the law vessels were constantly fitted out which ran upon trading voyages to the west indies and other places and although the practice was punishable as smuggling yet it found extensive connivance from this beginning smuggling of all kinds gradually grew up in the community and gained such a foothold that even after the repeal of the embargo it still continued to be extensively practiced secret depositories of contraband goods still existed in many of the lonely haunts of islands off the coast of maine hid in deep forest shadows visited only in the darkness of the night were these illegal stores of merchandise and from these secluded resorts they found their way no one knew or cared to say how into houses for miles around  there was no doubt that the practice like all other illegal ones was demoralizing to the community and particularly fatal to the character of that class of bold enterprising young men who would be most likely to be drawn into it  zephaniah pennel who was made of a kind of straightgrained uncompromising oaken timber such as built the mayflower of old had always borne his testimony at home and abroad against any violations of the laws of the land however veiled under the pretext of righting a wrong or resisting an injustice and had done what he could in his neighborhood to enable government officers to detect and break up these unlawful depositories this exposed him particularly to the hatred and illwill of the operators concerned in such affairs and a plot was laid by a few of the most daring and determined of them to establish one of their depositories on orrs island and to implicate the family of pennel himself in the trade this would accomplish two purposes as they hopedit would be a mortification and defeat to hima revenge which they coveted and it would they thought insure his silence and complicity for the strongest reasons  the situation and characteristics of orrs island peculiarly fitted it for the carrying out of a scheme of this kind and for this purpose we must try to give our readers a more definite idea of it  the traveler who wants a ride through scenery of more varied and singular beauty than can ordinarily be found on the shores of any land whatever should start some fine clear day along the clean sandy road ribboned with strips of green grass that leads through the flat pitchpine forests of brunswick toward the sea as he approaches the salt water a succession of the most beautiful and picturesque lakes seems to be lying softly cradled in the arms of wild rocky forest shores whose outlines are ever changing with the windings of the road  at a distance of about six or eight miles from brunswick he crosses an arm of the sea and comes upon the first of the interlacing group of islands which beautifies the shore a ride across this island is a constant succession of pictures whose wild and solitary beauty entirely distances all power of description the magnificence of the evergreen foreststheir peculiar air of sombre stillnessthe rich intermingling ever and anon of groves of birch beech and oak in picturesque knots and tufts as if set for effect by some skillful landscapegardenerproduce a sort of strange dreamy wonder while the sea breaking forth both on the right hand and the left of the road into the most romantic glimpses seems to flash and glitter like some strange gem which every moment shows itself through the framework of a new setting here and there little secluded coves push in from the sea around which lie soft tracts of green meadowland hemmed in and guarded by rocky pinecrowned ridges in such sheltered spots may be seen neat white houses nestling like sheltered doves in the beautiful solitude  when one has ridden nearly to the end of great island which is about four miles across he sees rising before him from the sea a bold romantic point of land uplifting a crown of rich evergreen and forest trees over shores of perpendicular rock this is orrs island  it was not an easy matter in the days of our past experience to guide a horse and carriage down the steep wild shores of great island to the long bridge that connects it with orrs the sense of wild seclusion reaches here the highest degree and one crosses the bridge with a feeling as if genii might have built it and one might be going over it to fairyland from the bridge the path rises on to a high granite ridge which runs from one end of the island to the other and has been called the devils back with that superstitious generosity which seems to have abandoned all romantic places to so undeserving an owner  by the side of this ridge of granite is a deep narrow chasm running a mile and a half or two miles parallel with the road and veiled by the darkest and most solemn shadows of the primeval forest here scream the jays and the eagles and fishhawks make their nests undisturbed and the tide rises and falls under black branches of evergreen from which depend long light festoons of delicate gray moss the darkness of the forest is relieved by the delicate foliage and the silvery trunks of the great white birches which the solitude of centuries has allowed to grow in this spot to a height and size seldom attained elsewhere  it was this narrow rocky cove that had been chosen by the smuggler atkinson and his accomplices as a safe and secluded resort for their operations he was a seafaring man of bath one of that class who always prefer uncertain and doubtful courses to those which are safe and reputable he was possessed of many of those traits calculated to make him a hero in the eyes of young men was dashing free and frank in his manners with a fund of humor and an abundance of ready anecdote which made his society fascinating but he concealed beneath all these attractions a character of hard grasping unscrupulous selfishness and an utter destitution of moral principle  moses now in his sixteenth year and supposed to be in a general way doing well under the care of the minister was left free to come and go at his own pleasure unwatched by zephaniah whose fishing operations often took him for weeks from home atkinson hung about the boys path engaging him first in fishing or hunting enterprises plied him with choice preparations of liquor with which he would enhance the hilarity of their expeditions and finally worked on his love of adventure and that impatient restlessness incident to his period of life to draw him fully into his schemes moses lost all interest in his lessons often neglecting them for days at a timeaccounting for his negligence by excuses which were far from satisfactory when mara would expostulate with him about this he would break out upon her with a fierce irritation was he always going to be tied to a girls apronstring he was tired of study and tired of old sewell whom he declared an old granny in a white wig who knew nothing of the world he wasnt going to collegeit was altogether too slow for himhe was going to see life and push ahead for himself  maras life during this time was intensely wearing a frail slender delicate girl of thirteen she carried a heart prematurely old with the most distressing responsibility of mature life her love for moses had always had in it a large admixture of that maternal and caretaking element which in some shape or other qualities the affection of woman to man ever since that dream of babyhood when the vision of a pale mother had led the beautiful boy to her arms mara had accepted him as something exclusively her own with an intensity of ownership that seemed almost to merge her personal identity with his she felt and saw and enjoyed and suffered in him and yet was conscious of a higher nature in herself by which unwillingly he was often judged and condemned his faults affected her with a kind of guilty pain as if they were her own his sins were borne bleeding in her heart in silence and with a jealous watchfulness to hide them from every eye but hers she busied herself day and night interceding and making excuses for him first to her own sensitive moral nature and then with everybody around for with one or another he was coming into constant collision she felt at this time a fearful load of suspicion which she dared not express to a human being  up to this period she had always been the only confidant of moses who poured into her ear without reserve all the good and the evil of his nature and who loved her with all the intensity with which he was capable of loving anything nothing so much shows what a human being is in moral advancement as the quality of his love moses pennels love was egotistic exacting tyrannical and capricioussometimes venting itself in expressions of a passionate fondness which had a savor of protecting generosity in them and then receding to the icy pole of surly petulance for all that there was no resisting the magnetic attraction with which in his amiable moods he drew those whom he liked to himself  such people are not very wholesome companions for those who are sensitively organized and predisposed to selfsacrificing love they keep the heart in a perpetual freeze and thaw which like the american northern climate is so particularly fatal to plants of a delicate habit they could live through the hot summer and the cold winter but they cannot endure the three or four months when it freezes one day and melts the nextwhen all the buds are started out by a week of genial sunshine and then frozen for a fortnight these fitful persons are of all others most engrossing because you are always sure in their good moods that they are just going to be angelsan expectation which no number of disappointments seems finally to do away mara believed in mosess future as she did in her own existence he was going to do something great and goodthat she was certain of he would be a splendid man nobody she thought knew him as she did nobody could know how good and generous he was sometimes and how frankly he would confess his faults and what noble aspirations he had  but there was no concealing from her watchful sense that moses was beginning to have secrets from her he was cloudy and murky and at some of the most harmless inquiries in the world would flash out with a sudden temper as if she had touched some sore spot her bedroom was opposite to his and she became quite sure that night after night while she lay thinking of him she heard him steal down out of the house between two and three oclock and not return till a little before daydawn where he went and with whom and what he was doing was to her an awful mysteryand it was one she dared not share with a human being if she told her kind old grandfather she feared that any inquiry from him would only light as a spark on that inflammable spirit of pride and insubordination that was rising within him and bring on an instantaneous explosion mr sewells influence she could hope little more from and as to poor mrs pennel such communications would only weary and distress her without doing any manner of good there was therefore only that one unfailing confidantthe invisible friend to whom the solitary child could pour out her heart and whose inspirations of comfort and guidance never fail to come again in return to true souls  one moonlight night as she lay thus praying her senses sharpened by watching discerned a sound of steps treading under her window and then a low whistle her heart beat violently and she soon heard the door of mosess room open and then the old chamberstairs gave forth those inconsiderate creaks and snaps that garrulous old stairs always will when anybody is desirous of making them accomplices in a nightsecret mara rose and undrawing her curtain saw three men standing before the house and saw moses come out and join them quick as thought she threw on her clothes and wrapping her little form in a dark cloak with a hood followed them out she kept at a safe distance behind themso far back as just to keep them in sight they never looked back and seemed to say but little till they approached the edge of that deep belt of forest which shrouds so large a portion of the island she hurried along now nearer to them lest they should be lost to view in the deep shadows while they went on crackling and plunging through the dense underbrush     chapter xxi  the tempter   it was well for mara that so much of her life had been passed in wild forest rambles she looked frail as the rays of moonbeam which slid down the old whitebearded hemlocks but her limbs were agile and supple as steel and while the party went crashing on before she followed with such lightness that the slight sound of her movements was entirely lost in the heavy crackling plunges of the party her little heart was beating fast and hard but could any one have seen her face as it now and then came into a spot of moonshine they might have seen it fixed in a deadly expression of resolve and determination she was going after himno matter where she was resolved to know who and what it was that was leading him away as her heart told her to no good deeper and deeper into the shadows of the forest they went and the child easily kept up with them  mara had often rambled for whole solitary days in this lonely wood and knew all its rocks and dells the whole three miles to the long bridge at the other end of the island but she had never before seen it under the solemn stillness of midnight moonlight which gives to the most familiar objects such a strange ghostly charm after they had gone a mile into the forest she could see through the black spruces silver gleams of the sea and hear amid the whirr and sway of the pinetops the dash of the ever restless tide which pushed up the long cove it was at the full as she could discern with a rapid glance of her practiced eye expertly versed in the knowledge of every change of the solitary nature around  and now the party began to plunge straight down the rocky ledge of the devils back on which they had been walking hitherto into the deep ravine where lay the cove it was a scrambling precipitous way over perpendicular walls of rock whose crevices furnished anchoringplaces for grand old hemlocks or silverbirches and whose rough sides leathery with black flaps of lichen were all tangled and interlaced with thick netted bushes the men plunged down laughing shouting and swearing at their occasional missteps and silently as moonbeam or thistledown the lightfooted shadow went down after them  she suddenly paused behind a pile of rock as through an opening between two great spruces the sea gleamed out like a sheet of lookingglass set in a black frame and here the child saw a small vessel swinging at anchor with the moonlight full on its slack sails and she could hear the gentle gurgle and lick of the greentongued waves as they dashed under it toward the rocky shore  mara stopped with a beating heart as she saw the company making for the schooner the tide is high will they go on board and sail away with him where she cannot follow what could she do in an ecstasy of fear she kneeled down and asked god not to let him goto give her at least one more chance to save him  for the pure and pious child had heard enough of the words of these men as she walked behind them to fill her with horror she had never before heard an oath but there came back from these men coarse brutal tones and words of blasphemy that froze her blood with horror and moses was going with them she felt somehow as if they must be a company of fiends bearing him to his ruin  for some time she kneeled there watching behind the rock while moses and his companions went on board the little schooner she had no feeling of horror at the loneliness of her own situation for her solitary life had made every woodland thing dear and familiar to her she was cowering down on a loose spongy bed of moss which was all threaded through and through with the green vines and pale pink blossoms of the mayflower and she felt its fragrant breath streaming up in the moist moonlight as she leaned forward to look through a rocky crevice her arms rested on a bed of that brittle white moss she had often gathered with so much admiration and a scarlet rockcolumbine such as she loved to paint brushed her cheekand all these mute fair things seemed to strive to keep her company in her chill suspense of watchfulness two whippoorwills from a clump of silvery birches kept calling to each other in melancholy iteration while she stayed there still listening and knowing by an occasional sound of laughing or the explosion of some oath that the men were not yet gone at last they all appeared again and came to a cleared place among the dry leaves quite near to the rock where she was concealed and kindled a fire which they kept snapping and crackling by a constant supply of green resinous hemlock branches  the red flame danced and leaped through the green fuel and leaping upward in tongues of flame cast ruddy bronze reflections on the old pinetrees with their long branches waving with boards of white mossand by the firelight mara could see two men in sailors dress with pistols in their belts and the man atkinson whom she had recollected as having seen once or twice at her grandfathers she remembered how she had always shrunk from him with a strange instinctive dislike half fear half disgust when he had addressed her with that kind of free admiration which men of his class often feel themselves at liberty to express to a pretty girl of her early age he was a man that might have been handsome had it not been for a certain strange expression of covert wickedness it was as if some vile evil spirit walking as the scriptures say through dry places had lighted on a comely mans body in which he had set up housekeeping making it look like a fair house abused by an unclean owner  as mara watched his demeanor with moses she could think only of a loathsome black snake that she had once seen in those solitary rocksshe felt as if his handsome but evil eye were charming him with an evil charm to his destruction  well mo my boy she heard him sayslapping moses on the shoulderthis is something like well have a tempus as the college fellows sayput down the clams to roast and ill mix the punch he said setting over the fire a teakettle which they brought from the ship  after their preparations were finished all sat down to eat and drink mara listened with anxiety and horror to a conversation such as she never heard or conceived before it is not often that women hear men talk in the undisguised manner which they use among themselves but the conversation of men of unprincipled lives and low brutal habits unchecked by the presence of respectable female society might well convey to the horrorstruck child a feeling as if she were listening at the mouth of hell almost every word was preceded or emphasized by an oath and what struck with a death chill to her heart was that moses swore too and seemed to show that desperate anxiety to seem au fait in the language of wickedness which boys often do at that age when they fancy that to be ignorant of vice is a mark of disgraceful greenness moses evidently was bent on showing that he was not greenignorant of the pure ear to which every such word came like the blast of death  he drank a great deal too and the mirth among them grew furious and terrific mara horrified and shocked as she was did not however lose that intense and alert presence of mind natural to persons in whom there is moral strength however delicate be their physical frame she felt at once that these men were playing upon moses that they had an object in view that they were flattering and cajoling him and leading him to drink that they might work out some fiendish purpose of their own the man called atkinson related story after story of wild adventure in which sudden fortunes had been made by men who he said were not afraid to take the short cut across lots he told of piratical adventures in the west indiesof the fun of chasing and overhauling shipsand gave dazzling accounts of the treasures found on board it was observable that all these stories were told on the line between joke and earnestas frolics as specimens of good fun and seeing life etc  at last came a suggestionwhat if they should start off together some fine day just for a spree and try a cruise in the west indies to see what they could pick up they had arms and a gang of fine wholesouled fellows moses had been tied to maam pennels apronstring long enough and hark ye said one of them moses they say old pennel has lots of dollars in that old seachest of hisn it would be a kindness to him to invest them for him in an adventure  moses answered with a streak of the boy innocence which often remains under the tramping of evil men like ribbons of green turf in the middle of roads  you dont know father pennelwhy hed no more come into it than  a perfect roar of laughter cut short this declaration and atkinson slapping moses on the back said  by  mo you are the jolliest green dog i shall die alaughing of your innocence some day why my boy cant you see pennels money can be invested without asking him  why he keeps it locked said moses  and supposing you pick the lock  not i indeed said moses making a sudden movement to rise  mara almost screamed in her ecstasy but she had sense enough to hold her breath  ho see him now said atkinson lying back and holding his sides while he laughed and rolled over you can get off anything on that muffany hoax in the worldhes so soft come come my dear boy sit down i was only seeing how wide i could make you open those great black eyes of yournthats all  youd better take care how you joke with me said moses with that look of gloomy determination which mara was quite familiar with of old it was the rallying effort of a boy who had abandoned the first outworks of virtue to make a stand for the citadel and atkinson like a prudent besieger after a repulse returned to lie on his arms  he began talking volubly on other subjects telling stories and singing songs and pressing moses to drink  mara was comforted to see that he declined drinkingthat he looked gloomy and thoughtful in spite of the jokes of his companions but she trembled to see by the following conversation how atkinson was skillfully and prudently making apparent to moses the extent to which he had him in his power he seemed to mara like an ugly spider skillfully weaving his web around a fly she felt cold and faint but within her there was a heroic strength  she was not going to faint she would make herself bear up she was going to do something to get moses out of this snarebut what at last they rose  it is past three oclock she heard one of them say  i say mo said atkinson you must make tracks for home or you wont be in bed when mother pennel calls you  the men all laughed at this joke as they turned to go on board the schooner  when they were gone moses threw himself down and hid his face in his hands he knew not what pitying little face was looking down upon him from the hemlock shadows what brave little heart was determined to save him he was in one of those great crises of agony that boys pass through when they first awake from the fun and frolic of unlawful enterprises to find themselves sold under sin and feel the terrible logic of evil which constrains them to pass from the less to greater crime he felt that he was in the power of bad unprincipled heartless men who if he refused to do their bidding had the power to expose him all he had been doing would come out his kind old fosterparents would know it mara would know it mr sewell and miss emily would know the secrets of his life that past month he felt as if they were all looking at him now he had disgraced himselfhad sunk below his educationhad been false to all his better knowledge and the past expectations of his friends living a mean miserable dishonorable lifeand now the ground was fast sliding from under him and the next plunge might be down a precipice from which there would be no return what he had done up to this hour had been done in the roystering inconsiderate gamesomeness of boyhood it had been represented to himself only as sowing wild oats having steep times seeing a little of life and so on but this night he had had propositions of piracy and robbery made to him and he had not dared to knock down the man that made themhad not dared at once to break away from his company he must meet him againmust go on with him orhe groaned in agony at the thought  it was a strong indication of that repressed considerate habit of mind which love had wrought in the child that when mara heard the boys sobs rising in the stillness she did not as she wished to rush out and throw her arms around his neck and try to comfort him  but she felt instinctively that she must not do this she must not let him know that she had discovered his secret by stealing after him thus in the night shadows she knew how nervously he had resented even the compassionate glances she had cast upon him in his restless turbid intervals during the past few weeks and the fierceness with which he had replied to a few timid inquiries nothough her heart was breaking for him it was a shrewd wise little heart and resolved not to spoil all by yielding to its first untaught impulses she repressed herself as the mother does who refrains from crying out when she sees her unconscious little one on the verge of a precipice  when moses rose and moodily began walking homeward she followed at a distance she could now keep farther off for she knew the way through every part of the forest and she only wanted to keep within sound of his footsteps to make sure that he was going home when he emerged from the forest into the open moonlight she sat down in its shadows and watched him as he walked over the open distance between her and the house he went in and then she waited a little longer for him to be quite retired she thought he would throw himself on the bed and then she could steal in after him so she sat there quite in the shadows  the grand full moon was riding high and calm in the purple sky and harpswell bay on the one hand and the wide open ocean on the other lay all in a silver shimmer of light there was not a sound save the plash of the tide now beginning to go out and rolling and rattling the pebbles up and down as it came and went and once in a while the distant mournful intoning of the whippoorwill there were silent lonely ships sailing slowly to and fro far out to sea turning their fair wings now into bright light and now into shadow as they moved over the glassy stillness mara could see all the houses on harpswell neck and the white church as clear as in the daylight it seemed to her some strange unearthly dream  as she sat there she thought over her whole little life all full of one thought one purpose one love one prayer for this being so strangely given to her out of that silent sea which lay so like a still eternity around herand she revolved again what meant the vision of her childhood did it not mean that she was to watch over him and save him from some dreadful danger that poor mother was lying now silent and peaceful under the turf in the little graveyard not far off and she must care for her boy  a strong motherly feeling swelled out the girls heartshe felt that she must she would somehow save that treasure which had so mysteriously been committed to her so when she thought she had given time enough for moses to be quietly asleep in his room she arose and ran with quick footsteps across the moonlit plain to the house  the frontdoor was standing wide open as was always the innocent fashion in these regions with a halfangle of moonlight and shadow lying within its dusky depths mara listened a momentno sound he had gone to bed then poor boy she said i hope he is asleep how he must feel poor fellow its all the fault of those dreadful men said the little dark shadow to herself as she stole up the stairs past his room as guiltily as if she were the sinner once the stairs creaked and her heart was in her mouth but she gained her room and shut and bolted the door she kneeled down by her little white bed and thanked god that she had come in safe and then prayed him to teach her what to do next she felt chilly and shivering and crept into bed and lay with her great soft brown eyes wide open intently thinking what she should do  should she tell her grandfather something instinctively said no that the first word from him which showed moses he was detected would at once send him off with those wicked men he would never never bear to have this known she said mr sewellah that was worse she herself shrank from letting him know what moses had been doing she could not bear to lower him so much in his eyes he could not make allowances she thought he is good to be sure but he is so old and grave and doesnt know how much moses has been tempted by these dreadful men and then perhaps he would tell miss emily and they never would want moses to come there any more  what shall i do she said to herself i must get somebody to help me or tell me what to do i cant tell grandmamma it would only make her ill and she wouldnt know what to do any more than i ah i know what i will doill tell captain kittridge he was always so kind to me and he has been to sea and seen all sorts of men and moses wont care so much perhaps to have him know because the captain is such a funny man and dont take everything so seriously yes thats it ill go right down to the cove in the morning god will bring me through i know he will and the little weary head fell back on the pillow asleep and as she slept a smile settled over her face perhaps a reflection from the face of her good angel who always beholdeth the face of our father in heaven      chapter xxii  a friend in need   mara was so wearied with her night walk and the agitation she had been through that once asleep she slept long after the early breakfast hour of the family she was surprised on awaking to hear the slow old clock downstairs striking eight she hastily jumped up and looked around with a confused wonder and then slowly the events of the past night came back upon her like a remembered dream she dressed herself quickly and went down to find the breakfast things all washed and put away and mrs pennel spinning  why dear heart said the old lady how came you to sleep soi spoke to you twice but i could not make you hear  has moses been down grandma said mara intent on the sole thought in her heart  why yes dear long agoand cross enough he was that boy does get to be a trialbut come dear ive saved some hot cakes for yousit down now and eat your breakfast  mara made a feint of eating what her grandmother with fond officiousness would put before her and then rising up she put on her sunbonnet and started down toward the cove to find her old friend  the queer dry lean old captain had been to her all her life like a faithful kobold or brownie an unquestioning servant of all her gentle biddings she dared tell him anything without diffidence or shamefacedness and she felt that in this trial of her life he might have in his seareceptacle some odd old amulet or spell that should be of power to help her instinctively she avoided the house lest sally should see and fly out and seize her she took a narrow path through the cedars down to the little boat cove where the old captain worked so merrily ten years ago in the beginning of our story and where she found him now with his coat off busily planing a board  wal nowif this ere dont beat all he said looking up and seeing her why youre looking after sally i spose shes up to the house  no captain kittridge im come to see you  you be said the captain i swow if i aint a lucky feller but whats the matter he said suddenly observing her pale face and the tears in her eyes haint nothin bad happenedhes there  oh captain kittridge something dreadful and nobody but you can help me  want to know now said the captain with a grave face well come here now and sit down and tell me all about it dont you cry theres a good girl dont now  mara began her story and went through with it in a rapid and agitated manner and the good captain listened in a fidgety state of interest occasionally relieving his mind by interjecting do tell now i swanif that ar aint too bad  that ars rediculous conduct in atkinson he ought to be talked to said the captain when she had finished and then he whistled and put a shaving in his mouth which he chewed reflectively  dont you be a mite worried mara he said you did a great deal better to come to me than to go to mr sewell or your grandther either cause you see these ere wild chaps theyll take things from me they wouldnt from a churchmember or a minister folks mustnt pull em up with too short a reinthey must kind o flatter em off but that ar atkinsons too rediculous for anything and if he dont mind ill serve him out i know a thing or two about him that i shall shake over his head if he dont behave now i dont think so much of smugglin as some folks said the captain lowering his voice to a confidential tone i reely dont now but come to goin off piratinand tryin to put a young boy up to robbin his best friendswhy there aint no kind o sense in that its pison mean of atkinson i shall tell him so and i shall talk to moses  oh im afraid to have you said mara apprehensively  why chickabiddy said the old captain you dont understand me i aint goin at him with no sermonsi shall jest talk to

circumstances but bless you child these ere fellers aint none of em fraid o me you see cause they know i know the ropes  and can you make that horrid man let him alone said mara fearfully  calculate i can spect if is to tell atkinson a few things i know hed be for bein scase in our parts now you see i haint minded doin a small bit o trade now and then with them ar fellers myself but this ere said the captain stopping and looking extremely disgusted why its contemptible its rediculous  do you think id better tell grandpapa said mara  dont worry your little head ill step up and have a talk with pennel this evening he knows as well as i that there is times when chaps must be seen to and no remarks made pennel knows that ar why now mis kittridge thinks our boys turned out so well all along of her bringin up and i let her think so keeps her sort o in spirits you see but lord bless ye child theres been times with job and sam and pass and dass and dile and all on em finally when if i hadnt

them neither but i jest kind o worked em off you know and theys all putty spectable men now as men go you know not like parson sewell but good honest mates and shipmasterskind o middlin people you know it takes a good many o sich to make up a world dye see  but oh captain kittridge did any of them use to swear said mara in a faltering voice  wal they did considable said the captainthen seeing the trembling of maras lip he added  ef you could afound this ere out any other way its most a pity youd aheard him cause he wouldnt never have let out afore you it dont do for gals to hear the fellers talk when theys alone cause fellerswal you see fellers will be fellers particlarly when theyre young some on em they never gits over it all their lives finally  but oh captain kittridge that talk last night was so dreadfully wicked and mosesoh it was dreadful to hear him  wal yes it was said the captain consolingly but dont you cry and dont you break your little heart i expect hell come all right and jine the church one of these days cause theres old pennel he praysfact now i think theres considable in some peoples prayers and hes one of the sort and you pray too and im quite sure the good lord must hear you i declare sometimes i wish youd jest say a good word to him for me i should like to get the hang o things a little better than i do somehow i reely should ive gin up swearing years ago mis kittridge she broke me o that and now i dont never go further than i vum or i swow or somethin o that sort but you see im oldmoses is young but then hes got eddication and friends and hell come all right now you jest see ef he dont  this miscellaneous budget of personal experiences and friendly consolation which the good captain conveyed to mara may possibly make you laugh my reader but the good ropy brown man was doing his best to console his little friend and as mara looked at him he was almost glorified in her eyeshe had power to save moses and he would do it she went home to dinner that day with her heart considerably lightened she refrained in a guilty way from even looking at moses who was gloomy and moody  mara had from nature a good endowment of that kind of innocent hypocrisy which is needed as a staple in the lives of women who bridge a thousand awful chasms with smiling unconscious looks and walk singing and scattering flowers over abysses of fear while their hearts are dying within them  she talked more volubly than was her wont with mrs pennel and with her old grandfather she laughed and seemed in more than usual spirits and only once did she look up and catch the gloomy eye of moses it had that murky troubled look that one may see in the eye of a boy when those evil waters which cast up mire and dirt have once been stirred in his soul they fell under her clear glance and he made a rapid impatient movement as if it hurt him to be looked at the evil spirit in boy or man cannot bear the touch of celestial temper and the sensitiveness to eyebeams is one of the earliest signs of conscious inward guilt  mara was relieved as he flung out of the house after dinner to see the long dry figure of captain kittridge coming up and seizing moses by the button from the window she saw the captain assuming a confidential air with him and when they had talked together a few moments she saw moses going with great readiness after him down the road to his house  in less than a fortnight it was settled moses was to sail for china and mara was deep in the preparations for his outfit once she would have felt this departure as the most dreadful trial of her life now it seemed to her a deliverance for him and she worked with a cheerful alacrity which seemed to moses more than was proper considering he was going away  for moses like many others of his sex boy or man had quietly settled in his own mind that the whole love of maras heart was to be his to have and to hold to use and to draw on when and as he liked he reckoned on it as a sort of inexhaustible uncounted treasure that was his own peculiar right and property and therefore he felt abused at what he supposed was a disclosure of some deficiency on her part  you seem to be very glad to be rid of me he said to her in a bitter tone one day as she was earnestly busy in her preparations  now the fact was that moses had been assiduously making himself disagreeable to mara for the fortnight past by all sorts of unkind sayings and doings and he knew it too yet he felt a right to feel very much abused at the thought that she could possibly want him to be going if she had been utterly desolate about it and torn her hair and sobbed and wailed he would have asked what she could be crying about and begged not to be bored with scenes but as it was this cheerful composure was quite unfeeling  now pray dont suppose moses to be a monster of an uncommon species we take him to be an average specimen of a boy of a certain kind of temperament in the transition period of life everything is chaos within the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and light and darkness and mind and dust and passion and pure thoughts mingle and contend without end or order he wondered at himself sometimes that he could say such cruel things as he did to his faithful little friendto one whom after all he did love and trust before all other human beings  there is no saying why it is that a man or a boy not radically destitute of generous comprehensions will often cruelly torture and tyrannize over a woman whom he both loves and reveres who stands in his soul in his best hours as the very impersonation of all that is good and beautiful it is as if some evil spirit at times possessed him and compelled him to utter words which were felt at the moment to be mean and hateful moses often wondered at himself as he lay awake nights how he could have said and done the things he had and felt miserably resolved to make it up somehow before he went away but he did not  he could not say mara i have done wrong though he every day meant to do it and sometimes sat an hour in her presence feeling murky and stony as if possessed by a dumb spirit then he would get up and fling stormily out of the house  poor mara wondered if he really would go without one kind word she thought of all the years they had been together and how he had been her only thought and love what had become of her brotherthe moses that once she used to knowfrank careless not illtempered and who sometimes seemed to love her and think she was the best little girl in the world where was he gone tothis friend and brother of her childhood and would he never come back  at last came the evening before his parting the seachest was all made up and packed and maras fingers had been busy with everything from more substantial garments down to all those little comforts and nameless conveniences that only a woman knows how to improvise mara thought certainly she should get a few kind words as moses looked it over but he only said all right and then added that there was a button off one of the shirts maras busy fingers quickly replaced it and moses was annoyed at the tear that fell on the button what was she crying for now he knew very well but he felt stubborn and cruel afterwards he lay awake many a night in his berth and acted this last scene over differently he took mara in his arms and kissed her he told her she was his best friend his good angel and that he was not worthy to kiss the hem of her garment but the next day when he thought of writing a letter to her he didnt and the good mood passed away boys do not acquire an ease of expression in letterwriting as early as girls and a voyage to china furnished opportunities few and far between of sending letters  now and then through some sailing ship came missives which seemed to mara altogether colder and more unsatisfactory than they would have done could she have appreciated the difference between a boy and a girl in power of epistolary expression for the power of really representing ones heart on paper which is one of the first spring flowers of early womanhood is the latest blossom on the slowgrowing tree of manhood to do moses justice these seeming cold letters were often written with a choking lump in his throat caused by thinking over his many sins against his little good angel but then that past account was so long and had so much that it pained him to think of that he dashed it all off in the shortest fashion and said to himself one of these days when i see her ill make it all up  no manespecially one that is living a rough busy outofdoors lifecan form the slightest conception of that veiled and secluded life which exists in the heart of a sensitive woman whose sphere is narrow whose external diversions are few and whose mind therefore acts by a continual introversion upon itself they know nothing how their careless words and actions are pondered and turned again in weary quiet hours of fruitless questioning what did he mean by this and what did he intend by thatwhile he the careless buffalo meant nothing or has forgotten what it was if he did mans utter ignorance of womans nature is a cause of a great deal of unsuspected cruelty which he practices toward her  mara found one or two opportunities of writing to moses but her letters were timid and constrained by a sort of frosty discouraged sense of loneliness and moses though he knew he had no earthly right to expect this to be otherwise took upon him to feel as an abused individual whom nobody lovedwhose way in the world was destined to be lonely and desolate so when at the end of three years he arrived suddenly at brunswick in the beginning of winter and came all burning with impatience to the home at orrs island and found that mara had gone to boston on a visit he resented it as a personal slight  he might have inquired why she should expect him and whether her whole life was to be spent in looking out of the window to watch for him he might have remembered that he had warned her of his approach by no letter but no mara didnt care for himshe had forgotten all about himshe was having a good time in boston just as likely as not with some train of admirers and he had been tossing on the stormy ocean and she had thought nothing of it how many things he had meant to say he had never felt so good and so affectionate he would have confessed all the sins of his life to her and asked her pardonand she wasnt there  mrs pennel suggested that he might go to boston after her  no he was not going to do that he would not intrude on her pleasures with the memory of a rough hardworking sailor he was alone in the world and had his own way to make and so best go at once up among lumbermen and cut the timber for the ship that was to carry cæsar and his fortunes  when mara was informed by a letter from mrs pennel expressed in the few brief words in which that good woman generally embodied her epistolary communications that moses had been at home and gone to umbagog without seeing her she felt at her heart only a little closer stricture of cold quiet pain which had become a habit of her inner life  he did not love herhe was cold and selfish said the inner voice and faintly she pleaded in answer he is a manhe has seen the worldand has so much to do and think of no wonder  in fact during the last three years that had parted them the great change of life had been consummated in both they had parted boy and girl they would meet man and woman the time of this meeting had been announced  and all this is the history of that sigh so very quiet that sally kittridge never checked the rattling flow of her conversation to observe it     chapter xxiii  the beginning of the story   we have in the last three chapters brought up the history of our characters to the time when our story opens when mara and sally kittridge were discussing the expected return of moses sally was persuaded by mara to stay and spend the night with her and did so without much fear of what her mother would say when she returned for though mrs kittridge still made bustling demonstrations of authority it was quite evident to every one that the handsome grownup girl had got the sceptre into her own hands and was reigning in the full confidence of being in one way or another able to bring her mother into all her views  so sally stayedto have one of those long nighttalks in which girls delight in the course of which all sorts of intimacies and confidences that shun the daylight open like the nightblooming cereus in strange successions one often wonders by daylight at the things one says very naturally in the dark  so the two girls talked about moses and sally dilated upon his handsome manly air the one sunday that he had appeared in harpswell meetinghouse  he didnt know me at all if youll believe it said sally i was standing with father when he came out and he shook hands with him and looked at me as if id been an entire stranger  im not in the least surprised said mara youre grown so and altered  well now youd hardly know him mara said sally he is a mana real man everything about him is different he holds up his head in such a proud way well he always did that when he was a boy but when he speaks he has such a deep voice how boys do alter in a year or two  do you think i have altered much sally said mara at least do you think he would think so  why mara you and i have been together so much i cant tell we dont notice what goes on before us every day i really should like to see what moses pennel will think when he sees you at any rate he cant order you about with such a grand air as he used to when you were younger  i think sometimes he has quite forgotten about me said mara  well if i were you i should put him in mind of myself by one or two little ways said sally id plague him and tease him id lead him such a life that he couldnt forget methats what i would  i dont doubt you would sally and he might like you all the better for it but you know that sort of thing isnt my way people must act in character  do you know mara said sally i always thought moses was hateful in his treatment of you now id no more marry that fellow than id walk into the fire but it would be a just punishment for his sins to have to marry me wouldnt i serve him out though  with which threat of vengeance on her mind sally kittridge fell asleep while mara lay awake ponderingwondering if moses would come tomorrow and what he would be like if he did come  the next morning as the two girls were wiping breakfast dishes in a room adjoining the kitchen a step was heard on the kitchenfloor and the first that mara knew she found herself lifted from the floor in the arms of a tall darkeyed young man who was kissing her just as if he had a right to she knew it must be moses but it seemed strange as a dream for all she had tried to imagine it beforehand  he kissed her over and over and then holding her off at arms length said why mara you have grown to be a beauty  and what was she id like to know when you went away mr moses said sally who could not long keep out of a conversation she was handsome when you were only a great ugly boy  thank you miss sally said moses making a profound bow  thank me for what said sally with a toss  for your intimation that i am a handsome young man now said moses sitting with his arm around mara and her hand in his  and in truth he was as handsome now for a man as he was in the promise of his early childhood all the oafishness and surly awkwardness of the halfboy period was gone his great black eyes were clear and confident his dark hair clustering in short curls round his wellshaped head his black lashes and fine form and a certain confident ease of manner set him off to the greatest advantage  mara felt a peculiar dreamy sense of strangeness at this brother who was not a brotherthis moses so different from the one she had known the very tone of his voice which when he left had the uncertain cracked notes which indicate the unformed man were now mellowed and settled mara regarded him shyly as he talked blushed uneasily and drew away from his arm around her as if this handsome selfconfident young man were being too familiar in fact she made apology to go out into the other room to call mrs pennel  moses looked after her as she went with admiration what a little woman she has grown he said naïvely  and what did you expect she would grow said sally you didnt expect to find her a girl in short clothes did you  not exactly miss sally said moses turning his attention to her and some other people are changed too  like enough said sally carelessly i should think so since somebody never spoke a word to one the sunday he was at meeting  oh you remember that do you on my word sally  miss kittridge if you please sir said sally turning round with the air of an empress  well then miss kittridge said moses making a bow now let me finish my sentence i never dreamed who you were  complimentary said sally pouting  well hear me through said moses you had grown so handsome miss kittridge  oh that indeed i suppose you mean to say i was a fright when you left  not at allnot at all said moses but handsome things may grow handsomer you know  i dont like flattery said sally  i never flatter miss kittridge said moses  our young gentleman and young lady of orrs island went through with this customary little lie of civilized society with as much gravity as if they were practicing in the court of versaillesshe looking out from the corner of her eye to watch the effect of her words and he laying his hand on his heart in the most edifying gravity they perfectly understood one another  but says the reader seems to me sally kittridge does all the talking so she doesso she always willfor it is her nature to be bright noisy and restless and one of these girls always overcrows a timid and thoughtful one and makes her for the time seem dim and faded as does rose color when put beside scarlet  sally was a born coquette it was as natural for her to want to flirt with every man she saw as for a kitten to scamper after a pinball does the kitten care a fig for the pinball or the dry leaves which she whisks and frisks and boxes and pats and races round and round after no its nothing but kittenhood every hair of her fur is alive with it her sleepy green eyes when she pretends to be dozing are full of it and though she looks wise a moment and seems resolved to be a discreet young cat let but a leaf swayoff she goes again with a frisk and a rap so though sally had scolded and flounced about mosess inattention to mara in advance she contrived even in this first interview to keep him talking with nobody but herselfnot because she wanted to draw him from mara or meant to not because she cared a pin for him but because it was her nature as a frisky young cat and moses let himself be drawn between bantering and contradicting and jest and earnest at some moments almost to forget that mara was in the room  she took her sewing and sat with a pleased smile sometimes breaking into the lively flow of conversation or eagerly appealed to by both parties to settle some rising quarrel  once as they were talking moses looked up and saw maras head as a stray sunbeam falling upon the golden hair seemed to make a halo around her face her large eyes were fixed upon him with an expression so intense and penetrative that he felt a sort of wincing uneasiness what makes you look at me so mara he said suddenly  a bright flush came in her cheek as she answered i didnt know i was looking it all seems so strange to me i am trying to make out who and what you are  its not best to look too deep moses said laughing but with a slight shade of uneasiness  when sally late in the afternoon declared that she must go home she couldnt stay another minute moses rose to go with her  what are you getting up for she said to moses as he took his hat  to go home with you to be sure  nobody asked you to said sally  im accustomed to asking myself said moses  well i suppose i must have you along said sally father will be glad to see you of course  youll be back to tea moses said mara will you not grandfather will be home and want to see you  oh i shall be right back said moses i have a little business to settle with captain kittridge  but moses however did stay at tea with mrs kittridge who looked graciously at him through the bows of her black horn spectacles having heard her liege lord observe that moses was a smart chap and had done pretty well in a money way  how came he to stay sally told him every other minute to go and then when he had got fairly out of the door called him back to tell him that there was something she had heard about him and moses of course came back wanted to know what it was and couldnt be told it was a secret and then he would be ordered off and reminded that he promised to go straight home and then when he got a little farther off she called after him a second time to tell him that he would be very much surprised if he knew how she found it out etc etctill at last tea being ready there was no reason why he shouldnt have a cup and so it was sober moonrise before moses found himself going home  hang that girl he said to himself dont she know what shes about though  there our hero was mistaken sally never did know what she was abouthad no plan or purpose more than a blackbird and when moses was gone laughed to think how many times she had made him come back  now confound it all said moses i care more for our little mara than a dozen of her and what have i been fooling all this time fornow mara will think i dont love her  and in fact our young gentleman rather set his heart on the sensation he was going to make when he got home it is flattering after all to feel ones power over a susceptible nature and moses remembering how entirely and devotedly mara had loved him all through childhood never doubted but he was the sole possessor of uncounted treasure in her heart which he could develop at his leisure and use as he pleased he did not calculate for one force which had grown up in the meanwhile between themand that was the power of womanhood he did not know the intensity of that kind of pride which is the very life of the female nature and which is most vivid and vigorous in the most timid and retiring  our little mara was tender selfdevoting humble and religious but she was woman after all to the tips of her fingersquick to feel slights and determined with the intensest determination that no man should wrest from her one of those few humble rights and privileges which nature allows to woman something swelled and trembled in her when she felt the confident pressure of that bold arm around her waistlike the instinct of a wild bird to fly something in the deep manly voice the determined selfconfident air aroused a vague feeling of defiance and resistance in her which she could scarcely explain to herself was he to assume a right to her in this way without even asking when he did not come to tea nor long after and mrs pennel and her grandfather wondered she laughed and said gayly  oh he knows hell have time enough to see me sally seems more like a stranger  but when moses came home after moonrise determined to go and console mara for his absence he was surprised to hear the sound of a rapid and pleasant conversation in which a masculine and feminine voice were intermingled in a lively duet coming a little nearer he saw mara sitting knitting in the doorway and a very goodlooking young man seated on a stone at her feet with his straw hat flung on the ground while he was looking up into her face as young men often do into pretty faces seen by moonlight mara rose and introduced mr adams of boston to mr moses pennel  moses measured the young man with his eye as if he could have shot him with a good will and his temper was not at all bettered as he observed that he had the easy air of a man of fashion and culture and learned by a few moments of the succeeding conversation that the acquaintance had commenced during maras winter visit to boston  i was staying a day or two at mr sewells he said carelessly and the night was so fine i couldnt resist the temptation to row over  it was now mosess turn to listen to a conversation in which he could bear little part it being about persons and places and things unfamiliar to him and though he could give no earthly reason why the conversation was not the most proper in the worldyet he found that it made him angry  in the pauses mara inquired prettily how he found the kittridges and reproved him playfully for staying in despite of his promise to come home moses answered with an effort to appear easy and playful that there was no reason it appeared to hurry on her account since she had been so pleasantly engaged  that is true said mara quietly but then grandpapa and grandmamma expected you and they have gone to bed as you know they always do after tea  theyll keep till morning i suppose said moses rather gruffly  oh yes but then as you had been gone two or three months naturally they wanted to see a little of you at first  the stranger now joined in the conversation and began talking with moses about his experiences in foreign parts in a manner which showed a man of sense and breeding moses had a jealous fear of people of breedingan apprehension lest they should look down on one whose life had been laid out of the course of their conventional ideas and therefore though he had sufficient ability and vigor of mind to acquit himself to advantage in this conversation it gave him all the while a secret uneasiness after a few moments he rose up moodily and saying that he was very much fatigued he went into the house to retire  mr adams rose to go also and moses might have felt in a more christian frame of mind had he listened to the last words of the conversation between him and mara  do you remain long in harpswell she asked  that depends on circumstances he replied if i do may i be permitted to visit you  as a friendyes said mara i shall always be happy to see you  no more  no more replied mara  i had hoped he said that you would reconsider  it is impossible said she and soft voices can pronounce that word impossible in a very fateful and decisive manner  well god bless you then miss lincoln he said and was gone  mara stood in the doorway and saw him loosen his boat from its moorings and float off in the moonlight with a long train of silver sparkles behind  a moment after moses was looking gloomily over her shoulder  who is that puppy he said  he is not a puppy but a very fine young man said mara  well that very fine young man then  i thought i told you he is a mr adams of boston and a distant connection of the sewells i met him when i was visiting at judge sewells in boston  you seemed to be having a very pleasant time together  we were said mara quietly  its a pity i came home as i did im sorry i interrupted you said moses with a sarcastic laugh  you didnt interrupt us he had been here almost two hours  now mara saw plainly enough that moses was displeased and hurt and had it been in the days of her fourteenth summer she would have thrown her arms around his neck and said moses i dont care a fig for that man and i love you better than all the world but this the young lady of eighteen would not do so she wished him goodnight very prettily and pretended not to see anything about it  mara was as near being a saint as human dust ever is butshe was a woman saint and therefore may be excused for a little gentle vindictiveness she was in a merciful way rather glad that moses had gone to bed dissatisfied and rather glad that he did not know what she might have told himquite resolved that he should not know at present was he to know that she liked nobody so much as him not he unless he loved her more than all the world and said so first mara was resolved upon that he might go where he likedflirt with whom he likedcome back as late as he pleased never would she by word or look give him reason to think she cared     chapter xxiv  desires and dreams   moses passed rather a restless and uneasy night on his return to the homeroof which had sheltered his childhood all his life past and all his life expected seemed to boil and seethe and ferment in his thoughts and to go round and round in neverceasing circles before him  moses was par excellence proud ambitious and willful these words generally supposed to describe positive vices of the mind in fact are only the overaction of certain very valuable portions of our nature since one can conceive all three to raise a man immensely in the scale of moral being simply by being applied to right objects he who is too proud even to admit a mean thoughtwho is ambitious only of ideal excellencewho has an inflexible will only in the pursuit of truth and righteousnessmay be a saint and a hero  but moses was neither a saint nor a hero but an undeveloped chaotic young man whose pride made him sensitive and restless whose ambition was fixed on wealth and worldly success whose willfulness was for the most part a blind determination to compass his own points with the leave of providence or without there was no god in his estimate of lifeand a sort of secret unsuspected determination at the bottom of his heart that there should be none he feared religion from a suspicion which he entertained that it might hamper some of his future schemes he did not wish to put himself under its rules lest he might find them in some future time inconveniently strict  with such determinations and feelings the biblenecessarily an excessively uninteresting book to himhe never read and satisfied himself with determining in a general way that it was not worth reading and as was the custom with many young men in america at that period announced himself as a skeptic and seemed to value himself not a little on the distinction pride in skepticism is a peculiar distinction of young men it takes years and maturity to make the discovery that the power of faith is nobler than the power of doubt and that there is a celestial wisdom in the ingenuous propensity to trust which belongs to honest and noble natures elderly skeptics generally regard their unbelief as a misfortune  not that moses was after all without the angel in him he had a good deal of the susceptibility to poetic feeling the power of vague and dreamy aspiration the longing after the good and beautiful which is gods witness in the soul a noble sentiment in poetry a fine scene in nature had power to bring tears in his great dark eyes and he had under the influence of such things brief inspired moments in which he vaguely longed to do or be something grand or noble but this however was something apart from the real purpose of his lifea sort of voice crying in the wildernessto which he gave little heed practically he was determined with all his might to have a good time in this life whatever another might beif there were one and that he would do it by the strength of his right arm wealth he saw to be the lamp of aladdin which commanded all other things and the pursuit of wealth was therefore the first step in his programme  as for plans of the heart and domestic life moses was one of that very common class who had more desire to be loved than power of loving his cravings and dreams were not for somebody to be devoted to but for somebody who should be devoted to him and like most people who possess this characteristic he mistook it for an affectionate disposition  now the chief treasure of his heart had always been his little sister mara chiefly from his conviction that he was the one absorbing thought and love of her heart he had never figured life to himself otherwise than with mara at his side his unquestioning devoted friend of course he and his plans his ways and wants would always be in the future as they always had been her sole thought these sleeping partnerships in the interchange of affection which support ones heart with a basis of uncounted wealth and leave one free to come and go and buy and sell without exaction or interference are a convenience certainly and the loss of them in any way is like the sudden breaking of a bank in which all ones deposits are laid  it had never occurred to moses how or in what capacity he should always stand banker to the whole wealth of love that there was in maras heart and what provision he should make on his part for returning this incalculable debt but the interview of this evening had raised a new thought in his mind mara as he saw that day was no longer a little girl in a pink sunbonnet she was a womana little one it is true but every inch a womanand a woman invested with a singular poetic charm of appearance which more than beauty has the power of awakening feeling in the other sex  he felt in himself in the experience of that one day that there was something subtle and veiled about her which set the imagination at work that the wistful plaintive expression of her dark eyes and a thousand little shy and tremulous movements of her face affected him more than the most brilliant of sally kittridges sprightly sallies yes there would be people falling in love with her fast enough he thought even here where she is as secluded as a pearl in an oystershellit seems means were found to come after herand then all the love of her heart that priceless love would go to another  mara would be absorbed in some one else would love some one else as he knew she could with heart and soul and mind and strength when he thought of this it affected him much as it would if one were turned out of a warm smiling apartment into a bleak december storm what should he do if that treasure which he had taken most for granted in all his valuations of life should suddenly be found to belong to another who was this fellow that seemed so free to visit her and what had passed between them was mara in love with him or going to be there is no saying how the consideration of this question enhanced in our heros opinion both her beauty and all her other good qualities  such a brave little heart such a good clear little head and such a pretty hand and foot she was always so cheerful so unselfish so devoted when had he ever seen her angry except when she had taken up some childish quarrel of his and fought for him like a little spartan then she was pious too she was born religious thought our hero who in common with many men professing skepticism for their own particular part set a great value on religion in that unknown future person whom they are fond of designating in advance as my wife yes moses meant his wife should be pious and pray for him while he did as he pleased  now theres that witch of a sally kittridge he said to himself i wouldnt have such a girl for a wife nothing to her but foam and friskno heart more than a bobolink but isnt she amusing by george isnt she though  but thought moses its time i settled this matter who is to be my wife i wont marry till im richthats flat my wife isnt to rub and grub so at it i must go to raise the wind i wonder if old sewell really does know anything about my parents miss emily would have it that there was some mystery that he had the key of but i never could get any thing from him he always put me off in such a smooth way that i couldnt tell whether he did or he didnt but now supposing i have relatives family connections then who knows but what there may be property coming to me thats an idea worth looking after surely  theres no saying with what vividness ideas and images go through ones wakeful brain when the midnight moon is making an exact shadow of your windowsash with panes of light on your chamberfloor how vividly we all have loved and hated and planned and hoped and feared and desired and dreamed as we tossed and turned to and fro upon such watchful still nights in the stillness the tide upon one side of the island replied to the dash on the other side in unbroken symphony and moses began to remember all the stories gossips had told him of how he had floated ashore there like a fragment of tropical seaweed borne landward by a great gale he positively wondered at himself that he had never thought of it more and the more he meditated the more mysterious and inexplicable he felt then he had heard miss roxy once speaking something about a bracelet he was sure he had but afterwards it was hushed up and no one seemed to know anything about it when he inquired but in those days he was a boyhe was nobodynow he was a young man he could go to mr sewell and demand as his right a fair answer to any questions he might ask if he found as was quite likely that there was nothing to be known his mind would be thus far settledhe should trust only to his own resources  so far as the state of the young mans finances were concerned it would be considered in those simple times and regions an auspicious beginning of life the sum intrusted to him by captain kittridge had been more than doubled by the liberality of zephaniah pennel and moses had traded upon it in foreign parts with a skill and energy that brought a very fair return and gave him in the eyes of the shrewd thrifty neighbors the prestige of a young man who was marked for success in the world  he had already formed an advantageous arrangement with his grandfather and captain kittridge by which a ship was to be built which he should command and thus the old saturday afternoon dream of their childhood be fulfilled as he thought of it there arose in his mind a picture of mara with her golden hair and plaintive eyes and little white hands reigning as a fairy queen in the captains cabin with a sort of wish to carry her off and make sure that no one else ever should get her from him  but these midnight dreams were all sobered down by the plain matteroffact beams of the morning sun and nothing remained of immediate definite purpose except the resolve which came strongly upon moses as he looked across the blue band of harpswell bay that he would go that morning and have a talk with mr sewell     chapter xxv  miss emily   miss roxy toothache was seated by the window of the little keepingroom where miss emily sewell sat on everyday occasions around her were the insignia of her power and sway her big tailors goose was heating between miss emilys bright brass fireirons her great pincushion was by her side bristling with pins of all sizes and with broken needles thriftily made into pins by heads of red sealingwax and with needles threaded with all varieties of cotton silk and linen her scissors hung martially by her side her black bombazette workapron was on and the expression of her iron features was that of deep responsibility for she was making the minister a new sunday vest  the good soul looks not a day older than when we left her ten years ago like the gray weatherbeaten rocks of her native shore her strong features had an unchangeable identity beyond that of anything fair and blooming there was of course no chance for a gray streak in her stiff uncompromising mohair frisette which still pushed up her capborder bristlingly as of old and the clear high winds and bracing atmosphere of that rough coast kept her in an admirable state of preservation  miss emily had now and then a white hair among her soft pretty brown ones and looked a little thinner but the round bright spot of bloom on each cheek was there just as of yoreand just as of yore she was thinking of her brother and filling her little head with endless calculations to keep him looking fresh and respectable and his housekeeping comfortable and easy on very limited means she was now officiously and anxiously attending on miss roxy who was in the midst of the responsible operation which should conduce greatly to this end  does that twist work well she said nervously because i believe ive got some other upstairs in my india box  miss roxy surveyed the article bit a fragment off as if she meant to taste it threaded a needle and made a few cabalistical stitches and then pronounced ex cathedrâ that it would do miss emily gave a sigh of relief after buttons and tapes and linings and various other items had been also discussed the conversation began to flow into general channels  did you know moses pennel had got home from umbagog said miss roxy  yes captain kittridge told brother so this morning i wonder he doesnt call over to see us  your brother took a sight of interest in that boy said miss roxy i was saying to ruey this morning that if moses pennel ever did turn out well he ought to have a large share of the credit  brother always did feel a peculiar interest in him it was such a strange providence that seemed to cast in his lot among us said miss emily  as sure as you live there he is acoming to the front door said miss roxy  dear me said miss emily and here i have on this old faded chintz just so sure as one puts on any old rag and thinks nobody will come company is sure to call  law im sure i shouldnt think of calling him company said miss roxy  a rap at the door put an end to this conversation and very soon miss emily introduced our hero into the little sittingroom in the midst of a perfect stream of apologies relating to her old dress and the littered condition of the sittingroom for miss emily held to the doctrine of those who consider any sign of human occupation and existence in a room as being disorderhowever reputable and respectable be the cause of it  well really she said after she had seated moses by the fire how time does pass to be sure it dont seem more than yesterday since you used to come with your latin books and now here you are a grown man i must run and tell mr sewell he will be so glad to see you  mr sewell soon appeared from his study in morninggown and slippers and seemed heartily responsive to the proposition which moses soon made to him to have some private conversation with him in his study  i declare said miss emily as soon as the studydoor had closed upon her brother and moses what a handsome young man he is and what a beautiful way he has with himso deferential a great many young men nowadays seem to think nothing of their minister but he comes to seek advice very proper it isnt every young man that appreciates the privilege of having elderly friends i declare what a beautiful couple he and mara lincoln would make dont providence seem in a peculiar way to have designed them for each other  i hope not said miss roxy with her grimmest expression  you dont why not  i never liked him said miss roxy who had possessed herself of her great heavy goose and was now thumping and squeaking it emphatically on the pressboard shes a thousand times too good for moses pennelthump i neer had no faith in himthump hes dreffle unstiddythump hes handsome but he knows itthump he wont never love nobody so much as he does himselfthump fortissimo con spirito  well really now miss roxy you mustnt always remember the sins of his youth boys must sow their wild oats he was unsteady for a while but now everybody says hes doing well and as to his knowing hes handsome and all that i dont see as he does see how polite and deferential he was to us all this morning and he spoke so handsomely to you  i dont want none of his politeness said miss roxy inexorably and as to mara lincoln she might have better than him any day miss badger was atellin captain brown sunday noon that she was very much admired in boston  so she was said miss emily bridling i never reveal secrets or i might tell somethingbut there has been a young manbut i promised not to speak of it and i shant  if you mean mr adams said miss roxy you neednt worry about keepin that secret cause that ar was all talked over atween meetins asunday noon for mis kittridge she used to know his aunt jerushy her that married solomon peters and mis captain badger she says that he has a very good property and is a professor in the old south church in boston  dear me said miss emily how things do get about  people will talk there aint no use trying to help it said miss roxy but its strongly borne in on my mind that it aint adams nor t aint moses pennel thats to marry her ive had peculiar exercises of mind about that ar childwell i have and miss roxy pulled a large spotted bandanna handkerchief out of her pocket and blew her nose like a trumpet and then wiped the withered corners of her eyes which were humid as some old orrs island rock wet with seaspray  miss emily had a secret love of romancing it was one of the recreations of her quiet monotonous life to build aircastles which she furnished regardless of expense and in which she set up at housekeeping her various friends and acquaintances and she had always been bent on weaving a romance on the history of mara and moses pennel the good little body had done her best to second mr sewells attempts toward the education of the children it was little busy miss emily who persuaded honest zephaniah and mary pennel that talents such as maras ought to be cultivated and that ended in sending her to miss pluchers school in portland there her artistic faculties were trained into creating funereal monuments out of chenille embroidery fully equal to miss emilys own also to painting landscapes in which the ground and all the trees were one unvarying tint of bluegreen and also to creating flowers of a new and particular construction which as sally kittridge remarked were pretty but did not look like anything in heaven or earth mara had obediently and patiently done all these things and solaced herself with copying flowers and birds and landscapes as near as possible like nature as a recreation from these more dignified toils  miss emily also had been the means of getting mara invited to boston where she saw some really polished society and gained as much knowledge of the forms of artificial life as a nature so wholly and strongly individual could obtain so little miss emily regarded mara as her godchild and was intent on finishing her up into a romance in real life of which a handsome young man who had been washed ashore in a shipwreck should be the hero  what would she have said could she have heard the conversation that was passing in her brothers study little could she dream that the mystery about which she had timidly nibbled for years was now about to be unrolledbut it was even so but upon what she does not see good reader you and i following invisibly on tiptoe will make our observations  when moses was first ushered into mr sewells study and found himself quite alone with the door shut his heart beat so that he fancied the good man must hear it he knew well what he wanted and meant to say but he found in himself all that shrinking and nervous repugnance which always attends the proposing of any decisive question  i thought it proper he began that i should call and express my sense of obligation to you sir for all the kindness you showed me when a boy im afraid in those thoughtless days i did not seem to appreciate it so much as i do now  as moses said this the color rose in his cheeks and his fine eyes grew moist with a sort of subdued feeling that made his face for the moment more than usually beautiful  mr sewell looked at him with an expression of peculiar interest which seemed to have something almost of pain in it and answered with a degree of feeling more than he commonly showed  it has been a pleasure to me to do anything i could for you my young friend i only wish it could have been more i congratulate you on your present prospects in life you have perfect health you have energy and enterprise you are courageous and selfreliant and i trust your habits are pure and virtuous it only remains that you add to all this that fear of the lord which is the beginning of wisdom  moses bowed his head respectfully and then sat silent a moment as if he were looking through some cloud where he vainly tried to discover objects  mr sewell continued gravely  you have the greatest reason to bless the kind providence which has cast your lot in such a family in such a community i have had some means in my youth of comparing other parts of the country with our new england and it is my opinion that a young man could not ask a better introduction into life than the wholesome nurture of a christian family in our favored land  mr sewell said moses raising his head and suddenly looking him straight in the eyes do you know anything of my family  the question was so pointblank and sudden that for a moment mr sewell made a sort of motion as if he dodged a pistolshot and then his face assumed an expression of grave thoughtfulness while moses drew a long breath it was outthe question had been asked  my son replied mr sewell it has always been my intention when you had arrived at years of discretion to make you acquainted with all that i know or suspect in regard to your life i trust that when i tell you all i do know you will see that i have acted for the best in the matter it has been my study and my prayer to do so  mr sewell then rose and unlocking the cabinet of which we have before made mention in his apartment drew forth a very yellow and timeworn package of papers which he untied from these he selected one which enveloped an oldfashioned miniature case  i am going to show you he said what only you and my god know that i possess i have not looked at it now for ten years but i have no doubt that it is the likeness of your mother  moses took it in his hand and for a few moments there came a mist over his eyeshe could not see clearly he walked to the window as if needing a clearer light  what he saw was a painting of a beautiful young girl with large melancholy eyes and a clustering abundance of black curly hair the face was of a beautiful clear oval with that warm brunette tint in which the italian painters delight the black eyebrows were strongly and clearly defined and there was in the face an indescribable expression of childish innocence and shyness mingled with a kind of confiding frankness that gave the picture the charm which sometimes fixes itself in faces for which we involuntarily make a history she was represented as simply attired in a white muslin made low in the neck and the hands and arms were singularly beautiful the picture as moses looked at it seemed to stand smiling at him with a childish gracea tender ignorant innocence which affected him deeply  my young friend said mr sewell i have written all that i know of the original of this picture and the reasons i have for thinking her your mother  you will find it all in this paper which if i had been providentially removed was to have been given you in your twentyfirst year you will see in the delicate nature of the narrative that it could not properly have been imparted to you till you had arrived at years of understanding i trust when you know all that you will be satisfied with the course i have pursued you will read it at your leisure and after reading i shall be happy to see you again  moses took the package and after exchanging salutations with mr sewell hastily left the house and sought his boat  when one has suddenly come into possession of a letter or paper in which is known to be hidden the solution of some longpondered secret of the decision of fate with regard to some longcherished desire who has not been conscious of a sort of painan unwillingness at once to know what is therein we turn the letter again and again we lay it by and return to it and defer from moment to moment the opening of it so moses did not sit down in the first retired spot to ponder the paper he put it in the breast pocket of his coat and then taking up his oars rowed across the bay he did not land at the house but passed around the south point of the island and rowed up the other side to seek a solitary retreat in the rocks which had always been a favorite with him in his early days  the shores of the island as we have said are a precipitous wall of rock whose long ribbed ledges extend far out into the sea at high tide these ledges are covered with the smooth blue sea quite up to the precipitous shore there was a place however where the rocky shore shelved over forming between two ledges a sort of grotto whose smooth floor of shells and manycolored pebbles was never wet by the rising tide it had been the delight of moses when a boy to come here and watch the gradual rise of the tide till the grotto was entirely cut off from all approach and then to look out in a sort of hermitlike security over the open ocean that stretched before him many an hour he had sat there and dreamed of all the possible fortunes that might be found for him when he should launch away into that blue smiling futurity  it was now about halftide and moses left his boat and made his way over the ledge of rocks toward his retreat they were all shaggy and slippery with yellow seaweeds with here and there among them wide crystal pools where purple and lilac and green mosses unfolded their delicate threads and thousands of curious little shellfish were tranquilly pursuing their quiet life the rocks where the pellucid water lay were in some places crusted with barnacles which were opening and shutting the little white scaly doors of their tiny houses and drawing in and out those delicate pink plumes which seem to be their nerves of enjoyment moses and mara had rambled and played here many hours of their childhood amusing themselves with catching crabs and young lobsters and various little fish for these rocky aquariums and then studying at their leisure their various ways now he had come hither a man to learn the secret of his life  moses stretched himself down on the clean pebbly shore of the grotto and drew forth mr sewells letter     chapter xxvi  dolores   mr sewells letter ran as follows  my dear young friendit has always been my intention when you arrived at years of maturity to acquaint you with some circumstances which have given me reason to conjecture your true parentage and to let you know what steps i have taken to satisfy my own mind in relation to these conjectures in order to do this it will be necessary for me to go back to the earlier years of my life and give you the history of some incidents which are known to none of my most intimate friends i trust i may rely on your honor that they will ever remain as secrets with you  i graduated from harvard university in  at the time i was suffering somewhat from an affection of the lungs which occasioned great alarm to my mother many of whose family had died of consumption in order to allay her uneasiness and also for the purpose of raising funds for the pursuit of my professional studies i accepted a position as tutor in the family of a wealthy gentleman at st augustine in florida  i cannot do justice to myselfto the motives which actuated me in the events which took place in this family without speaking with the most undisguised freedom of the character of all the parties with whom i was connected  don josé mendoza was a spanish gentleman of large property who had emigrated from the spanish west indies to florida bringing with him an only daughter who had been left an orphan by the death of her mother at a very early age he brought to this country a large number of slavesand shortly after his arrival married an american lady a widow with three children by her he had four other children and thus it will appear that the family was made up of such a variety of elements as only the most judicious care could harmonize but the character of the father and mother was such that judicious care was a thing not to be expected of either  don josé was extremely ignorant and proud and had lived a life of the grossest dissipation habits of absolute authority in the midst of a community of a very low moral standard had produced in him all the worst vices of despots he was cruel overbearing and dreadfully passionate his wife was a woman who had pretensions to beauty and at times could make herself agreeable and even fascinating but she was possessed of a temper quite as violent and ungoverned as his own  imagine now two classes of slaves the one belonging to the mistress and the other brought into the country by the master and each animated by a party spirit and jealousyimagine children of different marriages inheriting from their parents violent tempers and stubborn wills flattered and fawned on by slaves and alternately petted or stormed at now by this parent and now by that and you will have some idea of the task which i undertook in being tutor in this family  i was young and fearless in those days as you are now and the difficulties of the position instead of exciting apprehension only awakened the spirit of enterprise and adventure  the whole arrangements of the household to me fresh from the simplicity and order of new england had a singular and wild sort of novelty which was attractive rather than otherwise i was well recommended in the family by an influential and wealthy gentleman of boston who represented my family as indeed it was as among the oldest and most respectable of boston and spoke in such terms of me personally as i should not have ventured to use in relation to myself when i arrived i found that two or three tutors who had endeavored to bear rule in this tempestuous family had thrown up the command after a short trial and that the parents felt some little apprehension of not being able to secure the services of anothera circumstance which i did not fail to improve in making my preliminary arrangements i assumed an air of grave hauteur was very exacting in all my requisitions and stipulations and would give no promise of doing more than to give the situation a temporary trial i put on an air of supreme indifference as to my continuance and acted in fact rather on the assumption that i should confer a favor by remaining  in this way i succeeded in obtaining at the outset a position of more respect and deference than had been enjoyed by any of my predecessors i had a fine apartment a servant exclusively devoted to me a horse for riding and saw myself treated among the servants as a person of consideration and distinction  don josé and his wife both had in fact a very strong desire to retain my services when after the trial of a week or two it was found that i really could make their discordant and turbulent children to some extent obedient and studious during certain portions of the day and in fact i soon acquired in the whole family that ascendancy which a wellbred person who respects himself and can keep his temper must have over passionate and undisciplined natures  i became the receptacle of the complaints of all and a sort of confidential adviser don josé imparted to me with more frankness than good taste his chagrins with regard to his wifes indolence illtemper and bad management and his wife in turn omitted no opportunity to vent complaints against her husband for similar reasons i endeavored to the best of my ability to act a friendly part by both it never was in my nature to see anything that needed to be done without trying to do it and it was impossible to work at all without becoming so interested in my work as to do far more than i had agreed to do i assisted don josé about many of his affairs brought his neglected accounts into order and suggested from time to time arrangements which relieved the difficulties which had been brought on by disorder and neglect in fact i became as he said quite a necessary of life to him  in regard to the children i had a more difficult task the children of don josé by his present wife had been systematically stimulated by the negroes into a chronic habit of dislike and jealousy toward her children by a former husband on the slightest pretext they were constantly running to their father with complaints and as the mother warmly espoused the cause of her first children criminations and recriminations often convulsed the whole family  in illregulated families in that region the care of the children is from the first in the hands of halfbarbarized negroes whose power of moulding and assimilating childish minds is peculiar so that the teacher has to contend constantly with a savage element in the children which seems to have been drawn in with the mothers milk it is in a modified way something the same result as if the child had formed its manners in dahomey or on the coast of guinea in the fierce quarrels which were carried on between the children of this family i had frequent occasion to observe this strange savage element which sometimes led to expressions and actions which would seem incredible in civilized society  the three children by madame mendozas former husband were two girls of sixteen and eighteen and a boy of fourteen the four children of the second marriage consisted of three boys and a daughterthe eldest being not more than thirteen  the natural capacity of all the children was good although from selfwill and indolence they had grown up in a degree of ignorance which could not have been tolerated except in a family living an isolated plantation life in the midst of barbarized dependents savage and untaught and passionate as they were the work of teaching them was not without its interest to me a power of control was with me a natural gift and then that command of temper which is the common attribute of welltrained persons in the northern states was something so singular in this family as to invest its possessor with a certain awe and my calm energetic voice and determined manner often acted as a charm on their stormy natures  but there was one member of the family of whom i have not yet spokenand yet all this letter is about herthe daughter of don josé by his first marriage poor dolores poor child god grant she may have entered into his rest  i need not describe her you have seen her picture and in the wild rude discordant family she always reminded me of the words a lily among thorns she was in her nature unlike all the rest and i may say unlike any one i ever saw she seemed to live a lonely kind of life in this disorderly household often marked out as the object of the spites and petty tyrannies of both parties she was regarded with bitter hatred and jealousy by madame mendoza who was sure to visit her with unsparing bitterness and cruelty after the occasional demonstrations of fondness she received from her father her exquisite beauty and the gentle softness of her manners made her such a contrast to her sisters as constantly excited their illwill unlike them all she was fastidiously neat in her personal habits and orderly in all the little arrangements of life  she seemed to me in this family to be like some shy beautiful pet creature in the hands of rude unappreciated owners hunted from quarter to quarter and finding rest only by stealth yet she seemed to have no perception of the harshness and cruelty with which she was treated she had grown up with it it was the habit of her life to study peaceable methods of averting or avoiding the various inconveniences and annoyances of her lot and secure to herself a little quiet  it not unfrequently happened amid the cabals and storms which shook the family that one party or the other took up and patronized dolores for a while more as it would appear out of hatred for the other than any real love to her at such times it was really affecting to see with what warmth the poor child would receive these equivocal demonstrations of goodwillthe nearest approaches to affection which she had ever knownand the bitterness with which she would mourn when they were capriciously withdrawn again with a heart full of affection she reminded me of some delicate climbing plant trying vainly to ascend the slippery side of an inhospitable wall and throwing its neglected tendrils around every weed for support  her only fast unfailing friend was her old negro nurse or mammy as the children called her this old creature with the cunning and subtlety which had grown up from years of servitude watched and waited upon the interests of her little mistress and contrived to carry many points for her in the confused household her young mistress was her one thought and purpose in living she would have gone through fire and water to serve her and this faithful devoted heart blind and ignorant though it were was the only unfailing refuge and solace of the poor hunted child  dolores of course became my pupil among the rest like the others she had suffered by the neglect and interruptions in the education of the family but she was intelligent and docile and learned with a surprising rapidity it was not astonishing that she should soon have formed an enthusiastic attachment to me as i was the only intelligent cultivated person she had ever seen and treated her with unvarying consideration and delicacy the poor thing had been so accustomed to barbarous words and manners that simple politeness and the usages of good society seemed to her cause for the most boundless gratitude  it is due to myself in view of what follows to say that i was from the first aware of the very obvious danger which lay in my path in finding myself brought into close and daily relations with a young creature so confiding so attractive and so singularly circumstanced i knew that it would be in the highest degree dishonorable to make the slightest advances toward gaining from her that kind of affection which might interfere with her happiness in such future relations as her father might arrange for her according to the european fashion i know that dolores was in her fathers hands to be disposed of for life according to his pleasure as absolutely as if she had been one of his slaves i had every reason to think that his plans on this subject were matured and only waited for a little more teaching and training on my part and her fuller development in womanhood to be announced to her  in looking back over the past therefore i have not to reproach myself with any dishonest and dishonorable breach of trust for i was from the first upon my guard and so much so that even the jealousy my other scholars never accused me of partiality i was not in the habit of giving very warm praise and was in my general management anxious rather to be just than conciliatory knowing that with the kind of spirits i had to deal with firmness and justice went farther than anything else if i approved dolores oftener than the rest it was seen to be because she never failed in a duty if i spent more time with her lessons it was because her enthusiasm for study led her to learn longer ones and study more things but i am sure there was never a look or a word toward her that went beyond the proprieties of my position  but yet i could not so well guard my heart i was young and full of feeling she was beautiful and more than that there was something in her spanish nature at once so warm and simple so artless and yet so unconsciously poetic that her presence was a continual charm how well i remember her nowall her little waysthe movements of her pretty little handsthe expression of her changeful face as she recited to methe grave rapt earnestness with which she listened to all my instructions  i had not been with her many weeks before i felt conscious that it was her presence that charmed the whole house and made the otherwise perplexing and distasteful details of my situation agreeable i had a dim perception that this growing passion was a dangerous thing for myself but was it a reason i asked why i should relinquish a position in which i felt that i was useful and when i could do for this lovely child what no one else could do i call her a childshe always impressed me as suchthough she was in her sixteenth year and had the early womanly development of southern climates she seemed to me like something frail and precious needing to be guarded and cared for and when reason told me that i risked my own happiness in holding my position love argued on the other hand that i was her only friend and that i should be willing to risk something myself for the sake of protecting and shielding her for there was no doubt that my presence in the family was a restraint upon the passions which formerly vented themselves so recklessly on her and established a sort of order in which she found more peace than she had ever known before  for a long time in our intercourse i was in the habit of looking on myself as the only party in danger it did not occur to me that this heart so beautiful and so lonely might in the want of all natural and appropriate objects of attachment fasten itself on me unsolicited from the mere necessity of loving she seemed to me so much too beautiful too perfect to belong to a lot in life like mine that i could not suppose it possible this could occur without the most blameworthy solicitation on my part and it is the saddest and most affecting proof to me how this poor child had been starved for sympathy and love that she should have repaid such cold services as mine with such an entire devotion at first her feelings were expressed openly toward me with the dutiful air of a good child she placed flowers on my desk in the morning and made quaint little nosegays in the spanish fashion which she gave me and busied her leisure with various ingenious little knickknacks of fancy work which she brought me i treated them all as the offerings of a child while with her but i kept them sacredly in my own room to tell the truth i have some of the poor little things now  but after a while i could not help seeing how she loved me and then i felt as if i ought to go but how could i the pain to myself i could have borne but how could i leave her to all the misery of her bleak ungenial position she poor thing was so unconscious of what i knewfor i was made clearsighted by love i tried the more strictly to keep to the path i had marked out for myself but i fear i did not always do it in fact many things seemed to conspire to throw us together the sisters who were sometimes invited out to visit on neighboring estates were glad enough to dispense with the presence and attractions of dolores and so she was frequently left at home to study with me in their absence as to don josé although he always treated me with civility yet he had such an ingrained and deeprooted idea of his own superiority of position that i suppose he would as soon have imagined the possibility of his daughters falling in love with one of his horses i was a great convenience to him i had a knack of governing and carrying points in his family that it had always troubled and fatigued him to endeavor to arrangeand that was all so that my intercourse with dolores was as free and unwatched and gave me as many opportunities of enjoying her undisturbed society as heart could desire  at last came the crisis however after breakfast one morning don josé called dolores into his library and announced to her that he had concluded for her a treaty of marriage and expected her husband to arrive in a few days he expected that this news would be received by her with the glee with which a young girl hears of a new dress or of a ballticket and was quite confounded at the grave and mournful silence in which she received it she said no word made no opposition but went out from the room and shut herself up in her own apartment and spent the day in tears and sobs  don josé who had rather a greater regard for dolores than for any creature living and who had confidently expected to give great delight by the news he had imparted was quite confounded by this turn of things if there had been one word of either expostulation or argument he would have blazed and stormed in a fury of passion but as it was this brokenhearted submission though vexatious was perplexing he sent for me and opened his mind and begged me to talk with dolores and show her the advantages of the alliance which the poor foolish child he said did not seem to comprehend the man was immensely rich and had a splendid estate in cuba it was a most desirable thing  i ventured to inquire whether his person and manners were such as would be pleasing to a young girl and could gather only that he was a man of about fifty who had been most of his life in the military service and was now desirous of making an establishment for the repose of his latter days at the head of which he would place a handsome and tractable woman and do well by her  i represented that it would perhaps be safer to say no more on the subject until dolores had seen him and to this he agreed madame mendoza was very zealous in the affair for the sake of getting clear of the presence of dolores in the family and her sisters laughed at her for her dejected appearance they only wished they said that so much luck might happen to them for myself i endeavored to take as little notice as possible of the affair though what i felt may be conjectured i knewi was perfectly certainthat dolores loved me as i loved her i knew that she had one of those simple and unworldly natures which wealth and splendor could not satisfy and whose life would lie entirely in her affections sometimes i violently debated with myself whether honor required me to sacrifice her happiness as well as my own and i felt the strongest temptation to ask her to be my wife and fly with me to the northern states where i did not doubt my ability to make for her a humble and happy home  but the sense of honor is often stronger than all reasoning and i felt that such a course would be the betrayal of a trust and i determined at least to command myself till i should see the character of the man who was destined to be her husband  meanwhile the whole manner of dolores was changed she maintained a stony gloomy silence performed all her duties in a listless way and occasionally when i commented on anything in her lessons or exercises would break into little flashes of petulance most strange and unnatural in her sometimes i could feel that she was looking at me earnestly but if i turned my eyes toward her hers were instantly averted but there was in her eyes a peculiar expression at times such as i have seen in the eye of a hunted animal when it turned at baya sort of desperate resistancewhich taken in connection with her fragile form and lovely face produced a mournful impression  one morning i found dolores sitting alone in the schoolroom leaning her head on her arms she had on her wrist a bracelet of peculiar workmanship which she always worethe bracelet which was afterwards the means of confirming her identity she sat thus some moments in silence and then she raised her head and began turning this bracelet round and round upon her arm while she looked fixedly before her at last she spoke abruptly and said  did i ever tell you that this was my mothers hair it is my mothers hairand she was the only one that ever loved me except poor old mammy nobody else loves menobody ever will  my dear miss dolores i began  dont call me dear she said you dont care for menobody doespapa doesnt and i always loved him everybody in the house wants to get rid of me whether i like to go or not i have always tried to be good and do all you wanted and i should think you might care for me a little but you dont  dolores i said i do care for you more than i do for any one in the world i love you more than my own soul  these were the very words i never meant to say but somehow they seemed to utter themselves against my will she looked at me for a moment as if she could not believe her hearing and then the blood flushed her face and she laid her head down on her arms  at this moment madame mendoza and the other girls came into the room in a clamor of admiration about a diamond bracelet which had just arrived as a present from her future husband it was a splendid thing and had for its clasp his miniature surrounded by the largest brilliants  the enthusiasm of the party even at this moment could not say anything in favor of the beauty of this miniature which though painted on ivory gave the impression of a coarsefeatured man with a scar across one eye  no matter for the beauty said one of the girls so long as it is set with such diamonds  come dolores said another giving her the present pull off that old hair bracelet and try this on  dolores threw the diamond bracelet from her with a vehemence so unlike her gentle self as to startle every one  i shall not take off my mothers bracelet for a gift from a man i never knew she said i hate diamonds i wish those who like such things might have them  was ever anything so odd said madame mendoza  dolores always was odd said another of the girls nobody ever could tell what she would like     chapter xxvii  hidden things   the next day señor don guzman de cardona arrived and the whole house was in a commotion of excitement there was to be no school and everything was bustle and confusion i passed my time in my own room in reflecting severely upon myself for the imprudent words by which i had thrown one more difficulty in the way of this poor harassed child  dolores this day seemed perfectly passive in the hands of her mother and sisters who appeared disposed to show her great attention she allowed them to array her in her most becoming dress and made no objection to anything except removing the bracelet from her arm nobodys gifts should take the place of her mothers she said and they were obliged to be content with her wearing of the diamond bracelet on the other arm  don guzman was a large plethoric man with coarse features and heavy gait besides the scar i have spoken of his face was adorned here and there with pimples which were not set down in the miniature in the course of the first hours study i saw him to be a man of much the same stamp as doloress fathersensual tyrannical passionate he seemed in his own way to be much struck with the beauty of his intended wife and was not wanting in efforts to please her all that i could see in her was the settled passive paleness of despair she played sang exhibited her embroidery and painting at the command of madame mendoza with the air of an automaton and don guzman remarked to her father on the passive obedience as a proper and hopeful trait once only when he in presenting her a flower took the liberty of kissing her cheek did i observe the flashing of her eye and a movement of disgust and impatience that she seemed scarcely able to restrain  the marriage was announced to take place the next week and a holiday was declared through the house nothing was talked of or discussed but the corbeille de mariage which the bridegroom had broughtthe dresses laces sets of jewels and cashmere shawls dolores never had been treated with such attention by the family in her life she rose immeasurably in the eyes of all as the future possessor of such wealth and such an establishment as awaited her madame mendoza had visions of future visits in cuba rising before her mind and overwhelmed her daughterinlaw with flatteries and caresses which she received in the same passive silence as she did everything else  for my own part i tried to keep entirely by myself i remained in my room reading and took my daily rides accompanied by my servantseeing dolores only at mealtimes when i scarcely ventured to look at her one night however as i was walking through a lonely part of the garden dolores suddenly stepped out from the shrubbery and stood before me it was bright moonlight by which her face and person were distinctly shown how well i remember her as she looked then she was dressed in white muslin as she was fond of being but it had been torn and disordered by the haste with which she had come through the shrubbery her face was fearfully pale and her great dark eyes had an unnatural brightness she laid hold on my arm  look here she said i saw you and came down to speak with you  she panted and trembled so that for some moments she could not speak another word i want to ask you she gasped after a pause whether i heard you right did you say  yes dolores you did i did say what i had no right to say like a dishonorable man  but is it true are you sure it is true she said scarcely seeming to hear my words  god knows it is said i despairingly  then why dont you save me why do you let them sell me to this dreadful man he dont love mehe never will cant you take me away  dolores i am a poor man i cannot give you any of these splendors your father desires for you  do you think i care for them i love you more than all the world together and if you do really love me why should we not be happy with each other  dolores i said with a last effort to keep calm i am much older than you and know the world and ought not to take advantage of your simplicity you have been so accustomed to abundant wealth and all it can give that you cannot form an idea of what the hardships and discomforts of marrying a poor man would be you are unused to having the least care or making the least exertion for yourself all the world would say that i acted a very dishonorable part to take you from a position which offers you wealth splendor and ease to one of comparative hardship perhaps some day you would think so yourself  while i was speaking dolores turned me toward the moonlight and fixed her great dark eyes piercingly upon me as if she wanted to read my soul is that all she said is that the only reason  i do not understand you said i  she gave me such a desolate look and answered in a tone of utter dejection oh i didnt know but perhaps you might not want me all the rest are so glad to sell me to anybody that will take me but you really do love me dont you she added laying her hand on mine  what answer i made i cannot say i only know that every vestige of what is called reason and common sense left me at that moment and that there followed an hour of delirium in which iwe both were very happywe forgot everything but each other and we arranged all our plans for flight there was fortunately a ship lying in the harbor of st augustine the captain of which was known to me in course of a day or two passage was taken and my effects transported on board nobody seemed to suspect us everything went on quietly up to the day before that appointed for sailing i took my usual rides and did everything as much as possible in my ordinary way to disarm suspicion and none seemed to exist the needed preparations went gayly forward on the day i mentioned when i had ridden some distance from the house a messenger came posthaste after me it was a boy who belonged specially to dolores he gave me a little hurried note i copy it      papa has found all out and it is dreadful no one else knows and     he means to kill you when you come back do if you love me hurry     and get on board the ship i shall never get over it if evil comes     on you for my sake i shall let them do what they please with me if     god will only save you i will try to be good perhaps if i bear     my trials well he will let me die soon that is all i ask i love     you and always shall to death and after      dolores  there was the end of it all i escaped on the ship i read the marriage in the paper incidentally i afterwards heard of her as living in cuba but i never saw her again till i saw her in her coffin sorrow and death had changed her so much that at first the sight of her awakened only a vague painful remembrance the sight of the hair bracelet which i had seen on her arm brought all back and i felt sure that my poor dolores had strangely come to sleep her last sleep near me  immediately after i became satisfied who you were i felt a painful degree of responsibility for the knowledge i wrote at once to a friend of mine in the neighborhood of st augustine to find out any particulars of the mendoza family i learned that its history had been like that of many others in that region don josé had died in a bilious fever brought on by excessive dissipation and at his death the estate was found to be so incumbered that the whole was sold at auction the slaves were scattered hither and thither to different owners and madame mendoza with her children and remains of fortune had gone to live in new orleans  of dolores he had heard but once since her marriage a friend had visited don guzmans estates in cuba he was living in great splendor but bore the character of a hard cruel tyrannical master and an overbearing man his wife was spoken of as being in very delicate healthavoiding society and devoting herself to religion  i would here take occasion to say that it was understood when i went into the family of don josé that i should not in any way interfere with the religious faith of the children the family being understood to belong to the roman catholic church there was so little like religion of any kind in the family that the idea of their belonging to any faith savored something of the ludicrous in the case of poor dolores however it was different the earnestness of her nature would always have made any religious form a reality to her in her case i was glad to remember that the romish church amid many corruptions preserves all the essential beliefs necessary for our salvation and that many holy souls have gone to heaven through its doors i therefore was only careful to direct her principal attention to the more spiritual parts of her own faith and to dwell on the great themes which all christian people hold in common  many of my persuasion would not have felt free to do this but my liberty of conscience in this respect was perfect i have seen that if you break the cup out of which a soul has been used to take the wine of the gospel you often spill the very wine itself and after all these forms are but shadows of which the substance is christ  i am free to say therefore that the thought that your poor mother was devoting herself earnestly to religion although after the forms of a church with which i differ was to me a source of great consolation because i knew that in that way alone could a soul like hers find peace  i have never rested from my efforts to obtain more information a short time before the incident which cast you upon our shore i conversed with a seacaptain who had returned from cuba he stated that there had been an attempt at insurrection among the slaves of don guzman in which a large part of the buildings and outhouses of the estate had been consumed by fire on subsequent inquiry i learned that don guzman had sold his estates and embarked for boston with his wife and family and that nothing had subsequently been heard of him  thus my young friend i have told you all that i know of those singular circumstances which have cast your lot on our shores i do not expect at your time of life you will take the same view of this event that i do you may possiblyvery probably willconsider it a loss not to have been brought up as you might have been in the splendid establishment of don guzman and found yourself heir to wealth and pleasure without labor or exertion yet i am quite sure in that case that your value as a human being would have been immeasurably less i think i have seen in you the elements of passions which luxury and idleness and the too early possession of irresponsible power might have developed with fatal results you have simply to reflect whether you would rather be an energetic intelligent selfcontrolled man capable of guiding the affairs of life and of acquiring its prizesor to be the reverse of all this with its prizes bought for you by the wealth of parents i hope mature reflection will teach you to regard with gratitude that disposition of the allwise which cast your lot as it has been cast  let me ask one thing in closing i have written for you here many things most painful for me to remember because i wanted you to love and honor the memory of your mother i wanted that her memory should have something such a charm for you as it has for me with me her image has always stood between me and all other women but i have never even intimated to a living being that such a passage in my history ever occurredno not even to my sister who is nearer to me than any other earthly creature  in some respects i am a singular person in my habits and having once written this you will pardon me if i observe that it will never be agreeable to me to have the subject named between us look upon me always as a friend who would regard nothing as a hardship by which he might serve the son of one so dear  i have hesitated whether i ought to add one circumstance more i think i will do so trusting to your good sense not to give it any undue weight  i have never ceased making inquiries in cuba as i found opportunity in regard to your fathers property and late investigations have led me to the conclusion that he left a considerable sum of money in the hands of a notary whose address i have which if your identity could be proved would come in course of law to you i have written an account of all the circumstances which in my view identify you as the son of don guzman de cardona and had them properly attested in legal form  this together with your mothers picture and the bracelet i recommend you to take on your next voyage and to see what may result from the attempt how considerable the sum may be which will result from this i cannot say but as don guzmans fortune was very large i am in hopes it may prove something worth attention  at any time you may wish to call i will have all these things ready for you      i am with warm regard             your sincere friend                   theophilus sewell  when moses had finished reading this letter he laid it down on the pebbles beside him and leaning back against a rock looked moodily out to sea the tide had washed quite up to within a short distance of his feet completely isolating the little grotto where he sat from all the surrounding scenery and before him passing and repassing on the blue bright solitude of the sea were silent ships going on their wondrous pathless ways to unknown lands the letter had stirred all within him that was dreamy and poetic he felt somehow like a leaf torn from a romance and blown strangely into the hollow of those rocks something too of ambition and pride stirred within him he had been born an heir of wealth and power little as they had done for the happiness of his poor mother and when he thought he might have had these two wild horses which have run away with so many young men he felt as young men all do an impetuous desire for their possession and he thought as so many do give them to me and ill risk my characterill risk my happiness  the letter opened a future before him which was something to speculate upon even though his reason told him it was uncertain and he lay there dreamily piling one aircastle on anotherunsubstantial as the great islands of white cloud that sailed through the sky and dropped their shadows in the blue sea  it was late in the afternoon when he bethought him he must return home and so climbing from rock to rock he swung himself upward on to the island and sought the brown cottage as he passed by the open window he caught a glimpse of mara sewing he walked softly up to look in without her seeing him she was sitting with the various articles of his wardrobe around her quietly and deftly mending his linen singing soft snatches of an old psalmtune  she seemed to have resumed quite naturally that quiet care of him and his which she had in all the earlier years of their life he noticed again her little handsthey seemed a sort of wonder to him why had he never seen when a boy how pretty they were and she had such dainty little ways of taking up and putting down things as she measured and clipped it seemed so pleasant to have her handling his things it was as if a good fairy were touching them whose touch brought back peace but then he thought by and by she will do all this for some one else the thought made him angry he really felt abused in anticipation she was doing all this for him just in sisterly kindness and likely as not thinking of somebody else whom she loved better all the time it is astonishing how cool and dignified this consideration made our hero as he faced up to the window he was after all in hopes she might blush and look agitated at seeing him suddenly but she did not the foolish boy did not know the quick wits of a girl and that all the while that he had supposed himself so sly and been holding his breath to observe mara had been perfectly cognizant of his presence and had been schooling herself to look as unconscious and natural as possible so she didonly saying  oh moses is that you where have you been all day  oh i went over to see parson sewell and get my pastoral lecture you know  and did you stay to dinner  no i came home and went rambling round the rocks and got into our old cave and never knew how the time passed  why then youve had no dinner poor boy said mara rising suddenly come in quick you must be fed or youll get dangerous and eat somebody  no no dont get anything said moses its almost suppertime and im not hungry  and moses threw himself into a chair and began abstractedly snipping a piece of tape with maras very best scissors  if you please sir dont demolish that i was going to stay one of your collars with it said mara  oh hang it im always in mischief among girls things said moses putting down the scissors and picking up a bit of white wax which with equal unconsciousness he began kneading in his hands while he was dreaming over the strange contents of the mornings letter  i hope mr sewell didnt say anything to make you look so very gloomy said mara  mr sewell said moses starting no he didnt in fact i had a pleasant call there and there was that confounded old sphinx of a miss roxy there why dont she die she must be somewhere near a hundred years old by this time  never thought to ask her why she didnt die said mara but i presume she has the best of reasons for living  yes thats so said moses every old toadstool and burdock and mullein lives and thrives and lasts no danger of their dying  you seem to be in a charitable frame of mind said mara  confound it all i hate this world if i could have my own way nowif i could have just what i wanted and do just as i please exactly i might make a pretty good thing of it  and pray what would you have said mara  well in the first place riches  in the first place  yes in the first place i say for money buys everything else  well supposing so said mara for arguments sake what would you buy with it  position in society respect considerationand id have a splendid place with everything elegant i have ideas enough only give me the means and then id have a wife of course  and how much would you pay for her said mara looking quite cool  id buy her with all the resta girl that wouldnt look at me as i amwould take me for all the rest you knowthats the way of the world  it is is it said mara i dont understand such matters much  yes its the way with all you girls said moses its the way youll marry when you do  dont be so fierce about it i havent done it yet said mara but now really i must go and set the suppertable when i have put these things awayand mara gathered an armful of things together and tripped singing upstairs and arranged them in the drawer of mosess room will his wife like to do all these little things for him as i do she thought its natural i should i grew up with him and love him just as if he were my own brotherhe is all the brother i ever had i love him more than anything else in the world and this wife he talks about could do no more  she dont care a pin about me thought moses its only a habit she has got and her strict notions of duty thats all she is housewifely in her instincts and seizes all neglected linen and garments as her lawful preyshe would do it just the same for her grandfather and moses drummed moodily on the windowpane     chapter xxviii  a coquette   the timbers of the ship which was to carry the fortunes of our hero were laid by the side of middle bay and all these romantic shores could hardly present a lovelier scene this beautiful sheet of water separates harpswell from a portion of brunswick its shores are rocky and pinecrowned and display the most picturesque variety of outline eagle island shelter island and one or two smaller ones lie on the glassy surface like soft clouds of green foliage pierced through by the steelblue tops of arrowy pinetrees  there were a goodly number of shareholders in the projected vessel some among the most substantial men in the vicinity zephaniah pennel had invested there quite a solid sum as had also our friend captain kittridge moses had placed therein the proceeds of his recent voyage which enabled him to buy a certain number of shares and he secretly revolved in his mind whether the sum of money left by his father might not enable him to buy the whole ship then a few prosperous voyages and his fortune was made  he went into the business of building the new vessel with all the enthusiasm with which he used when a boy to plan ships and mould anchors every day he was off at early dawn in his workingclothes and labored steadily among the men till evening no matter how early he rose however he always found that a good fairy had been before him and prepared his dinner daintily sometimes adding thereto a fragrant little bunch of flowers but when his boat returned home at evening he no longer saw her as in the days of girlhood waiting far out on the farthest point of rock for his return not that she did not watch for it and run out many times toward sunset but the moment she had made out that it was surely he she would run back into the house and very likely find an errand in her own room where she would be so deeply engaged that it would be necessary for him to call her down before she could make her appearance then she came smiling chatty always gracious and ready to go or to come as he requestedthe very cheerfulest of household fairiesbut yet for all that there was a cobweb invisible barrier around her that for some reason or other he could not break over it vexed and perplexed him and day after day he determined to whistle it downride over it roughshodand be as free as he chose with this apparently soft unresistant airy being who seemed so accessible why shouldnt he kiss her when he chose and sit with his arm around her waist and draw her familiarly upon his kneethis little childwoman who was as a sister to him why to be sure had she ever frowned or scolded as sally kittridge did when he attempted to pass the airline that divides man from womanhood not at all she had neither blushed nor laughed nor ran away if he kissed her she took it with the most matteroffact composure if he passed his arm around her she let it remain with unmoved calmness and so somehow he did these things less and less and wondered why  the fact is our hero had begun an experiment with his little friend that we would never advise a young man to try on one of these intense quiet softseeming women whose whole life is inward he had determined to find out whether she loved him before he committed himself to her and the strength of a whole book of martyrs is in women to endure and to bear without flinching before they will surrender the gate of this citadel of silence moreover our hero had begun his siege with precisely the worst weapons  for on the night that he returned and found mara conversing with a stranger the suspicion arose in his mind that somehow mara might be particularly interested in him and instead of asking her which anybody might consider the most feasible step in the case he asked sally kittridge  sallys inborn inherent love of teasing was up in a moment did she know anything of that mr adams of course she dida young lawyer of one of the best boston familiesa splendid fellow she wished any such luck might happen to her was mara engaged to him what would he give to know why didnt he ask mara did he expect her to reveal her friends secrets well she shouldntreport said mr adams was welltodo in the world and had expectations from an uncleand didnt moses think he was interesting in conversation everybody said what a conquest it was for an orrs island girl etc etc and sally said the rest with many a malicious toss and wink and sly twinkle of the dimples of her cheek which might mean more or less as a young man of imaginative temperament was disposed to view it now this was all done in pure simple love of teasing we incline to think phrenologists have as yet been very incomplete in their classification of faculties or they would have appointed a separate organ for this propensity of human nature certain persons often the most kindhearted in the world and who would not give pain in any serious matter seem to have an insatiable appetite for those small annoyances we commonly denominate teasingand sally was one of this number  she diverted herself infinitely in playing upon the excitability of mosesin awaking his curiosity and baffling it and tormenting him with a whole phantasmagoria of suggestions and assertions which played along so near the line of probability that one could never tell which might be fancy and which might be fact  moses therefore pursued the line of tactics for such cases made and provided and strove to awaken jealousy in mara by paying marked and violent attentions to sally he went there evening after evening leaving mara to sit alone at home he made secrets with her and alluded to them before mara he proposed calling his new vessel the sally kittridge but whether all these things made mara jealous or not he could never determine mara had no peculiar gift for acting except in this one point but here all the vitality of nature rallied to her support and enabled her to preserve an air of the most unperceiving serenity if she shed any tears when she spent a long lonesome evening she was quite particular to be looking in a very placid frame when moses returned and to give such an account of the books or the work or paintings which had interested her that moses was sure to be vexed never were her inquiries for sally more cordialnever did she seem inspired by a more ardent affection for her  whatever may have been the result of this state of things in regard to mara it is certain that moses succeeded in convincing the common fame of that district that he and sally were destined for each other and the thing was regularly discussed at quilting frolics and teadrinkings around much to miss emilys disgust and aunt roxys grave satisfaction who declared that mara was altogether too good for moses pennel but sally kittridge would make him stand roundby which expression she was understood to intimate that sally had in her the rudiments of the same kind of domestic discipline which had operated so favorably in the case of captain kittridge  these things of course had come to maras ears she had overheard the discussions on sunday noons as the people between meetings sat over their doughnuts and cheese and analyzed their neighbors affairs and she seemed to smile at them all sally only laughed and declared that it was no such thing that she would no more marry moses pennel or any other fellow than she would put her head into the fire what did she want of any of them she knew too much to get marriedthat she did she was going to have her liberty for one while yet to come etc etc but all these assertions were of course supposed to mean nothing but the usual declarations in such cases mara among the rest thought it quite likely that this thing was yet to be  so she struggled and tried to reason down a pain which constantly ached in her heart when she thought of this she ought to have foreseen that it must some time end in this way of course she must have known that moses would some time choose a wife and how fortunate that instead of a stranger he had chosen her most intimate friend sally was careless and thoughtless to be sure but she had a good generous heart at the bottom and she hoped she would love moses at least as well as she did and then she would always live with them and think of any little things that sally might forget  after all sally was so much more capable and efficient a person than herselfso much more bustling and energetic she would make altogether a better housekeeper and doubtless a better wife for moses but then it was so hard that he did not tell her about it was she not his sisterhis confidant for all his childhoodand why should he shut up his heart from her now but then she must guard herself from being jealousthat would be mean and wicked so mara in her zeal of selfdiscipline pushed on matters invited sally to tea to meet moses and when she came left them alone together while she busied herself in hospitable cares she sent moses with errands and commissions to sally which he was sure to improve into protracted visits and in short no young matchmaker ever showed more goodwill to forward the union of two chosen friends than mara showed to unite moses and sally  so the flirtation went on all summer like a ship under full sail with prosperous breezes and mara in the many hours that her two best friends were together tried heroically to persuade herself that she was not unhappy she said to herself constantly that she never had loved moses other than as a brother and repeated and dwelt upon the fact to her own mind with a pertinacity which might have led her to suspect the reality of the fact had she had experience enough to look closer true it was rather lonely she said but that she was used toshe always had been and always should be nobody would ever love her in return as she loved which sentence she did not analyze very closely or she might have remembered mr adams and one or two others who had professed more for her than she had found herself able to return that general proposition about nobody is commonly found if sifted to the bottom to have specific relation to somebody whose name never appears in the record  nobody could have conjectured from maras calm gentle cheerfulness of demeanor that any sorrow lay at the bottom of her heart she would not have owned it to herself  there are griefs which grow with years which have no marked beginningsno especial dates they are not events but slow perceptions of disappointment which bear down on the heart with a constant and equable pressure like the weight of the atmosphere and these things are never named or counted in words among lifes sorrows yet through them as through an unsuspected inward wound life energy and vigor slowly bleed away and the persons never owning even to themselves the weight of the pressurestanding to all appearance fair and cheerful are still undermined with a secret wear of this inner current and ready to fall with the first external pressure  there are persons often brought into near contact by the relations of life and bound to each other by a love so close that they are perfectly indispensable to each other who yet act upon each other as a file upon a diamond by a slow and gradual friction the pain of which is so equable so constantly diffused through life as scarcely ever at any time to force itself upon the mind as a reality  such had been the history of the affection of mara for moses it had been a deep inward concentrated passion that had almost absorbed selfconsciousness and made her keenly alive to all the moody restless passionate changes of his nature it had brought with it that craving for sympathy and return which such love ever will and yet it was fixed upon a nature so different and so uncomprehending that the action had for years been one of pain more than pleasure even now when she had him at home with her and busied herself with constant cares for him there was a sort of disturbing unquiet element in the history of every day the longing for him to come home at nightthe wish that he would stay with herthe uncertainty whether he would or would not go and spend the evening with sallythe musing during the day over all that he had done and said the day before were a constant interior excitement for moses besides being in his moods quite variable and changeable had also a good deal of the dramatic element in him and put on sundry appearances in the way of experiment  he would feign to have quarreled with sally that he might detect whether mara would betray some gladness but she only evinced concern and a desire to make up the difficulty he would discuss her character and her fitness to make a man happy in matrimony in the style that young gentlemen use who think their happiness a point of great consequence in the creation and mara always cool and firm and sensible would talk with him in the most maternal style possible and caution him against trifling with her affections then again he would be lavish in his praise of sallys beauty vivacity and energy and mara would join with the most apparently unaffected delight sometimes he ventured on the other side to rally her on some future husband and predict the days when all the attentions which she was daily bestowing on him would be for another and here as everywhere else he found his little sphinx perfectly inscrutable instinct teaches the grassbird who hides her eggs under long meadow grass to creep timidly yards from the nest and then fly up boldly in the wrong place and a like instinct teaches shy girls all kinds of unconscious stratagems when the one secret of their life is approached they may be as truthful in all other things as the strictest puritan but here they deceive by an infallible necessity and meanwhile where was sally kittridge in all this matter was her heart in the least touched by the black eyes and long lashes who can say had she a heart well sally was a good girl when one got sufficiently far down through the foam and froth of the surface to find what was in the depths of her nature there was abundance there of good womanly feeling generous and strong if one could but get at it  she was the best and brightest of daughters to the old captain whose accounts she kept whose clothes she mended whose dinner she often dressed and carried to him from loving choice and mrs kittridge regarded her housewifely accomplishments with pride though she never spoke to her otherwise than in words of criticism and rebuke as in her view an honest mother should who means to keep a flourishing sprig of a daughter within limits of a proper humility  but as for any sentiment or love toward any person of the other sex sally as yet had it not her numerous admirers were only so many subjects for the exercise of her dear delight of teasing and moses pennel the last and most considerable differed from the rest only in the fact that he was a match for her in this redoubtable art and science and this made the game she was playing with him altogether more stimulating than that she had carried on with any other of her admirers for moses could sulk and storm for effect and clear off as bright as harpswell bay after a thunderstormfor effect also moses could play jealous and make believe all those thousandandone shadowy nothings that coquettes male and female get up to carry their points with and so their quarrels and their makingsup were as manifold as the seabreezes that ruffled the ocean before the captains door  there is but one danger in play of this kind and that is that deep down in the breast of every slippery frothy elfish undine sleeps the germ of an unawakened soul which suddenly in the course of some such trafficking with the outward shows and seemings of affection may wake up and make of the teasing tricksy elf a sad and earnest womana creature of loves and selfdenials and faithfulness unto deathin short something altogether too good too sacred to be trifled with and when a man enters the game protected by a previous attachment which absorbs all his nature and the woman awakes in all her depth and strength to feel the real meaning of love and life she finds that she has played with one stronger than she at a terrible disadvantage  is this mine lying dark and evil under the saucy little feet of our sally well we should not of course be surprised some day to find it so     chapter xxix  night talks   october is come and among the black glooms of the pine forests flare out the scarlet branches of the rockmaple and the beechgroves are all arrayed in gold through which the sunlight streams in subdued richness october is come with long bright hazy days swathing in purple mists the rainbow brightness of the forests and blending the otherwise gaudy and flaunting colors into wondrous harmonies of splendor and moses pennels ship is all built and ready waiting only a favorable day for her launching  and just at this moment moses is sauntering home from captain kittridges in company with sally for mara has sent him to bring her to tea with them moses is in high spirits everything has succeeded to his wishes and as the two walk along the high bold rocky shore his eye glances out to the open ocean where the sun is setting and the fresh wind blowing and the white sails flying and already fancies himself a seaking commanding his own place and going from land to land  there hasnt been a more beautiful ship built here these twenty years he says in triumph  oho mr conceit said sally thats only because its yours nowyour geese are all swans i wish you could have seen the typhoon that ben drummond sailed ina real handsome fellow he was what a pity there arent more like him  i dont enter on the merits of ben drummonds beauty said moses but i dont believe the typhoon was one whit superior to our ship besides miss sally i thought you were going to take it under your especial patronage and let me honor it with your name  how absurd you always will be talking about thatwhy dont you call it after mara  after mara said moses i dont want toit wouldnt be appropriateone wants a different kind of girl to name a ship aftersomething bold and bright and dashing  thank you sir but i prefer not to have my bold and dashing qualities immortalized in this way said sally besides sir how do i know that you wouldnt run me on a rock the very first thing when i give my name to a ship it must have an experienced commander she added maliciously for she knew that moses was specially vulnerable on this point  as you please said moses with heightened color allow me to remark that he who shall ever undertake to command the sally kittridge will have need of all his experienceand then perhaps not be able to know the ways of the craft  see him now said sally with a malicious laugh we are getting wrathy are we  not i said moses it would cost altogether too much exertion to get angry at every teasing thing you choose to say miss sally by and by i shall be gone and then wont your conscience trouble you  my conscience is all easy so far as you are concerned sir your selfesteem is too deeprooted to suffer much from my poor little nipsthey produce no more impression than a catbird pecking at the cones of that sprucetree yonder now dont you put your hand where your heart is supposed to betheres nobody at home there you know theres mara coming to meet us and sally bounded forward to meet mara with all those demonstrations of extreme delight which young girls are fond of showering on each other  its such a beautiful evening said mara and we are all in such good spirits about mosess ship and i told him you must come down and hold counsel with us as to what was to be done about the launching and the name you know that is to be decided onare you going to let it be called after you  not i indeed i should always be reading in the papers of horrible accidents that had happened to the sally kittridge  sally has so set her heart on my being unlucky said moses that i believe if i make a prosperous voyage the disappointment would injure her health  she doesnt mean what she says said mara but i think there are some objections in a young ladys name being given to a ship  then i suppose mara said moses that you would not have yours either  i would be glad to accommodate you in anything but that said mara quietly but she added why need the ship be named for anybody a ship is such a beautiful graceful thing it should have a fancy name  well suggest one said moses  dont you remember said mara one saturday afternoon when you and sally and i launched your little ship down in the cove after you had come from your first voyage at the banks  i do said sally we called that the ariel mara after that old torn play you were so fond of thats a pretty name for a ship  why not take that said mara  i bow to the decree said moses the ariel it shall be  yes and you remember said sally mr moses here promised at that time that he would build a ship and take us two round the world with him  mosess eyes fell upon mara as sally said these words with a sort of sudden earnestness of expression which struck her he was really feeling very much about something under all the bantering disguise of his demeanor she said to herself could it be that he felt unhappy about his prospects with sally that careless liveliness of hers might wound him perhaps now when he felt that he was soon to leave her  mara was conscious herself of a deep undercurrent of sadness as the time approached for the ship to sail that should carry moses from her and she could not but think some such feeling must possess her mind in vain she looked into sallys great spanish eyes for any signs of a lurking softness or tenderness concealed under her sparkling vivacity sallys eyes were admirable windows of exactly the right size and color for an earnest tender spirit to look out of but just now there was nobody at the casement but a slippery elf peering out in tricksy defiance  when the three arrived at the house tea was waiting on the table for them mara fancied that moses looked sad and preoccupied as they sat down to the teatable which mrs pennel had set forth festively with the best china and the finest tablecloth and the choicest sweetmeats in fact moses did feel that sort of tumult and upheaving of the soul which a young man experiences when the great crisis comes which is to plunge him into the struggles of manhood it is a time when he wants sympathy and is grated upon by uncomprehending merriment and therefore his answers to sally grew brief and even harsh at times and mara sometimes perceived him looking at herself with a singular fixedness of expression though he withdrew his eyes whenever she turned hers to look on him like many another little woman she had fixed a theory about her friends into which she was steadily interweaving all the facts she saw sally must love moses because she had known her from childhood as a good and affectionate girl and it was impossible that she could have been going on with moses as she had for the last six months without loving him she must evidently have seen that he cared for her and in how many ways had she shown that she liked his society and him but then evidently she did not understand him and mara felt a little womanly selfpluming on the thought that she knew him so much better she was resolved that she would talk with sally about it and show her that she was disappointing moses and hurting his feelings yes she said to herself sally has a kind heart and her coquettish desire to conceal from him the extent of her affection ought now to give way to the outspoken tenderness of real love  so mara pressed sally with the oldtimes request to stay and sleep with her for these two the only young girls in so lonely a neighborhood had no means of excitement or dissipation beyond this occasional sleeping togetherby which is meant of course lying awake all night talking  when they were alone together in their chamber sally let down her long black hair and stood with her back to mara brushing it mara sat looking out of the window where the moon was making a wide sheet of silversparkling water everything was so quiet that the restless dash of the tide could be plainly heard sally was rattling away with her usual gayety  and so the launching is to come off next thursday what shall you wear  im sure i havent thought said mara  well i shall try and finish my blue merino for the occasion what fun it will be i never was on a ship when it was launched and i think it will be something perfectly splendid  but doesnt it sometimes seem sad to think that after all this moses will leave us to be gone so long  what do i care said sally tossing back her long hair as she brushed it and then stopping to examine one of her eyelashes  sally dear you often speak in that way said mara but really and seriously you do yourself great injustice you could not certainly have been going on as you have these six months past with a man you did not care for  well i do care for him sort o said sally but is that any reason i should break my heart for his goingthats too much for any man  but sally you must know that moses loves you  im not so sure said sally freakishly tossing her head and laughing  if he did not said mara why has he sought you so much and taken every opportunity to be with you im sure ive been left here alone hour after hour when my only comfort was that it was because my two best friends loved each other as i know they must some time love some one better than they do me  the most practiced selfcontrol must fail some time and maras voice faltered on these last words and she put her hands over her eyes sally turned quickly and looked at her then giving her hair a sudden fold round her shoulders and running to her friend she kneeled down on the floor by her and put her arms round her waist and looked up into her face with an air of more gravity than she commonly used  now mara what a wicked inconsistent fool i have been did you feel lonesomedid you care i ought to have seen that but im selfish i love admiration and i love to have some one to flatter me and run after me and so ive been going on and on in this silly way but i didnt know you caredindeed i didntyou are such a deep little thing nobody can ever tell what you feel i never shall forgive myself if you have been lonesome for you are worth five hundred times as much as i am you really do love moses i dont  i do love him as a dear brother said mara  dear fiddlestick said sally love is love and when a person loves all she can it isnt much use to talk so ive been a wicked sinner that i have love do you suppose i would bear with moses pennel all his ins and outs and ups and downs and be always putting him before myself in everything as you do no i couldnt i havent it in me but you have hes a sinner too and deserves to get me for a wife but mara i have tormented him welltheres some comfort in that  its no comfort to me said mara i see his heart is set on youthe happiness of his life depends on youand that he is pained and hurt when you give him only cold trifling words when he needs real true love it is a serious thing dear to have a strong man set his whole heart on you it will do him a great good or a great evil and you ought not to make light of it  oh pshaw mara you dont know these fellows they are only playing games with us if they once catch us they have no mercy and for one heres a child that isnt going to be caught i can see plain enough that moses pennel has been trying to get me in love with him but he doesnt love me no he doesnt said sally reflectively he only wants to make a conquest of me and im just the same i want to make a conquest of himat least i have been wanting tobut now i see its a false wicked kind of way to do as weve been doing  and is it really possible sally that you dont love him said mara her large serious eyes looking into sallys what be with him so muchseem to like him so muchlook at him as i have seen you doand not love him  i cant help my eyes they will look so said sally hiding her face in maras lap with a sort of coquettish consciousness i tell you ive been silly and wicked but hes just the same exactly  and you have worn his ring all summer  yes and he has worn mine and i have a lock of his hair and he has a lock of mine yet i dont believe he cares for them a bit oh his heart is safe enough if he has any it isnt with me that i know  but if you found it were sally suppose you found that after all you were the one love and hope of his life that all he was doing and thinking was for you that he was laboring and toiling and leaving home so that he might some day offer you a heart and home and be your best friend for life perhaps he dares not tell you how he really does feel  its no such thing its no such thing said sally lifting up her head with her eyes full of tears which she dashed angrily away what am i crying for i hate him im glad hes going away lately it has been such a trouble to me to have things go on so im really getting to dislike him you are the one he ought to love perhaps all this time you are the one he does love said sally with a sudden energy as if a new thought had dawned in her mind  oh no he does not even love me as he once did when we were children said mara he is so shut up in himself so reserved i know nothing about what passes in his heart  no more does anybody said sally moses pennel isnt one that says and does things straightforward because he feels so but he says and does them to see what you will do thats his way nobody knows why he has been going on with me as he has he has had his own reasons doubtless as i have had mine  he has admired you very much sally said mara and praised you to me very warmly he thinks you are so handsome i could tell you ever so many things he has said about you he knows as i do that you are a more enterprising practical sort of body than i am too everybody thinks you are engaged i have heard it spoken of everywhere  everybody is mistaken then as usual said sally perhaps aunt roxy was in the right of it when she said that moses would never be in love with anybody but himself  aunt roxy has always been prejudiced and unjust to moses said mara her cheeks flushing she never liked him from a child and she never can be made to see anything good in him i know that he has a deep hearta nature that craves affection and sympathy and it is only because he is so sensitive that he is so reserved and conceals his feelings so much he has a noble kind heart and i believe he truly loves you sally it must be so  sally rose from the floor and went on arranging her hair without speaking something seemed to disturb her mind she bit her lip and threw down the brush and comb violently in the clear depths of the little square of lookingglass a face looked into hers whose eyes were perturbed as if with the shadows of some coming inward storm the black brows were knit and the lips quivered she drew a long breath and burst out into a loud laugh  what are you laughing at now said mara who stood in her white nightdress by the window with her hair falling in golden waves about her face  oh because these fellows are so funny said sally its such fun to see their actions come now she added turning to mara dont look so grave and sanctified its better to laugh than cry about things any time its a great deal better to be made hardhearted like me and not care for anybody than to be like you for instance the idea of any ones being in love is the drollest thing to me i havent the least idea how it feels i wonder if i ever shall be in love  it will come to you in its time sally  oh yesi suppose like the chickenpox or the whooping cough said sally one of the things to be gone through with and rather disagreeable while it lastsso i hope to put it off as long as possible  well come said mara we must not sit up all night  after the two girls were nestled into bed and the light out instead of the brisk chatter there fell a great silence between them the full round moon cast the reflection of the window on the white bed and the ever restless moan of the sea became more audible in the fixed stillness the two faces both young and fair yet so different in their expression lay each still on its pillowtheir wideopen eyes gleaming out in the shadow like mystical gems each was breathing softly as if afraid of disturbing the other at last sally gave an impatient movement  how lonesome the sea sounds in the night she said i wish it would ever be still  i like to hear it said mara when i was in boston for a while i thought i could not sleep i used to miss it so much  there was another silence which lasted so long that each girl thought the other asleep and moved softly but at a restless movement from sally mara spoke again  sallyyou asleep  noi thought you were  i wanted to ask you said mara did moses ever say anything to you about meyou know i told you how much he said about you  yes he asked me once if you were engaged to mr adams  and what did you tell him said mara with increasing interest  well i only plagued him i sometimes made him think you were and sometimes that you were not and then again that there was a deep mystery in hand but i praised and glorified mr adams and told him what a splendid match it would be and put on any little bits of embroidery here and there that i could lay hands on i used to make him sulky and gloomy for a whole evening sometimes in that way it was one of the best weapons i had  sally what does make you love to tease people so said mara  why you know the hymn says      let dogs delight to bark and bite       for god hath made them so     let bears and lions growl and fight       for tis their nature too  thats all the account i can give of it  but said mara i never can rest easy a moment when i see i am making a person uncomfortable  well i dont tease anybody but the men i dont tease father or mother or youbut men are fair game they are such thumby blundering creatures and we can confuse them so  take care sally its playing with edge tools you may lose your heart some day in this kind of game  never you fear said sally but arent you sleepylets go to sleep  both girls turned their faces resolutely in opposite directions and remained for an hour with their large eyes looking out into the moonlit chamber like the fixed stars over harpswell bay at last sleep drew softly down the fringy curtains     chapter xxx  the launch of the ariel   in the plain simple regions we are describingwhere the sea is the great avenue of active life and the pine forests are the great source of wealthshipbuilding is an engrossing interest and there is no fête that calls forth the community like the launching of a vessel and no wonder for what is there belonging to this workaday world of ours that has such a neverfailing fund of poetry and grace as a ship a ship is a beauty and a mystery wherever we see it its white wings touch the regions of the unknown and the imaginative they seem to us full of the odors of quaint strange foreign shores where life we fondly dream moves in brighter currents than the muddy tranquil tides of every day  who that sees one bound outward with her white breasts swelling and heaving as if with a reaching expectancy does not feel his own heart swell with a longing impulse to go with her to the faroff shores even at dingy crowded wharves amid the stir and tumult of great cities the coming in of a ship is an event that never can lose its interest but on these romantic shores of maine where all is so wild and still and the blue sea lies embraced in the arms of dark solitary forests the sudden incoming of a ship from a distant voyage is a sort of romance who that has stood by the blue waters of middle bay engirdled as it is by soft slopes of green farming land interchanged here and there with heavy billows of foresttrees or rocky pinecrowned promontories has not felt that sense of seclusion and solitude which is so delightful and then what a wonder there comes a ship from china drifting in like a white cloudthe gallant creature how the waters hiss and foam before her with what a great free generous plash she throws out her anchors as if she said a cheerful well done to some glorious work accomplished the very life and spirit of strange romantic lands come with her suggestions of sandalwood and spice breathe through the pinewoods she is an oriental queen with hands full of mystical gifts all her garments smell of myrrh and cassia out of the ivory palaces whereby they have made her glad no wonder men have loved ships like birds and that there have been found brave rough hearts that in fatal wrecks chose rather to go down with their ocean love than to leave her in the last throes of her deathagony  a shipbuilding a shipsailing community has an unconscious poetry ever underlying its existence exotic ideas from foreign lands relieve the trite monotony of life the shipowner lives in communion with the whole world and is less likely to fall into the petty commonplaces that infest the routine of inland life  never arose a clearer or lovelier october morning than that which was to start the ariel on her watery pilgrimage moses had risen while the stars were yet twinkling over their own images in middle bay to go down and see that everything was right and in all the houses that we know in the vicinity everybody woke with the one thought of being ready to go to the launching  mrs pennel and mara were also up by starlight busy over the provisions for the ample cold collation that was to be spread in a barn adjoining the scenethe materials for which they were packing into baskets covered with nice clean linen cloths ready for the little sailboat which lay within a stones throw of the door in the brightening dawn her white sails looking rosy in the advancing light  it had been agreed that the pennels and the kittridges should cross together in this boat with their contributions of good cheer  the kittridges too had been astir with the dawn intent on their quota of the festive preparations in which dame kittridges housewifely reputation was involvedfor it had been a disputed point in the neighborhood whether she or mrs pennel made the best doughnuts and of course with this fact before her mind her efforts in this line had been all but superhuman  the captain skipped in and out in high featheroccasionally pinching sallys cheek and asking if she were going as captain or mate upon the vessel after it was launched for which he got in return a fillip of his sleeve or a sly twitch of his coattails for sally and her old father were on romping terms with each other from early childhood a thing which drew frequent lectures from the always exhorting mrs kittridge  such levity she said as she saw sally in full chase after his retreating figure in order to be revenged for some sly allusions he had whispered in her ear  sally kittridge sally kittridge she called come back this minute what are you about i should think your father was old enough to know better  lawful sakes polly it kind o renews ones youth to get a new ship done said the captain skipping in at another door sort o puts me in mind o that i went out capen in when i was jist beginning to court you as somebody else is courtin our sally here  now father said sally threateningly what did i tell you  its really lemancholy said the captain to think how it does distress gals to talk to em bout the fellers when they aint thinkin o nothin else all the time they cant even laugh without sayin hehehe  now father you know ive told you five hundred times that i dont care a cent for moses pennelthat hes a hateful creature said sally looking very red and determined  yes yes said the captain i take that ars the reason youve ben awearin the ring he gin you and them ribbins youve got on your neck this blessed minute and why youve giggled off to singinschool and lord knows where with him all summerthat ars clear now  but father said sally getting redder and more earnest i dont care for him really and ive told him so i keep telling him so and he will run after me  haw haw laughed the captain he will will he jist so sally that ars jist the way your ma there talked to me and it kind o couraged me along i knew that gals always has to be read backard jist like the writin in the barbary states  captain kittridge will you stop such ridiculous talk said his helpmeet and jist carry this ere basket of cold chicken down to the landin agin the pennels come round in the boat and you must step spry for theres two more baskets acomin  the captain shouldered the basket and walked toward the sea with it and sally retired to her own little room to hold a farewell consultation with her mirror before she went  you will perhaps think from the conversation that you heard the other night that sally now will cease all thought of coquettish allurement in her acquaintance with moses and cause him to see by an immediate and marked change her entire indifference probably as she stands thoughtfully before her mirror she is meditating on the propriety of laying aside the ribbons he gave herperhaps she will alter that arrangement of her hair which is one that he himself particularly dictated as most becoming to the character of her face she opens a little drawer which looks like a flower garden all full of little knots of pink and blue and red and various fancies of the toilet and looks into it reflectively she looses the ribbon from her hair and chooses anotherbut moses gave her that too and said she remembers that when she wore that he should know she had been thinking of him sally is sally yetas full of sly dashes of coquetry as a tulip is of streaks  theres no reason i should make myself look like a fright because i dont care for him she says besides after all that he has said he ought to say morehe ought at least to give me a chance to say nohe shall too said the gypsy winking at the bright elfish face in the glass  sally kittridge sally kittridge called her mother how long will you stay prinkincome down this minute  law now mother said the captain gals must prink afore such times its as natural as for hens to dress their feathers afore a thunderstorm  sally at last appeared all in a flutter of ribbons and scarfs whose bright high colors assorted well with the ultramarine blue of her dress and the vivid pomegranate hue of her cheeks the boat with its white sails flapping was balancing and courtesying up and down on the waters and in the stern sat mara her shining white straw hat trimmed with blue ribbons set off her golden hair and pink shell complexion the dark even penciling of her eyebrows and the beauty of the brow above the brown translucent clearness of her thoughtful eyes made her face striking even with its extreme delicacy of tone she was unusually animated and excited and her cheeks had a rich bloom of that pure deep rosecolor which flushes up in fair complexions under excitement and her eyes had a kind of intense expression for which they had always been remarkable all the deep secluded yearning of repressed nature was looking out of them giving that pathos which every one has felt at times in the silence of eyes  now bless that ar gal said the captain when he saw her our sally heres handsome but shes got the real newjerusalem look she haslike them in the revelations that wears the fine linen clean and white  bless you captain kittridge dont be amakin a fool of yourself about no girl at your time o life said mrs kittridge speaking under her breath in a nipping energetic tone for they were coming too near the boat to speak very loud  good mornin mis pennel weve got a good day and a mercy it is so member when we launched the north star that it rained guns all the mornin and the water got into the baskets when we was afetchin the things over and made a sight o pester  yes said mrs pennel with an air of placid satisfaction everything seems to be going right about this vessel  mrs kittridge and sally were soon accommodated with seats and zephaniah pennel and the captain began trimming sail the day was one of those perfect gems of days which are to be found only in the jewelcasket of october a day neither hot nor cold with an air so clear that every distant pinetree top stood out in vivid separateness and every woody point and rocky island seemed cut out in crystalline clearness against the sky there was so brisk a breeze that the boat slanted quite to the waters edge on one side and mara leaned over and pensively drew her little pearly hand through the water and thought of the days when she and moses took this sail togethershe in her pink sunbonnet and he in his round straw hat with a tin dinnerpail between them and now today the ship of her childish dreams was to be launched that launching was something she regarded almost with superstitious awe the ship built on one element but designed to have its life in another seemed an image of the soul framed and fashioned with many a weary hammerstroke in this life but finding its true element only when it sails out into the ocean of eternity such was her thought as she looked down the clear translucent depths but would it have been of any use to try to utter it to anybodyto sally kittridge for example who sat all in a cheerful rustle of bright ribbons beside her and who would have shown her white teeth all round at such a suggestion and said now mara who but you would have thought of that  but there are souls sent into this world who seem to have always mysterious affinities for the invisible and the unknownwho see the face of everything beautiful through a thin veil of mystery and sadness the germans call this yearning of spirit homesicknessthe dim remembrances of a spirit once affiliated to some higher sphere of whose lost brightness all things fair are the vague reminders as mara looked pensively into the water it seemed to her that every incident of life came up out of its depths to meet her her own face reflected in a wavering image sometimes shaped itself to her gaze in the likeness of the pale lady of her childhood who seemed to look up at her from the waters with dark mysterious eyes of tender longing once or twice this dreamy effect grew so vivid that she shivered and drawing herself up from the water tried to take an interest in a very minute account which mrs kittridge was giving of the way to make cornfritters which should taste exactly like oysters the closing direction about the quantity of mace mrs kittridge felt was too sacred for common ears and therefore whispered it into mrs pennels bonnet with a knowing nod and a look from her black spectacles which would not have been bad for a priestess of dodona in giving out an oracle in this secret direction about the mace lay the whole mystery of cornoysters and who can say what consequences might ensue from casting it in an unguarded manner before the world  and now the boat which has rounded harpswell point is skimming across to the head of middle bay where the new ship can distinctly be discerned standing upon her ways while moving clusters of people were walking up and down her decks or lining the shore in the vicinity all sorts of gossiping and neighborly chitchat is being interchanged in the little world assembling there  i haint seen the pennels nor the kittridges yet said aunt ruey whose little rolypoly figure was made illustrious in her best cinnamoncolored dyed silk theres moses pennel agoin up that ar ladder dear me what a beautiful feller he is its a pity he aint agoin to marry mara lincoln after all  ruey do hush up said miss roxy frowning sternly down from under the shadow of a preternatural black straw bonnet trimmed with huge bows of black ribbon which headpiece sat above her curls like a helmet dont be agettin sentimental ruey whatever else you getand talkin like miss emily sewell about matchmakin i cant stand it it rises on my stomach such talk does as to that ar moses pennel folks aint so certain as they thinks what hell do sally kittridge may think hes agoin to have her because hes been afoolin round with her all summer and sally kittridge may jist find shes mistaken thats all  yes said miss ruey i member when i was a girl my old aunt jerushy hopkins used to be always adwellin on this scripture and ive been havin it brought up to me this mornin there are three things which are too wonderful for me yea four which i know not the way of an eagle in the air the way of a serpent upon a rock the way of a ship in the sea and the way of a man with a maid she used to say it as a kind o caution to me when she used to think abram peters was bein attentive to me ive often reflected what a massy it was that ar never come to nothin for hes a poor drunken critter now  well for my part said miss roxy fixing her eyes critically on the boat that was just at the landing i should say the ways of a maid with a man was full as particular as any of the rest of em do look at sally kittridge now theres tom hiers ahelpin her out of the boat and did you see the look she gin moses pennel as she went by him wal moses has got mara on his arm anyhow theres a gal worth sixandtwenty of the other do see them ribbins and scarfs and the furbelows and the way that ar sally kittridge handles her eyes shes one that one feller aint never enough for  maras heart beat fast when the boat touched the shore and moses and one or two other young men came to assist in their landing never had he looked more beautiful than at this moment when flushed with excitement and satisfaction he stood on the shore his straw hat off and his black curls blowing in the seabreeze he looked at sally with a look of frank admiration as she stood there dropping her long black lashes over her bright cheeks and coquettishly looking out from under them but she stepped forward with a little energy of movement and took the offered hand of tom hiers who was gazing at her too with undisguised rapture and moses stepping into the boat helped mrs pennel on shore and then took mara on his arm looking her over as he did so with a glance far less assured and direct than he had given to sally  you wont be afraid to climb the ladders mara said he  not if you help me she said  sally and tom hiers had already walked on toward the vessel she ostentatiously chatting and laughing with him mosess brow clouded a little and mara noticed it moses thought he did not care for sally he knew that the little hand that was now lying on his arm was the one he wanted and yet he felt vexed when he saw sally walk off triumphantly with another it was the doginthemanger feeling which possesses coquettes of both sexes sally on all former occasions had shown a marked preference for him and professed supreme indifference to tom hiers  its all well enough he said to himself and he helped mara up the ladders with the greatest deference and tenderness this little woman is worth ten such girls as sally if one only could get her heart here we are on our ship mara he said as he lifted her over the last barrier and set her down on the deck look over there do you see eagle island did you dream when we used to go over there and spend the day that you ever would be on my ship as you are today you wont be afraid will you when the ship starts  i am too much of a seagirl to fear on anything that sails in water said mara with enthusiasm what a splendid ship how nicely it all looks  come let me take you over it said moses and show you my cabin  meanwhile the graceful little vessel was the subject of various comments by the crowd of spectators below and the clatter of workmens hammers busy in some of the last preparations could yet be heard like a shower of hailstones under her  i hope the ways are well greased said old captain eldritch member how the john peters stuck in her ways for want of their being greased  dont you remember the grand turk that keeled over five minutes after she was launched said the quavering voice of miss ruey there was jist such a company of thoughtless young creatures aboard as there is now  well there wasnt nobody hurt said captain kittridge if mis kittridge would let me id be glad to go aboard this ere and be launched with em  i tell the capn hes too old to be climbin round and mixin with young folks frolics said mrs kittridge  i suppose capn pennel youve seen that the ways is all right said captain broad returning to the old subject  oh yes its all done as well as hands can do it said zephaniah moses has been here since starlight this morning and moses has pretty good faculty about such matters  wheres mr sewell and miss emily said miss ruey oh there they are over on that pile of rocks they get a pretty fair view there  mr sewell and miss emily were sitting under a cedartree with two or three others on a projecting point whence they could have a clear view of the launching they were so near that they could distinguish clearly the figures on deck and see moses standing with his hat off the wind blowing his curls back talking earnestly to the goldenhaired little woman on his arm  it is a launch into life for him said mr sewell with suppressed feeling  yes and he has mara on his arm said miss emily thats as it should be who is that that sally kittridge is flirting with now oh tom hiers well hes good enough for her why dont she take him said miss emily in her zeal jogging her brothers elbow  im sure emily i dont know said mr sewell dryly perhaps he wont be taken  dont you think moses looks handsome said miss emily i declare there is something quite romantic and spanish about him dont you think so theophilus  yes i think so said her brother quietly looking externally the meekest and most matteroffact of persons but deep within him a voice sighed poor dolores be comforted your boy is beautiful and prosperous  there there said miss emily i believe she is starting  all eyes of the crowd were now fixed on the ship the sound of hammers stopped the workmen were seen flying in every direction to gain good positions to see her gothat sight so often seen on those shores yet to which use cannot dull the most insensible  first came a slight almost imperceptible movement then a swift exultant rush a dash into the hissing water and the air was rent with hurrahs as the beautiful ship went floating far out on the blue seas where her fairer life was henceforth to be  mara was leaning on mosess arm at the instant the ship began to move but in the moment of the last dizzy rush she felt his arm go tightly round her holding her so close that she could hear the beating of his heart  hurrah he said letting go his hold the moment the ship floated free and swinging his hat in answer to the hats scarfs and handkerchiefs which fluttered from the crowd on the shore his eyes sparkled with a proud light as he stretched himself upward raising his head and throwing back his shoulders with a triumphant movement he looked like a young seaking just crowned and the fact is the less wonderful therefore that mara felt her heart throb as she looked at him and that a treacherous throb of the same nature shook the breezy ribbons fluttering over the careless heart of sally a handsome young seacaptain treading the deck of his own vessel is in his time and place a prince  moses looked haughtily across at sally and then passed a halflaughing defiant flash of eyes between them he looked at mara who could certainly not have known what was in her eyes at the momentan expression that made his heart give a great throb and wonder if he saw aright but it was gone a moment after as all gathered around in a knot exchanging congratulations on the fortunate way in which the affair had gone off then came the launching in boats to go back to the collation on shore where were high merrymakings for the space of one or two hours and thus was fulfilled the first part of moses pennels saturday afternoon prediction     chapter xxxi  greek meets greek   moses was now within a day or two of the time of his sailing and yet the distance between him and mara seemed greater than ever it is astonishing when two people are once started on a wrong understanding with each other how near they may live how intimate they may be how many things they may have in common how many words they may speak how closely they may seem to simulate intimacy confidence friendship while yet there lies a gulf between them that neither crossesa reserve that neither explores  like most shy girls mara became more shy the more really she understood the nature of her own feelings the conversation with sally had opened her eyes to the secret of her own heart and she had a guilty feeling as if what she had discovered must be discovered by every one else yes it was clear she loved moses in a way that made him she thought more necessary to her happiness than she could ever be to hisin a way that made it impossible to think of him as wholly and for life devoted to another without a constant inner conflict in vain had been all her little stratagems practiced upon herself the whole summer long to prove to herself that she was glad that the choice had fallen upon sally she saw clearly enough now that she was not gladthat there was no woman or girl living however dear who could come for life between him and her without casting on her heart the shuddering sorrow of a dim eclipse  but now the truth was plain to herself her whole force was directed toward the keeping of her secret i may suffer she thought but i will have strength not to be silly and weak nobody shall knownobody shall dream itand in the long long time that he is away i shall have strength given me to overcome  so mara put on her most cheerful and matteroffact kind of face and plunged into the making of shirts and knitting of stockings and talked of the coming voyage with such a total absence of any concern that moses began to think after all there could be no depth to her feelings or that the deeper ones were all absorbed by some one else  you really seem to enjoy the prospect of my going away said he to her one morning as she was energetically busying herself with her preparations  well of course you know your career must begin you must make your fortune and it is pleasant to think how favorably everything is shaping for you  one likes however to be a little regretted said moses in a tone of pique  a little regretted maras heart beat at these words but her hypocrisy was well practiced she put down the rebellious throb and assuming a look of open sisterly friendliness said quite naturally why we shall all miss you of course  of course said mosesone would be glad to be missed some other way than of course  oh as to that make yourself easy said mara we shall all be dull enough when you are gone to content the most exacting still she spoke not stopping her stitching and raising her soft brown eyes with a frank open look into mosessno tremor not even of an eyelid  you men must have everything she continued gayly the enterprise the adventure the novelty the pleasure of feeling that you are something and can do something in the world and besides all this you want the satisfaction of knowing that we women are following in chains behind your triumphal car  there was a dash of bitterness in this which was a rare ingredient in maras conversation  moses took the word and you women sit easy at home sewing and singing and forming romantic pictures of our life as like its homely reality as romances generally are to reality and while we are off in the hard struggle for position and the means of life you hold your hearts ready for the first rich man that offers a fortune ready made  the first said mara oh you naughty sometimes we try two or three  well then i suppose this is from one of them said moses flapping down a letter from boston directed in a masculine hand which he had got at the postoffice that morning  now mara knew that this letter was nothing in particular but she was taken by surprise and her skin was delicate as peachblossom and so she could not help a sudden blush which rose even to her golden hair vexed as she was to feel it coming she put the letter quietly in her pocket and for a moment seemed too discomposed to answer  you do well to keep your own counsel said moses no friend so near as ones self is a good maxim one does not expect young girls to learn it so early but it seems they do  and why shouldnt they as well as young men said mara confidence begets confidence they say  i have no ambition to play confidant said moses although as one who stands to you in the relation of older brother and guardian and just on the verge of a long voyage i might be supposed anxious to know  and i have no ambition to be confidant said mara all her spirit sparkling in her eyes although when one stands to you in the relation of an only sister i might be supposed perhaps to feel some interest to be in your confidence  the words older brother and only sister grated on the ears of both the combatants as a decisive sentence mara never looked so pretty in her life for the whole force of her being was awake glowing and watchful to guard passage door and window of her soul that no treacherous hint might escape had he not just reminded her that he was only an older brother and what would he think if he knew the truthand moses thought the words only sister unequivocal declaration of how the matter stood in her view and so he rose and saying i wont detain you longer from your letter took his hat and went out  are you going down to sallys said mara coming to the door and looking out after him  yes  well ask her to come home with you and spend the evening i have ever so many things to tell her  i will said moses as he lounged away  the thing is clear enough said moses to himself why should i make a fool of myself any further what possesses us men always to set our hearts precisely on what isnt to be had theres sally kittridge likes me i can see that plainly enough for all her mincing and why couldnt i have had the sense to fall in love with her she will make a splendid showy woman she has talent and tact enough to rise to any position i may rise to let me rise as high as i will she will always have skill and energy in the conduct of life and when all the froth and foam of youth has subsided she will make a noble woman why then do i cling to this fancy i feel that this little flossy cloud this delicate quiet little puff of thistledown on which i have set my heart is the only thing for me and that without her my life will always be incomplete i remember all our early life it was she who sought me and ran after me and where has all that love gone to gone to this fellow thats plain enough when a girl like her is so comfortably cool and easy its because her heart is off somewhere else  this conversation took place about four oclock in as fine an october afternoon as you could wish to see the sun sloping westward turned to gold the thousand blue scales of the everheaving sea and soft pinescented winds were breathing everywhere through the forests waving the long swaying films of heavy moss and twinkling the leaves of the silver birches that fluttered through the leafy gloom the moon already in the sky gave promise of a fine moonlight night and the wild and lonely stillness of the island and the thoughts of leaving in a few days all conspired to foster the restless excitement in our heros mind into a kind of romantic unrest  now in some such states a man disappointed in one woman will turn to another because in a certain way and measure her presence stills the craving and fills the void it is a sort of supposititious courtshipa saying to one woman who is sympathetic and receptive the words of longing and love that another will not receive to be sure it is a game unworthy of any true mana piece of sheer reckless inconsiderate selfishness but men do it as they do many other unworthy things from the mere promptings of present impulse and let consequences take care of themselves moses met sally that afternoon in just the frame to play the lover in this hypothetical supposititious way with words and looks and tones that came from feelings given to another and as to sally well for once greek met greek for although sally as we showed her was a girl of generous impulses she was yet in no danger of immediate translation on account of superhuman goodness in short sally had made up her mind that moses should give her a chance to say that precious and golden no which should enable her to count him as one of her captivesand then he might go where he liked for all her  so said the wicked elf as she looked into her own great eyes in the little square of mirror shaded by a misty asparagus bush and to this end there were various braidings and adornings of the lustrous black hair and coquettish earrings were mounted that hung glancing and twinkling just by the smooth outline of her glowing cheekand then sally looked at herself in a friendly way of approbation and nodded at the bright dimpled shadow with a look of secret understanding the real sally and the sally of the lookingglass were on admirable terms with each other and both of one mind about the plan of campaign against the common enemy sally thought of him as he stood kingly and triumphant on the deck of his vessel his great black eyes flashing confident glances into hers and she felt a rebellious rustle of all her plumage no sir she said to herself you dont do it you shall never find me among your slavesthat you know of added a doubtful voice within her never to your knowledge she said as she turned away i wonder if he will come here this evening she said as she began to work upon a pillowcaseone of a set which mrs kittridge had confided to her nimble fingers the seam was long straight and monotonous and sally was restless and fidgety her thread would catch in knots and when she tried to loosen it would break and the needle had to be threaded over somehow the work was terribly irksome to her and the house looked so still and dim and lonesome and the ticktock of the kitchenclock was insufferable and sally let her work fall in her lap and looked out of the open window far to the open ocean where a fresh breeze was blowing toward her and her eyes grew deep and dreamy following the gliding ship sails sally was getting romantic had she been reading novels novels what can a pretty woman find in a novel equal to the romance that is all the while weaving and unweaving about her and of which no human foresight can tell her the catastrophe it is novels that give false views of life is there not an eternal novel with all these false cheating views written in the breast of every beautiful and attractive girl whose witcheries make every man that comes near her talk like a fool like a sovereign princess she never hears the truth unless it be from the one manly man in a thousand who understands both himself and her from all the rest she hears only flatteries more or less ingenious according to the ability of the framer compare for instance what tom brown says to little seraphina at the party tonight with what tom brown sober says to sober sister maria about her tomorrow tom remembers that he was a fool last night and knows what he thinks and always has thought today but pretty seraphina thinks he adores her so that no matter what she does he will never see a flaw she is sure of thatpoor little puss she does not know that philosophic tom looks at her as he does at a glass of champagne or a dose of exhilarating gas and calculates how much it will do for him to take of the stimulus without interfering with his serious and settled plans of life which of course he doesnt mean to give up for her the onethousandandfirst man in creation is he that can feel the fascination but will not flatter and that tries to tell to the little tyrant the rare word of truth that may save her he is as we say the onethousandandfirst well as sally sat with her great dark eyes dreamily following the ship she mentally thought over all the compliments moses had paid her expressed or understood and those of all her other admirers who had built up a sort of cloudworld around her so that her little feet never rested on the soil of reality sally was shrewd and keen and had a native motherwit in the discernment of spirits that made her feel that somehow this was all false coin but still she counted it over and it looked so pretty and bright that she sighed to think it was not real  if it only had been she thought if there were only any truth to the creature he is so handsomeits a pity but i do believe in his secret heart he is in love with mara he is in love with some one i know i have seen looks that must come from something real but they were not for me i have a kind of power over him though she said resuming her old wicked look and ill puzzle him a little and torment him he shall find his match in me and sally nodded to a catbird that sat perched on a pinetree as if she had a secret understanding with him and the catbird went off into a perfect roulade of imitations of all that was going on in the late birdoperas of the season  sally was roused from her revery by a spray of goldenrod that was thrown into her lap by an invisible hand and moses soon appeared at the window  theres a plume that would be becoming to your hair he said stay let me arrange it  no no youll tumble my hairwhat can you know of such things  moses held the spray aloft and leaned toward her with a sort of quiet determined insistence  by your leave fair lady he said wreathing it in her hair and then drawing back a little he looked at her with so much admiration that sally felt herself blush  come now i dare say youve made a fright of me she said rising and instinctively turning to the lookingglass but she had too much coquetry not to see how admirably the golden plume suited her black hair and the brilliant eyes and cheeks she turned to moses again and courtesied saying thank you sir dropping her eyelashes with a mock humility  come now said moses i am sent after you to come and spend the evening lets walk along the seashore and get there by degrees  and so they set out but the path was circuitous for moses was always stopping now at this point and now at that and enacting some of those thousand little byplays which a man can get up with a pretty woman they searched for smooth pebbles where the waves had left themmanycolored pink and crimson and yellow and brown all smooth and rounded by the eternal tossings of the old sea that had made playthings of them for centuries and with every pebble given and taken were things said which should have meant more and more had the play been earnest had moses any idea of offering himself to sally no but he was in one of those fluctuating unresisting moods of mind in which he was willing to lie like a chip on the tide of present emotion and let it rise and fall and dash him when it liked and sally never had seemed more beautiful and attractive to him than that afternoon because there was a shade of reality and depth about her that he had never seen before  come on and let me show you my hermitage said moses guiding her along the slippery projecting rocks all covered with yellow tresses of seaweed sally often slipped on this treacherous footing and moses was obliged to hold her up and instinctively he threw a meaning into his manner so much more than ever he had before that by the time they had gained the little cove both were really agitated and excited he felt that temporary delirium which is often the mesmeric effect of a strong womanly presence and she felt that agitation which every woman must when a determined hand is striking on the great vital chord of her being when they had stepped round the last point of rock they found themselves driven by the advancing tide up into the little lonely grottoand there they were with no lookout but the wide blue sea all spread out in rose and gold under the twilight skies with a silver moon looking down upon them  sally said moses in a low earnest whisper you love medo you not and he tried to pass his arm around her  she turned and flashed at him a look of mingled terror and defiance and struck out her hands at him then impetuously turning away and retreating to the other end of the grotto she sat down on a rock and began to cry  moses came toward her and kneeling tried to take her hand she raised her head angrily and again repulsed him  go she said what right had you to say that what right had you even to think it  sally you do love me it cannot but be you are a woman you could not have been with me as we have and not feel more than friendship  oh you menyour conceit passes understanding said sally you think we are born to be your bond slavesbut for once you are mistaken sir i dont love you and whats more you dont love meyou know you dont you know that you love somebody else you love marayou know you do theres no truth in you she said rising indignantly  moses felt himself color there was an embarrassed pause and then he answered  sally why should i love mara her heart is all given to anotheryou yourself know it  i dont know it either said sally i know it isnt so  but you gave me to understand so  well sir you put prying questions about what you ought to have asked her and so what was i to do besides i did want to show you how much better mara could do than to take you besides i didnt know till lately i never thought she could care much for any man more than i could  and you think she loves me said moses eagerly a flash of joy illuminating his face do you really  there you are said sally its a shame i have let you know yes moses pennel she loves you like an angel as none of you men deserve to be lovedas you in particular dont  moses sat down on a point of rock and looked on the ground discountenanced sally stood up glowing and triumphant as if she had her foot on the neck of her oppressor and meant to make the most of it  now what do you think of yourself for all this summers workfor what you have just said asking me if i didnt love you supposing now i had done as other girls would played the fool and blushed and said yes why tomorrow you would have been thinking how to be rid of me i shall save you all that trouble sir  sally i own i have been acting like a fool said moses humbly  you have done more than thatyou have acted wickedly said sally  and am i the only one to blame said moses lifting his head with a show of resistance  listen sir said sally energetically i have played the fool and acted wrong too but there is just this difference between you and me you had nothing to lose and i a great deal your heart such as it was was safely disposed of but supposing you had won mine what would you have done with it that was the last thing you considered  go on sally dont spare im a vile dog unworthy of either of you said moses  sally looked down on her handsome penitent with some relenting as he sat quite dejected his strong arms drooping and his long eyelashes cast down  ill be friends with you she said because after all im not so very much better than you we have both done wrong and made dear mara very unhappy but after all i was not so much to blame as you because if there had been any reality in your love i could have paid it honestly i had a heart to givei have it now and hope long to keep it said sally  sally you are a right noble girl i never knew what you were till now said moses looking at her with admiration  its the first time for all these six months that we have either of us spoken a word of truth or sense to each other i never did anything but trifle with you and you the same now weve come to some plain dry land we may walk on and be friends so now help me up these rocks and i will go home  and youll not come home with me  of course not i think you may now go home and have one talk with mara without witnesses     chapter xxxii  the betrothal   moses walked slowly home from his interview with sally in a sort of maze of confused thought in general men understand women only from the outside and judge them with about as much real comprehension as an eagle might judge a canarybird the difficulty of real understanding intensifies in proportion as the man is distinctively manly and the woman womanly there are men with a large infusion of the feminine element in their composition who read the female nature with more understanding than commonly falls to the lot of men but in general when a man passes beyond the mere outside artifices and unrealities which lie between the two sexes and really touches his finger to any vital chord in the heart of a fair neighbor he is astonished at the quality of the vibration  i could not have dreamed there was so much in her thought moses as he turned away from sally kittridge he felt humbled as well as astonished by the moral lecture which this frisky elf with whom he had all summer been amusing himself preached to him from the depths of a real womans heart what she said of maras loving him filled his eyes with remorseful tearsand for the moment he asked himself whether this restless jealous exacting desire which he felt to appropriate her whole life and heart to himself were as really worthy of the name of love as the generous selfdevotion with which she had all her life made all his interests her own  was he to go to her now and tell her that he loved her and therefore he had teased and vexed hertherefore he had seemed to prefer another before hertherefore he had practiced and experimented upon her nature a suspicion rather stole upon him that love which expresses itself principally in making exactions and giving pain is not exactly worthy of the name and yet he had been secretly angry with her all summer for being the very reverse of this for her apparent cheerful willingness to see him happy with another for the absence of all signs of jealousyall desire of exclusive appropriation it showed he said to himself that there was no love and now when it dawned on him that this might be the very heroism of selfdevotion he asked himself which was best worthy to be called love  she did love him then the thought blazed up through the smouldering embers of thought in his heart like a tongue of flame she loved him he felt a sort of triumph in it for he was sure sally must know they were so intimate well he would go to her and tell her all confess all his sins and be forgiven  when he came back to the house all was still evening the moon which was playing brightly on the distant sea left one side of the brown house in shadow moses saw a light gleaming behind the curtain in the little room on the lower floor which had been his peculiar sanctum during the summer past he had made a sort of library of it keeping there his books and papers upon the white curtain flitted from time to time a delicate busy shadow now it rose and now it stooped and then it rose againgrew dim and vanished and then came out again his heart beat quick  mara was in his room busy as she always had been before his departures in cares for him how many things had she made for him and done and arranged for him all his life long things which he had taken as much as a matter of course as the shining of that moon his thought went back to the times of his first going to seahe a rough chaotic boy sensitive and surly and she the ever thoughtful good angel of a little girl whose lovingkindness he had felt free to use and to abuse he remembered that he made her cry there when he should have spoken lovingly and gratefully to her and that the words of acknowledgment that ought to have been spoken never had been saidremained unsaid to that hour he stooped low and came quite close to the muslin curtain all was bright in the room and shadowy without he could see her movements as through a thin white haze she was packing his seachest his things were lying about her folded or rolled nicely now he saw her on her knees writing something with a pencil in a book and then she enveloped it very carefully in silk paper and tied it trimly and hid it away at the bottom of the chest then she remained a moment kneeling at the chest her head resting in her hands a sort of strange sacred feeling came over him as he heard a low murmur and knew that she felt a presence that he never felt or acknowledged he felt somehow that he was doing her a wrong thus to be prying upon moments when she thought herself alone with god a sort of vague remorse filled him he felt as if she were too good for him he turned away and entering the front door of the house stepped noiselessly along and lifted the latch of the door he heard a rustle as of one rising hastily as he opened it and stood before mara he had made up his mind what to say but when she stood there before him with her surprised inquiring eyes he felt confused  what home so soon she said  you did not expect me then  of course notnot for these two hours so she said looking about i found some mischief to do among your things if you had waited as long as i expected they would all have been quite right again and you would never have known  moses sat down and drew her toward him as if he were going to say something and then stopped and began confusedly playing with her workbox  now please dont said she archly you know what a little old maid i am about my things  mara said moses people have asked you to marry them have they not  people asked me to marry them said mara i hope not what an odd question  you know what i mean said moses you have had offers of marriagefrom mr adams for example  and what if i have  you did not accept him mara said moses  no i did not  and yet he was a fine man i am told and well fitted to make you happy  i believe he was said mara quietly  and why were you so foolish  mara was fretted at this question she supposed moses had come to tell her of his engagement to sally and that this was a kind of preface and she answered  i dont know why you call it foolish i was a true friend to mr adams i saw intellectually that he might have the power of making any reasonable woman happy i think now that the woman will be fortunate who becomes his wife but i did not wish to marry him  is there anybody you prefer to him mara said moses  she started up with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes  you have no right to ask me that though you are my brother  i am not your brother mara said moses rising and going toward her and that is why i ask you i feel i have a right to ask you  i do not understand you she said faintly  i can speak plainer then i wish to put in my poor venture i love you maranot as a brother i wish you to be my wife if you will  while moses was saying these words mara felt a sort of whirling in her head and it grew dark before her eyes but she had a strong firm will and she mastered herself and answered after a moment in a quiet sorrowful tone how can i believe this moses if it is true why have you done as you have this summer  because i was a fool marabecause i was jealous of mr adamsbecause i somehow hoped after all that you either loved me or that i might make you think more of me through jealousy of another they say that love always is shown by jealousy  not true love i should think said mara how could you do soit was cruel to hercruel to me  i admit itanything everything you can say i have acted like a fool and a knave if you will but after all mara i do love you i know i am not worthy of younever wasnever can be you are in all things a true noble woman and i have been unmanly  it is not to be supposed that all this was spoken without accompaniments of looks movements and expressions of face such as we cannot give but such as doubled their power to the parties concerned and the i love you had its usual conclusive force as argument apology promisecovering like charity a multitude of sins  half an hour after you might have seen a youth and a maiden coming together out of the door of the brown house and walking arm in arm toward the seabeach  it was one of those wonderfully clear moonlight evenings when the ocean like a great reflecting mirror seems to double the brightness of the skyand its vast expanse lay all around them in its stillness like an eternity of waveless peace mara remembered that time in her girlhood when she had followed moses into the woods on just such a nighthow she had sat there under the shadows of the trees and looked over to harpswell and noticed the white houses and the meetinghouse all so bright and clear in the moonlight and then off again on the other side of the island where silent ships were coming and going in the mysterious stillness they were talking together now with that outflowing fullness which comes when the seal of some great reserve has just been brokengoing back over their lives from day to day bringing up incidents of childhood and turning them gleefully like two children  and then moses had all the story of his life to relate and to tell mara all he had learned of his mothergoing over with all the narrative contained in mr sewells letter  you see mara that it was intended that you should be my fate he ended so the winds and waves took me up and carried me to the lonely island where the magic princess dwelt  you are prince ferdinand said mara  and you are miranda said he  ah she said with fervor how plainly we can see that our heavenly father has been guiding our way how good he isand how we must try to live for himboth of us  a sort of cloud passed over mosess brow he looked embarrassed and there was a pause between them and then he turned the conversation  mara felt pained it was like a sudden discord such thoughts and feelings were the very breath of her life she could not speak in perfect confidence and unreserve as she then spoke without uttering them and her finely organized nature felt a sort of electric consciousness of repulsion and dissent she grew abstracted and they walked on in silence  i see now mara i have pained you said moses but there are a class of feelings that you have that i have not and cannot have no i cannot feign anything i can understand what religion is in you i can admire its results i can be happy if it gives you any comfort but people are differently constituted i never can feel as you do  oh dont say never said mara with an intensity that nearly startled him it has been the one prayer the one hope of my life that you might have these comfortsthis peace  i need no comfort or peace except what i shall find in you said moses drawing her to himself and looking admiringly at her but pray for me still i always thought that my wife must be one of the sort of women who pray  and why said mara in surprise  because i need to be loved a great deal and it is only that kind who pray who know how to love really if you had not prayed for me all this time you never would have loved me in spite of all my faults as you did and do and will as i know you will he said folding her in his arms and in his secret heart he said some of this intensity this devotion which went upward to heaven will be mine one day she will worship me  the fact is mara he said i am a child of this world i have no sympathy with things not seen you are a halfspiritual creaturea child of air and but for the great womans heart in you i should feel that you were something uncanny and unnatural i am selfish i know i frankly admit i never disguised it but i love your religion because it makes you love me it is an incident to that loving trusting nature which makes you all and wholly mine as i want you to be i want you all and wholly every thought every feelingthe whole strength of your being i dont care if i say it i would not wish to be second in your heart even to god himself  oh moses said mara almost starting away from him such words are dreadful they will surely bring evil upon us  i only breathed out my nature as you did yours why should you love an unseen and distant being more than you do one whom you can feel and see who holds you in his arms whose heart beats like your own  moses said mara stopping and looking at him in the clear moonlight god has always been to me not so much like a father as like a dear and tender mother perhaps it was because i was a poor orphan and my father and mother died at my birth that he has been so loving to me i never remember the time when i did not feel his presence in my joys and my sorrows i never had a thought of joy and sorrow that i could not say to him i never woke in the night that i did not feel that he was loving and watching me and that i loved him in return oh how many many things i have said to him about you my heart would have broken years ago had it not been for him because though you did not know it you often seemed unkind you hurt me very often when you did not mean to his love is so much a part of my life that i cannot conceive of life without it it is the very air i breathe  moses stood still a moment for mara spoke with a fervor that affected him then he drew her to his heart and said  oh what could ever make you love me  he sent you and gave you to me she answered to be mine in time and eternity  the words were spoken in a kind of enthusiasm so different from the usual reserve of mara that they seemed like a prophecy that night for the first time in her life had she broken the reserve which was her very nature and spoken of that which was the intimate and hidden history of her soul     chapter xxxiii  at a quilting   and so said mrs captain badger to miss roxy toothacre it seems that moses pennel aint going to have sally kittridge after allhes engaged to mara lincoln  more shame for him said miss roxy with a frown that made her mohair curls look really tremendous  miss roxy and mrs badger were the advance party at a quilting to be holden at the house of mr sewell and had come at one oclock to do the marking upon the quilt which was to be filled up by the busy fingers of all the women in the parish said quilt was to have a bordering of a pattern commonly denominated in those parts clamshell and this miss roxy was diligently marking with indigo  what makes you say so now said mrs badger a fat comfortable motherly matron who always patronized the last matrimonial venture that put forth among the young people  what business had he to flirt and gallivant all summer with sally kittridge and make everybody think he was going to have her and then turn round to mara lincoln at the last minute i wish id been in maras place  in miss roxys martial enthusiasm she gave a sudden poke to her frisette giving to it a diagonal bristle which extremely increased its usually severe expression and any one contemplating her at the moment would have thought that for moses pennel or any other young man to come with tender propositions in that direction would have been indeed a venturesome enterprise  i tell you what tis mis badger she said ive known mara since she was borni may say i fetched her up myself for if i hadnt trotted and tended her them first four weeks of her life mis penneld never have got her through and ive watched her every year since and havin moses pennel is the only silly thing i ever knew her to do but you never can tell what a girl will do when it comes to marryinnever  but hes a real stirrin likely young man and captain of a fine ship said mrs badger  dont care if hes captain of twenty ships said miss roxy obdurately he aint a professor of religion and i believe hes an infidel and shes one of the lords people  well said mrs badger you know the unbelievin husband shall be sanctified by the believin wife  much sanctifyin hell get said miss roxy contemptuously i dont believe he loves her any more than fancy shes the last plaything and when hes got her hell be tired of her as he always was with anything he got ever since i tell you moses pennel is all for pride and ambition and the world and his wife when he gets used to her ll be only a circumstancethats all  come now miss roxy said miss emily who in her best silk and smoothlybrushed hair had just come in we must not let you talk so moses pennel has had long talks with brother and he thinks him in a very hopeful way and we are all delighted and as to mara she is as fresh and happy as a little rose  so i tell roxy said miss ruey who had been absent from the room to hold private consultations with miss emily concerning the biscuits and spongecake for tea and who now sat down to the quilt and began to unroll a capacious and very limp calico threadcase and placing her spectacles awry on her little pug nose she began a series of ingenious dodges with her thread designed to hit the eye of her needle  the old folks she continued are een amost tickled to piecescause they think itll jist be the salvation of him to get mara  i aint one of the sort that wants to be ausin up girls for the salvation of fellers said miss roxy severely ever since he nearly like to have got her eat up by sharks by giggiting her off in the boat out to sea when she want moren three years old i always have thought he was a misfortin in that family and i think so now  here broke in mrs eaton a thrifty energetic widow of a deceased seacaptain who had been left with a tidy little fortune which commanded the respect of the neighborhood mrs eaton had entered silently during the discussion but of course had come as every other woman had that afternoon with views to be expressed upon the subject  for my part she said as she stuck a decisive needle into the first clamshell pattern i aint so sure that all the advantage in this match is on moses pennels part mara lincoln is a good little thing but she aint fitted to help a man alongshell always be wantin somebody to help her why i member goin a voyage with capn eaton when i saved the ship if anybody didit was allowed on all hands capn eaton wasnt hearty at that time he was jist gettin up from a feverit was when marthy ann was a baby and i jist took her and went to sea and took care of him i used to work the longitude for him and help him lay the ships course when his head was badand when we came on the coast we were kept out of harbor beatin about nearly three weeks and all the ships tacklin was stiff with ice and i tell you the men never would have stood it through and got the ship in if it hadnt been for me i kept their mittens and stockings all the while adryin at my stove in the cabin and hot coffee all the while aboilin for em or i believe theyd afrozen their hands and feet and never been able to work the ship in thats the way i did now sally kittridge is a great deal more like that than mara  theres no doubt that sally is smart said mrs badger but then it aint every one can do like you mrs eaton  oh no oh no was murmured from mouth to mouth mrs eaton mustnt think shes any rule for otherseverybody knows she can do more than most people whereat the pacified mrs eaton said she didnt know as it was anything remarkableit showed what anybody might do if theyd only try and have resolution but that mara never had been brought up to have resolution and her mother never had resolution before her it wasnt in any of mary pennels family she knew their grandmother and all their aunts and they were all a weakly set and not fitted to get along in lifethey were a kind of people that somehow didnt seem to know how to take hold of things  at this moment the consultation was hushed up by the entrance of sally kittridge and mara evidently on the closest terms of intimacy and more than usually demonstrative and affectionate they would sit together and use each others needles scissors thread and thimbles interchangeably as if anxious to express every minute the most overflowing confidence sly winks and didactic nods were covertly exchanged among the elderly people and when mrs kittridge entered with more than usual airs of impressive solemnity several of these were covertly directed toward her as a matron whose views in life must have been considerably darkened by the recent event  mrs kittridge however found an opportunity to whisper under her breath to miss ruey what a relief to her it was that the affair had taken such a turn she had felt uneasy all summer for fear of what might come sally was so thoughtless and worldly she felt afraid that he would lead her astray she didnt see for her part how a professor of religion like mara could make up her mind to such an unsettled kind of fellow even if he did seem to be rich and welltodo but then she had done looking for consistency and she sighed and vigorously applied herself to quilting like one who has done with the world  in return miss ruey sighed and took snuff and related for the hundredth time to mrs kittridge the great escape she once had from the addresses of abraham peters who had turned out a poor drunken creetur but then it was only natural that mara should be interested in moses and the good soul went off into her favorite verse      the fondness of a creatures love       how strong it strikes the sense     thither the warm affections move       nor can we drive them thence  in fact miss rueys sentimental vein was in quite a gushing state for she more than once extracted from the dark corners of the limp calico threadcase we have spoken of certain longtreasured morceaux of newspaper poetry of a tender and sentimental cast which she had laid up with true yankee economy in case any one should ever be in a situation to need them they related principally to the union of kindred hearts and the joys of reciprocated feeling and the pains of absence good miss ruey occasionally passed these to mara with glances full of meaning which caused the poor old thing to resemble a sentimental goblin keeping sally kittridge in a perfect hysterical tempest of suppressed laughter and making it difficult for mara to preserve the decencies of life toward her wellintending old friend the trouble with poor miss ruey was that while her body had grown old and crazy her soul was just as juvenile as everand a simple juvenile soul disporting itself in a crazy battered old body is at great disadvantage it was lucky for her however that she lived in the most sacred unconsciousness of the ludicrous effect of her little indulgences and the pleasure she took in them was certainly of the most harmless kind the world would be a far better and more enjoyable place than it is if all people who are old and uncomely could find amusement as innocent and christianlike as miss rueys inoffensive threadcase collection of sentimental truisms  this quilting of which we speak was a solemn festive occasion of the parish held a week after moses had sailed away and so piquant a morsel as a recent engagement could not of course fail to be served up for the company in every variety of garnishing which individual tastes might suggest  it became an ascertained fact however in the course of the evening festivities that the minister was serenely approbative of the event that captain kittridge was at length brought to a sense of the errors of his way in supposing that sally had ever cared a pin for moses more than as a mutual friend and confidant and the great affair was settled without more ripples of discomposure than usually attend similar announcements in more refined society     chapter xxxiv  friends   the quilting broke up at the primitive hour of nine oclock at which in early new england days all social gatherings always dispersed captain kittridge rowed his helpmeet with mara and sally across the bay to the island  come and stay with me tonight sally said mara  i think sally had best be at home said mrs kittridge theres no sense in girls talking all night  there aint sense in nothin else mother said the captain next to sparkin which is the christianist thing i knows on comes gals talks bout their sparks theys as natural as crowsfoot and red columbines in the spring and spring dont come but once a year neitherand so let em take the comfort ont i warrant now polly youve laid awake nights and talked about me  weve all been foolish once said mrs kittridge  well mother we want to be foolish too said sally  well you and your father are too much for me said mrs kittridge plaintively you always get your own way  how lucky that my way is always a good one said sally  well you know sally you are going to make the beer tomorrow still objected her mother  oh yes thats another reason said sally mara and i shall come home through the woods in the morning and we can get whole apronfuls of young wintergreen and besides i know where theres a lot of sassafras root well dig it wont we mara  yes and ill come down and help you brew said mara dont you remember the beer i made when moses came home  yes yes i remember said the captain you sent us a couple of bottles  we can make better yet now said mara the wintergreen is young and the green tips on the spruce boughs are so full of strength everything is lively and sunny now  yes yes said the captain and i spect i know why things do look pretty lively to some folks dont they  i dont know what sort of work youll make of the beer among you said mrs kittridge but you must have it your own way  mrs kittridge who never did anything else among her teadrinking acquaintances but laud and magnify sallys good traits and domestic acquirements felt constantly bound to keep up a faint show of controversy and authority in her dealings with herthe fading remains of the strict government of her childhood but it was nevertheless very perfectly understood in a general way that sally was to do as she pleased and so when the boat came to shore she took the arm of mara and started up toward the brown house  the air was soft and balmy and though the moon by which the troth of mara and moses had been plighted had waned into the latest hours of the night still a thousand stars were lying in twinkling brightness reflected from the undulating waves all around them and the tide as it rose and fell made a sound as gentle and soft as the respiration of a peaceful sleeper  well mara said sally after an interval of silence all has come out right you see that it was you whom he loved what a lucky thing for me that i am made so heartless or i might not be as glad as i am  you are not heartless sally said mara its the enchanted princess asleep the right one hasnt come to waken her  maybe so said sally with her old light laugh if i only were sure he would make you happy nowhalf as happy as you deserveid forgive him his share of this summers mischief the fault was just half mine you see for i witched with him i confess it i have my own little spiderwebs for these great lordly flies and i like to hear them buzz  take care sally never do it again or the spiderweb may get round you said mara  never fear me said sally but mara i wish i felt sure that moses could make you happy do you really now when you think seriously feel as if he would  i never thought seriously about it said mara but i know he needs me that i can do for him what no one else can i have always felt all my life that he was to be mine that he was sent to me ordained for me to care for and to love  you are well mated said sally he wants to be loved very much and you want to love theres the active and passive voice as they used to say at miss pluchers but yet in your natures you are opposite as any two could well be  mara felt that there was in these chance words of sally more than she perceived no one could feel as intensely as she could that the mind and heart so dear to her were yet as to all that was most vital and real in her inner life unsympathizing to her the spiritual world was a reality god an everpresent consciousness and the line of this present life seemed so to melt and lose itself in the anticipation of a future and brighter one that it was impossible for her to speak intimately and not unconsciously to betray the fact to him there was only the life of this world there was no present god and from all thought of a future life he shrank with a shuddering aversion as from something ghastly and unnatural she had realized this difference more in the few days that followed her betrothal than all her life before for now first the barrier of mutual constraint and misunderstanding having melted away each spoke with an abandon and unreserve which made the acquaintance more vitally intimate than ever it had been before it was then that mara felt that while her sympathies could follow him through all his plans and interests there was a whole world of thought and feeling in her heart where his could not follow her and she asked herself would it be so always must she walk at his side forever repressing the utterance of that which was most sacred and intimate living in a nominal and external communion only how could it be that what was so lovely and clear in its reality to her that which was to her as lifeblood that which was the vital air in which she lived and moved and had her being could be absolutely nothing to him was it really possible as he said that god had no existence for him except in a nominal cold belief that the spiritual world was to him only a land of pale shades and doubtful glooms from which he shrank with dread and the least allusion to which was distasteful and would this always be so and if so could she be happy  but mara said the truth in saying that the question of personal happiness never entered her thoughts she loved moses in a way that made it necessary to her happiness to devote herself to him to watch over and care for him and though she knew not how she felt a sort of presentiment that it was through her that he must be brought into sympathy with a spiritual and immortal life  all this passed through maras mind in the reverie into which sallys last words threw her as she sat on the doorsill and looked off into the starry distance and heard the weird murmur of the sea  how lonesome the sea at night always is said sally i declare mara i dont wonder you miss that creature for to tell the truth i do a little bit it was something you know to have somebody to come in and to joke with and to say how he liked ones hair and ones ribbons and all that i quite got up a friendship for moses so that i can feel how dull you must be and sally gave a half sigh and then whistled a tune as adroitly as a blackbird  yes said mara we two girls down on this lonely island need some one to connect us with the great world and he was so full of life and so certain and confident he seemed to open a way before one out into life  well of course while he is gone there will be plenty to do getting ready to be married said sally by the by when i was over to portland the other day maria potter showed me a new pattern for a bedquilt the sweetest thing you can imagineit is called the morning star there is a great star in the centre and little stars all aroundwhite on a blue ground i mean to begin one for you  i am going to begin spinning some very fine flax next week said mara and have i shown you the new pattern i drew for a counterpane it is to be morningglories leaves and flowers you knowa pretty idea isnt it  and so the conversation falling from the region of the sentimental to the practical the two girls went in and spent an hour in discussions so purely feminine that we will not enlighten the reader further therewith sally seemed to be investing all her energies in the preparation of the wedding outfit of her friend about which she talked with a constant and restless activity and for which she formed a thousand plans and projected shopping tours to portland brunswick and even to bostonthis last being about as far off a venture at that time as paris now seems to a boston belle  when you are married said sally youll have to take me to live with you that creature shant have you all to himself i hate men they are so exorbitantthey spoil all our playmates and what shall i do when you are gone  you will go with mrwhats his name said mara  pshaw i dont know him i shall be an old maid said sally and really there isnt much harm in that if one could have companyif somebody or other wouldnt marry all ones friendsthats lonesome she said winking a tear out of her black eyes and laughing if i were only a young fellow now mara id have you myself and that would be just the thing and id shoot moses if he said a word and id have money and id have honors and id carry you off to europe and take you to paris and rome and nobody knows where and wed live in peace as the storybooks say  come sally how wild you are talking said mara and the clock has just struck one lets try to go to sleep  sally put her face to maras and kissed her and mara felt a moist spot on her cheekcould it be a tear     chapter xxxv  the toothacre cottage   aunt roxy and aunt ruey toothacre lived in a little onestory gambrelroofed cottage on the side of harpswell bay just at the head of the long cove which we have already described the windows on two sides commanded the beautiful bay and the opposite shores and on the other they looked out into the dense forest through whose deep shadows of white birch and pine the silver rise and fall of the sea daily revealed itself  the house itself was a miracle of neatness within for the two thrifty sisters were worshipers of soap and sand and these two tutelary deities had kept every board of the housefloor white and smooth and also every table and bench and tub of household use there was a sacred care over each article however small and insignificant which composed their slender household stock the loss or breakage of one of them would have made a visible crack in the hearts of the worthy sistersfor every plate knife fork spoon cup or glass was as intimate with them as instinct with home feeling as if it had a soul each defect or spot had its history and a cracked dish or article of furniture received as tender and considerate medical treatment as if it were capable of understanding and feeling the attention  it was now a warm spicy day in juneone of those which bring out the pineapple fragrance from the firshoots and cause the spruce and hemlocks to exude a warm resinous perfume the two sisters for a wonder were having a day to themselves free from the numerous calls of the vicinity for twelve miles round the room in which they were sitting was bestrewn with fragments of dresses and bonnets which were being torn to pieces in a most wholesale way with a view to a general rejuvenescence a person of unsympathetic temperament and disposed to take sarcastic views of life might perhaps wonder what possible object these two battered and weatherbeaten old bodies proposed to themselves in this processwhether miss roxys gaunt blackstraw helmet which she had worn defiantly all winter was likely to receive much lustre from being pressed over and trimmed with an old green ribbon which that energetic female had colored black by a domestic recipe and whether miss roxys rusty bombazette would really seem to the world any fresher for being ripped and washed and turned for the second or third time and made over with every breadth in a different situation probably after a week of efficient labor busily expended in bleaching dyeing pressing sewing and ripping an unenlightened spectator seeing them come into the meetinghouse would simply think there are those two old frights with the same old things on they have worn these fifty years happily the weird sisters were contentedly ignorant of any such remarks for no duchesses could have enjoyed a more quiet belief in their own social position and their semiannual spring and fall rehabilitation was therefore entered into with the most simplehearted satisfaction  im athinkin roxy said aunt ruey considerately turning and turning on her hand an old straw bonnet on which were streaked all the marks of the former trimming in lighter lines which revealed too clearly the effects of wind and weatherim athinkin whether or no this ere mightnt as well be dyed and done with it as try to bleach it out ive had it ten years last may and its kind o losin its freshness you know i dont believe these ere streaks will bleach out  never mind ruey said miss roxy authoritatively im goin to do mis badgers legorn and it wont cost nothin so hang yourn in the barrel along with itthe same smokell do em both mis badger she finds the brimstone and next fall you can put it in the dye when we do the yarn  that ar straw is a beautiful straw said miss ruey in a plaintive tone tenderly examining the battered old headpiecei braided every stroke on it myself and i dont know as i could do it agin my fingers aint quite so limber as they was i dont think i shall put green ribbon on it agin cause green is such a color to ruin if a body gets caught out in a shower theres these green streaks come that day i left my amberil at captain broads and went to meetin mis broad she says to me aunt ruey it wont rain and says i to her well mis broad ill try it though i never did leave my amberil at home but what it rained and so i went and sure enough it rained cats and dogs and streaked my bonnet all up and them ar streaks wont bleach out im feared  how long is it mis badger has had that ar legorn  why you know the capn he brought it home when he came from his voyage from marseilles that ar was when phebe ann was born and shes fifteen year old it was a most elegant thing when he brought it but i think it kind o led mis badger on to extravagant waysfor gettin new trimmin spring and fall so uses up money as fast as new bonnets but mis badgers got the money and shes got a right to use it if she pleases but if id ahad new trimmins spring and fall i shouldnt aput away what i have in the bank  have you seen the straw sally kittridge is braidin for mara lincolns weddin bonnet said miss ruey its jist the finest thing ever you did seeand the whitest i was atellin sally that i could do as well once myself but my mantle was afallin on her sally dont seem to act a bit like a disapinted gal she is as chipper as she can be about maras weddin and seems like she couldnt do too much but laws everybody seems to want to be adoin for her miss emily was ashowin me a fine double damask tablecloth that she was goin to give her and mis pennel shes been aspinnin and layin up sheets and towels and tablecloths all her lifeand then she has all naomis things mis pennel was talkin to me the other day about bleachin em out cause theyd got yellow alyin i kind o felt as if twas unlucky to be afittin out a bride with her dead mothers things but i didnt like to say nothin  ruey said miss roxy impressively i haint never had but jist one mind about mara lincolns weddinits to bebut it

she wont be moses pennels wifenow you see  why whose wife will she be then said miss ruey cause that ar mr adams is married i saw it in the paper last week when i was up to mis badgers  miss roxy shut her lips with oracular sternness and went on with her sewing  whos that comin in the back door said miss ruey as the sound of a footstep fell upon her ear bless me she added as she started up to look if folks aint always nearest when youre talkin about em why mara you come down here and catched us in all our dirt well now were glad to see you if we be said miss ruey     chapter xxxvi  the shadow of death   it was in truth mara herself who came and stood in the doorway she appeared overwearied with her walk for her cheeks had a vivid brightness unlike their usual tender pink her eyes had too a brilliancy almost painful to look upon they seemed like ardent fires in which the life was slowly burning away  sit down sit down little mara said aunt ruey why how like a picture you look this morninone neednt ask you how you doits plain enough that you are pretty well  yes i am aunt ruey she answered sinking into a chair only it is warm today and the sun is so hot thats all i believe but i am very tired  so you are now poor thing said miss ruey roxy wheres my turkeyfeather fan oh here tis there take it and fan you child and maybe youll have a glass of our spruce beer  thank you aunt roxy i brought you some young wintergreen said mara unrolling from her handkerchief a small knot of those fragrant leaves which were wilted by the heat  thank you im sure said miss ruey in delight you always fetch something maraalways would ever since you could toddle roxy and i was jist talkin about your weddin i spose youre gettin things well along down to your house well heres the beer i dont hardly know whether youll think it worked enough though i set it saturday afternoon for all mis twitchell said it was wicked for beer to work sundays said miss ruey with a feeble cackle at her own joke  thank you aunt ruey it is excellent as your things always are i was very thirsty  i spose you hear from moses pretty often now said aunt ruey how kind o providential it happened about his getting that property hell be a rich man now and mara youll come to grandeur wont you well i dont know anybody deserves it morei rally dont mis badger was asayin so asunday and capn kittridge and all on em i spose though weve got to lose youyoull be goin off to boston or new york or somewhere  we cant tell what may happen aunt ruey said mara and there was a slight tremor in her voice as she spoke  miss roxy who beyond the first salutations had taken no part in this conversation had from time to time regarded mara over the tops of her spectacles with looks of grave apprehension and mara looking up now encountered one of these glances  have you taken the dock and dandelion tea i told you about said the wise woman rather abruptly  yes aunt roxy i have taken them faithfully for two weeks past  and do they seem to set you up any said miss roxy  no i dont think they do grandma thinks im better and grandpa and i let them think so but miss roxy cant you think of something else  miss roxy laid aside the straw bonnet which she was ripping and motioned mara into the outer roomthe sinkroom as the sisters called it it was the scullery of their little establishmentthe place where all dishwashing and clotheswashing was generally performedbut the boards of the floor were white as snow and the place had the odor of neatness the open door looked out pleasantly into the deep forest where the waters of the cove now at high tide could be seen glittering through the trees soft moving spots of sunlight fell checkering the feathery ferns and small piney tribes of evergreen which ran in ruffling wreaths of green through the dry brown matting of fallen pine needles birds were singing and calling to each other merrily from the green shadows of the foresteverything had a sylvan fullness and freshness of life there are moods of mind when the sight of the bloom and freshness of nature affects us painfully like the want of sympathy in a dear friend mara had been all her days a child of the woods her delicate life had grown up in them like one of their own cool shaded flowers and there was not a moss not a fern not an upspringing thing that waved a leaf or threw forth a flowerbell that was not a wellknown friend to her she had watched for years its haunts known the time of its coming and its going studied its shy and veiled habits and interwoven with its life each year a portion of her own and now she looked out into the old mossy woods with their wavering spots of sun and shadow with a yearning pain as if she wanted help or sympathy to come from their silent recesses  she sat down on the clean scoured doorsill and took off her straw hat her goldenbrown hair was moist with the damps of fatigue which made it curl and wave in darker little rings about her forehead her eyesthose longing wistful eyeshad a deeper pathos of sadness than ever they had worn before and her delicate lips trembled with some strong suppressed emotion  aunt roxy she said suddenly i must speak to somebody i cant go on and keep up without telling some one and it had better be you because you have skill and experience and can help me if anybody can ive been going on for six months now taking this and taking that and trying to get better but its of no use aunt roxy i feel my life goinggoing just as steadily and as quietly every day as the sand goes out of your hourglass i want to liveoh i never wanted to live so much and i cantoh i know i cant can i nowdo you think i can  mara looked imploringly at miss roxy the hardvisaged woman sat down on the washbench and covering her worn stony visage with her checked apron sobbed aloud  mara was confounded this implacably withered sensible dry woman beneficently impassive in sickness and sorrow weepingit was awful as if one of the fates had laid down her fatal distaff to weep  mara sprung up impulsively and threw her arms round her neck  now dont aunt roxy dont i didnt think you would feel bad or i wouldnt have told you but oh you dont know how hard it is to keep such a secret all to ones self i have to make believe all the time that i am feeling well and getting better i really say what isnt true every day because poor grandmamma how could i bear to see her distress and grandpapaoh i wish people didnt love me so why cannot they let me go and oh aunt roxy i had a letter only yesterday and he is so sure we shall be married this falland i know it cannot be maras voice gave way in sobs and the two wept togetherthe old grim gray woman holding the soft golden head against her breast with a convulsive grasp oh aunt roxy do you love me too said mara i didnt know you did  love ye child said miss roxy yes i love ye like my life i aint one that makes talk about things but i do you come into my arms fust of anybodys in this worldand except poor little hitty i never loved nobody as i have you  ah that was your sister whose grave i have seen said mara speaking in a soothing caressing tone and putting her little thin hand against the grim wasted cheek which was now moist with tears  jes so child she died when she was a year younger than you be she was not lost for god took her poor hitty her life jest dried up like a brook in augustjest so well she was hopefully pious and it was better for her  did she go like me aunt roxy said mara  well yes dear she did begin jest so and i gave her everything i could think of and we had doctors for her far and near but twasnt to bethats all we could say she was called and her time was come  well now aunt roxy said mara at any rate its a relief to speak out to some one its more than two months that i have felt every day more and more that there was no hopelife has hung on me like a weight i have had to make myself keep up and make myself do everything and no one knows how it has tried me i am so tired all the time i could cry and yet when i go to bed nights i cant sleep i lie in such a hot restless way and then before morning i am drenched with cold sweat and feel so weak and wretched i force myself to eat and i force myself to talk and laugh and its all pretense and it wears me outit would be better if i stopped tryingit would be better to give up and act as weak as i feel but how can i let them know  my dear child said aunt roxy the truth is the kindest thing we can give folks in the end when folks know jest where they are why they can walk youll all be supported you must trust in the lord i have been moren forty years with sick rooms and dyin beds and i never knew it fail that those that trusted in the lord was brought through  oh aunt roxy it is so hard for me to give upto give up hoping to live there were a good many years when i thought i should love to departnot that i was really unhappy but i longed to go to heaven though i knew it was selfish when i knew how lonesome i should leave my friends but now oh life has looked so bright i have clung to it so i do now i lie awake nights and pray and try to give it up and be resigned and i cant is it wicked  well its natur to want to live said miss roxy life is sweet and in a genl way we was made to live dont worry the lordll bring you right when his time comes folks isnt always supported jest when they want to be nor as they want to be but yet theyre supported fust and last ef i was to tell you how as i has hope in your case i shouldnt be atellin you the truth i hasnt much of any only all things is possible with god if you could kind o give it all up and rest easy in his hands and keep adoin what you canwhy while theres life theres hope you know and if you are to be made well you will be all the sooner  aunt roxy its all right i know its all right god knows best he will do what is best i know that but my heart bleeds and is sore and when i get his lettersi got one yesterdayit brings it all back again everything is going on so well he says he has done more than all he ever hoped his letters are full of jokes full of spirit ah he little knowsand how can i tell him  child you neednt yet you can jest kind o prepare his mind a little  aunt roxy have you spoken of my case to any onehave you told what you know of me  no child i haint said nothin more than that you was a little weakly now and then  i have such a color every afternoon said mara grandpapa talks about my roses and captain kittridge jokes me about growing so handsome nobody seems to realize how i feel i have kept up with all the strength i had i have tried to shake it off and to feel that nothing was the matterreally there is nothing much only this weakness this morning i thought it would do me good to walk down here i remember times when i could ramble whole days in the woods but i was so tired before i got half way here that i had to stop a long while and rest aunt roxy if you would only tell grandpapa and grandmamma just how things are and what the danger is and let them stop talking to me about wedding thingsfor really and truly i am too unwell to keep up any longer  well child i will said miss roxy your grandfather will be supported and hold you up for hes one of the sort as has the secret of the lordi remember him of old why the day your father and mother was buried he stood up and sung old china and his face was wonderful to see he seemed to be standin with the world under his feet and heaven opening hes a master christian your grandfather is and now you jest go and lie down in the little bedroom and rest you a bit and by and by in the cool of the afternoon ill walk along home with you  miss roxy opened the door of a little room whose white fringy windowcurtains were blown inward by breezes from the blue sea and laid the child down to rest on a clean sweetsmelling bed with as deft and tender care as if she were not a bony hardvisaged angular female in a black mohair frisette  she stopped a moment wistfully before a little profile head of a kind which resembles a black shadow on a white ground that was hitty she said  mara had often seen in the graveyard a mound inscribed to this young person and heard traditionally of a young and pretty sister of miss roxy who had died very many years before but the grave was overgrown with blackberryvines and gray moss had grown into the crevices of the slab which served for a tombstone and never before that day had she heard miss roxy speak of her miss roxy took down the little black object and handed it to mara you cant tell much by that but she was a most beautiful creatur well its all best as it is mara saw nothing but a little black shadow cast on white paper yet she was affected by the perception how bright how beautiful was the image in the memory of that seemingly stern commonplace woman and how of all that in her minds eye she saw and remembered she could find no outward witness but this black block so some day my friends will speak of me as a distant shadow she said as with a sigh she turned her head on the pillow  miss roxy shut the door gently as she went out and betrayed the unwonted rush of softer feelings which had come over her only by being more dictatorial and commanding than usual in her treatment of her sister who was sitting in fidgety curiosity to know what could have been the subject of the private conference  i spose mara wanted to get some advice about makin up her weddin things said miss ruey with a sort of humble quiver as miss roxy began ripping and tearing fiercely at her old straw bonnet as if she really purposed its utter and immediate demolition  no she didnt neither said miss roxy fiercely i declare ruey you are silly your head is always full of weddins weddins weddinsnothin elsefrom mornin till night and night till mornin i tell you theres other things have got to be thought of in this world besides weddin clothes and it would be well if people would think more o gettin their weddin garments ready for the kingdom of heaven thats what maras got to think of for mark my words ruey there is no marryin and givin in marriage for her in this world  why bless me roxy now you dont say so said miss ruey why i knew she was kind o weakly and ailin but  kind o weakly and ailin said miss roxy taking up miss rueys words in a tone of high disgust i should rather think she was and moren that too shes marked for death and that before long too it may be that moses pennelll never see her againhe never half knew what she was worthmaybe hell know when hes lost her thats one comfort  but said miss ruey everybody has been asayin what a beautiful color she was agettin in her cheeks  color in her cheeks snorted miss roxy so does a rockmaple get color in september and turn all scarlet and what for why the frost has been at it and its time is out thats what your bright colors stand for haint you noticed that little gravestone cough jest the faintest in the world and it dont come from a cold and it hangs on i tell you you cant cheat me shes goin jest as mehitabel went jest as sally ann smith went jest as louisa pearson went i could count now on my fingers twenty girls that have gone that way nobody saw em goin till they was gone  well now i dont think the old folks have the least idea ont said miss ruey only last saturday mis pennel was atalkin to me about the sheets and tablecloths shes got out ableachin and she said that the weddin dress was to be made over to mis moselys in portland cause moses hes so particular about havin things genteel  well master mosesll jest have to give up his particular notions said miss roxy and come down in the dust like all the rest on us when the lord sends an east wind and withers our gourds moses pennels one of the sort that expects to drive all before him with the strong arm and sech has to learn that things aint to go as they please in the lords world sech always has to come to spots that they cant get over nor under nor round to have their own way but jest has to give right up square  well roxy said miss ruey how does the poor little thing take it has she got reconciled  reconciled ruey how you do ask questions said miss roxy fiercely pulling a bandanna silk handkerchief out of her pocket with which she wiped her eyes in a defiant manner reconciled its easy enough to talk ruey but how would you like it when everything was goin smooth and playin into your hands and all the world smooth and shiny to be took short up i guess you wouldnt be reconciled thats what i guess  dear me roxy who said i should said miss ruey i want blamin the poor child not a grain  well who said you was ruey answered miss roxy in the same high key  you neednt take my head off said aunt ruey roused as much as her adipose comfortable nature could be youve been atalkin at me ever since you came in from the sinkroom as if i was to blame and snappin at me as if i hadnt a right to ask civil questions and i wont stan it said miss ruey and while im about it ill say that you always have snubbed me and contradicted and ordered me round i wont bear it no longer  come ruey dont make a fool of yourself at your time of life said miss roxy things is bad enough in this world without two lone sisters and churchmembers turnin agin each other you must take me as i am ruey my barks worse than my bite as you know  miss ruey sank back pacified into her usual state of pillowy dependence it was so much easier to be goodnatured than to contend as for miss roxy if you have ever carefully examined a chestnutburr you will remember that hard as it is to handle no plush of downiest texture can exceed the satin smoothness of the fibres which line its heart there are a class of people in new england who betray the uprising of the softer feelings of our nature only by an increase of outward asperitya sort of bashfulness and shyness leaves them no power of expression for these unwonted guests of the heartthey hurry them into inner chambers and slam the doors upon them as if they were vexed at their appearance  now if poor miss roxy had been like you my dear young ladyif her soul had been encased in a round rosy and comely body and looked out of tender blue eyes shaded by golden hair probably the grief and love she felt would have shown themselves only in bursts of feeling most graceful to see and engaging the sympathy of all but this same soul imprisoned in a dry angular body stiff and old and looking out under beetling eyebrows over withered high cheekbones could only utter itself by a passionate tempestunlovely utterance of a lovely impulsedear only to him who sees with a fathers heart the real beauty of spirits it is our firm faith that bright solemn angels in celestial watchings were frequent guests in the homely room of the two sisters and that passing by all accidents of age and poverty withered skins bony features and grotesque movements and shabby clothing they saw more real beauty there than in many a scented boudoir where seeming angels smile in lace and satin  ruey said miss roxy in a more composed voice while her hard bony hands still trembled with excitement this eres been on my mind a good while i haint said nothin to nobody but ive seen it acomin i always thought that child want for a long life lives is run in different lengths and nobody can say whats the matter with some folks only that their threads run out theres more on one spool and less on another i thought when we laid hitty in the grave that i shouldnt never set my heart on nothin elsebut we cant jest say we will or we wont ef we are to be sorely afflicted at any time the lord lets us set our hearts before we know it this eres a great affliction to me ruey but i must jest shoulder my cross and go through with it im goin down tonight to tell the old folks and to make arrangements so that the poor little lamb may have the care she needs shes been akeepin up so long cause she dreaded to let em know but this ere has got to be looked right in the face and i hope therell be grace given to do it     chapter xxxvii  the victory   meanwhile mara had been lying in the passive calm of fatigue and exhaustion her eyes fixed on the window where as the white curtain drew inward she could catch glimpses of the bay gradually her eyelids fell and she dropped into that kind of halfwaking doze when the outer senses are at rest and the mind is all the more calm and clear for their repose in such hours a spiritual clairvoyance often seems to lift for a while the whole stifling cloud that lies like a confusing mist over the problem of life and the soul has sudden glimpses of things unutterable which lie beyond then the narrow straits that look so full of rocks and quicksands widen into a broad clear passage and one after another rosy with a celestial dawn and ringing silver bells of gladness the isles of the blessed lift themselves up on the horizon and the soul is flooded with an atmosphere of light and joy as the burden of christian fell off at the cross and was lost in the sepulchre so in these hours of celestial vision the whole weight of lifes anguish is lifted and passes away like a dream and the soul seeing the boundless ocean of divine love wherein all human hopes and joys and sorrows lie so tenderly upholden comes and casts the one little drop of its personal will and personal existence with gladness into that fatherly depth henceforth with it god and saviour is no more word of mine and thine for in that hour the child of earth feels himself heir of all things all things are yours and ye are christs and christ is gods                                       the child is asleep said miss roxy as she stole on tiptoe into the room when their noon meal was prepared a plate and knife had been laid for her and they had placed for her a tumbler of quaint old engraved glass reputed to have been brought over from foreign parts and which had been given to miss roxy as her share in the effects of the mysterious mr swadkins tea also was served in some egglike india china cups which saw the light only on the most high and festive occasions  hadnt you better wake her said miss ruey a cup of hot tea would do her so much good  miss ruey could conceive of few sorrows or ailments which would not be materially better for a cup of hot tea if not the very elixir of life it was indeed the next thing to it  well said miss roxy after laying her hand for a moment with great gentleness on that of the sleeping girl she dont wake easy and shes tired and she seems to be enjoying it so the bible says he giveth his beloved sleep and i wont interfere ive seen more good come of sleep than most things in my nursin experience said miss roxy and she shut the door gently and the two sisters sat down to their noontide meal  how long the child does sleep said miss ruey as the old clock struck four  it was too much for her this walk down here said aunt roxy shes been doin too much for a long time im agoin to put an end to that well nobody neednt say mara haint got resolution i never see a little thing have more she always did have when she was the leastest little thing she was always quiet and white and still but she did whatever she sot out to  at this moment to their surprise the door opened and mara came in and both sisters were struck with a change that had passed over her it was more than the result of mere physical repose not only had every sign of weariness and bodily languor vanished but there was about her an air of solemn serenity and high repose that made her seem as miss ruey afterwards said like an angel jest walked out of the big bible  why dear child how you have slept and how bright and rested you look said miss ruey  i am rested said mara oh how much and happy she added laying her little hand on miss roxys shoulder i thank you dear friend for all your kindness to me i am sorry i made you feel so sadly but now you mustnt feel so any more for all is wellyes all is well i see now that it is so i have passed beyond sorrowyes forever  softhearted miss ruey here broke into audible sobbing hiding her face in her hands and looking like a tumbled heap of old faded calico in a state of convulsion  dear aunt ruey you mustnt said mara with a voice of gentle authority we mustnt any of us feel so any more there is no harm done no real evil is coming only a good which we do not understand i am perfectly satisfiedperfectly at rest now i was foolish and weak to feel as i did this morning but i shall not feel so any more i shall comfort you all is it anything so dreadful for me to go to heaven how little while it will be before you all come to me oh how littlelittle while  i told you mara that youd be supported in the lords time said miss roxy who watched her with an air of grave and solemn attention first and last folks allers is supported but sometimes there is a long wrestlin the lords give you the victory early  victory said the girl speaking as in a deep muse and with a mysterious brightness in her eyes yes that is the wordit is a victoryno other word expresses it come aunt roxy we will go home i am not afraid now to tell grandpapa and grandmamma god will care for them he will wipe away all tears  well though you musnt think of goin till youve had a cup of tea said aunt ruey wiping her eyes ive kep the teapot hot by the fire and you must eat a little somethin for its long past dinnertime  is it said mara i had no idea i had slept so longhow thoughtful and kind you are  i do wish i could only do more for you said miss ruey i dont seem to get reconciled no ways it seems dreffle harddreffle but im glad you can feel so and the good old soul proceeded to press upon the child not only the tea which she drank with feverish relish but every hoarded dainty which their limited housekeeping commanded  it was toward sunset before miss roxy and mara started on their walk homeward their way lay over the high stony ridge which forms the central part of the island on one side through the pines they looked out into the boundless blue of the ocean and on the other caught glimpses of harpswell bay as it lay glorified in the evening light the fresh cool breeze blowing landward brought with it an invigorating influence which mara felt through all her feverish frame she walked with an energy to which she had long been a stranger she said little but there was a sweetness a repose in her manner contrasting singularly with the passionate melancholy which she had that morning expressed  miss roxy did not interrupt her meditations the nature of her profession had rendered her familiar with all the changing mental and physical phenomena that attend the development of disease and the gradual loosening of the silver cords of a present life certain wellunderstood phrases everywhere current among the mass of the people in new england strikingly tell of the deep foundations of religious earnestness on which its daily life is built a triumphant death was a matter often casually spoken of among the records of the neighborhood and miss roxy felt that there was a vague and solemn charm about its approach yet the soul of the gray dry woman was hot within her for the conversation of the morning had probed depths in her own nature of whose existence she had never before been so conscious the roughest and most matteroffact minds have a craving for the ideal somewhere and often this craving forbidden by uncomeliness and ungenial surroundings from having any personal history of its own attaches itself to the fortune of some other one in a kind of strange disinterestedness some one young and beautiful is to live the life denied to themto be the poem and the romance it is the young mistress of the poor black slavethe pretty sister of the homely old spinsteror the clever son of the consciously illeducated father something of this unconscious personal investment had there been on the part of miss roxy in the nursling whose singular loveliness she had watched for so many years and on whose fair virgin orb she had marked the growing shadow of a fatal eclipse and as she saw her glowing and serene with that peculiar brightness that she felt came from no earthly presence or influence she could scarcely keep the tears from her honest gray eyes  when they arrived at the door of the house zephaniah pennel was sitting in it looking toward the sunset  why reely he said miss roxy we thought you must arun away with mara shes been gone amost all day  i expect shes had enough to talk with aunt roxy about said mrs pennel girls goin to get married have a deal to talk about what with patterns and contrivin and makin up but come in miss roxy were glad to see you  mara turned to miss roxy and gave her a look of peculiar meaning aunt roxy she said you must tell them what we have been talking about today and then she went up to her room and shut the door  miss roxy accomplished her task with a matteroffact distinctness to which her businesslike habits of dealing with sickness and death had accustomed her yet with a sympathetic tremor in her voice which softened the hard directness of her words you can take her over to portland if you say so and get dr wilsons opinion she said in conclusion its best to have all done that can be though in my mind the case is decided  the silence that fell between the three was broken at last by the sound of a light footstep descending the stairs and mara entered among them  she came forward and threw her arms round mrs pennels neck and kissed her and then turning she nestled down in the arms of her old grandfather as she had often done in the old days of childhood and laid her hand upon his shoulder there was no sound for a few moments but one of suppressed weeping but she did not weepshe lay with bright calm eyes as if looking upon some celestial vision  it is not so very sad she said at last in a gentle voice that i should go there you are going too and grandmamma we are all going and we shall be forever with the lord think of it think of it  many were the words spoken in that strange communing and before miss roxy went away a calmness of solemn rest had settled down on all the old family bible was brought forth and zephaniah pennel read from it those strange words of strong consolation which take the sting from death and the victory from the grave  and i heard a great voice out of heaven behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying for the former things are passed away     chapter xxxviii  open vision   as miss roxy was leaving the dwelling of the pennels she met sally kittridge coming toward the house laughing and singing as was her wont she raised her long lean forefinger with a gesture of warning  whats the matter now aunt roxy you look as solemn as a hearse  none o your jokin now miss sally there is such a thing as serious things in this ere world of ourn for all you girls never seems to know it  what is the matter aunt roxyhas anything happenedis anything the matter with mara

you old nurses always talk i hope now you havent been filling maras head with any such notionspeople can be frightened into anything  sally kittridge dont be atalkin of what you dont know nothin about it stands to reason that a body that was bearin the heat and burden of the day long before you was born or thought on in this world should know a thing or two moren you why ive laid you on your stomach and trotted you to trot up the wind many a day and i was pretty experienced then and it aint likely that im agoin to take sace from you mara pennel is a gal as has every bit and grain as much resolution and ambition as you have for all you flap your wings and crow so much louder and shes one of the closemouthed sort that dont make no talk and shes been abearin up and bearin up and comin to

he that singeth songs on a heavy heart the scriptur says  oh miss roxy do tell me truly said sally much moved what do you think is the matter with mara ive noticed myself that she got tired easy and that she was shortbreathedbut she seemed so cheerful can anything really be the matter  its consumption sally kittridge said miss roxy neither more nor less that ar is the long and the short theyre going to take her over to portland to see dr wilsonit wont do no harm and it wont do no good  you seem to be determined she shall die said sally in a tone of pique  determined am i is it i that

middlin goodlookin that you have feelins and i hasnt well youre mistaken thats all i dont believe theres one person in the world that would go farther or do more to save mara pennel than i wouldand yet ive been in the world long enough to see that livin aint no great shakes neither ef one is hopefully prepared in the days of their youth why they escape a good deal ef they get took crosslots into heaven  sally turned away thoughtfully into the house there was no one in the kitchen and the tick of the old clock sounded lonely and sepulchral she went upstairs to maras room the door was ajar mara was sitting at the open window that looked forth toward the ocean busily engaged in writing the glow of evening shone on the golden waves of her hair and tinged the pearly outline of her cheek sally noticed the translucent clearness of her complexion and the deep burning color and the transparency of the little hands which seemed as if they might transmit the light like sèvres porcelain she was writing with an expression of tender calm and sometimes stopping to consult an open letter that sally knew came from moses  so fair and sweet and serene she looked that a painter might have chosen her for an embodiment of twilight and one might not be surprised to see a clear star shining out over her forehead yet in the tender serenity of the face there dwelt a pathos of expression that spoke of struggles and sufferings past like the traces of tears on the face of a restful infant that has grieved itself to sleep  sally came softly in on tiptoe threw her arms around her and kissed her with a half laugh then bursting into tears sobbed upon her shoulder  dear sally what is the matter said mara looking up  oh mara i just met miss roxy and she told me  sally only sobbed passionately  it is very sad to make all ones friends so unhappy said mara in a soothing voice stroking sallys hair you dont know how much i have suffered dreading it sally it is a long time since i began to expect and dread and fear my time of anguish was thenthen when i first felt that it could be possible that i should not live after all there was a long time i dared not even think of it i could not even tell such a fear to myself and i did far more than i felt able to do to convince myself that i was not weak and failing i have been often to miss roxy and once when nobody knew it i went to a doctor in brunswick but then i was afraid to tell him half lest he should say something about me and it should get out and so i went on getting worse and worse and feeling every day as if i could not keep up and yet afraid to lie down for fear grandmamma would suspect me but this morning it was pleasant and bright and something came over me that said i must tell somebody and so as it was cool and pleasant i walked up to aunt roxys and told her i thought you know that she knew the most and would feel it the least but oh sally she has such a feeling heart and loves me so it is strange she should  is it said sally tightening her clasp around maras neck and then with a hysterical shadow of gayety she said i suppose you think that you are such a hobgoblin that nobody could be expected to do that after all though i should have as soon expected roses to bloom in a juniper clump as love from aunt roxy  well she does love me said mara no mother could be kinder poor thing she really sobbed and cried when i told her i was very tired and she told me she would take care of me and tell grandpapa and grandmammathat had been lying on my heart as such a dreadful thing to doand she laid me down to rest on her bed and spoke so lovingly to me i wish you could have seen her and while i lay there i fell into a strange sweet sort of rest i cant describe it but since then everything has been changed i wish i could tell any one how i saw things then  do try to tell me mara said sally for i need comfort too if there is any to be had  well then i lay on the bed and the wind drew in from the sea and just lifted the windowcurtain and i could see the sea shining and hear the waves making a pleasant little dash and then my head seemed to swim i thought i was walking out by the pleasant shore and everything seemed so strangely beautiful and grandpapa and grandmamma were there and moses had come home and you were there and we were all so happy and then i felt a sort of strange sense that something was comingsome great trial or afflictionand i groaned and clung to moses and asked him to put his arm around me and hold me  then it seemed to be not by our seashore that this was happening but by the sea of galilee just as it tells about it in the bible and there were fishermen mending their nets and men sitting counting their money and i saw jesus come walking along and heard him say to this one and that one leave all and follow me and it seemed that the moment he spoke they did it and then he came to me and i felt his eyes in my very soul and he said wilt thou leave all and follow me i cannot tell now what a pain i feltwhat an anguish i wanted to leave all but my heart felt as if it were tied and woven with a thousand threads and while i waited he seemed to fade away and i found myself then alone and unhappy wishing that i could and mourning that i had not and then something shone out warm like the sun and i looked up and he stood there looking pitifully and he said again just as he did before wilt thou leave all and follow me every word was so gentle and full of pity and i looked into his eyes and could not look away they drew me they warmed me and i felt a strange wonderful sense of his greatness and sweetness it seemed as if i felt within me cord after cord breaking i felt so free so happy and i said i will i will with all my heart and i woke then so happy so sure of gods love  i saw so clearly how his love is in everything and these words came into my mind as if an angel had spoken them god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes since then i cannot be unhappy i was so myself only this morning and now i wonder that any one can have a grief when god is so loving and good and cares so sweetly for us all why sally if i could see christ and hear him speak i could not be more certain that he will make this sorrow such a blessing to us all that we shall never be able to thank him enough for it  oh mara said sally sighing deeply while her cheek was wet with tears it is beautiful to hear you talk but there is one that i am sure will not and cannot feel so  god will care for him said mara oh i am sure of it he is love itself and he values his love in us and he never never would have brought such a trial if it had not been the true and only way to our best good we shall not shed one needless tear yes if god loved us so that he spared not his own son he will surely give us all the good here that we possibly can have without risking our eternal happiness  you are writing to moses now said sally  yes i am answering his letter it is so full of spirit and life and hopebut all hope in this worldall all earthly as much as if there was no god and no world to come sally perhaps our father saw that i could not have strength to live with him and keep my faith i should be drawn by him earthward instead of drawing him heavenward and so this is in mercy to us both  and are you telling him the whole truth mara  not all no said mara he could not bear it at once i only tell him that my health is failing and that my friends are seriously alarmed and then i speak as if it were doubtful in my mind what the result might be  i dont think you can make him feel as you do moses pennel has a tremendous will and he never yielded to any one you bend mara like the little blue harebells and so the storm goes over you but he will stand up against it and it will wrench and shatter him i am afraid instead of making him better it will only make him bitter and rebellious  he has a father in heaven who knows how to care for him said mara i am persuadedi feel certain that he will be blessed in the end not perhaps in the time and way i should have chosen but in the end i have always felt that he was mine ever since he came a little shipwrecked boy to mea little girl and now i have given him up to his saviour and my saviourto his god and my godand i am perfectly at peace all will be well  mara spoke with a look of such solemn bright assurance as made her in the dusky golden twilight seem like some serene angel sent down to comfort rather than a hapless mortal just wrenched from life and hope  sally rose up and kissed her silently mara she said i shall come tomorrow to see what i can do for you i will not interrupt you now goodby dear                                       there are no doubt many who have followed this history so long as it danced like a gay little boat over sunny waters and who would have followed it gayly to the end had it closed with ringing of marriagebells who turn from it indignantly when they see that its course runs through the dark valley this they say is an imposition a trick upon our feelings we want to read only stories which end in joy and prosperity  but have we then settled it in our own mind that there is no such thing as a fortunate issue in a history which does not terminate in the way of earthly success and good fortune are we christians or heathen it is now eighteen centuries since as we hold the highly favored among women was pronounced to be one whose earthly hopes were all cut off in the blossomwhose noblest and dearest in the morning of his days went down into the shadows of death  was mary the highlyfavored among women and was jesus indeed the blessedor was the angel mistaken if they were these if we are christians it ought to be a settled and established habit of our souls to regard something else as prosperity than worldly success and happy marriages that life is a success which like the life of jesus in its beginning middle and close has borne a perfect witness to the truth and the highest form of truth it is true that god has given to us and inwoven in our nature a desire for a perfection and completeness made manifest to our senses in this mortal life to see the daughter bloom into youth and womanhood the son into manhood to see them marry and become themselves parents and gradually ripen and develop in the maturities of middle life gradually wear into a sunny autumn and so be gathered in fullness of time to their fatherssuch one says is the programme which god has made us to desire such the ideal of happiness which he has interwoven with our nerves and for which our heart and our flesh crieth out to which every stroke of a knell is a violence and every thought of an early death is an abhorrence  but the life of christ and his mother sets the foot on this lower ideal of happiness and teaches us that there is something higher his ministry began with declaring blessed are they that mourn it has been well said that prosperity was the blessing of the old testament and adversity of the new christ came to show us a nobler style of living and bearing and so far as he had a personal and earthly life he buried it as a cornerstone on which to erect a new immortal style of architecture  of his own he had nothing neither houses nor lands nor family ties nor human hopes nor earthly sphere of success and as a human life it was all a sacrifice and a defeat he was rejected by his countrymen whom the passionate anguish of his love and the unwearied devotion of his life could not save from an awful doom he was betrayed by weak friends prevailed against by slanderers overwhelmed with an ignominious death in the morning of youth and his mother stood by his cross and she was the only woman whom god ever called highly favored in this world  this then is the great and perfect ideal of what god honors christ speaks of himself as bread to be eatenbread simple humble unpretending vitally necessary to human life made by the bruising and grinding of the grain unostentatiously having no life or worth of its own except as it is absorbed into the life of others and lives in them we wished in this history to speak of a class of lives formed on the model of christ and like his obscure and unpretending like his seeming to end in darkness and defeat but which yet have this preciousness and value that the dear saints who live them come nearest in their mission to the mission of jesus they are made not for a career and history of their own but to be bread of life to others in every household or house have been some of these and if we look on their lives and deaths with the unbaptized eyes of nature we shall see only most mournful and unaccountable failure when if we could look with the eye of faith we should see that their living and dying has been bread of life to those they left behind fairest of these and least developed are the holy innocents who come into our households to smile with the smile of angels who sleep in our bosoms and win us with the softness of tender little hands and pass away like the lamb that was slain before they have ever learned the speech of mortals not vain are even these silent lives of christs lambs whom many an earthbound heart has been roused to follow when the shepherd bore them to the higher pastures and so the daughter who died so early whose weddingbells were never rung except in heaventhe son who had no career of ambition or a manly duty except among the angelsthe patient sufferers whose only lot on earth seemed to be to endure whose life bled away drop by drop in the shadows of the sickroomall these are among those whose life was like christs in that they were made not for themselves but to become bread to us  it is expedient for us that they go away like their lord they come to suffer and to die they take part in his sacrifice their life is incomplete without their death and not till they are gone away does the comforter fully come to us  it is a beautiful legend which one sees often represented in the churches of europe that when the grave of the mother of jesus was opened it was found full of blossoming liliesfit emblem of the thousand flowers of holy thought and purpose which spring up in our hearts from the memory of our sainted dead  cannot many who read these lines bethink them of such rooms that have been the most cheerful places in the familywhen the heart of the smitten one seemed the band that bound all the rest togetherand have there not been dying hours which shed such a joy and radiance on all around that it was long before the mourners remembered to mourn is it not a misuse of words to call such a heavenly translation death and to call most things that are lived out on this earth life     chapter xxxix  the land of beulah   it is now about a month after the conversation which we have recorded and during that time the process which was to loose from this present life had been going on in mara with a soft insensible but steady power when she ceased to make efforts beyond her strength and allowed herself that languor and repose which nature claimed all around her soon became aware how her strength was failing and yet a cheerful repose seemed to hallow the atmosphere around her the sight of her every day in family worship sitting by in such tender tranquillity with such a smile on her face seemed like a present inspiration and though the aged pair knew that she was no more for this world yet she was comforting and inspiring to their view as the angel who of old rolled back the stone from the sepulchre and sat upon it they saw in her eyes not death but the solemn victory which christ gives over death  bunyan has no more lovely poem than the image he gives of that land of pleasant waiting which borders the river of death where the chosen of the lord repose while shining messengers constantly passing and repassing bear tidings from the celestial shore opening a way between earth and heaven it was so that through the very thought of mara an influence of tenderness and tranquillity passed through the whole neighborhood keeping hearts fresh with sympathy and causing thought and conversation to rest on those bright mysteries of eternal joy which were reflected on her face  sally kittridge was almost a constant inmate of the brown house ever ready in watching and waiting and one only needed to mark the expression of her face to feel that a holy charm was silently working upon her higher and spiritual nature those great dark sparkling eyes that once seemed to express only the brightness of animal vivacity and glittered like a brook in unsympathetic gayety had in them now mysterious depths and tender fleeting shadows and the very tone of her voice had a subdued tremor the capricious elf the tricksy sprite was melting away in the immortal soul and the deep pathetic power of a noble heart was being born some influence sprung of sorrow is necessary always to perfect beauty in womanly nature we feel its absence in many whose sparkling wit and high spirits give grace and vivacity to life but in whom we vainly seek for some spot of quiet tenderness and sympathetic repose sally was ignorantly to herself changing in the expression of her face and the tone of her character as she ministered in the daily wants which sickness brings in a simple household  for the rest of the neighborhood the shelves and larder of mrs pennel were constantly crowded with the tributes which one or another sent in for the invalid there was jelly of iceland moss sent across by miss emily and brought by mr sewell whose calls were almost daily there were custards and preserves and every form of cake and other confections in which the housekeeping talent of the neighbors delighted and which were sent in under the old superstition that sick people must be kept eating at all hazards  at church sunday after sunday the simple note requested the prayers of the church and congregation for mara lincoln who was as the note phrased it drawing near her end that she and all concerned might be prepared for the great and last change one familiar with new england customs must have remembered with what a plaintive power the reading of such a note from sunday to sunday has drawn the thoughts and sympathies of a congregation to some chamber of sickness and in a village church where every individual is known from childhood to every other the power of this simple custom is still greater  then the prayers of the minister would dwell on the case and thanks would be rendered to god for the great light and peace with which he had deigned to visit his young handmaid and then would follow a prayer that when these sad tidings should reach a distant friend who had gone down to do business on the great waters they might be sanctified to his spiritual and everlasting good then on sunday noons as the people ate their dinners together in a room adjoining the church all that she said and did was talked over and overhow quickly she had gained the victory of submission the peace of a will united with gods mixed with harmless gossip of the sick chamberas to what she ate and how she slept and who had sent her gruel with raisins in it and who jelly with wine and how she had praised this and eaten that twice with a relish but how the other had seemed to disagree with her thereafter would come scraps of nursing information recipes against coughing specifics against short breath speculations about watchers how soon she would need them and long legends of other deathbeds where the fear of death had been slain by the power of an endless life  yet through all the gossip and through much that might have been called at other times commonplace cant of religion there was spread a tender earnestness and the whole air seemed to be enchanted with the fragrance of that fading rose each one spoke more gently more lovingly to each for the thought of her  it was now a bright september morning and the early frosts had changed the maples in the pinewoods to scarlet and touched the white birches with gold when one morning miss roxy presented herself at an early hour at captain kittridges  they were at breakfast and sally was dispensing the tea at the head of the table mrs kittridge having been prevailed on to abdicate in her favor  it is such a fine morning she said looking out at the window which showed a waveless expanse of ocean i do hope mara has had a good night  im agoin to make her some jelly this very forenoon said mrs kittridge aunt roxy was atellin me yesterday that she was agoin down to stay at the house regular for she needed so much done now  its most an amazin thing we dont hear from moses pennel said captain kittridge if he dont make haste he may never see her  theres aunt roxy at this minute said sally  in truth the door opened at this moment and aunt roxy entered with a little blue bandbox and a bundle tied up in a checked handkerchief  oh aunt roxy said mrs kittridge you are on your way are you do sit down right here and get a cup of strong tea  thank you said aunt roxy but ruey gave me a humming cup before i came away  aunt roxy have they heard anything from moses said the captain  no father i know they havent said sally mara has written to him and so has mr sewell but it is very uncertain whether he ever got the letters  its most time to be alookin for him home said the captain i shouldnt be surprised to see him any day  at this moment sally who sat where she could see from the window gave a sudden start and a half scream and rising from the table darted first to the window and then to the door whence she rushed out eagerly  well what now said the captain  i am sure i dont know whats come over her said mrs kittridge rising to look out  why aunt roxy do look i believe to my soul that ars moses pennel  and so it was he met sally as she ran out with a gloomy brow and scarcely a look even of recognition but he seized her hand and wrung it in the stress of his emotion so that she almost screamed with the pain  tell me sally he said tell me the truth i dared not go home without i knew those gossiping lying reports are always exaggerated they are dreadful exaggerationsthey frighten a sick person into the grave but you have good sense and a hopeful cheerful temperyou must see and know how things are mara is not so veryveryhe held sallys hand and looked at her with a burning eagerness say what do you think of her  we all think that we cannot long keep her with us said sally and oh moses i am so glad you have come  its falseit must be false he said violently nothing is more deceptive than these ideas that doctors and nurses pile on when a sensitive person is going down a little i know mara everything depends on the mind with her i shall wake her up out of this dream she is not to die she shall not diei come to save her  oh if you could said sally mournfully  it cannot be it is not to be he said again as if to convince himself no such thing is to be thought of tell me sally have you tried to keep up the cheerful side of things to herhave you  oh you cannot tell moses how it is unless you see her she is cheerful happy the only really joyous one among us  cheerful joyous happy she does not believe then these frightful things i thought she would keep up she is a brave little thing  no moses she does believe she has given up all hope of lifeall wish to live and oh she is so lovelyso sweetso dear  sally covered her face with her hands and sobbed moses stood still looking at her a moment in a confused way and then he answered  come get your bonnet sally and go with me you must go in and tell them tell her that i am come you know  yes i will said sally as she ran quickly back to the house  moses stood listlessly looking after her a moment after she came out of the door again and miss roxy behind sally hurried up to moses  wheres that black old raven going said moses in a low voice looking back on miss roxy who stood on the steps  what aunt roxy said sally why shes going up to nurse mara and take care of her mrs pennel is so old and infirm she needs somebody to depend on  i cant bear her said moses i always think of sickrooms and coffins and a stifling smell of camphor when i see her i never could endure her shes an old harpy going to carry off my dove  now moses you must not talk so she loves mara dearly the poor old soul and mara loves her and there is no earthly thing she would not do for her and she knows what to do for sickness better than you or i i have found out one thing that it isnt mere love and goodwill that is needed in a sickroom it needs knowledge and experience  moses assented in gloomy silence and they walked on together the way that they had so often taken laughing and chatting when they came within sight of the house moses said  here she came running to meet us do you remember  yes said sally  i was never half worthy of her i never said half what i ought to he added she must live i must have one more chance  when they came up to the house zephaniah pennel was sitting in the door with his gray head bent over the leaves of the great family bible  he rose up at their coming and with that suppression of all external signs of feeling for which the new englander is remarkable simply shook the hand of moses saying  well my boy we are glad you have come  mrs pennel who was busied in some domestic work in the back part of the kitchen turned away and hid her face in her apron when she saw him there fell a great silence among them in the midst of which the old clock ticked loudly and importunately like the inevitable approach of fate  i will go up and see her and get her ready said sally in a whisper to moses ill come and call you  moses sat down and looked around on the old familiar scene there was the great fireplace where in their childish days they had sat together winter nightsher fair spiritual face enlivened by the blaze while she knit and looked thoughtfully into the coals there she had played checkers or fox and geese with him or studied with him the latin lessons or sat by grave and thoughtful hemming his toyship sails while he cut the moulds for his anchors or tried experiments on pulleys and in all these years he could not remember one selfish actionone unlovely wordand he thought to himself i hoped to possess this angel as a mortal wife god forgive my presumption     chapter xl  the meeting   sally found mara sitting in an easychair that had been sent to her by the provident love of miss emily it was wheeled in front of her room window from whence she could look out upon the wide expanse of the ocean it was a gloriously bright calm morning and the water lay clear and still with scarce a ripple to the far distant pearly horizon she seemed to be looking at it in a kind of calm ecstasy and murmuring the words of a hymn      nor wreck nor ruin there is seen       there not a wave of trouble rolls     but the bright rainbow round the throne       peals endless peace to all their souls  sally came softly behind her on tiptoe to kiss her goodmorning dear how do you find yourself  quite well was the answer  mara is not there anything you want  there might be many things but his will is mine  you want to see moses  very much but i shall see him as soon as it is best for us both  marahe is come  the quick blood flushed over the pale transparent face as a virgin glacier flushes at sunrise and she looked up eagerly come  yes he is belowstairs wanting to see you  she seemed about to speak eagerly and then checked herself and mused a moment poor poor boy she said yes sally let him come at once  there were a few dazzling dreamy minutes when moses first held that frail form in his arms which but for its tender mortal warmth might have seemed to him a spirit it was no spirit but a woman whose heart he could feel thrilling against his own who seemed to him like some frail fluttering bird but somehow as he looked into her clear transparent face and pressed her thin little hands in his the conviction stole over him overpoweringly that she was indeed fading away and going from himdrawn from him by that mysterious irresistible power against which human strength even in the strongest has no chance  it is dreadful to a strong man who has felt the influence of his strengthwho has always been ready with a resource for every emergency and a weapon for every battlewhen first he meets that mighty invisible power by which a beloved lifea life he would give his own blood to savemelts and dissolves like smoke before his eyes  oh mara mara he groaned this is too dreadful too cruel it is cruel  you will think so at first but not always she said soothingly you will live to see a joy come out of this sorrow  never mara never i cannot believe that kind of talk i see no love no mercy in it of course if there is any life after death you will be happy if there is a heaven you will be there but can this dim unsubstantial cloudy prospect make you happy in leaving me and giving up ones lover oh mara you cannot love as i do or you could not  moses i have sufferedoh very very much it was many months ago when i first thought that i must give everything upwhen i thought that we must part but christ helped me he showed me his wonderful lovethe love that surrounds us all our life that follows us in all our wanderings and sustains us in all our weaknessesand then i felt that whatever he wills for us is in love oh believe itbelieve it for my sake for your own  oh i cannot i cannot said moses but as he looked at the bright pale face and felt how the tempest of his feelings shook the frail form he checked himself i do wrong to agitate you so mara i will try to be calm  and to pray she said beseechingly  he shut his lips in gloomy silence  promise me she said  i have prayed ever since i got your first letter and i see it does no good he answered our prayers cannot alter fate  fate there is no fate she answered there is a strong and loving father who guides the way though we know it not we cannot resist his will but it is all lovepure pure love  at this moment sally came softly into the room a gentle air of womanly authority seemed to express itself in that once gay and giddy face at which moses in the midst of his misery marveled  you must not stay any longer now she said it would be too much for her strength this is enough for this morning  moses turned away and silently left the room and sally said to mara  you must lie down now and rest  sally said mara promise me one thing  well mara of course i will  promise to love him and care for him when i am gone he will be so lonely  i will do all i can mara said sally soothingly so now you must take a little wine and lie down you know what you have so often said that all will yet be well with him  oh i know it i am sure said mara but oh his sorrow shook my very heart  you must not talk another word about it said sally peremptorily do you know aunt roxy is coming to see you i see her out of the window this very moment  and sally assisted to lay her friend on the bed and then administering a stimulant she drew down the curtains and sitting beside her began repeating in a soft monotonous tone the words of a favorite hymn      the lord my shepherd is       i shall be well supplied     since he is mine and i am his       what can i want beside  before she had finished mara was asleep     chapter xli  consolation   moses came down from the chamber of mara in a tempest of contending emotions he had all that constitutional horror of death and the spiritual world which is an attribute of some particularly strong and wellendowed physical natures and he had all that instinctive resistance of the will which such natures offer to anything which strikes athwart their cherished hopes and plans to be wrenched suddenly from the sphere of an earthly life and made to confront the unclosed doors of a spiritual world on the behalf of the one dearest to him was to him a dreary horror uncheered by one filial belief in god he felt furthermore that blind animal irritation which assails one under a sudden blow whether of the body or of the soulan anguish of resistance a vague blind anger  mr sewell was sitting in the kitchenhe had called to see mara and waited for the close of the interview above he rose and offered his hand to moses who took it in gloomy silence without a smile or word  my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord said mr sewell  i cannot bear that sort of thing said moses abruptly and almost fiercely i beg your pardon sir but it irritates me  do you not believe that afflictions are sent for our improvement said mr sewell  no how can i what improvement will there be to me in taking from me the angel who guided me to all good and kept me from all evil the one pure motive and holy influence of my life if you call this the chastening of a loving father i must say it looks more to me like the caprice of an evil spirit  had you ever thanked the god of your life for this gift or felt your dependence on him to keep it have you not blindly idolized the creature and forgotten him who gave it said mr sewell  moses was silent a moment  i cannot believe there is a god he said since this fear came on me i have prayedyes and humbled myself for i know i have not always been what i ought i promised if he would grant me this one thing i would seek him in future but it did no goodits of no use to pray i would have been good in this way if she might be spared and i cannot in any other  my son our lord and master will have no such conditions from us said mr sewell we must submit unconditionally she has done it and her peace is as firm as the everlasting hills gods will is a great current that flows in spite of us if we go with it it carries us to endless restif we resist we only wear our lives out in useless struggles  moses stood a moment in silence and then turning away without a word hurried from the house he strode along the high rocky bluff through tangled junipers and pine thickets till he came above the rocky cove which had been his favorite retreat on so many occasions he swung himself down over the cliffs into the grotto where shut in by the high tide he felt himself alone there he had read mr sewells letter and dreamed vain dreams of wealth and worldly success now all to him so void he felt today as he sat there and watched the ships go by how utterly nothing all the wealth in the world was in the loss of that one heart unconsciously even to himself sorrow was doing her ennobling ministry within him melting off in her fierce fires trivial ambitions and low desires and making him feel the sole worth and value of love that which in other days had seemed only as one good thing among many now seemed the only thing in life and he who has learned the paramount value of love has taken one step from an earthly to a spiritual existence  but as he lay there on the pebbly shore hour after hour glided by his whole past life lived itself over to his eye he saw a thousand actions he heard a thousand words whose beauty and significance never came to him till now and alas he saw so many when on his part the responsive word that should have been spoken and the deed that should have been done was forever wanting he had all his life carried within him a vague consciousness that he had not been to mara what he should have been but he had hoped to make amends for all in that future which lay before himthat future now alas dissolving and fading away like the white cloudislands which the wind was drifting from the sky a voice seemed saying in his ears ye know that when he would have inherited a blessing he was rejected for he found no place for repentance though he sought it carefully with tears something that he had never felt before struck him as appalling in the awful fixedness of all past deeds and wordsthe unkind words once said which no tears could unsaythe kind ones suppressed to which no agony of wishfulness could give a past reality there were particular times in their past history that he remembered so vividly when he saw her so clearlydoing some little thing for him and shyly watching for the word of acknowledgment which he did not give some willful wayward demon withheld him at the moment and the light on the little wishful face slowly faded true all had been a thousand times forgiven and forgotten between them but it is the ministry of these great vital hours of sorrow to teach us that nothing in the souls history ever dies or is forgotten and when the beloved one lies stricken and ready to pass away comes the judgmentday of love and all the dead moments of the past arise and live again  he lay there musing and dreaming till the sun grew low in the afternoon sky and the tide that isolated the little grotto had gone far out into the ocean leaving long low reefs of sunken rocks all matted and tangled with the yellow hair of the seaweed with little crystal pools of salt water between he heard the sound of approaching footsteps and captain kittridge came slowly picking his way round among the shingle and pebbles  wal now i thought id find ye here he said i kind o thought i wanted to see yeye see  moses looked up half moody half astonished while the captain seated himself upon a fragment of rock and began brushing the knees of his trousers industriously until soon the tears rained down from his eyes upon his dry withered hands  wal now ye see i cant help it darned if i can knowed her ever since shes that high shes done me good she has mis kittridge has been pretty faithful ive had folks here and there talk to me considable but lord bless you i never had nothin go to my heart like this erewhy to look on her there couldnt nobody doubt but what there

know we must be a little sort o manly ye know cause her bodys weak if her heart is strong  now moses was in a mood of dry proud fierce selfconsuming sorrow least likely to open his heart or seek sympathy from any one and no friend or acquaintance would probably have dared to intrude on his grief but there are moods of the mind which cannot be touched or handled by one on an equal level with us that yield at once to the sympathy of something below a dog who comes with his great honest sorrowful face and lays his mute paw of inquiry on your knee will sometimes open floodgates of sober feeling that have remained closed to every human touchthe dumb simplicity and ignorance of his sympathy makes it irresistible in like manner the downright grief of the goodnatured old captain and the childlike ignorance with which he ventured upon a ministry of consolation from which a more cultivated person would have shrunk away were irresistibly touching moses grasped the dry withered hand and said thank you thank you captain kittridge youre a true friend  wal i be thats a fact moses lord bless me i aint no greati aint nobodyim jest an old lastyears mulleinstalk in the lords vineyard but that ere blessed little thing allers had a good word for me she gave me a hymnbook and marked some hymns in it and read em to me herself and her voice was jest as sweet as the sea of a warm evening them hymns come to me kind o powerful when im at my work planin and sawin mis kittridge she allers talks to me as ef i was a terrible sinner and i suppose i be but this ere blessed child shes so kind o good and innocent she thinks im good kind o takes it for granted im one o the lords people ye know it kind o makes me want to be ye know  the captain here produced from his coatpocket a much worn hymnbook and showed moses where leaves were folded down now heres this ere he said you get her to say it to you he added pointing to the wellknown sacred idly which has refreshed so many hearts      there is a land of pure delight       where saints immortal reign     eternal day excludes the night       and pleasures banish pain      there everlasting spring abides       and neverfading flowers     death like a narrow sea divides       this happy land from ours  now that ar beats everything said the captain and we must kind o think of it for her cause shes goin to see all that and ef its our loss its her gain ye know  i know said moses our grief is selfish  jest so wal were selfish critters we be said the captain but arter all t aint as ef we was heathen and didnt know where they was agoin to we jest ought to be alookin about and tryin to foller em ye know  yes yes i do know said moses its easy to say but hard to do  but law man she prays for you she did years and years ago when you was a boy and she a girl you know it tells in the revelations how the angels has golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints i tell ye moses you ought to get into heaven if no one else does i expect you are pretty well known among the angels by this time i tell ye what tis moses fellers think it a mighty pretty thing to be asteppin high and asayin they dont believe the bible and all that ar so long as the world goes well this ere old biblewhy its jest like yer motherye rove and ramble and cut up round the world without her a spell and mebbe think the old woman aint so fashionable as some but when sickness and sorrow comes why there aint nothin else to go back to is there now  moses did not answer but he shook the hand of the captain and turned away     chapter xlii  last words   the setting sun gleamed in at the window of maras chamber tinted with rose and violet hues from a great cloudcastle that lay upon the smooth ocean over against the window mara was lying upon the bed but she raised herself upon her elbow to look out  dear aunt roxy she said raise me up and put the pillows behind me so that i can see outit is splendid  aunt roxy came and arranged the pillows and lifted the girl with her long strong arms then stooping over her a moment she finished her arrangements by softly smoothing the hair from her forehead with a caressing movement most unlike her usual precise businesslike proceedings  i love you aunt roxy said mara looking up with a smile  aunt roxy made a strange wry face which caused her to look harder than usual she was choked with tenderness and had only this uncomely way of showing it  law now mara i dont see how ye can i aint nothin but an old burdockbush love aint for me  yes it is too said mara drawing her down and kissing her withered cheek and you shant call yourself an old burdock god sees that you are beautiful and in the resurrection everybody will see it  i was always homely as an owl said miss roxy unconsciously speaking out what had lain like a stone at the bottom of even her sensible heart i always had sense to know it and knew my sphere homely folks would like to say pretty things and to have pretty things said to them but they never do i made up my mind pretty early that my part in the vineyard was to have hard work and no posies  well you will have all the more in heaven i love you dearly and i like your looks too you look kind and true and good and thats beauty in the country where we are going  miss roxy sprang up quickly from the bed and turning her back began to arrange the bottles on the table with great zeal  has moses come in yet said mara  no there aint nobody seen a thing of him since he went out this morning  poor boy said mara it is too hard upon him aunt roxy please pick some roses off the bush from under the window and put in the vases lets have the room as sweet and cheerful as we can i hope god will let me live long enough to comfort him it is not so very terrible if one would only think so to cross that river all looks so bright to me now that i have forgotten how sorrow seemed poor moses he will have a hard struggle but he will get the victory too i am very weak tonight but tomorrow i shall feel better and i shall sit up and perhaps i can paint a little on that flower i was doing for him we will not have things look sickly or deathly there aunt roxy he has come in i hear his step  i didnt hear it said miss roxy surprised at the acute senses which sickness had etherealized to an almost spiritlike intensity shall i call him  yes do said mara he can sit with me a little while tonight  the light in the room was a strange dusky mingling of gold and gloom when moses stole softly in the great cloudcastle that a little while since had glowed like living gold from turret and battlement now dim changed for the most part to a sombre gray enlivened with a dull glow of crimson but there was still a golden light where the sun had sunk into the sea moses saw the little thin hand stretched out to him  sit down she said it has been such a beautiful sunset did you notice it  he sat down by the bed leaning his forehead on his hand but saying nothing  she drew her fingers through his dark hair i am so glad to see you she said it is such a comfort to me that you have come and i hope it will be to you you know i shall be better tomorrow than i am tonight and i hope we shall have some pleasant days together yet we mustnt reject what little we may have because it cannot be more  oh mara said moses i would give my life if i could take back the past i have never been worthy of you never knew your worth never made you happy you always lived for me and i lived for myself i deserve to lose you but it is none the less bitter  dont say lose why must you i cannot think of losing you i know i shall not god has given you to me you will come to me and be mine at last i feel sure of it  you dont know me said moses  christ does though she said and he has promised to care for you yes you will live to see many flowers grow out of my grave you cannot think so now but it will be sobelieve me  mara said moses i never lived through such a day as this it seems as if every moment of my life had been passing before me and every moment of yours i have seen how true and loving in thought and word and deed you have been and i have been doing nothing but take you have given love as the skies give rain and i have drunk it up like the hot dusty earth  mara knew in her own heart that this was all true and she was too real to use any of the terms of affected humiliation which many think a kind of spiritual court language she looked at him and answered moses i always knew i loved most it was my nature god gave it to me and it was a gift for which i give him thanksnot a merit i knew you had a larger wider nature than minea wider sphere to live in and that you could not live in your heart as i did mine was all thought and feeling and the narrow little duties of this little home yours went all round the world  but oh maraoh my angel to think i should lose you when i am just beginning to know your worth i always had a sort of superstitious feelinga sacred presentiment about youthat my spiritual life if ever i had any would come through you it seemed if there ever was such a thing as gods providence which some folks believe in it was in leading me to you and giving you to me and now to have all lashedall destroyedit makes me feel as if all was blind chance no guiding god for if he wanted me to be good he would spare you  mara lay with her large eyes fixed on the now faded sky the dusky shadows had dropped like a black crape veil around her pale face in a few moments she repeated to herself as if she were musing upon them those mysterious words of him who liveth and was dead except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone if it die it bringeth forth much fruit  moses she said for all i know you have loved me dearly yet i have felt that in all that was deepest and dearest to me i was alone you did not come near to me nor touch me where i feel most deeply if i had lived to be your wife i cannot say but this distance in our spiritual nature might have widened you know what we live with we get used to it grows an old story your love to me might have grown old and worn out if we lived together in the commonplace toils of life you would see only a poor threadbare wife i might have lost what little charm i ever had for you but i feel that if i die this will not be there is something sacred and beautiful in death and i may have more power over you when i seem to be gone than i should have had living  oh mara mara dont say that  dear moses it is so think how many lovers marry and how few lovers are left in middle life and how few love and reverence living friends as they do the dead there are only a very few to whom it is given to do that  something in the heart of moses told him that this was true in this one daythe sacred revealing light of approaching deathhe had seen more of the real spiritual beauty and significance of maras life than in years before and felt upspringing in his heart from the deep pathetic influence of the approaching spiritual world a new and stronger power of loving it may be that it is not merely a perception of love that we were not aware of before that wakes up when we approach the solemn shadows with a friend it may be that the soul has compressed and unconscious powers which are stirred and wrought upon as it looks over the borders into its future homeits loves and its longings so swell and beat that they astonish itself we are greater than we know and dimly feel it with every approach to the great hereafter it doth not yet appear what we shall be                                       now ill tell you what tis said aunt roxy opening the door all the strength this ere girl spends atalkin tonight will be so much taken out o the whole cloth tomorrow  moses started up i ought to have thought of that mara  ye see said miss roxy shes been through a good deal today and she must be got to sleep at some rate or other tonight lord if he sleep he shall do well the bible says and its one of my best nussin maxims  and a good one too aunt roxy said mara goodnight dear boy you see we must all mind aunt roxy  moses bent down and kissed her and felt her arms around his neck  let not your heart be troubled she whispered in spite of himself moses felt the storm that had risen in his bosom that morning soothed by the gentle influences which mara breathed upon it there is a sympathetic power in all states of mind and they who have reached the deep secret of eternal rest have a strange power of imparting calm to others  it was in the very crisis of the battle that christ said to his disciples my peace i give unto you and they that are made one with him acquire like precious power of shedding round them repose as evening flowers shed odors moses went to his pillow sorrowful and heartstricken but bitter or despairing he could not be with the consciousness of that present angel in the house     chapter xliii  the pearl   the next morning rose calm and bright with that wonderful and mystical stillness and serenity which glorify autumn days it was impossible that such skies could smile and such gentle airs blow the sea into one great waving floor of sparkling sapphires without bringing cheerfulness to human hearts you must be very despairing indeed when nature is doing her best to look her in the face sullen and defiant so long as there is a drop of good in your cup a penny in your exchequer of happiness a bright day reminds you to look at it and feel that all is not gone yet  so felt moses when he stood in the door of the brown house while mrs pennel was clinking plates and spoons as she set the breakfasttable and zephaniah pennel in his shirtsleeves was washing in the backroom while miss roxy came downstairs in a businesslike fashion bringing sundry bowls plates dishes and mysterious pitchers from the sickroom  well aunt roxy you aint one that lets the grass grow under your feet said mrs pennel how is the dear child this morning  well she had a better night than one could have expected said miss roxy and by the time shes had her breakfast she expects to sit up a little and see her friends miss roxy said this in a cheerful tone looking encouragingly at moses whom she began to pity and patronize now she saw how real was his affliction  after breakfast moses went to see her she was sitting up in her white dressinggown looking so thin and poorly and everything in the room was fragrant with the spicy smell of the monthly roses whose late buds and blossoms miss roxy had gathered for the vases she seemed so natural so calm and cheerful so interested in all that went on around her that one almost forgot that the time of her stay must be so short she called moses to come and look at her drawings and paintings of flowers and birdsfull of reminders they were of old timesand then she would have her pencils and colors and work a little on a bunch of red rockcolumbine that she had begun to do for him and she chatted of all the old familiar places where flowers grew and of the old talks they had had there till moses quite forgot himself forgot that he was in a sick room till aunt roxy warned by the deepening color on maras cheeks interposed her nussing authority that she must do no more that day  then moses laid her down and arranged her pillows so that she could look out on the sea and sat and read to her till it was time for her afternoon nap and when the evening shadows drew on he marveled with himself how the day had gone  many such there were all that pleasant month of september and he was with her all the time watching her wants and doing her biddingreading over and over with a softened modulation her favorite hymns and chapters arranging her flowers and bringing her home wild bouquets from all her favorite woodhaunts which made her sickroom seem like some sylvan bower sally kittridge was there too almost every day with always some friendly offering or some helpful deed of kindness and sometimes they two together would keep guard over the invalid while miss roxy went home to attend to some of her own more peculiar concerns mara seemed to rule all around her with calm sweetness and wisdom speaking unconsciously only the speech of heaven talking of spiritual things not in an excited rapture or wild ecstasy but with the sober certainty of waking bliss she seemed like one of the sweet friendly angels one reads of in the old testament so lovingly companionable walking and talking eating and drinking with mortals yet ready at any unknown moment to ascend with the flame of some sacrifice and be gone there are those a few at least whose blessing it has been to have kept for many days in bonds of earthly fellowship a perfected spirit in whom the work of purifying love was wholly done who lived in calm victory over sin and sorrow and death ready at any moment to be called to the final mystery of joy  yet it must come at last the moment when heaven claims its own and it came at last in the cottage on orrs island there came a day when the room so sacredly cheerful was hushed to a breathless stillness the bed was then all snowy white and that soft still sealed face the parted waves of golden hair the little hands folded over the white robe all had a sacred and wonderful calm a rapture of repose that seemed to say it is done  they who looked on her wondered it was a look that sunk deep into every heart it hushed down the common cant of those who according to country custom went to stare blindly at the great mystery of deathfor all that came out of that chamber smote upon their breasts and went away in silence revolving strangely whence might come that unearthly beauty that celestial joy  once more in that very room where james and naomi lincoln had lain side by side in their coffins sleeping restfully there was laid another form shrouded and coffined but with such a fairness and tender purity such a mysterious fullness of joy in its expression that it seemed more natural to speak of that rest as some higher form of life than of death  once more were gathered the neighborhood all the faces known in this history shone out in one solemn picture of which that sweet restful form was the centre zephaniah pennel and mary his wife moses and sally the dry form of captain kittridge and the solemn face of his wife aunt roxy and aunt ruey miss emily and mr sewell but their faces all wore a tender brightness such as we see falling like a thin celestial veil over all the faces in an old florentine painting the room was full of sweet memories of words of cheer words of assurance words of triumph and the mysterious brightness of that young face forbade them to weep solemnly mr sewell read  he will swallow up death in victory and the lord god will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth for the lord hath spoken it and it shall be said in that day lo this is our god we have waited for him and he will save us this is the lord we have waited for him we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation  then the prayer trembled up to heaven with thanksgiving for the early entrance of that fair young saint into glory and then the same old funeral hymn with its mournful triumph      why should we mourn departed friends       or shake at deaths alarms     tis but the voice that jesus sends       to call them to his arms  then in a few words mr sewell reminded them how that hymn had been sung in this room so many years ago when that frail fluttering orphan soul had been baptized into the love and care of jesus and how her whole life passing before them in its simplicity and beauty had come to so holy and beautiful a close and when pointing to the calm sleeping face he asked would we call her back there was not a heart at that moment that dared answer yes even he that should have been her bridegroom could not at that moment have unsealed the holy charm and so they bore her away and laid the calm smiling face beneath the soil by the side of poor dolores                                       i had a beautiful dream last night said zephaniah pennel the next morning after the funeral as he opened his bible to conduct family worship  what was it said miss roxy  well ye see i thought i was out awalkin up and down and lookin and lookin for something that id lost what it was i couldnt quite make out but my heart felt heavy as if it would break and i was lookin all up and down the sands by the seashore and somebody said i was like the merchantman seeking goodly pearls i said i had lost my pearlmy pearl of great priceand then i looked up and far off on the beach shining softly on the wet sands lay my pearl i thought it was mara but it seemed a great pearl with a soft moonlight on it and i was running for it when some one said hush and i looked and i saw him acomingjesus of nazareth jist as he walked by the sea of galilee it was all dark night around him but i could see him by the light that came from his face and the long hair was hanging down on his shoulders he came and took up my pearl and put it on his forehead and it shone out like a star and shone into my heart and i felt happy and he looked at me steadily and rose and rose in the air and melted in the clouds and i awoke so happy and so calm     chapter xliv  four years after   it was a splendid evening in july and the sky was filled high with gorgeous tabernacles of purple and gold the remains of a grand thundershower which had freshened the air and set a separate jewel on every needle leaf of the old pines  four years had passed since the fair pearl of orrs island had been laid beneath the gentle soil which every year sent monthly tributes of flowers to adorn her rest great blue violets and starry flocks of ethereal eyebrights in spring and fringy asters and goldenrod in autumn in those days the tender sentiment which now makes the burialplace a cultivated garden was excluded by the rigid spiritualism of the puritan life which ever jealous of that which concerned the body lest it should claim what belonged to the immortal alone had frowned on all watching of graves as an earthward tendency and enjoined the flight of faith with the spirit rather than the yearning for its castoff garments  but sally kittridge being lonely found something in her heart which could only be comforted by visits to that grave so she had planted there roses and trailing myrtle and tended and watered them a proceeding which was much commented on sunday noons when people were eating their dinners and discussing their neighbors  it is possible good mrs kittridge might have been much scandalized by it had she been in a condition to think on the matter at all but a very short time after the funeral she was seized with a paralytic shock which left her for a while as helpless as an infant and then she sank away into the grave leaving sally the sole care of the old captain  a cheerful home she made too for his old age adorning the house with many little tasteful fancies unknown in her mothers days reading the bible to him and singing maras favorite hymns with a voice as sweet as the spring bluebird the spirit of the departed friend seemed to hallow the dwelling where these two worshiped her memory in simplehearted love her paintings framed in quaint woodland frames of moss and pinecones by sallys own ingenuity adorned the walls her books were on the table and among them many that she had given to moses  i am going to be a wanderer for many years he said in parting keep these for me until i come back  and so from time to time passed long letters between the two friendseach telling to the other the same storythat they were lonely and that their hearts yearned for the communion of one who could no longer be manifest to the senses and each spoke to the other of a world of hopes and memories buried with her which each so constantly said no one could understand but you each too was firm in the faith that buried love must have no earthly resurrection every letter strenuously insisted that they should call each other brother and sister and under cover of those names the letters grew longer and more frequent and with every chance opportunity came presents from the absent brother which made the little old cottage quaintly suggestive with smell of spice and sandalwood  but as we said this is a glorious july eveningand you may discern two figures picking their way over those low sunken rocks yellowed with seaweed of which we have often spoken they are moses and sally going on an evening walk to that favorite grotto retreat which has so often been spoken of in the course of this history  moses has come home from long wanderings it is four years since they parted and now they meet and have looked into each others eyes not as of old when they met in the first giddy flush of youth but as fully developed man and woman moses and sally had just risen from the teatable where she had presided with a thoughtful housewifery gravity just pleasantly dashed with quaint streaks of her old merry willfulness while the old captain warmed up like a rheumatic grasshopper in a fine autumn day chirruped feebly and told some of his old stories which now he told every day forgetting that they had ever been heard before somehow all three had been very happy the more so from a shadowy sense of some sympathizing presence which was rejoicing to see them together again and which stealing softfooted and noiseless everywhere touched and lighted up every old familiar object with sweet memories  and so they had gone out together to walk to walk towards the grotto where sally had caused a seat to be made and where she declared she had passed hours and hours knitting sewing or reading  sally said moses do you know i am tired of wandering i am coming home now i begin to want a home of my own this he said as they sat together on the rustic seat and looked off on the blue sea  yes you must said sally how lovely that ship looks just coming in there  yes they are beautiful said moses abstractedly and sally rattled on about the difference between sloops and brigs seeming determined that there should be no silence such as often comes in ominous gaps between two friends who have long been separated and have each many things to say with which the other is not familiar  sally said moses breaking in with a deep voice on one of these monologues do you remember some presumptuous things i once said to you in this place  sally did not answer and there was a dead silence in which they could hear the tide gently dashing on the weedy rocks  you and i are neither of us what we were then sally said moses we are as different as if we were each another person we have been trained in another lifeeducated by a great sorrowis it not so  i know it said sally  and why should we two who have a world of thoughts and memories which no one can understand but the otherwhy should we each of us go on alone if we must why then sally i must leave you and i must write and receive no more letters for i have found that you are becoming so wholly necessary to me that if any other should claim you i could not feel as i ought must i go  sallys answer is not on record but one infers what it was from the fact that they sat there very late and before they knew it the tide rose up and shut them in and the moon rose up in full glory out of the water and still they sat and talked leaning on each other till a cracked feeble voice called down through the pinetrees above like a hoarse old cricket  children be you there  yes father said sally blushing and conscious  yes all right said the deep bass of moses ill bring her back when ive done with her captain  walwal i was gettin consarned but i see i dont need to i hope you wont get no colds nor nothin  they did not but in the course of a month there was a wedding at the brown house of the old captain which everybody in the parish was glad of and was voted without dissent to be just the thing  miss roxy grimly approbative presided over the preparations and all the characters of our story appeared and more having on their weddinggarments nor was the wedding less joyful that all felt the presence of a heavenly guest silent and loving seeing and blessing all whose voice seemed to say in every heart  he turneth the shadow of death into morning
