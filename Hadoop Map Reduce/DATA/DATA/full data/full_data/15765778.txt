15765778	snowbound at eagles  by bret harte     snowbound at eagles     chapter i   for some moments profound silence and darkness had accompanied a sierran stagecoach towards the summit the huge dim bulk of the vehicle swaying noiselessly on its straps glided onward and upward as if obeying some mysterious impulse from behind so faint and indefinite appeared its relation to the viewless and silent horses ahead the shadowy trunks of tall trees that seemed to approach the coach windows look in and then move hurriedly away were the only distinguishable objects yet even these were so vague and unreal that they might have been the mere phantoms of some dream of the halfsleeping passengers for the thicklystrewn needles of the pine that choked the way and deadened all sound yielded under the silentlycrushing wheels a faint soporific odor that seemed to benumb their senses already slipping back into unconsciousness during the long ascent suddenly the stage stopped  three of the four passengers inside struggled at once into upright wakefulness the fourth passenger john hale had not been sleeping and turned impatiently towards the window it seemed to him that two of the moving trees had suddenly become motionless outside one of them moved again and the door opened quickly but quietly as of itself  git down said a voice in the darkness  all the passengers except hale started the man next to him moved his right hand suddenly behind him but as quickly stopped one of the motionless trees had apparently closed upon the vehicle and what had seemed to be a bough projecting from it at right angles changed slowly into the faintly shining doublebarrels of a gun at the window  drop that said the voice  the man who had moved uttered a short laugh and returned his hand empty to his knees the two others perceptibly shrugged their shoulders as over a game that was lost the remaining passenger john hale fearless by nature inexperienced by habit awaking suddenly to the truth conceived desperate resistance but without his making a gesture this was instinctively felt by the others the muzzle of the gun turned spontaneously on him and he was vaguely conscious of a certain contempt and impatience of him in his companions  git down repeated the voice imperatively  the three passengers descended hale furious alert but helpless of any opportunity followed he was surprised to find the stagedriver and express messenger standing beside him he had not heard them dismount he instinctively looked towards the horses he could see nothing  hold up your hands  one of the passengers had already lifted his in a weary perfunctory way the others did the same reluctantly and awkwardly but apparently more from the consciousness of the ludicrousness of their attitude than from any sense of danger the rays of a bullseye lantern deftly managed by invisible hands while it left the intruders in shadow completely illuminated the faces and figures of the passengers in spite of the majestic obscurity and silence of surrounding nature the group of humanity thus illuminated was more farcical than dramatic a scrap of newspaper part of a sandwich and an orange peel that had fallen from the floor of the coach brought into equal prominence by the searching light completed the absurdity  theres a man here with a package of greenbacks said the voice with an official coolness that lent a certain suggestion of custom house inspection to the transaction who is it the passengers looked at each other and their glance finally settled on hale  its not him continued the voice with a slight tinge of contempt on the emphasis youll save time and searching gentlemen if youll tote it out if weve got to go through every one of you well try to make it pay  the significant threat was not unheeded the passenger who had first moved when the stage stopped put his hand to his breast  tother pocket first if you please said the voice  the man laughed drew a pistol from his hip pocket and under the strong light of the lantern laid it on a spot in the road indicated by the voice a thick envelope taken from his breast pocket was laid beside it i told the dd fools that gave it to me instead of sending it by express it would be at their own risk he said apologetically  as its going with the express now its all the same said the inevitable humorist of the occasion pointing to the despoiled express treasurebox already in the road  the intention and deliberation of the outrage was plain enough to hales inexperience now yet he could not understand the cool acquiescence of his fellowpassengers and was furious his reflections were interrupted by a voice which seemed to come from a greater distance he fancied it was even softer in tone as if a certain austerity was relaxed  step in as quick as you like gentlemen youve five minutes to wait bill  the passengers reentered the coach the driver and express messenger hurriedly climbed to their places hale would have spoken but an impatient gesture from his companions stopped him they were evidently listening for something he listened too  yet the silence remained unbroken it seemed incredible that there should be no indication near or far of that forceful presence which a moment ago had been so dominant no rustle in the wayside brush nor echo from the rocky canyon below betrayed a sound of their flight a faint breeze stirred the tall tips of the pines a cone dropped on the stage roof one of the invisible horses that seemed to be listening too moved slightly in his harness but this only appeared to accentuate the profound stillness the moments were growing interminable when the voice so near as to startle hale broke once more from the surrounding obscurity  goodnight  it was the signal that they were free the drivers whip cracked like a pistol shot the horses sprang furiously forward the huge vehicle lurched ahead and then bounded violently after them when hale could make his voice heard in the confusiona confusion which seemed greater from the colorless intensity of their last few moments experiencehe said hurriedly then that fellow was there all the time  i reckon returned his companion he stopped five minutes to cover the driver with his doublebarrel until the two other men got off with the treasure  the two others gasped hale then there were only three men and we six  the man shrugged his shoulders the passenger who had given up the greenbacks drawled with a slow irritating tolerance i reckon youre a stranger here  i amto this sort of thing certainly though i live a dozen miles from here at eagles court returned hale scornfully  then youre the chap thats doin that fancy ranchin over at eagles continued the man lazily  whatever im doing at eagles court im not ashamed of it said hale tartly and thats more than i can say of what ive doneor havent donetonight ive been one of six men overawed and robbed by three  as to the overawin ez you call itmebbee you know more about it than us as to the robbinez far as i kin remember you havent onloaded much ef youre talkin about what oughter have been done ill tell you what could have happened praps ye noticed that when he pulled up i made a kind of grab for my wepping behind me  i did and you wernt quick enough said hale shortly  i wasnt quick enough and that saved you for ef i got that pistol out and in sight o that man that held the gun  well said hale impatiently hed have hesitated  hed hev blown you with both barrels outer the window and that before id got a halfcock on my revolver  but that would have been only one man gone and there would have been five of you left said hale haughtily  that might have been ef youd contracted to take the hull charge of two handfuls of buckshot and slugs but ez one eighth o that amount would have done your business and yet left enough to have gone round promiskiss and satisfied the other passengers it wouldnt do to kalkilate upon  but the express messenger and the driver were armed continued hale  they were armed but not fixed that makes all the difference  i dont understand  i reckon you know what a duel is  yes  well the chances agin us was about the same as youd have ef you was put up agin another chap who was allowed to draw a bead on you and the signal to fire was your drawin your weapon you may be a stranger to this sort o thing and praps you never fought a duel but even then you wouldnt go foolin your life away on any such chances  something in the mans manner as in a certain sly amusement the other passengers appeared to extract from the conversation impressed hale already beginning to be conscious of the ludicrous insufficiency of his own grievance beside that of his interlocutor  then you mean to say this thing is inevitable said he bitterly but less aggressively  ez long ez they hunt you when you hunt them youve got the advantage allus provided you know how to get at them ez well as they know how to get at you this yer coach is bound to go regular and on certain days they aint by the time the sheriff gets out his posse theyve skedaddled and the leader like as not is takin his quiet cocktail at the bank exchange or mebbe losin his earnings to the sheriff over draw poker in sacramento you see you cant prove anything agin them unless you take them on the fly it may be a part of joaquim muriettas band though i wouldnt swear to it  the leader might have been gentleman george from upcountry interposed a passenger he seemed to throw in a few fancy touches particlerly in that good night sorter chucked a little sentiment in it didnt seem to be the same thing ez git yer dd suckers on the other line  whoever he was he knew the road and the men who travelled on it like ez not he went over the line beside the driver on the box on the down trip and took stock of everything he even knew i had those greenbacks though they were handed to me in the bank at sacramento he must have been hanging round there  for some moments hale remained silent he was a civicbred man with an intense love of law and order the kind of man who is the first to take that law and order into his own hands when he does not find it existing to please him he had a bostonians respect for respectability tradition and propriety but was willing to face irregularity and impropriety to create order elsewhere he was fond of nature with these limitations never quite trusting her unguided instincts and finding her as an instructress greatly inferior to harvard university though possibly not to cornell with dauntless enterprise and energy he had built and stocked a charming cottage farm in a nook in the sierras whence he opposed like the lesser englishman that he was his own tastes to those of the alien west in the present instance he felt it incumbent upon him not only to assert his principles but to act upon them with his usual energy how far he was impelled by the halfcontemptuous passiveness of his companions it would be difficult to say  what is to prevent the pursuit of them at once he asked suddenly we are a few miles from the station where horses can be procured  whos to do it replied the other lazily the stage company will lodge the complaint with the authorities but it will take two days to get the county officers out and its nobody elses funeral  i will go for one said hale quietly i have a horse waiting for me at the station and can start at once  there was an instant of silence the stagecoach had left the obscurity of the forest and by the stronger light hale could perceive that his companion was examining him with two colorless lazy eyes presently he said meeting hales clear glance but rather as if yielding to a careless reflection  it might be done with four men we oughter raise one man at the station he paused i dont know ez id mind taking a hand myself he added stretching out his legs with a slight yawn  ye can count me in if youre goin kernel i reckon im talkin to kernel clinch said the passenger beside hale with sudden alacrity im rawlins of frisco heerd of ye afore kernel and kinder spotted you jist now from your talk  to hales surprise the two men after awkwardly and perfunctorily grasping each others hand entered at once into a languid conversation on the recent election at fresno without the slightest further reference to the pursuit of the robbers it was not until the remaining and undenominated passenger turned to hale and regretting that he had immediate business at the summit offered to accompany the party if they would wait a couple of hours that colonel clinch briefly returned to the subject  four men will do and ez well hev to take horses from the station well hev to take the fourth man from there  with these words he resumed his uninteresting conversation with the equally uninterested rawlins and the undenominated passenger subsided into an admiring and dreamy contemplation of them both with all his principle and really highminded purpose hale could not help feeling constrained and annoyed at the sudden subordinate and auxiliary position to which he the projector of the enterprise had been reduced it was true that he had never offered himself as their leader it was true that the principle he wished to uphold and the effect he sought to obtain would be equally demonstrated under another it was true that the execution of his own conception gravitated by some occult impulse to the man who had not sought it and whom he had always regarded as an incapable but all this was so unlike precedent or tradition that after the fashion of conservative men he was suspicious of it and only that his honor was now involved he would have withdrawn from the enterprise there was still a chance of reasserting himself at the station where he was known and where some authority might be deputed to him  but even this prospect failed the station half hotel and half stable contained only the landlord who was also express agent and the new volunteer who clinch had suggested would be found among the stablemen the nearest justice of the peace was ten miles away and hale had to abandon even his hope of being sworn in as a deputy constable this introduction of a common and illiterate ostler into the party on equal terms with himself did not add to his satisfaction and a remark from rawlins seemed to complete his embarrassment  ye had a mighty narrer escape down there just now said that gentleman confidentially as hale buckled his saddle girths  i thought as we were not supposed to defend ourselves there was no danger said hale scornfully  oh i dont mean them road agents but him  who  kernel clinch you jist ez good as allowed he hadnt any grit  whatever i said i suppose i am responsible for it answered hale haughtily  thats what gits me was the imperturbable reply hes the best shot in southern california and hez let daylight through a dozen chaps afore now for half what you said  indeed  howsummever continued rawlins philosophically ez hes concluded to go with ye instead of for ye youre likely to hev your ideas on this matter carried out up to the handle hell make short work of it you bet ef ez i suspect the leader is an airy young feller from frisco who hez took to the road lately clinch hez got a personal grudge agin him from a quarrel over draw poker  this was the last blow to hales ideal crusade here he wasan honest respectable citizenengaged as simple accessory to a lawless vendetta originating at a gambling table when the first shock was over that grim philosophy which is the reaction of all imaginative and sensitive natures came to his aid he felt better oddly enough he began to be conscious that he was thinking and acting like his companions with this feeling a vague sympathy before absent faintly showed itself in their actions the sharpes rifle put into his hands by the stableman was accompanied by a familiar word of suggestion as to an equal which he was ashamed to find flattered him he was able to continue the conversation with rawlins more coolly  then you suspect who is the leader  only on giniral principles there was a finer touch so to speak in this yer robbery that wasnt in the oldfashioned style down in my country they hed crude ideas about them thingsused to strip the passengers of everything includin their clothes they say that at the station hotels when the coach came in the folks used to stand round with blankets to wrap up the passengers so ez not to skeer the wimen thars a story that the driver and express manager drove up one day with only a copy of the alty californy wrapped around em but thin added rawlins grimly there was folks ez said the hull story was only an advertisement got up for the alty  times up  are you ready gentlemen said colonel clinch  hale started he had forgotten his wife and family at eagles court ten miles away they would be alarmed at his absence would perhaps hear some exaggerated version of the stage coach robbery and fear the worst  is there any way i could send a line to eagles court before daybreak he asked eagerly  the station was already drained of its spare men and horses the undenominated passenger stepped forward and offered to take it himself when his business which he would despatch as quickly as possible was concluded  that aint a bad idea said clinch reflectively for ef yer hurry youll head em off in case they scent us and try to double back on the north ridge theyll fight shy of the trail if they see anybody on it and one mans as good as a dozen  hale could not help thinking that he might have been that one man and had his opportunity for independent action but for his rash proposal but it was too late to withdraw now he hastily scribbled a few lines to his wife on a sheet of the station paper handed it to the man and took his place in the little cavalcade as it filed silently down the road  they had ridden in silence for nearly an hour and had passed the scene of the robbery by a higher track morning had long ago advanced its colors on the cold white peaks to their right and was taking possession of the spur where they rode  it looks like snow said rawlins quietly  hale turned towards him in astonishment nothing on earth or sky looked less likely it had been cold but that might have been only a current from the frozen peaks beyond reaching the lower valley the ridge on which they had halted was still thick with yellowishgreen summer foliage mingled with the darker evergreen of pine and fir ovenlike canyons in the long flanks of the mountain seemed still to glow with the heat of yesterdays noon the breathless air yet trembled and quivered over stifling gorges and passes in the granite rocks while far at their feet sixty miles of perpetual summer stretched away over the winding american river now and then lost in a gossamer haze it was scarcely ripe october where they stood they could see the plenitude of august still lingering in the valleys  ive seen thomsons pass choked up with fifteen feet o snow earlier than this said rawlins answering hales gaze and last september the passengers sledded over the road we came last night and all the time thomson a mile lower down over the ridge in the hollow smoking his pipes under roses in his piazzy mountains is mighty uncertain they make their own weather ez they want it i reckon you aint wintered here yet  hale was obliged to admit that he had only taken eagles court in the early spring  oh youre all right at eagleswhen youre there but its like thomsonsits the gettin there thathallo whats that  a shot distant but distinct had rung through the keen air it was followed by another so alike as to seem an echo  thats over yon on the north ridge said the ostler about two miles as the crow flies and five by the trail somebodys shootin bar  not with a shot gun said clinch quickly wheeling his horse with a gesture that electrified them its them and theve doubled on us to the north ridge gentlemen and ride all you know  it needed no second challenge to completely transform that quiet cavalcade the wild manhunting instinct inseparable to most humanity rose at their leaders look and word with an incoherent and unintelligible cry giving voice to the chase like the commonest hound of their fields the orderloving hale and the philosophical rawlins wheeled with the others and in another instant the little band swept out of sight in the forest  an immense and immeasurable quiet succeeded the sunlight glistened silently on cliff and scar the vast distance below seemed to stretch out and broaden into repose it might have been fancy but over the sharp line of the north ridge a light smoke lifted as of an escaping soul     chapter ii   eagles court one of the highest canyons of the sierras was in reality a plateau of tableland embayed like a green lake in a semicircular sweep of granite that lifting itself three thousand feet higher became a foundation for the eternal snows the mountain genii of space and atmosphere jealously guarded its seclusion and surrounded it with illusions it never looked to be exactly what it was the traveller who saw it from the north ridge apparently at his feet in descending found himself separated from it by a milelong abyss and a rushing river those who sought it by a seeming direct trail at the end of an hour lost sight of it completely or abandoning the quest and retracing their steps suddenly came upon the gap through which it was entered that which from the ridge appeared to be a copse of bushes beside the tiny dwelling were trees three hundred feet high the cultivated lawn before it which might have been covered by the travellers handkerchief was a field of a thousand acres  the house itself was a long low irregular structure chiefly of roof and veranda picturesquely upheld by rustic pillars of pine with the bark still adhering and covered with vines and trailing roses yet it was evident that the coolness produced by this vast extent of cover was more than the architect who had planned it under the influence of a staring and bewildering sky had trustfully conceived for it had to be mitigated by blazing fires in open hearths when the thermometer marked a hundred degrees in the field beyond the dry restless wind that continually rocked the tall masts of the pines with a sound like the distant sea while it stimulated outdoor physical exertion and defied fatigue left the sedentary dwellers in these altitudes chilled in the shade they courted or scorched them with heat when they ventured to bask supinely in the sun white muslin curtains at the french windows and rugs skins and heavy furs dispersed in the interior with certain other charming but incongruous details of furniture marked the inconsistencies of the climate  there was a coquettish indication of this in the costume of miss kate scott as she stepped out on the veranda that morning a mans broadbrimmed panama hat partly unsexed by a twisted gaylycolored scarf but retaining enough character to give piquancy to the pretty curves of the face beneath protected her from the sun a red flannel shirtanother spoil from the enemyand a thick jacket shielded her from the austerities of the morning breeze but the next inconsistency was peculiarly her own miss kate always wore the freshest and lightest of white cambric skirts without the least reference to the temperature to the practical sanatory remonstrances of her brotherinlaw and to the conventional criticism of her sister she opposed the same defence how else is one to tell when it is summer in this ridiculous climate and then woollen is stuffy color draws the sun and one at least knows when one is clean or dirty artistically the result was far from unsatisfactory it was a pretty figure under the sombre pines against the gray granite and the steely sky and seemed to lend the yellowing fields from which the flowers had already fled a floral relief of color i do not think the few masculine wayfarers of that locality objected to it indeed some had betrayed an indiscreet admiration and had curiously followed the invitation of miss kates warmlycolored figure until they had encountered the invincible indifference of miss kates cold gray eyes with these manifestations her brotherinlaw did not concern himself he had perfect confidence in her unqualified disinterest in the neighboring humanity and permitted her to wander in her solitary picturesqueness or accompanied her when she rode in her dark green habit with equal freedom from anxiety  for miss scott although only twenty had already subjected most of her maidenly illusions to mature critical analyses she had voluntarily accompanied her sister and mother to california in the earnest hope that nature contained something worth saying to her and was disappointed to find she had already discounted its value in the pages of books she hoped to find a vague freedom in this unconventional life thus opened to her or rather to show others that she knew how intelligently to appreciate it but as yet she was only able to express it in the one detail of dress already alluded to some of the men and nearly all the women she had met thus far she was amazed to find valued the conventionalities she believed she despised and were voluntarily assuming the chains she thought she had thrown off instead of learning anything from them these children of nature had bored her with eager questionings regarding the civilization she had abandoned or irritated her with crude imitations of it for her benefit fancy she had written to a friend in boston my calling on sue murphy who remembered the donner tragedy and who once shot a grizzly that was prowling round her cabin and think of her begging me to lend her my sack for a pattern and wanting to know if polonays were still worn she remembered more bitterly the romance that had tickled her earlier fancy told of two college friends of her brotherinlaws who were living the perfect life in the mines laboring in the ditches with a copy of homer in their pockets and writing letters of the purest philosophy under the free air of the pines how coming unexpectedly on them in their arcadia the party found them unpresentable through dirt and thenceforth unknowable through domestic complications that had filled their arcadian cabin with halfbreed children  much of this disillusion she had kept within her own heart from a feeling of pride or only lightly touched upon it in her relations with her mother and sister for mrs hale and mrs scott had no idols to shatter no enthusiasm to subdue firmly and unalterably conscious of their own superiority to the life they led and the community that surrounded them they accepted their duties cheerfully and performed them conscientiously those duties were loyalty to hales interests and a vague missionary work among the neighbors which like most missionary work consisted rather in making their own ideas understood than in understanding the ideas of their audience old mrs scotts zeal was partly religious an inheritance from her puritan ancestry mrs hales was the affability of a gentlewoman and the obligation of her position to this was added the slight languor of the cultivated american wife whose health has been affected by the birth of her first child and whose views of marriage and maternity were slightly tinged with gentle scepticism she was sincerely attached to her husband who dominated the household like the rest of his women folk with the faint consciousness of that division of service which renders the position of the sultan of a seraglio at once so prominent and so precarious the attitude of john hale in his family circle was dominant because it had never been subjected to criticism or comparison and perilous for the same reason  mrs hale presently joined her sister in the veranda and shading her eyes with a narrow white hand glanced on the prospect with a polite interest and ladylike urbanity the searching sun which as miss kate once intimated was vulgarity itself stared at her in return but could not call a blush to her somewhat sallow cheek neither could it detract however from the delicate prettiness of her refined face with its soft gray shadows or the dark gentle eyes whose blueveined lids were just then wrinkled into coquettishly mischievous lines by the strong light she was taller and thinner than kate and had at times a certain shy coy sinuosity of movement which gave her a more virginal suggestion than her unmarried sister for miss kate from her earliest youth had been distinguished by that matronly sedateness of voice and step and completeness of figure which indicates some members of the gallinaceous tribe from their callow infancy  i suppose john must have stopped at the summit on some business said mrs hale or he would have been here already its scarcely worth while waiting for him unless you choose to ride over and meet him you might change your dress she continued looking doubtfully at kates costume put on your ridinghabit and take manuel with you  and take the only man we have and leave you alone returned kate slowly no  there are the chinese field hands said mrs hale you must correct your ideas and really allow them some humanity kate john says they have a very good compulsory school system in their own country and can read and write  that would be of little use to you here alone ifif kate hesitated  if what said mrs hale smiling are you thinking of manuels dreadful story of the grizzly tracks across the fields this morning i promise you that neither i nor mother nor minnie shall stir out of the house until you return if you wish it  i wasnt thinking of that said kate though i dont believe the beating of a gong and the using of strong language is the best way to frighten a grizzly from the house besides the chinese are going down the river today to a funeral or a wedding or a feast of stolen chickenstheyre all the sameand wont be here  then take manuel repeated mrs hale we have the chinese servants and indian molly in the house to protect us from heaven knows what i have the greatest confidence in chylee as a warrior and in chinese warfare generally one has only to hear him pipe in time of peace to imagine what a terror he might become in war time indeed anything more deadly and soulharrowing than that love song he sang for us last night i cannot conceive but really kate i am not afraid to stay alone you know what john says we ought to be always prepared for anything that might happen  my dear josie returned kate putting her arm around her sisters waist i am perfectly convinced that if threefingered jack or twotoed bill or even joaquim murietta himself should step redhanded on that veranda you would gently invite him to take a cup of tea inquire about the state of the road and refrain delicately from any allusions to the sheriff but i shant take manuel from you i really cannot undertake to look after his morals at the station and keep him from drinking aguardiente with suspicious characters at the bar it is true he kisses my hand in his speech even when it is thickest and offers his back to me for a horseblock but i think i prefer the sober and honest familiarity of even that pike county landlord who is satisfied to say jump girl and ill ketch ye  i hope you didnt change your manner to either of them for that said mrs hale with a faint sigh john wants to be good friends with them and they are behaving quite decently lately considering that they cant speak a grammatical sentence nor know the use of a fork  and now the man puts on gloves and a tall hat to come here on sundays and the woman wont call until youve called first retorted kate perhaps you call that improvement the fact is josephine continued the young girl folding her arms demurely we might as well admit it at oncethese people dont like us  thats impossible said mrs hale with sublime simplicity you dont like them you mean  i like them better than you do josie and thats the reason why i feel it and you dont she checked herself and after a pause resumed in a lighter tone no i shant go to the station ill commune with nature today and wont take any humanity in mine thank you as bill the driver says adios  i wish kate would not use that dreadful slang even in jest said mrs scott in her rockingchair at the french window when josephine reentered the parlor as her sister walked briskly away i am afraid she is being infected by the people at the station she ought to have a change  i was just thinking said josephine looking abstractedly at her mother that i would try to get john to take her to san francisco this winter the careys are expected you know she might visit them  im afraid if she stays here much longer she wont care to see them at all she seems to care for nothing now that she ever liked before returned the old lady ominously  meantime the subject of these criticisms was carrying away her own reflections tightly buttoned up in her short jacket she had driven back her dog spotanother one of her disillusions who giving way to his lower nature had once killed a sheepas she did not wish her jacqueslike contemplation of any wounded deer to be inconsistently interrupted by a fresh outrage from her companion the air was really very chilly and for the first time in her mountain experience the direct rays of the sun seemed to be shorn of their power this compelled her to walk more briskly than she was conscious of for in less than an hour she came suddenly and breathlessly upon the mouth of the canyon or natural gateway to eagles court  to her always a profound spectacle of mountain magnificence it seemed today almost terrible in its cold strong grandeur the narrowing pass was choked for a moment between two gigantic buttresses of granite approaching each other so closely at their towering summits that trees growing in opposite clefts of the rock intermingled their branches and pointed the soaring gothic arch of a stupendous gateway she raised her eyes with a quickly beating heart she knew that the interlacing trees above her were as large as those she had just quitted she knew also that the point where they met was only halfway up the cliff for she had once gazed down upon them dwindled to shrubs from the airy summit she knew that their shaken cones fell a thousand feet perpendicularly or bounded like shot from the scarred walls they bombarded she remembered that one of these pines dislodged from its high foundations had once dropped like a portcullis in the archway blocking the pass and was only carried afterwards by assault of steel and fire bending her head mechanically she ran swiftly through the shadowy passage and halted only at the beginning of the ascent on the other side  it was here that the actual position of the plateau so indefinite of approach began to be realized it now appeared an independent elevation surrounded on three sides by gorges and watercourses so narrow as to be overlooked from the principal mountain range with which it was connected by a long canyon that led to the ridge at the outlet of this canyonin bygone ages a mighty riverit had the appearance of having been slowly raised by the diluvium of that river and the debris washed down from abovea suggestion repeated in miniature by the artificial plateaus of excavated soil raised before the mouths of mining tunnels in the lower flanks of the mountain it was the realization of a factoften forgotten by the dwellers in eagles courtthat the valley below them which was their connecting link with the surrounding world was only reached by ascending the mountain and the nearest road was over the higher mountain ridge never before had this impressed itself so strongly upon the young girl as when she turned that morning to look upon the plateau below her it seemed to illustrate the conviction that had been slowly shaping itself out of her reflections on the conversation of that morning it was possible that the perfect understanding of a higher life was only reached from a height still greater and that to those halfway up the mountain the summit was never as truthfully revealed as to the humbler dwellers in the valley  i do not know that these profound truths prevented her from gathering some quaint ferns and berries or from keeping her calm gray eyes open to certain practical changes that were taking place around her she had noticed a singular thickening in the atmosphere that seemed to prevent the passage of the suns rays yet without diminishing the transparent quality of the air the distant snowpeaks were as plainly seen though they appeared as if in moonlight this seemed due to no cloud or mist but rather to a fading of the sun itself the occasional flurry of wings overhead the whirring of larger birds in the cover and a frequent rustling in the undergrowth as of the passage of some stealthy animal began equally to attract her attention it was so different from the habitual silence of these sedate solitudes kate had no vague fear of wild beasts she had been long enough a mountaineer to understand the general immunity enjoyed by the unmolesting wayfarer and kept her way undismayed she was descending an abrupt trail when she was stopped by a sudden crash in the bushes it seemed to come from the opposite incline directly in a line with her and apparently on the very trail that she was pursuing the crash was then repeated again and again lower down as of a descending body expecting the apparition of some fallen tree or detached boulder bursting through the thicket in its way to the bottom of the gulch she waited the foliage was suddenly brushed aside and a large grizzly bear half rolled half waddled into the trail on the opposite side of the hill a few moments more would have brought them face to face at the foot of the gulch when she stopped there were not fifty yards between them  she did not scream she did not faint she was not even frightened there did not seem to be anything terrifying in this huge stupid beast who arrested by the rustle of a stone displaced by her descending feet rose slowly on his haunches and gazed at her with small wondering eyes nor did it seem strange to her seeing that he was in her way to pick up a stone throw it in his direction and say simply sho get away as she would have done to an intruding cow nor did it seem odd that he should actually go away as he did scrambling back into the bushes again and disappearing like some grotesque figure in a transformation scene it was not until after he had gone that she was taken with a slight nervousness and giddiness and retraced her steps somewhat hurriedly shying a little at every rustle in the thicket by the time she had reached the great gateway she was doubtful whether to be pleased or frightened at the incident but she concluded to keep it to herself  it was still intensely cold the light of the midday sun had decreased still more and on reaching the plateau again she saw that a dark cloud not unlike the precursor of a thunderstorm was brooding over the snowy peaks beyond in spite of the cold this singular suggestion of summer phenomena was still borne out by the distant smiling valley and even in the soft grasses at her feet it seemed to her the crowning inconsistency of the climate and with a halfserious halfplayful protest on her lips she hurried forward to seek the shelter of the house     chapter iii   to kates surprise the lower part of the house was deserted but there was an unusual activity on the floor above and the sound of heavy steps there were alien marks of dusty feet on the scrupulously clean passage and on the first step of the stairs a spot of blood with a sudden genuine alarm that drove her previous adventure from her mind she impatiently called her sisters name there was a hasty yet subdued rustle of skirts on the staircase and mrs hale with her finger on her lip swept kate unceremoniously into the sittingroom closed the door and leaned back against it with a faint smile she had a crumpled paper in her hand  dont be alarmed but read that first she said handing her sister the paper it was brought just now  kate instantly recognized her brothers distinct hand she read hurriedly the coach was robbed last night nobody hurt ive lost nothing but a days time as this business will keep me here until tomorrow when manuel can join me with a fresh horse no cause for alarm as the bearer goes out of his way to bring you this see that he wants for nothing  well said kate expectantly  well the bearer was fired upon by the robbers who were lurking on the ridge he was wounded in the leg luckily he was picked up by his friend who was coming to meet him and brought here as the nearest place hes upstairs in the spare bed in the spare room with his friend who wont leave his side he wont even have mother in the room theyve stopped the bleeding with johns ambulance things and now kate heres a chance for you to show the value of your education in the ambulance class the ball has got to be extracted heres your opportunity  kate looked at her sister curiously there was a faint pink flush on her pale cheeks and her eyes were gently sparkling she had never seen her look so pretty before  why not have sent manuel for a doctor at once asked kate  the nearest doctor is fifteen miles away and manuel is nowhere to be found perhaps hes gone to look after the stock theres some talk of snow imagine the absurdity of it  but who are they  they speak of themselves as friends as if it were a profession the wounded one was a passenger i suppose  but what are they like continued kate i suppose theyre like them all  mrs hale shrugged her shoulders  the wounded one when hes not fainting away is laughing the other is a creature with a moustache and gloomy beyond expression  what are you going to do with them said kate  what should i do even without johns letter i could not refuse the shelter of my house to a wounded and helpless man i shall keep him of course until john comes why kate i really believe you are so prejudiced against these people youd like to turn them out but i forget its because you like them so well well you need not fear to expose yourself to the fascinations of the wounded christy minstrelim sure hes thator to the unspeakable one who is shyness itself and would not dare to raise his eyes to you  there was a timid hesitating step in the passage it paused before the door moved away returned and finally asserted its intentions in the gentlest of taps  its him im sure of it said mrs hale with a suppressed smile  kate threw open the door smartly to the extreme discomfiture of a tall dark figure that already had slunk away from it for all that he was a goodlooking enough fellow with a moustache as long and almost as flexible as a ringlet kate could not help noticing also that his hand which was nervously pulling the moustache was white and thin  excuse me he stammered without raising his eyes i was looking forforthe old lady ii beg your pardon i didnt know that youthe young ladiescompanywere here i intendedi only wanted to say that my friend he stopped at the slight smile that passed quickly over mrs hales mouth and his pale face reddened with an angry flush  i hope he is not worse said mrs hale with more than her usual languid gentleness my mother is not here at present can ican wethis is my sisterdo as well  without looking up he made a constrained recognition of kates presence that embarrassed and curt as it was had none of the awkwardness of rusticity  thank you youre very kind but my friend is a little stronger and if you can lend me an extra horse ill try to get him on the summit tonight  but you surely will not take him away from us so soon said mrs hale with a languid look of alarm in which kate however detected a certain real feeling wait at least until my husband returns tomorrow  he wont be here tomorrow said the stranger hastily he stopped and as quickly corrected himself that is his business is so very uncertain my friend says  only kate noticed the slip but she noticed also that her sister was apparently unconscious of it you think she said that mr hale may be delayed  he turned upon her almost brusquely i mean that it is already snowing up there he pointed through the window to the cloud kate had noticed if it comes down lower in the pass the roads will be blocked up that is why it would be better for us to try and get on at once  but if mr hale is likely to be stopped by snow so are you said mrs hale playfully and you had better let us try to make your friend comfortable here rather than expose him to that uncertainty in his weak condition we will do our best for him my sister is dying for an opportunity to show her skill in surgery she continued with an unexpected mischievousness that only added to kates surprised embarrassment arent you kate  equivocal as the young girl knew her silence appeared she was unable to utter the simplest polite evasion some unaccountable impulse kept her constrained and speechless the stranger did not however wait for her reply but casting a swift hurried glance around the room said its impossible we must go in fact ive already taken the liberty to order the horses round they are at the door now you may be certain he added with quick earnestness suddenly lifting his dark eyes to mrs hale and as rapidly withdrawing them that your horse will be returned at once andandwe wont forget your kindness he stopped and turned towards the hall ii have brought my friend downstairs he wants to thank you before he goes  as he remained standing in the hall the two women stepped to the door to their surprise half reclining on a cane sofa was the wounded man and what could be seen of his slight figure was wrapped in a dark serape his beardless face gave him a quaint boyishness quite inconsistent with the mature lines of his temples and forehead pale and in pain as he evidently was his blue eyes twinkled with intense amusement not only did his manner offer a marked contrast to the sombre uneasiness of his companion but he seemed to be the only one perfectly at his ease in the group around him  its rather rough making you come out here to see me off he said with a not unmusical laugh that was very infectious but ned there who carried me downstairs wanted to tote me round the house in his arms like a baby to say tata to you all excuse my not rising but i feel as uncertain below as a mermaid and as out of my element he added with a mischievous glance at his friend ned concluded i must go on but i must say goodby to the old lady first ah here she is  to kates complete bewilderment not only did the utter familiarity of this speech pass unnoticed and unrebuked by her sister but actually her own mother advanced quickly with every expression of lively sympathy and with the authority of her years and an almost maternal anxiety endeavored to dissuade the invalid from going this is not my house she said looking at her daughter but if it were i should not hear of your leaving not only tonight but until you were out of danger josephine kate what are you thinking of to permit it well then i forbid itthere  had they become suddenly insane or were they bewitched by this morose intruder and his insufferably familiar confidant the man was wounded it was true they might have to put him up in common humanity but here was her austere mother who wouldnt come in the room when whisky dick called on business actually pressing both of the invalids hands while her sister who never extended a finger to the ordinary visiting humanity of the neighborhood looked on with evident complacency  the wounded man suddenly raised mrs scotts hand to his lips kissed it gently and with his smile quite vanished endeavored to rise to his feet its of no usewe must go give me your arm ned quick are the horses there  dear me said mrs scott quickly i forgot to say the horse cannot be found anywhere manuel must have taken him this morning to look up the stock but he will be back tonight certainly and if tomorrow  the wounded man sank back to a sitting position is manuel your man he asked grimly  yes  the two men exchanged glances  marked on his left cheek and drinks a good deal  yes said kate finding her voice why  the amused look came back to the mans eyes that kind of man isnt safe to wait for we must take our own horse ned are you ready  yes  the wounded man again attempted to rise he fell back but this time quite heavily he had fainted  involuntarily and simultaneously the three women rushed to his side he cannot go said kate suddenly  he will be better in a moment  but only for a moment will nothing induce you to change your mind  as if in reply a sudden gust of wind brought a volley of rain against the window  that will said the stranger bitterly  the rain  a mile from here it is snow and before we could reach the summit with these horses the road would be impassable  he made a slight gesture to himself as if accepting an inevitable defeat and turned to his companion who was slowly reviving under the active ministration of the two women the wounded man looked around with a weak smile this is one way of going off he said faintly but i could do this sort of thing as well on the road  you can do nothing now said his friend decidedly before we get to the gate the road will be impassable for our horses  for any horses asked kate  for any horses for any man or beast i might say where we cannot get out no one can get in he added as if answering her thoughts i am afraid that you wont see your brother tomorrow morning but ill reconnoitre as soon as i can do so without torturing him he said looking anxiously at the helpless man hes got about his share of pain i reckon and the first thing is to get him easier it was the longest speech he had made to her it was the first time he had fairly looked her in the face his shy restlessness had suddenly given way to dogged resignation less abstracted but scarcely more flattering to his entertainers lifting his companion gently in his arms as if he had been a child he reascended the staircase mrs scott and the hastilysummoned molly following with overflowing solicitude as soon as they were alone in the parlor mrs hale turned to her sister only that our guests seemed to be as anxious to go just now as you were to pack them off i should have been shocked at your inhospitality what has come over you kate these are the very people you have reproached me so often with not being civil enough to  but who are they  how do i know there is your brothers letter  she usually spoke of her husband as john this slight shifting of relationship and responsibility to the feminine mind was significant kate was a little frightened and remorseful  i only meant you dont even know their names  that wasnt necessary for giving them a bed and bandages do you suppose the good samaritan ever asked the wounded jews name and that the levite did not excuse himself because the thieves had taken the poor mans cardcase do the directions in case of accident in your ambulance rules read first lay the sufferer on his back and inquire his name and family connections besides you can call one ned and the other george if you like  oh you know what i mean said kate irrelevantly which is george  george is the wounded man said mrs hale not the one who talked to you more than he did to any one else i suppose the poor man was frightened and read dismissal in your eyes  i wish john were here  i dont think we have anything to fear in his absence from men whose only wish is to get away from us if it is a question of propriety my dear kate surely there is the presence of mother to prevent any scandalalthough really her own conduct with the wounded one is not above suspicion she added with that novel mischievousness that seemed a return of her lost girlhood we must try to do the best we can with them and for them she said decidedly and meantime ill see if i cant arrange johns room for them  johns room  oh mother is perfectly satisfied indeed suggested it its larger and will hold two beds for ned the friend must attend to him at night and kate dont you think if youre not going out again you might change your costume it does very well while we are alone  well said kate indignantly as i am not going into his room  im not so sure about that if we cant get a regular doctor but he is very restless and wanders all over the house like a timid and apologetic spaniel  who  why ned but i must go and look after the patient i suppose theyve got him safe in his bed again and with a nod to her sister she tripped upstairs  uncomfortable and embarrassed she knew not why kate sought her mother but that good lady was already in attendance on the patient and kate hurried past that baleful centre of attraction with a feeling of loneliness and strangeness she had never experienced before entering her own room she went to the windowthat first and last refuge of the troubled mindand gazed out turning her eyes in the direction of her mornings walk she started back with a sense of being dazzled she rubbed first her eyes and then the raindimmed pane it was no illusion the whole landscape so familiar to her was one vast field of dead colorless white trees rocks even distance itself had vanished in those few hours an even shadowless motionless white sea filled the horizon on either side a vast wall of snow seemed to shut out the world like a shroud only the green plateau before her with its sloping meadows and fringe of pines and cottonwood lay alone like a summer island in this frozen sea  a sudden desire to view this phenomenon more closely and to learn for herself the limits of this new tethered life completely possessed her and accustomed to act upon her independent impulses she seized a hooded waterproof cloak and slipped out of the house unperceived the rain was falling steadily along the descending trail where she walked but beyond scarcely a mile across the chasm the wintry distance began to confuse her brain with the inextricable swarming of snow hurrying down with feverish excitement she at last came in sight of the arching granite portals of their domain but her first glance through the gateway showed it closed as if with a white portcullis kate remembered that the trail began to ascend beyond the arch and knew that what she saw was only the mountain side she had partly climbed this morning but the snow had already crept down its flank and the exit by trail was practically closed breathlessly making her way back to the highest part of the plateauthe cliff behind the house that here descended abruptly to the raindimmed valleyshe gazed at the dizzy depths in vain for some undiscovered or forgotten trail along its face but a single glance convinced her of its inaccessibility the gateway was indeed their only outlet to the plain below she looked back at the falling snow beyond until she fancied she could see in the crossing and recrossing lines the moving meshes of a fateful web woven around them by viewless but inexorable fingers  half frightened she was turning away when she perceived a few paces distant the figure of the stranger ned also apparently absorbed in the gloomy prospect he was wrapped in the clinging folds of a black serape braided with silver the broad flap of a slouch hat beaten back by the wind exposed the dark glistening curls on his white forehead he was certainly very handsome and picturesque and that apparently without effort or consciousness neither was there anything in his costume or appearance inconsistent with his surroundings or even with what kate could judge were his habits or position nevertheless she instantly decided that he was too handsome and too picturesque without suspecting that her ideas of the limits of masculine beauty were merely personal experience  as he turned away from the cliff they were brought face to face it doesnt look very encouraging over there he said quietly as if the inevitableness of the situation had relieved him of his previous shyness and effort its even worse than i expected the snow must have begun there last night and it looks as if it meant to stay he stopped for a moment and then lifting his eyes to her said  i suppose you know what this means  i dont understand you  i thought not well it means that you are absolutely cut off here from any communication or intercourse with any one outside of that canyon by this time the snow is five feet deep over the only trail by which one can pass in and out of that gateway i am not alarming you i hope for there is no real physical danger a place like this ought to be well garrisoned and certainly is selfsupporting so far as the mere necessities and even comforts are concerned you have wood water cattle and game at your command but for two weeks at least you are completely isolated  for two weeks said kate growing paleand my brother  he knows all by this time and is probably as assured as i am of the safety of his family  for two weeks continued kate impossible you dont know my brother he will find some way to get to us  i hope so returned the stranger gravely for what is possible for him is possible for us  then you are anxious to get away kate could not help saying  very  the reply was not discourteous in manner but was so far from gallant that kate felt a new and inconsistent resentment before she could say anything he added and i hope you will remember whatever may happen that i did my best to avoid staying here longer than was necessary to keep my friend from bleeding to death in the road  certainly said kate then added awkwardly i hope hell be better soon she was silent and then quickening her pace said hurriedly i must tell my sister this dreadful news  i think she is prepared for it if there is anything i can do to help you i hope you will let me know perhaps i may be of some service i shall begin by exploring the trails tomorrow for the best service we can do you possibly is to take ourselves off but i can carry a gun and the woods are full of game driven down from the mountains let me show you something you may not have noticed he stopped and pointed to a small knoll of sheltered shrubbery and granite on the opposite mountain which still remained black against the surrounding snow it seemed to be thickly covered with moving objects they are wild animals driven out of the snow said the stranger that larger one is a grizzly there is a panther wolves wild cats a fox and some mountain goats  an illassorted party said the young girl  ill luck makes them companions they are too frightened to hurt one another now  but they will eat each other later on said kate stealing a glance at her companion  he lifted his long lashes and met her eyes not on a haven of refuge     chapter iv   kate found her sister as the stranger had intimated fully prepared a hasty inventory of provisions and means of subsistence showed that they had ample resources for a much longer isolation  they tell me it is by no means an uncommon case kate somebody over at somebodys place was snowed in for four weeks and now it appears that even the summit house is not always accessible john ought to have known it when he bought the place in fact i was ashamed to admit that he did not but that is like john to prefer his own theories to the experience of others however i dont suppose we should even notice the privation except for the mails it will be a lesson to john though as mr lee says he is on the outside and can probably go wherever he likes from the summit except to come here  mr lee echoed kate  yes the wounded one and the others name is falkner i asked them in order that you might be properly introduced there were very respectable falkners in charlestown you remember i thought you might warm to the name and perhaps trace the connection now that you are such good friends its providential they are here as we havent got a horse or a man in the place since manuel disappeared though mr falkner says he cant be far away or they would have met him on the trail if he had gone towards the summit  did they say anything more of manuel  nothing though i am inclined to agree with you that he isnt trustworthy but that again is the result of johns idea of employing native skill at the expense of retaining native habits  the evening closed early and with no diminution in the falling rain and rising wind falkner kept his word and unostentatiously performed the outdoor work in the barn and stables assisted by the only chinese servant remaining and under the advice and supervision of kate although he seemed to understand horses she was surprised to find that he betrayed a civic ignorance of the ordinary details of the farm and rustic household it was quite impossible that she should retain her distrustful attitude or he his reserve in their enforced companionship they talked freely of subjects suggested by the situation falkner exhibiting a general knowledge and intuition of things without parade or dogmatism doubtful of all versatility as kate was she could not help admitting to herself that his truths were none the less true for their quantity or that he got at them without ostentatious processes his talk certainly was more picturesque than her brothers and less subduing to her faculties john had always crushed her  when they returned to the house he did not linger in the parlor or sittingroom but at once rejoined his friend when dinner was ready in the diningroom a little more deliberately arranged and ornamented than usual the two women were somewhat surprised to receive an excuse from falkner begging them to allow him for the present to take his meals with the patient and thus save the necessity of another attendant  it is all shyness kate said mrs hale confidently and must not be permitted for a moment  im sure i should be quite willing to stay with the poor boy myself said mrs scott simply and take mr falkners place while he dines  you are too willing mother said mrs hale pertly and your poor boy as you call him will never see thirtyfive again  he will never see any other birthday retorted her mother unless you keep him more quiet he only talks when youre in the room  he wants some relief to his friends long face and moustachios that make him look prematurely in mourning said mrs hale with a slight increase of animation i dont propose to leave them too much together after dinner well adjourn to their room and lighten it up a little you must come kate to look at the patient and counteract the baleful effects of my frivolity  mrs hales instincts were truer than her mothers experience not only that the wounded mans eyes became brighter under the provocation of her presence but it was evident that his naturally exuberant spirits were a part of his vital strength and were absolutely essential to his quick recovery encouraged by falkners grave and practical assistance which she could not ignore kate ventured to make an examination of lees wound even to her unpractised eye it was less serious than at first appeared the great loss of blood had been due to the laceration of certain small vessels below the knee but neither artery nor bone was injured a recurrence of the haemorrhage or fever was the only thing to be feared and these could be averted by bandaging repose and simple nursing  the unfailing good humor of the patient under this manipulation the quaint originality of his speech the freedom of his fancy which was however always controlled by a certain instinctive tact began to affect kate nearly as it had the others she found herself laughing over the work she had undertaken in a pure sense of duty she joined in the hilarity produced by lees affected terror of her surgical mania and offered to undo the bandages in search of the thimble he declared she had left in the wound with a view to further experiments  you ought to broaden your practice he suggested a good deal might be made out of ned and a piece of soap left carelessly on the first step of the staircase while mountains of surgical opportunities lie in a humble orange peel judiciously exposed only i warn you that you wouldnt find him as docile as i am decoyed into a snowdrift and frozen you might get some valuable experiences in resuscitation by thawing him  i fancied you had done that already kate whispered mrs hale  freezing is the new suggestion for painless surgery said lee coming to kates relief with ready tact only the knowledge should be more generally spread there was a man up at strawberry fell under a sledgeload of wood in the snow stunned by the shock he was slowly freezing to death when with a tremendous effort he succeeded in freeing himself all but his right leg pinned down by a small log his axe happened to have fallen within reach and a few blows on the log freed him  and saved the poor fellows life said mrs scott who was listening with sympathizing intensity  at the expense of his left leg which he had unknowingly cut off under the pleasing supposition that it was a log returned lee demurely  nevertheless in a few moments he managed to divert the slightly shocked susceptibilities of the old lady with some raillery of himself and did not again interrupt the even goodhumored communion of the party the rain beating against the windows and the fire sparkling on the hearth seemed to lend a charm to their peculiar isolation and it was not until mrs scott rose with a warning that they were trespassing upon the rest of their patient that they discovered that the evening had slipped by unnoticed when the door at last closed on the bright sympathetic eyes of the two young women and the motherly benediction of the elder falkner walked to the window and remained silent looking into the darkness suddenly he turned bitterly to his companion  this is just hll george  george lee with a smile on his boyish face lazily moved his head  i dont know if it wasnt for the old woman who is the one solid chunk of absolute goodness here expecting nothing wanting nothing it would be good fun enough these two women cooped up in this house wanted excitement theyve got it that man hale wanted to show off by going for us hes had his chance and will have it again before ive done with him that dd fool of a messenger wanted to go out of his way to exchange shots with me i reckon hes the most satisfied of the lot i dont know why you should growl you did your level best to get away from here and the result is that little puritan is ready to worship you  yesbut this playing it on themgeorgethis  whos playing it not you i see youve given away our names already  i couldnt lie and they know nothing by that  do you think they would be happier by knowing it do you think that soft little creature would be as happy as she was tonight if she knew that her husband had been indirectly the means of laying me by the heels here where is the swindle this hole in my leg if you had been five minutes under that girls dd sympathetic fingers youd have thought it was genuine is it in our trying to get away do you call that tenfeet drift in the pass a swindle is it in the chance of hale getting back while were here thats real enough isnt it i say ned did you ever give your unfettered intellect to the contemplation of that  falkner did not reply there was an interval of silence but he could see from the movement of georges shoulders that he was shaking with suppressed laughter  fancy mrs hale archly introducing her husband my offering him a chair but being all the time obliged to cover him with a derringer under the bedclothes your rushing in from your peaceful pastoral pursuits in the barn with a pitchfork in one hand and the girl in the other and dear old mammy sympathizing all round and trying to make everything comfortable  i should not be alive to see it george said falkner gloomily  youd manage to pitchfork me and those two women on hales horse and ride away thats what youd do or i dont know you look here ned he added more seriously the only swindling was our bringing that note here that was your idea you thought it would remove suspicion and as you believed i was bleeding to death you played that game for all it was worth to save me you might have done what i asked you to dopropped me up in the bushes and got away yourself i was good for a couple of shots yet and after thatwhat mattered that night the next day the next time i take the road or a year hence it will come when it will come all the same  he did not speak bitterly nor relax his smile falkner without speaking slid his hand along the coverlet lee grasped it and their hands remained clasped together for a few minutes in silence  how is this to end we cannot go on here in this way said falkner suddenly  if we cannot get away it must go on look here ned i dont reckon to take anything out of this house that i didnt bring in it or isnt freely offered to me yet i dont otherwise you understand intend making myself out a dd bit better than i am thats the only excuse i have for not making myself out just what i am i dont know the fellow whos obliged to tell every one the last company he was in or the last thing he did do you suppose even these pretty little women tell us their whole story do you fancy that this st john in the wilderness is canonized in his family perhaps when i take the liberty to intrude in his affairs as he has in mine hed see he isnt i dont blame you for being sensitive ned its natural when a man lives outside the revised statutes of his own state he is apt to be awfully fine on points of etiquette in his own household as for me i find it rather comfortable here the beds of other peoples making strike me as being more satisfactory than my own goodnight  in a few moments he was sleeping the peaceful sleep of that youth which seemed to be his own dominant quality falkner stood for a little space and watched him following the boyish lines of his cheek on the pillow from the shadow of the light brown lashes under his closed lids to the lifting of his short upper lip over his white teeth with his regular respiration only a sharp accenting of the line of nostril and jaw and a faint depression of the temple betrayed his already tried manhood  the house had long sunk to repose when falkner returned to the window and remained looking out upon the storm suddenly he extinguished the light and passing quickly to the bed laid his hand upon the sleeper lee opened his eyes instantly  are you awake  perfectly  somebody is trying to get into the house  not him eh said lee gayly  no two men mexicans i think one looks like manuel  ah said lee drawing himself up to a sitting posture  well  dont you see he believes the women are alone  the dogdd hound  speak respectfully of one of my people if you please and hand me my derringer light the candle again and open the door let them get in quietly theyll come here first its his room you understand and if theres any money its here anyway they must pass here to get to the womens rooms leave manuel to me and you take care of the other  i see  manuel knows the house and will come first when hes fairly in the room shut the door and go for the other but no noise this is just one of the sweetest things outif its done properly  but you george  if i couldnt manage that fellow without turning down the bedclothes id kick myself hush steady now  he lay down and shut his eyes as if in natural repose only his right hand carelessly placed under his pillow closed on the handle of his pistol falkner quietly slipped into the passage the light of the candle faintly illuminated the floor and opposite wall but left it on either side in pitchy obscurity  for some moments the silence was broken only by the sound of the rain without the recumbent figure in bed seemed to have actually succumbed to sleep the multitudinous small noises of a house in repose might have been misinterpreted by ears less keen than the sleepers but when the apparent creaking of a faroff shutter was followed by the sliding apparition of a dark head of tangled hair at the door lee had not been deceived and was as prepared as if he had seen it another step and the figure entered the room the door closed instantly behind it the sound of a heavy body struggling against the partition outside followed and then suddenly ceased  the intruder turned and violently grasped the handle of the door but recoiled at a quiet voice from the bed  drop that and come here  he started back with an exclamation the sleepers eyes were wide open the sleepers extended arm and pistol covered him  silence or ill let that candle shine through you  yes captain growled the astounded and frightened halfbreed i didnt know you were here  lee raised himself and grasped the long whip in his left hand and whirled it round his head  will you dry up  the man sank back against the wall in silent terror  open that door nowsoftly  manuel obeyed with trembling fingers  ned said lee in a low voice bring him in herequick  there was a slight rustle and falkner appeared backing in another gasping figure whose eyes were starting under the strong grasp of the captor at his throat  silence said lee all of you  there was a breathless pause the sound of a door hesitatingly opened in the passage broke the stillness followed by the gentle voice of mrs scott  is anything the matter  lee made a slight gesture of warning to falkner of menace to the others everythings the matter he called out cheerily neds managed to half pull down the house trying to get at something from my saddlebags  i hope he has not hurt himself broke in another voice mischievously  answer you clumsy villain whispered lee with twinkling eyes  im all right thank you responded falkner with unaffected awkwardness  there was a slight murmuring of voices and then the door was heard to close lee turned to falkner  disarm that hound and turn him loose outside and make no noise and you manuel tell him what his and your chances are if he shows his black face here again  manuel cast a single terrified supplicating glance more suggestive than words at his confederate as falkner shoved him before him from the room the next moment they were silently descending the stairs  may i go too captain entreated manuel i swear to god  shut the door the man obeyed  now then said lee with a broad gratified smile laying down his whip and pistol within reach and comfortably settling the pillows behind his back well have a quiet confab a sort of oldfashioned talk eh youre not looking well manuel youre drinking too much again it spoils your complexion  let me go captain pleaded the man emboldened by the goodhumored voice but not near enough to notice a peculiar light in the speakers eye  youve only just come manuel and at considerable trouble too well what have you got to say whats all this about what are you doing here  the captured man shuffled his feet nervously and only uttered an uneasy laugh of coarse discomfiture  i see youre bashful well ill help you along come you knew that hale was away and these women were here without a man to help them you thought youd find some money here and have your own way generally eh  the tone of lees voice inspired him to confidence unfortunately it inspired him with familiarity also  i reckoned i had the right to a little fun on my own account cap i reckoned ez one gentleman in the profession wouldnt interfere with another gentlemans little game he continued coarsely  stand up  wot for  up i say  manuel stood up and glanced at him  utter a cry that might frighten these women and by the living god theyll rush in here only to find you lying dead on the floor of the house youd have polluted  he grasped the whip and laid the lash of it heavily twice over the ruffians shoulders writhing in suppressed agony the man fell imploringly on his knees  now listen said lee softly twirling the whip in the air i want to refresh your memory did you ever learn when you were with mebefore i was obliged to kick you out of gentlemens companyto break into a private house answer  no stammered the wretch  did you ever learn to rob a woman a child or any but a man and that face to face  no repeated manuel  did you ever learn from me to lay a finger upon a woman old or young in anger or kindness  no  then my poor manuel its as i feared civilization has ruined you farming and a simple bucolic life have perverted your morals so you were running off with the stock and that mustang when you got stuck in the snow and the luminous idea of this little game struck you eh that was another mistake manuel i never allowed you to think when you were with me  no captain  whos your friend  a dd cowardly nigger from the summit  i agree with you for once but he hasnt had a very brilliant example wheres he gone now  to hll for all i care  then i want you to go with him listen if theres a way out of the place you know it or can find it i give you two days to do ityou and he at the end of that time the order will be to shoot you on sight now take off your boots  the mans dark face visibly whitened his teeth chattered in superstitious terror  im not going to shoot you now said lee smiling so you will have a chance to die with your boots on if you are superstitious i only want you to exchange them for that pair of hales in the corner the fact is i have taken a fancy to yours that fashion of wearing the stockings outside strikes me as one of the neatest things out        to die with ones boots on  a synonym for death by      violence popular among southwestern desperadoes and the      subject of superstitious dread  manuel suddenly drew off his boots with their muffled covering and put on the ones designated  now open the door  he did so falkner was already waiting at the threshold turn manuel loose with the other ned but disarm him first they might quarrel the habit of carrying arms manuel added lee as falkner took a pistol and bowieknife from the halfbreed is of itself provocative of violence and inconsistent with a bucolic and pastoral life  when falkner returned he said hurriedly to his companion do you think it wise george to let those hellhounds loose good god i could scarcely let my grip of his throat go when i thought of what they were hunting  my dear ned said lee luxuriously ensconcing himself under the bedclothes again with a slight shiver of delicious warmth i must warn you against allowing the natural pride of a higher walk to prejudice you against the general level of our profession indeed i was quite struck with the justice of manuels protest that i was interfering with certain rude processes of his own towards results aimed at by others  george interrupted falkner almost savagely  well i admit its getting rather late in the evening for pure philosophical inquiry and you are tired practically then it was wise to let them get away before they discovered two things one our exact relations here with these women and the other how many of us were here at present they think we are three or four in possession and with the consent of the women  the dogs  they are paying us the highest compliment they can conceive of by supposing us cleverer scoundrels than themselves you are very unjust ned  if they escape and tell their story  we shall have the rare pleasure of knowing we are better than people believe us and now put those boots away somewhere where we can produce them if necessary as evidence of manuels evening call at present well keep the thing quiet and in the early morning you can find out where they got in and remove any traces they have left it is no use to frighten the women theres no fear of their returning  and if they get away  we can follow in their tracks  if manuel gives the alarm  with his burglarious boots left behind in the house not much goodnight ned go to bed  with these words lee turned on his side and quietly resumed his interrupted slumber falkner did not however follow this sensible advice when he was satisfied that his friend was sleeping he opened the door softly and looked out he did not appear to be listening for his eyes were fixed upon a small pencil of light that stole across the passage from the foot of kates door he watched it until it suddenly disappeared when leaving the door partly open he threw himself on his couch without removing his clothes the slight movement awakened the sleeper who was beginning to feel the accession of fever he moved restlessly  george said falkner softly  yes  where was it we passed that old mission church on the road one dark night and saw the light burning before the figure of the virgin through the window  there was a moment of crushing silence does that mean youre wanting to light the candle again  no  then dont lie there inventing sacrilegious conundrums but go to sleep  nevertheless in the morning his fever was slightly worse mrs hale offering her condolence said i know that you have not been resting well for even after your friend met with that mishap in the hall i heard your voices and kate says your door was open all night you have a little fever too mr falkner  george looked curiously at falkners pale faceit was burning     chapter v   the speed and fury with which clinchs cavalcade swept on in the direction of the mysterious shot left hale no chance for reflection he was conscious of shouting incoherently with the others of urging his horse irresistibly forward of momentarily expecting to meet or overtake something but without any further thought the figures of clinch and rawlins immediately before him shut out the prospect of the narrowing trail once only taking advantage of a sudden halt that threw them confusedly together he managed to ask a question  lost their trackfound it again shouted the ostler as clinch with a cry like the baying of a hound again darted forward their horses were panting and trembling under them the ascent seemed to be growing steeper a singular darkness which even the density of the wood did not sufficiently account for surrounded them but still their leader madly urged them on to hales returning senses they did not seem in a condition to engage a single resolute man who might have ambushed in the woods or beaten them in detail in the narrow gorge but in another instant the reason of their furious haste was manifest spurring his horse ahead clinch dashed out into the open with a cheering shouta shout that as quickly changed to a yell of imprecation they were on the ridge in a blinding snowstorm the road had already vanished under their feet and with it the fresh trail they had so closely followed they stood helplessly on the shore of a trackless white sea blank and spotless of any trace or sign of the fugitives  pears to me boys said the ostler suddenly ranging before them ef youre not kalkilatin on gittin another party to dig ye out yed better be huntin fodder and cover instead of road agents skuse me gentlemen but im responsible for the hosses and this aint no time for circusridin were a matter o six miles from the station in a bee line  back to the trail then said clinch wheeling his horse towards the road they had just quitted  skuse me kernel said the ostler laying his hand on clinchs rein but that way only brings us back the road we kemthe stage roadthree miles further from home that three miles is on the divide and by the time we get there it will be snowed up worse nor this the shortest cut is along the ridge if we hump ourselves we ken cross the divide afore the road is blocked and that skuse me gentlemen is my road  there was no time for discussion the road was already palpably thickening under their feet hales arm was stiffened to his side by a wet clinging snowwreath the figures of the others were almost obliterated and shapeless it was not snowingit was snowballing the huge flakes shaken like enormous feathers out of a vast blueblack cloud commingled and fell in sprays and patches all idea of their former pursuit was forgotten the blind rage and enthusiasm that had possessed them was gone they dashed after their new leader with only an instinct for shelter and succor  they had not ridden long when fortunately as it seemed to hale the character of the storm changed the snow no longer fell in such large flakes nor as heavily a bitter wind succeeded the soft snow began to stiffen and crackle under the horses hoofs they were no longer weighted and encumbered by the drifts upon their bodies the smaller flakes now rustled and rasped against them like sand or bounded from them like hail they seemed to be moving more easily and rapidly their spirits were rising with the stimulus of cold and motion when suddenly their leader halted  its no use boys it cant be done this is no blizzard but a regular two days snifter its no longer meltin but packin and driftin now even if we get over the divide were sure to be blocked up in the pass  it was true to their bitter disappointment they could now see that the snow had not really diminished in quantity but that the now finelypowdered particles were rapidly filling all inequalities of the surface packing closely against projections and swirling in long furrows across the levels they looked with anxiety at their selfconstituted leader  we must make a break to get down in the woods again before its too late he said briefly  but they had already drifted away from the fringe of larches and dwarf pines that marked the sides of the ridge and lower down merged into the dense forest that clothed the flank of the mountain they had lately climbed and it was with the greatest difficulty that they again reached it only to find that at that point it was too precipitous for the descent of their horses benumbed and speechless they continued to toil on opposed to the full fury of the stinging snow and at times obliged to turn their horses to the blast to keep from being blown over the ridge at the end of half an hour the ostler dismounted and beckoning to the others took his horse by the bridle and began the descent when it came to hales turn to dismount he could not help at first recoiling from the prospect before him the trailif it could be so calledwas merely the track or furrow of some fallen tree dragged by accident or design diagonally across the sides of the mountain at times it appeared scarcely a foot in width at other times a mere crumbling gully or a narrow shelf made by the projections of dead boughs and collected debris it seemed perilous for a foot passenger it appeared impossible for a horse nevertheless he had taken a step forward when clinch laid his hand on his arm  youll bring up the rear he said not unkindly ez youre a stranger here wait until we sing out to you  but if i prefer to take the same risks as you all said hale stiffly  you kin said clinch grimly but i reckoned as you wernt familiar with this sort o thing you wouldnt keer by any foolishness o yours to stampede the rocks ahead of us and break down the trail or send down an avalanche on top of us but just ez you like  i will wait then said hale hastily  the rebuke however did him good service it preoccupied his mind so that it remained unaffected by the dizzy depths and enabled him to abandon himself mechanically to the sagacity of his horse who was contented simply to follow the hoofprints of the preceding animal and in a few moments they reached the broader trail without a mishap a discussion regarding their future movements was already taking place the impossibility of regaining the station at the summit was admitted the way down the mountain to the next settlement was still left to them or the adjacent woods if they wished for an encampment the ostler once more assumed authority  skuse me gentlemen but them horses dont take no pasear down the mountain tonight the stageroad aint a mile off and i kalkilate to wait here till the up stage comes shes bound to stop on account of the snow and ive done my dooty when i hand the horses over to the driver  but if she hears of the block up yer and waits at the lower station said rawlins  then ive done my dooty all the same skuse me gentlemen but them ez hez their own horses kin do ez they like  as this clearly pointed to hale he briefly assured his companions that he had no intention of deserting them if i cannot reach eagles court i shall at least keep as near it as possible i suppose any messenger from my house to the summit will learn where i am and why i am delayed  messenger from your house gasped rawlins are you crazy stranger only a bird would get outer eagles now and it would hev to be an eagle at that between your house and the summit the snow must be ten feet by this time to say nothing of the drift in the pass  hale felt it was the truth at any other time he would have worried over this unexpected situation and utter violation of all his traditions he was past that now and even felt a certain relief he knew his family were safe it was enough that they were locked up securely and incapable of interfering with him seemed to enhance his new halfconscious halfshy enjoyment of an adventurous existence  the ostler who had been apparently lost in contemplation of the steep trail he had just descended suddenly clapped his hand to his leg with an ejaculation of gratified astonishment  waal darn my skin ef that aint hennickers slide all the time i heard it was somewhat about here  rawlins briefly explained to hale that a slide was a rude incline for the transit of heavy goods that could not be carried down a trail  and hennickers continued the man aint more nor a mile away ye might try hennickers at a push eh  by a common instinct the whole party looked dubiously at hale whos hennicker he felt compelled to ask  the ostler hesitated and glanced at the others to reply there are folks he said lazily at last ez beleeves that hennicker aint much better nor the crowd were hunting but they dont say it to hennicker we neednt let on what were after  i for one said hale stoutly decidedly object to any concealment of our purpose  it dont follow said rawlins carelessly that hennicker even knows of this yer robbery its his gineral gait we refer to ef yer think it more polite and it makes it more sociable to discuss this matter afore him im agreed  hale means said clinch that it wouldnt be on the square to take and make use of any points we might pick up there agin the road agents  certainly said hale it was not at all what he had meant but he felt singularly relieved at the compromise  and ez i reckon hennicker aint such a fool ez not to know who we are and what were out for continued clinch i reckon there aint any concealment  then its hennickers said the ostler with swift deduction  hennickers it is lead on  the ostler remounted his horse and the others followed the trail presently turned into a broader track that bore some signs of approaching habitations and at the end of five minutes they came upon a clearing it was part of one of the fragmentary mountain terraces and formed by itself a vast niche or bracketed shelf in the hollow flank of the mountain that to hales first glance bore a rude resemblance to eagles court but there was neither meadow nor open field the few acres of ground had been wrested from the forest by axe and fire and unsightly stumps everywhere marked the rude and difficult attempts at cultivation two or three rough buildings of unplaned and unpainted boards connected by rambling sheds stood in the centre of the amphitheatre far from being protected by the encircling rampart it seemed to be the selected arena for the combating elements a whirlwind from the outer abyss continually filled this cave of aeolus with driving snow which however melted as it fell or was quickly whirled away again  a few dogs barked and ran out to meet the cavalcade but there was no other sign of any life disturbed or concerned at their approach  i reckon hennicker aint home or hed hev been on the lookout afore this said the ostler dismounting and rapping on the door  after a silence a female voice unintelligibly to the others apparently had some colloquy with the ostler who returned to the party  must go in through the kitchincant open the door for the wind  leaving their horses in the shed they entered the kitchen which communicated and presently came upon a square room filled with smoke from a fire of green pine logs the doors and windows were tightly fastened the only air came in through the largethroated chimney in voluminous gusts which seemed to make the hollow shell of the apartment swell and expand to the point of bursting despite the stinging of the resinous smoke the temperature was grateful to the benumbed travellers several cushionless armchairs such as were used in barrooms two tables a sideboard half bar and half cupboard and a rockingchair comprised the furniture and a few bear and buffalo skins covered the floor hale sank into one of the armchairs and with a lazy satisfaction partly born of his fatigue and partly from some newlydiscovered appreciative faculty gazed around the room and then at the mistress of the house with whom the others were talking  she was tall gaunt and withered in spite of her evident years her twisted hair was still dark and full and her eyes bright and piercing her complexion and teeth had long since succumbed to the vitiating effects of frontier cookery and her lips were stained with the yellow juice of a brierwood pipe she held in her mouth the ostler had explained their intrusion and veiled their character under the vague epithet of a hunting party and was now evidently describing them personally in his newfound philosophy the fact that the interest of his hostess seemed to be excited only by the names of his companions that he himself was carelessly and even deprecatingly alluded to as the stranger from eagles by the ostler and completely overlooked by the old woman gave him no concern  youll have to talk to zenobia yourself dod rot ef im gine to interfere she knows hennickers ways and if she chooses to take in transients it aint no funeral o mine zeenie you zeenie look yer  a tall lazylooking handsome girl appeared on the threshold of the next room and with a hand on each doorpost slowly swung herself backwards and forwards without entering well maw  the old woman briefly and unalluringly pictured the condition of the travellers  paw aint here began the girl doubtfully andhow dy dick is that you the interruption was caused by her recognition of the ostler and she lounged into the room in spite of a skimp slatternly gown whose straight skirt clung to her lower limbs there was a quaint nymphlike contour to her figure whether from languor illhealth or more probably from a morbid consciousness of her own height she moved with a slightly affected stoop that had become a habit it did not seem ungraceful to hale already attracted by her delicate profile her large dark eyes and a certain weird resemblance she had to some halfdomesticated dryad  thatll do maw she said dismissing her parent with a nod ill talk to dick  as the door closed on the old woman zenobia leaned her hands on the back of a chair and confronted the admiring eyes of dick with a goddesslike indifference  now wots the use of your playin this yer game on me dick wots the good of your ladlin out that hogwash about huntin huntin ill tell yer the huntin youuns hev been at youve been huntin george lee and his boys since an hour before sun up youve been followin a blind trail up to the ridge until the snow got up and hunted you right here youve been whoopin and yellin and circusridin on the roads like ez yer wos comanches and frightening all the women folk within milesthats your huntin youve been climbin down paws old slide at last and makin tracks for here to save the skins of them condemned government horses of the kempany and thats your huntin  to hales surprise a burst of laughter from the party followed this speech he tried to join in but this ridiculous summary of the result of his enthusiastic sense of duty left himthe only earnest believer mortified and embarrassed nor was he the less concerned as he found the girls dark eyes had rested once or twice upon him curiously zenobia laughed too and lazily turning the chair around dropped into it and by this time george lees loungin back in his chyar and smokin his cigyar somewhar in sacramento she added stretching her feet out to the fire and suiting the action to the word with an imaginary cigar between the long fingers of a thin and not overclean hand  we cave zeenie said rawlins when their hilarity had subsided to a more subdued and scarcely less flattering admiration of the unconcerned goddess before them thats about the size of it you kin rake down the pile i forgot youre an old friend of georges  hes a white man said the girl decidedly  ye used to know him continued rawlins  once paw aint in that line now she said simply  there was such a sublime unconsciousness of any moral degradation involved in this allusion that even hale accepted it without a shock she rose presently and going to the little sideboard brought out a number of glasses these she handed to each of the party and then producing a demijohn of whiskey slung it dexterously and gracefully over her arm so that it rested on her elbow like a cradle and going to each one in succession filled their glasses it obliged each one to rise to accept the libation and as hale did so in his turn he met the dark eyes of the girl full on his own there was a pleased curiosity in her glance that made this married man of thirtyfive color as awkwardly as a boy  the tender of refreshment being understood as a tacit recognition of their claims to a larger hospitality all further restraint was removed zenobia resumed her seat and placing her elbow on the arm of her chair and her small round chin in her hand looked thoughtfully in the fire when i say george lees a white man it aint because i know him its his general gait wots he ever done thats underhanded or mean nothin you kant show the poor man hes ever took a picayune from when hes helped himself to a pile its been outer them banks or them express companies that think it mighty fine to bust up themselves and swindle the poor folks o their last cent and nobody talks o huntin them and does he keep their money no he passes it round among the boys that help him and they put it in circulation he dont keep it for himself he aint got fine houses in frisco he dont keep fast horses for show like ez not the critter he did that job withef it was himnone of you boys would have rid and he takes all the risks himself you ken bet your life that every man with him was safe and away afore he turned his back on youuns  he certainly drops a little of his money at draw poker zeenie said clinch laughing he lost five thousand dollars to sheriff kelly last week  well i dont hear of the sheriff huntin him to give it back nor do i reckon kelly handed it over to the express it was taken from i heard you won suthin from him a spell ago i reckon youve been huntin him to find out whar you should return it the laugh was clearly against clinch he was about to make some rallying rejoinder when the young girl suddenly interrupted him ef youre wantin to hunt somebody why dont you take higher game thars that jim harkins go for him and ill join you  harkins exclaimed clinch and hale simultaneously  yes jim harkins do you know him she said glancing from one to the other  one of my friends do said clinch laughing but dont let that stop you  and youover there continued zenobia bending her head and eyes towards hale  the fact isi believe he was my banker said hale with a smile i dont know him personally  then youd better hunt him before he does you  whats he done zeenie asked rawlins keenly enjoying the discomfiture of the others  what she stopped threw her long black braids over her shoulder clasped her knee with her hands and rocking backwards and forwards sublimely unconscious of the apparition of a slim ankle and halfdroppedoff slipper from under her shortened gown continued it mightnt please him she said slyly nodding towards hale  pray dont mind me said hale with unnecessary eagerness  well said zenobia i reckon you all know ned falkner and the excelsior ditch  yes falkners the superintendent of it said rawlins and a square man too thar aint anything mean about him  shake said zenobia extending her hand rawlins shook the proffered hand with eager spontaneousness and the girl resumed hes about ez good ez they make emyou bet well you know ned has put all his money and all his strength and all his sabe and  his good looks added clinch mischievously  into that ditch continued zenobia ignoring the interruption its his mother its his sweetheart its his everything when other chaps of his age was cavortin round frisco and havin high jinks ned was in his ditch wait till the ditch is done he used to say wait till she begins to boom and then you just stand round morn that he got all the boys to put in their last centfor they loved ned and love him now like ez ef he wos a woman  thats so said clinch and rawlins simultaneously and hes worth it  well continued zenobia the ditch didnt boom ez soon ez they kalkilated and then the boys kept gettin poorer and poorer and ned he kept gettin poorer and poorer in everything but his hopefulness and grit then he looks around for more capital and about this time that coyote harkins smelt suthin nice up there and he gits ned to give him control of it and hell lend him his name and fix up a company soon ez he gets control the first thing he does is to say that it wants half a million o money to make it pay and levies an assessment of two hundred dollars a share thats nothin for them rich fellows to pay or pretend to pay but for boys on grub wages it meant only ruin they couldnt pay and had to forfeit their shares for next to nothing and ned made one more desperate attempt to save them and himself by borrowing money on his shares when that hound harkins got wind of it and let it be buzzed around that the ditch is a failure and that he was goin out of it that brought the shares down to nothing as ned couldnt raise a dollar the new company swooped down on his shares for the debts they had put up and left him and the boys to help themselves ned couldnt bear to face the boys that hed helped to ruin and put out and aint been heard from since after harkins had got rid of ned and the boys he manages to pay off that wonderful debt and sells out for a hundred thousand dollars that moneyneds moneyhe sends to sacramento for he dont dare to travel with it himself and is kalkilatin to leave the kentry for some of the boys allow to kill him on sight so ef youre wantin to hunt suthin thars yer chance and you neednt go inter the snow to do it  but surely the law can recover this money said hale indignantly it is as infamous a robbery as he stopped as he caught zenobias eye  ez last nights you were goin to say ill call it more them road agents dont pretend to be your friendbut take yer money and run their risks for ez to the lawthat cant help yer  its a skin game and you might ez well expect to recover a gambling debt from a shortcard sharp explained clinch falkner oughter shot him on sight  or the boys lynched him suggested rawlins  i think said hale more reflectively that in the absence of legal remedy a man of that kind should have been forced under strong physical menace to give up his illgotten gains the money was the primary object and if that could be got without bloodshedwhich seems to me a useless crimeit would be quite as effective of course if there was resistance or retaliation it might be necessary to kill him  he had unconsciously fallen into his old didactic and dogmatic habit of speech and perhaps under the spur of zenobias eyes he had given it some natural emphasis a dead silence followed in which the others regarded him with amused and gratified surprise and it was broken only by zenobia rising and holding out her hand shake  hale raised it gallantly and pressed his lips on the one spotless finger  thats gospel truth and you aint the first white man to say it  indeed laughed hale who was the other  george lee     chapter vi   the laughter that followed was interrupted by a sudden barking of the dogs in the outer clearing zenobia rose lazily and strode to the window it relieved hale of certain embarrassing reflections suggested by her comment  ef it aint that godforsaken fool dick bringing up passengers from the snowbound up stage in the road i reckon ive got suthin to say to that but the later appearance of the apologetic dick with the assurance that the party carried a permission from her father granted at the lower station in view of such an emergency checked her active opposition thats like paw she soliloquized aggrievedly shuttin us up and settin dogs on everybody for a week and then lettin the whole stage service pass through one door and out at another well its his house and his whiskey and they kin take it but they dont get me to help em  they certainly were not a prepossessing or goodnatured acquisition to the party apart from the natural antagonism which on such occasions those in possession always feel towards the newcomer they were strongly inclined to resist the dissatisfied querulousness and aggressive attitude of these fresh applicants for hospitality the most offensive one was a person who appeared to exercise some authority over the others he was loud assuming and dressed with vulgar pretension he quickly disposed himself in the chair vacated by zenobia and called for some liquor  i reckon youll hev to help yourself said rawlins dryly as the summons met with no response there are only two women in the house and i reckon their hands are full already  i call it dd uncivil treatment said the man raising his voice and hennicker had better sing smaller if he dont want his old den pulled down some day he aint any better than men that hev been picked up afore now  you oughter told him that and mebbe hed hev come over with yer returned rawlins hes a mild soft easygoing man is hennicker aint he colonel clinch  the casual mention of clinchs name produced the effect which the speaker probably intended the stranger stared at clinch who apparently oblivious of the conversation was blinking his cold gray eyes at the fire dropping his aggressive tone to mere querulousness the man sought the whiskey demijohn and helped himself and his companions fortified by liquor he returned to the fire  i reckon youve heard about this yer robbery colonel he said addressing clinch with an attempt at easy familiarity  without raising his eyes from the fire clinch briefly assented i reckon  im up yer examining into it for the express  lost much asked rawlins  not so much ez they might hev that fool harkins had a hundred thousand dollars in greenbacks sealed up like an ordinary package of a thousand dollars and gave it to a friend bill guthrie in the bank to pick out some unlikely chap among the passengers to take charge of it to reno he wouldnt trust the express ha ha  the dead oppressive silence that followed his empty laughter made it seem almost artificial rawlins held his breath and looked at clinch hale with the instincts of a refined sensitive man turned hot with the embarrassment clinch should have shown for that gentleman without lifting his eyes from the fire and with no apparent change in his demeanor lazily asked  ye didnt ketch the name o that passenger  naturally no for when guthrie heard what was said agin him he wouldnt give his name until he heard from him  and what was said agin him asked clinch musingly  what would be said agin a man that give up that sum o money like a chaw of tobacco for the asking why there were but three men as far ez we kin hear that did the job and there were four passengers inside armed and the driver and express messenger on the box six were robbed by threethey were a sweetscented lot reckon they must hev felt mighty small for i hear they got up and skedaddled from the station under the pretext of lookin for the robbers he laughed again and the laugh was noisily repeated by his five companions at the other end of the room  hale who had forgotten that the stranger was only echoing a part of his own criticism of eight hours before was on the point of rising with burning cheeks and angry indignation when the lazily uplifted eye of clinch caught his and absolutely held him down with its paralyzing and deadly significance murder itself seemed to look from those cruelly quiet and remorseless gray pupils for a moment he forgot his own rage in this glimpse of clinchs implacable resentment for a moment he felt a thrill of pity for the wretch who had provoked it he remained motionless and fascinated in his chair as the lazy lids closed like a sheath over clinchs eyes again rawlins who had probably received the same glance of warning remained equally still  they havent heard the last of it yet you bet continued the infatuated stranger ive got a little statement here for the newspaper he added drawing some papers from his pocket suthin i just run off in the coach as i came along i reckon itll show things up in a new light its time there should be some change all the cussin thats been usually done hez been by the passengers agin the express and stage companies i propose that the company should do a little cussin themselves see praps you dont mind my readin it to ye its just spicy enough to suit them newspaper chaps  go on said colonel clinch quietly  the man cleared his throat with the preliminary pose of authorship and his five friends to whom the composition was evidently not unfamiliar assumed anticipatory smiles  i call it prize pusillanimous passengers sort of runs easy off the tongue you know  it now appears that the success of the late stagecoach robbery near the summit was largely due to the pusillanimitynot to use a more serious wordhe stopped and looked explanatorily towards clinch yell see in a minit what im gettin at by that pusillanimity of the passengers themselves it now transpires that there were only three robbers who attacked the coach and that although passengers driver and express messenger were fully armed and were double the number of their assailants not a shot was fired we mean no reflections upon the wellknown courage of yuba bill nor the experience and coolness of bracy tibbetts the courteous express messenger both of whom have since confessed to have been more than astonished at the christian and lamblike submission of the insiders amusing stories of some laughable yet sickening incidents of the occasionsuch as grown men kneeling in the road and offering to strip themselves completely if their lives were only spared of one of the passengers hiding under the seat and only being dislodged by pulling his coattails of incredible sums promised and even offers of menial service for the preservation of their wretched carcasesare received with the greatest gusto but we are in possession of facts which may lead to more serious accusations although one of the passengers is said to have lost a large sum of money intrusted to him while attempting with barefaced effrontery to establish a rival carrying business in one of the express companys own coachesi call that a good point he interrupted himself to allow the unrestrained applause of his own party dont you  its just hll said clinch musingly  yet the affair resumed the stranger from his manuscript is locked up in great and suspicious mystery the presence of jackson n stanner esq thats me special detective agent to the company and his staff in town is a guaranty that the mystery will be thoroughly probed hed to put that in to please the company he again deprecatingly explained we are indebted to this gentleman for the facts  the pint you want to make in that article said clinch rising but still directing his face and his conversation to the fire ez far ez i ken see ez that no three men kin back down six unless they be cowards or are willing to be backed down  thats the point what i start from rejoined stanner and work up i leave it to you ef it aint so  i cant say ez i agree with you said the colonel dryly he turned and still without lifting his eyes walked towards the door of the room which zenobia had entered the key was on the inside but clinch gently opened the door removed the key and closing the door again locked it from his side hale and rawlins felt their hearts beat quickly the others followed clinchs slow movements and downcast mien with amused curiosity after locking the other outlet from the room and putting the keys in his pocket clinch returned to the fire for the first time he lifted his eyes the man nearest him shrank back in terror  i am the man he said slowly taking deliberate breath between his sentences who gave up those greenbacks to the robbers i am one of the three passengers you have lampooned in that paper and these gentlemen beside me are the other two he stopped and looked around him you dont believe that three men can back down six well ill show you how it can be done more than that ill show you how one man can do it for by the living gd if you dont hand over that paper ill kill you where you sit ill give you until i count ten if one of you moves he and you are dead menbut you first  before he had finished speaking hale and rawlins had both risen as if in concert with their weapons drawn hale could not tell how or why he had done so but he was equally conscious without knowing why of fixing his eye on one of the other party and that he should in the event of an affray try to kill him he did not attempt to reason he only knew that he should do his best to kill that man and perhaps others  one said clinch lifting his derringer twothree  look here coloneli swear i didnt know it was you comedm it i saysee here stammered stanner with white cheeks not daring to glance for aid to his stupefied party  fourfivesix  wait here he produced the paper and threw it on the floor  pick it up and hand it to me seveneight  stanner hastily scrambled to his feet picked up the paper and handed it to the colonel i was only joking colonel he said with a forced laugh  im glad to hear it but as this joke is in black and white you wouldnt mind saying so in the same fashion take that pen and ink and write as i dictate i certify that i am satisfied that the above statement is a base calumny against the characters of ringwood clinch robert rawlins and john hale passengers and that i do hereby apologize to the same sign it thatll do now let the rest of your party sign as witnesses  they complied without hesitation some seizing the opportunity of treating the affair as a joke suggested a drink  excuse me said clinch quietly but ez this house aint big enough for me and that man and ez ive got business at wild cat station with this paper i think ill go without drinkin he took the keys from his pocket unlocked the doors and taking up his overcoat and rifle turned as if to go  rawlins rose to follow him hale alone hesitated the rapid occurrences of the last half hour gave him no time for reflection but he was by no means satisfied of the legality of the last act he had aided and abetted although he admitted its rude justice and felt he would have done so again a fear of this and an instinct that he might be led into further complications if he continued to identify himself with clinch and rawlins the fact that they had professedly abandoned their quest and that it was really supplanted by the presence of an authorized party whom they had already come in conflict withall this urged him to remain behind on the other hand the apparent desertion of his comrades at the last moment was opposed both to his sense of honor and the liking he had taken to them but he reflected that he had already shown his active partisanship that he could be of little service to them at wild cat station and would be only increasing the distance from his home and above all an impatient longing for independent action finally decided him i think ill stay here he said to clinch unless you want me  clinch cast a swift and meaning glance at the enemy but looked approval keep your eyes skinned and youre good for a dozen of em he said sotto voce and then turned to stanner im going to take this paper to wild cat if you want to communicate with me hereafter you know where i am to be found unlesshe smiled grimlyyoud like to see me outside for a few minutes before i go  it is a matter that concerns the stage company not me said stanner with an attempt to appear at his ease  hale accompanied clinch and rawlins through the kitchen to the stables the ostler dick had already returned to the rescue of the snowbound coach  i shouldnt like to leave many men alone with that crowd said clinch pressing hales hand and i wouldnt have allowed your staying behind ef i didnt know i could bet my pile on you your offerin to stay just puts a clean finish on it look yer hale i didnt cotton much to you at first but ef you ever want a friend call on ringwood clinch  the same here old man said rawlins extending his hand as he appeared from a hurried conference with the old woman at the woodshed and trust to zeenie to give you a hint ef theres anythin underhanded goin on so long  half inclined to resent this implied suggestion of protection yet half pleased at the idea of a confidence with the handsome girl he had seen hale returned to the room a whispered discussion among the party ceased on his entering and an awkward silence followed which hale did not attempt to break as he quietly took his seat again by the fire he was presently confronted by stanner who with an affectation of easy familiarity crossed over to the hearth  the old kernels dd peppery and high toned when hes got a little more than his reglar three fingers o corn juice eh  i must beg you to understand distinctly mr stanner said hale with a return of his habitual precision of statement that i regard any slighting allusion to the gentleman who has just left not only as in exceedingly bad taste coming from you but very offensive to myself if you mean to imply that he was under the influence of liquor it is my duty to undeceive you he was so perfectly in possession of his faculties as to express not only his own but my opinion of your conduct you must also admit that he was discriminating enough to show his objection to your company by leaving it i regret that circumstances do not make it convenient for me to exercise that privilege but if i am obliged to put up with your presence in this room i strongly insist that it is not made unendurable with the addition of your conversation  the effect of this deliberate and passionless declaration was more discomposing to the party than clinchs fury utterly unaccustomed to the ideas and language suddenly confronting them they were unable to determine whether it was the real expression of the speaker or whether it was a vague badinage or affectation to which any reply would involve them in ridicule in a country terrorized by practical joking they did not doubt but that this was a new form of hoaxing calculated to provoke some response that would constitute them as victims the immediate effect upon them was that complete silence in regard to himself that hale desired they drew together again and conversed in whispers while hale with his eyes fixed on the fire gave himself up to somewhat late and useless reflection  he could scarcely realize his position for however he might look at it within a space of twelve hours he had not only changed some of his most cherished opinions but he had acted in accordance with that change in a way that made it seem almost impossible for him ever to recant in the interests of law and order he had engaged in an unlawful and disorderly pursuit of criminals and had actually come in conflict not with the criminals but with the only party apparently authorized to pursue them more than that he was finding himself committed to a certain sympathy with the criminals twentyfour hours ago if anyone had told him that he would have condoned an illegal act for its abstract justice or assisted to commit an illegal act for the same purpose he would have felt himself insulted that he knew he would not now feel it as an insult perplexed him still more in these circumstances the fact that he was separated from his family and as it were from all his past life and traditions by a chance accident did not disturb him greatly indeed he was for the first time a little doubtful of their probable criticism on his inconsistency and was by no means in a hurry to subject himself to it  lifting his eyes he was suddenly aware that the door leading to the kitchen was slowly opening he had thought he heard it creak once or twice during his deliberate reply to stanner it was evidently moving now so as to attract his attention without disturbing the others it presently opened sufficiently wide to show the face of zeenie who with a gesture of caution towards his companions beckoned him to join her he rose carelessly as if going out and putting on his hat entered the kitchen as the retreating figure of the young girl glided lightly towards the stables she ascended a few open steps as if to a hayloft but stopped before a low door pushing it open she preceded him into a small room apparently under the roof which scarcely allowed her to stand upright by the light of a stable lantern hanging from a beam he saw that though poorly furnished it bore some evidence of feminine taste and habitation motioning to the only chair she seated herself on the edge of the bed with her hands clasping her knees in her familiar attitude her face bore traces of recent agitation and her eyes were shining with tears by the closer light of the lantern he was surprised to find it was from laughter  i reckoned youd be right lonely down there with that stanner crowd particklerly after that little speech o yourn so i sez to maw id get you up yer for a spell maw and i heerd you exhort em maw allowed you woz talkin a furrin tongue all along but isakes alivei hed to hump myself to keep from bustin into a yell when yer jist drawed them websterunabridged sentences on em she stopped and rocked backwards and forwards with a laugh that subdued by the proximity of the roof and the fear of being overheard was by no means unmusical ill tell ye whot got me though that part commencing suckamstances over which ive no controul  oh come i didnt say that interrupted hale laughing  dont make it convenient for me to exercise the privilege of kickin yer out to that extent she continued but if i cannot dispense with your room the least i can say is that its a dd sight better than your companyor suthin like that and then the way you minded your stops and let your voice rise and fall just ez easy ez if you wos a first reader in large type why the kernel wasnt nowhere his cussin didnt come within a mile o yourn that stanner jist turned yaller  im afraid you are laughing at me said hale not knowing whether to be pleased or vexed at the girls amusement  i reckon im the only one that dare do it then said the girl simply the kernel sez the way you turned round after hed done his cussin and said yer believed youd stay and take the responsibility of the whole thingand did in that kam soft didanybodyspeaktome stylewas the neatest thing hed seen yet no maw says i aint much on manners but i know a man when i see him  for an instant hale gave himself up to the delicious flattery of unexpected unintended and apparently uninterested compliment becoming at last a little embarrassed under the frank curiosity of the girls dark eyes he changed the subject  do you always come up here through the stables he asked glancing round the room which was evidently her own  i reckon she answered half abstractedly theres a ladder down thar to maws roompointing to a trapdoor beside the broad chimney that served as a wallbut its handier the other way and nearer the bosses if you want to get away quick  this palpable suggestionborne out by what he remembered of the other domestic detailsthat the house had been planned with reference to sudden foray or escape reawakened his former uneasy reflections zeenie who had been watching his face added its no slouch when bar or painters hang round nights and stampede the stock to be able to swing yourself on to a boss whenever you hear a row going on outside  do you mean that you  paw used and i do now sense ive come into the room she pointed to a nondescript garment half cloak half habit hanging on the wall ive been outer bed and on pitchpines back as far ez the trail five minutes arter i heard the first bellow  hale regarded her with undisguised astonishment there was nothing at all amazonian or horsey in her manners nor was there even the robust physical contour that might have been developed through such experiences on the contrary she seemed to be lazily effeminate in body and mind heedless of his critical survey of her she beckoned him to draw his chair nearer and looking into his eyes said  whatever possessed you to take to huntin men  hale was staggered by the question but nevertheless endeavored to explain but he was surprised to find that his explanation appeared stilted even to himself and he could not doubt was utterly incomprehensible to the girl she nodded her head however and continued  then you havent anythin agin george  i dont know george said hale smiling my proceeding was against the highwayman  well he was the highwayman  i mean it was the principle i objected toa principle that i consider highly dangerous  well he is the principal for the others only helped i reckon said zeenie with a sigh and i reckon he is dangerous  hale saw it was useless to explain the girl continued  what made you stay here instead of going on with the kernel there was suthin else besides your wanting to make that stanner take water what is it  a light sense of the propinquity of beauty of her confidence of their isolation of the eloquence of her dark eyes at first tempted hale to a reply of simple gallantry a graver consideration of the same circumstances froze it upon his lips  i dont know he returned awkwardly  well ill tell you she said you didnt cotton to the kernel and rawlins much more than you did to stanner they aint your kind  in his embarrassment hale blundered upon the thought he had honorably avoided  suppose he said with a constrained laugh i had stayed to see you  i reckon i aint your kind neither she replied promptly there was a momentary pause when she rose and walked to the chimney its very quiet down there she said stooping and listening over the roughlyboarded floor that formed the ceiling of the room below i wonder whats going on  in the belief that this was a delicate hint for his return to the party he had left hale rose but the girl passed him hurriedly and opening the door cast a quick glance into the stable beyond  just as i reckonedthe horses are gone too theyve skedaddled she said blankly  hale did not reply in his embarrassment a moment ago the idea of taking an equally sudden departure had flashed upon him should he take this as a justification of that impulse or how he stood irresolutely gazing at the girl who turned and began to descend the stairs silently he followed when they reached the lower room they found it as they had expecteddeserted  i hope i didnt drive them away said hale with an uneasy look at the troubled face of the girl for i really had an idea of going myself a moment ago  she remained silent gazing out of the window then turning with a slight shrug of her shoulders said half defiantly whats the use now oh maw the stanner crowd has vamosed the ranch and this yer stranger kalkilates to stay     chapter vii   a week had passed at eagles courta week of mingled clouds and sunshine by day of rain over the green plateau and snow on the mountain by night each morning had brought its fresh greenness to the wintergirt domain and a fresh coat of dazzling white to the barrier that separated its dwellers from the world beyond there was little change in the encompassing wall of their prison if anything the snowy circle round them seemed to have drawn its lines nearer day by day the immediate result of this restricted limit had been to confine the range of cattle to the meadows nearer the house and at a safe distance from the fringe of wilderness now invaded by the prowling tread of predatory animals  nevertheless the two figures lounging on the slope at sunset gave very little indication of any serious quality in the situation indeed so far as appearances were concerned kate who was returning from an afternoon stroll with falkner exhibited with feminine inconsistency a decided return to the world of fashion and conventionality apparently just as she was effectually excluded from it she had not only discarded her white dress as a concession to the practical evidence of the surrounding winter but she had also brought out a feather hat and sable muff which had once graced a fashionable suburb of boston even falkner had exchanged his slouch hat and picturesque serape for a beaver overcoat and fur cap of hales which had been pressed upon him by kate under the excuse of the exigencies of the season within a stones throw of the thicket turbulent with the savage forces of nature they walked with the abstraction of people hearing only their own voices in the face of the solemn peaks clothed with white austerity they talked gravely of dress  i dont mean to say said kate demurely that youre to give up the serape entirely you can wear it on rainy nights and when you ride over here from your friends house to spend the eveningfor the sake of old times she added with an unconscious air of referring to an already antiquated friendship but you must admit its a little too gorgeous and theatrical for the sunlight of day and the public highway  but why should that make it wrong if the experience of a people has shown it to be a garment best fitted for their wants and requirements said falkner argumentatively  but you are not one of those people said kate and that makes all the difference you look differently and act differently so that there is something irreconcilable between your clothes and you that makes you look odd  and to look odd according to your civilized prejudices is to be wrong said falkner bitterly  it is to seem different from what one really iswhich is wrong now you are a mining superintendent you tell me then you dont want to look like a spanish brigand as you do in that serape i am sure if you had ridden up to a stagecoach while i was in it id have handed you my watch and purse without a word there you are not offended she added with a laugh which did not however conceal a certain earnestness i suppose i ought to have said i would have given it gladly to such a romantic figure and perhaps have got out and danced a saraband or bolero with youif that is the thing to do nowadays well she said after a dangerous pause consider that ive said it  he had been walking a little before her with his face turned towards the distant mountain suddenly he stopped and faced her you would have given enough of your time to the highwayman miss scott as would have enabled you to identify him for the policeand no more like your brother you would have been willing to sacrifice yourself for the benefit of the laws of civilization and good order  if a denial to this assertion could have been expressed without the use of speech it was certainly transparent in the face and eyes of the young girl at that moment if falkner had been less selfconscious he would have seen it plainly but kate only buried her face in her lifted muff slightly raised her pretty shoulders and dropping her tremulous eyelids walked on it seems a pity she said after a pause that we cannot preserve our own miserable existence without taking something from otherssometimes even a life he started and its horrid to have to remind you that you have yet to kill something for the invalids supper she continued i saw a hare in the field yonder  you mean that jackass rabbit he said abstractedly  what you please its a pity you didnt take your gun instead of your rifle  i brought the rifle for protection  and a shot gun is only aggressive i suppose  falkner looked at her for a moment and then as the hare suddenly started across the open a hundred yards away brought the rifle to his shoulder a long intervalas it seemed to kateelapsed the animal appeared to be already safely out of range when the rifle suddenly cracked the hare bounded in the air like a ball and dropped motionless the girl looked at the marksman in undisguised admiration is it quite dead she said timidly  it never knew what struck it  it certainly looks less brutal than shooting it with a shot gun as john does and then not killing it outright said kate i hate what is called sport and sportsmen but a rifle seems  what said falkner  moregentlemanly  she had raised her pretty head in the air and with her hand shading her eyes was looking around the clear ether and said meditatively i wonderno matter  what is it  oh nothing  it is something said falkner with an amused smile reloading his rifle  well you once promised me an eagles feather for my hat isnt that thing an eagle  i am afraid its only a hawk  well that will do shoot that  her eyes were sparkling falkner withdrew his own with a slight smile and raised his rifle with provoking deliberation  are you quite sure its what you want he asked demurely  yesquick  nevertheless it was some minutes before the rifle cracked again the wheeling bird suddenly struck the wind with its wings aslant and then fell like a plummet at a distance which showed the difficulty of the feat falkner started from her side before the bird reached the ground he returned to her after a lapse of a few moments bearing a trailing wing in his hand you shall make your choice he said gayly  are you sure it was killed outright  head shot off said falkner briefly  and besides the fall would have killed it said kate conclusively its lovely i suppose they call you a very good shot  theywho  oh the people you knowyour friends and their sisters  george shoots better than i do and has had more experience ive seen him do that with a pistol of course not such a long shot but a more difficult one  kate did not reply but her face showed a conviction that as an artistic and gentlemanly performance it was probably inferior to the one she had witnessed falkner who had picked up the hare also again took his place by her side as they turned towards the house  do you remember the day you came when we were walking here you pointed out that rock on the mountain where the poor animals had taken refuge from the snow said kate suddenly  yes answered falkner they seem to have diminished i am afraid you were right they have either eaten each other or escaped let us hope the latter  i looked at them with a glass every day said kate and theyve got down to only four theres a bear and that shabby overgrown cat you call a california lion and a wolf and a creature like a fox or a squirrel  its a pity theyre not all of a kind said falkner  why  thered be nothing to keep them from being comfortable together  on the contrary i should think it would be simply awful to be shut up entirely with ones own kind  then you believe it is possible for them with their different natures and habits to be happy together said falkner with sudden earnestness  i believe said kate hurriedly that the bear and the lion find the fox and the wolf very amusing and that the fox and the wolf  well said falkner stopping short  well the fox and the wolf will carry away a much better opinion of the lion and bear than they had before  they had reached the house by this time and for some occult reason kate did not immediately enter the parlor where she had left her sister and the invalid who had already been promoted to a sofa and a cushion by the window but proceeded directly to her own room as a manoeuvre to avoid meeting mrs hale it was scarcely necessary for that lady was already in advance of her on the staircase as if she had left the parlor for a moment before they entered the house falkner too would have preferred the company of his own thoughts but lee apparently the only unpreoccupied allpervading and boyishly alert spirit in the party hailed him from within and obliged him to present himself on the threshold of the parlor with the hare and hawks wing he was still carrying eying the latter with affected concern lee said gravely of course i can eat it ned and i dare say its the best part of the fowl and the hare isnt more than enough for the women but i had no idea we were so reduced three hours and a half gunning and only one hare and a hawks wing its terrible  perceiving that his friend was alone falkner dropped his burden in the hall and strode rapidly to his side look here george we must i must leave this place at once its no use talking i can stand this sort of thing no longer  nor can i with the door open shut it and say what you want quick before mrs hale comes back have you found a trail  no no thats not what i mean  well it strikes me it ought to be if you expect to get away have you proposed to beacon street and she thinks it rather premature on a weeks acquaintance  no but  but you will you mean dont just yet  but i cannot live this perpetual lie  that depends i dont know how youre lying when im not with you if youre walking round with that girl singing hymns and talking of your class in sundayschool or if youre insinuating that youre a millionaire and think of buying the place for a summer hotel i should say youd better quit that kind of lying but on the other hand i dont see the necessity of your dancing round here with a shot gun and yelling for harkinss blood or counting that package of greenbacks in the lap of miss scott to be truthful it seems to me there ought to be something between the two  but george dont you thinkyou are on such good terms with mrs hale and her motherthat you might tell them the whole story that is tell it in your own way they will hear anything from you and believe it  thank you but suppose i dont believe in lying either  you know what i mean you have a way dn it of making everything seem like a matter of course and the most natural thing going  well suppose i did are you prepared for the worst  falkner was silent for a moment and then replied yes anything would be better than this suspense  i dont agree with you then you would be willing to have them forgive us  i dont understand you  i mean that their forgiveness would be the worst thing that could happen look here ned stop a moment listen at that door mrs hale has the tread of an angel with the pervading capacity of a cat now listen i dont pretend to be in love with anybody here but if i were i should hardly take advantage of a womans helplessness and solitude with a sensational story about myself its not giving her a fair show you know she wont turn you out of the house  no said falkner reddening but i should expect to go at once and that would be my only excuse for telling her  go where in your preoccupation with that girl you havent even found the trail by which manuel escaped do you intend to camp outside the house and make eyes at her when she comes to the window  because you think nothing of flirting with mrs hale said falkner bitterly you care little  my dear ned said lee the fact that mrs hale has a husband and knows that she cant marry me puts us on equal terms nothing that she could learn about me hereafter would make a flirtation with me any less wrong than it would be now or make her seem more a victim can you say the same of yourself and that puritan girl  but you did not advise me to keep aloof from her on the contrary you  i thought you might make the best of the situation and pay her some attention because you could not go any further  you thought i was utterly heartless and selfish like  ned  falkner walked rapidly to the fireplace and returned  forgive me georgeim a fooland an ungrateful one  lee did not reply at once although he took and retained the hand falkner had impulsively extended promise me he said slowly after a pause that you will say nothing yet to either of these women i ask it for your own sake and this girls not for mine if on the contrary you are tempted to do so from any quixotic idea of honor remember that you will only precipitate something that will oblige you from that same sense of honor to separate from the girl forever  i dont understand  enough said he with a quick return of his old reckless gayety shootoffhismouththe beardless boy chief of the sierrashas spoken let the pale face with the black moustache ponder and beware how he talks hereafter to the rippling cochituate water go  nevertheless as soon as the door had closed upon falkner lees smile vanished with his colorless face turned to the fading light at the window the hollows in his temples and the lines in the corners of his eyes seemed to have grown more profound he remained motionless and absorbed in thought so deep that the light rustle of a skirt that would at other times have thrilled his sensitive ear passed unheeded at last throwing off his reverie with the full and unrestrained sigh of a man who believes himself alone he was startled by the soft laugh of mrs hale who had entered the room unperceived  dear me how portentous really i almost feel as if i were interrupting a teteatete between yourself and some old flame i havent heard anything so oldfashioned and conservative as that sigh since i have been in california i thought you never had any past out here  fortunately his face was between her and the light and the unmistakable expression of annoyance and impatience which was passed over it was spared her there was however still enough dissonance in his manner to affect her quick feminine sense and when she drew nearer to him it was with a certain maidenlike timidity  you are not worse mr lee i hope you have not overexerted yourself  theres little chance of that with one legif not in the grave at least mummified with bandages he replied with a bitterness new to him  shall i loosen them perhaps they are too tight there is nothing so irritating to one as the sensation of being tightly bound  the light touch of her hand upon the rug that covered his knees the thoughtful tenderness of the blueveined lids and the delicate atmosphere that seemed to surround her like a perfume cleared his face of its shadow and brought back the reckless fire into his blue eyes  i suppose im intolerant of all bonds he said looking at her intently in others as well as myself  whether or not she detected any double meaning in his words she was obliged to accept the challenge of his direct gaze and raising her eyes to his drew back a little from him with a slight increase of color i was afraid you had heard bad news just now  what would you call bad news asked lee clasping his hands behind his head and leaning back on the sofa but without withdrawing his eyes from her face  oh any news that would interrupt your convalescence or break up our little family party said mrs hale you have been getting on so well that really it would seem cruel to have anything interfere with our life of forgetting and being forgotten but she added with apprehensive quickness has anything happened is there really any news fromfrom the trails yesterday mr falkner said the snow had recommenced in the pass has he seen anything noticed anything different  she looked so very pretty with the rare genuine and youthful excitement that transfigured her wearied and wearying regularity of feature that lee contented himself with drinking in her prettiness as he would have inhaled the perfume of some flower  why do you look at me so mr lee she asked with a slight smile i believe something has happened mr falkner has brought you some intelligence  he has certainly found out something i did not foresee  and that troubles you  it does  is it a secret  no  then i suppose you will tell it to me at dinner she said with a little tone of relief  i am afraid if i tell it at all i must tell it now he said glancing at the door  you must do as you think best she said coldly as it seems to be a secret after all she hesitated kate is dressing and will not be down for some time  so much the better for im afraid that ned has made a poor return to your hospitality by falling in love with her  impossible he has known her for scarcely a week  i am afraid we wont agree as to the length of time necessary to appreciate and love a woman i think it can be done in seven days and four hours the exact time we have been here  yes but as kate was not in when you arrived and did not come until later you must take off at least one hour said mrs hale gayly  ned can i shall not abate a second  but are you not mistaken in his feelings she continued hurriedly he certainly has not said anything to her  that is his last hold on honor and reason and to preserve that little intact he wants to run away at once  but that would be very silly  do you think so he said looking at her fixedly  why not she asked in her turn but rather faintly  ill tell you why he said lowering his voice with a certain intensity of passion unlike his usual boyish lightheartedness think of a man whose life has been one of alternate hardness and aggression of savage disappointment and equally savage successes who has known no other relaxation than dissipation and extravagance a man to whom the idea of the domestic hearth and family ties only meant weakness effeminacy orworse who had looked for loyalty and devotion only in the man who battled for him at his right hand in danger or shared his privations and sufferings think of such a man and imagine that an accident has suddenly placed him in an atmosphere of purity gentleness and peace surrounded him by the refinements of a higher life than he had ever known and that he found himself as in a dream on terms of equality with a pure woman who had never known any other life and yet would understand and pity his imagine his loving her imagine that the first effect of that love was to show him his own inferiority and the immeasurable gulf that lay between his life and hers would he not fly rather than brave the disgrace of her awakening to the truth would he not fly rather than accept even the pity that might tempt her to a sacrifice  butis mr falkner all that  nothing of the kind i assure you said he demurely but thats the way a man in love feels  really mr falkner should get you to plead his cause with kate said mrs hale with a faint laugh  i need all my persuasive powers in that way for myself said lee boldly  mrs hale rose i think i hear kate coming she said nevertheless she did not move away it is kate coming she added hurriedly stooping to pick up her workbasket which had slipped with lees hand from her own  it was kate who at once flew to her sisters assistance lee deploring from the sofa his own utter inability to aid her its all my fault too he said to kate but looking at mrs hale it seems i have a faculty of upsetting existing arrangements without the power of improving them or even putting them back in their places what shall i do i am willing to hold any number of skeins or rewind any quantity of spools i am even willing to forgive ned for spending the whole day with you and only bringing me the wing of a hawk for supper  that was all my folly mr lee said kate with swift mendacity he was all the time looking after something for you when i begged him to shoot a bird to get a feather for my hat and that wing is so pretty  it is a pity that mere beauty is not edible said lee gravely and that if the worst comes to the worst here you would probably prefer me to ned and his moustachios merely because ive been tied by the leg to this sofa and slowly fattened like a strasbourg goose  nevertheless his badinage failed somehow to amuse kate and she presently excused herself to rejoin her sister who had already slipped from the room for the first time during their enforced seclusion a sense of restraint and uneasiness affected mrs hale her sister and falkner at dinner the latter addressed himself to mrs scott almost entirely mrs hale was fain to bestow an exceptional and marked tenderness on her little daughter minnie who however by some occult childish instinct insisted upon sharing it with leeher great friendto mrs hales uneasy consciousness nor was lee slow to profit by the childs suggestion but responded with certain vicarious caresses that increased the mothers embarrassment that evening they retired early but in the intervals of a restless night kate was aware from the sound of voices in the opposite room that the friends were equally wakeful  a morning of bright sunshine and soft warm air did not however bring any change to their new and constrained relations it only seemed to offer a reason for falkner to leave the house very early for his daily rounds and gave lee that occasion for unaided exercise with an extempore crutch on the veranda which allowed mrs hale to pursue her manifold duties without the necessity of keeping him company kate also as if to avoid an accidental meeting with falkner had remained at home with her sister with one exception they did not make their guests the subject of their usual playful comments nor after the fashion of their sex quote their ideas and opinions that exception was made by mrs hale  you have had no difference with mr falkner she said carelessly  no said kate quickly why  i only thought he seemed rather put out at dinner last night and you didnt propose to go and meet him today  he must be bored with my company at times i dare say said kate with an indifference quite inconsistent with her rising color i shouldnt wonder if he was a little vexed with mr lees chaffing him about his sport yesterday and probably intends to go further today and bring home larger game i think mr lee very amusing always but i sometimes fancy he lacks feeling  feeling you dont know him kate said mrs hale quickly she stopped herself but with a halfsmiling recollection in her dropped eyelids  well he doesnt look very amiable now stamping up and down the veranda perhaps youd better go and soothe him  im really so busy just now said mrs hale with sudden and inconsequent energy things have got dreadfully behind in the last week you had better go kate and make him sit down or hell be overdoing it these men never know any mediumin anything  contrary to kates expectation falkner returned earlier than usual and taking the invalids arm supported him in a more ambitious walk along the terrace before the house they were apparently absorbed in conversation but the two women who observed them from the window could not help noticing the almost feminine tenderness of falkners manner towards his wounded friend and the thoughtful tenderness of his ministering care  i wonder said mrs hale following them with softly appreciative eyes if women are capable of as disinterested friendship as men i never saw anything like the devotion of these two creatures look if mr falkner hasnt got his arm round mr lees waist and lee with his own arm over falkners neck is looking up in his eyes i declare kate it almost seems an indiscretion to look at them  kate however to mrs hales indignation threw her pretty head back and sniffed the air contemptuously i really dont see anything but some absurd sentimentalism of their own or some mannish wickedness theyre concocting by themselves i am by no means certain josephine that lees influence over that young man is the best thing for him  on the contrary lees influence seems the only thing that checks his waywardness said mrs hale quickly im sure if anyone makes sacrifices it is lee i shouldnt wonder that even now he is making some concession to falkner and all those caressing ways of your friend are for a purpose theyre not much different from us dear  well i wouldnt stand there and let them see me looking at them as if i couldnt bear them out of my sight for a moment said kate whisking herself out of the room theyre conceited enough heaven knows already  that evening at dinner however the two men exhibited no trace of the restraint or uneasiness of the previous day if they were less impulsive and exuberant they were still frank and interested and if the term could be used in connection with men apparently trained to neither selfcontrol nor repose there was a certain gentle dignity in their manner which for the time had the effect of lifting them a little above the social level of their entertainers for even with all their predisposition to the strangers kate and mrs hale had always retained a conscious attitude of gentle condescension and superiority towards theman attitude not inconsistent with a stronger feeling nor altogether unprovocative of it yet this evening they found themselves impressed with something more than an equality in the men who had amused and interested them and they were perhaps a little more critical and doubtful of their own power mrs hales little girl who had appreciated only the seriousness of the situation had made her own application of it are you dowin away from aunt kate and mamma she asked in an interval of silence  how else can i get you the red snow we saw at sunset the other day on the peak yonder said lee gayly ill have to get up some morning very early and catch it when it comes at sunrise  what is this wonderful snow minnie that you are tormenting mr lee for asked mrs hale  oh its a fairy snow that he told me all about it only comes when the sun comes up and goes down and if you catch ever so little of it in your hand it makes all you fink you want come true wouldnt that be nice but to the childs astonishment her little circle of auditors even while assenting sighed  the red snow was there plain enough the next morning before the valley was warm with light and while minnie her mother and aunt kate were still peacefully sleeping and mr lee had kept his word and was evidently seeking it for he and falkner were already urging their horses through the pass with their faces towards and lit up by its glow     chapter viii   kate was stirring early but not as early as her sister who met her on the threshold of her room her face was quite pale and she held a letter in her hand what does this mean kate  what is the matter asked kate her own color fading from her cheek  they are gonewith their horses left before day and left this  she handed kate an open letter the girl took it hurriedly and read  when you get this we shall be no more perhaps not even as much ned found the trail yesterday and we are taking the first advantage of it before day we dared not trust ourselves to say goodby last evening we were too cowardly to face you this morning we must go as we came without warning but not without regret we leave a package and a letter for your husband it is not only our poor return for your gentleness and hospitality but since it was accidentally the means of giving us the pleasure of your society we beg you to keep it in safety until his return we kiss your mothers hands ned wants to say something more but time presses and i only allow him to send his love to minnie and to tell her that he is trying to find the red snow  george lee   but he is not fit to travel said mrs hale and the trailit may not be passable  it was passable the day before yesterday said kate drearily for i discovered it and went as far as the buckeyes  then it was you who told them about it said mrs hale reproachfully  no said kate indignantly of course i didnt she stopped and reading the significance of her speech in the glistening eyes of her sister she blushed josephine kissed her and said  it was treating us like children kate but we must make them pay for it hereafter for that package and letter to john means something and we shall probably see them before long i wonder what the letter is about and what is in the package  probably one of mr lees jokes he is quite capable of turning the whole thing into ridicule i dare say he considers his visit here a prolonged jest  with his poor leg kate you are as unfair to him as you were to falkner when they first came  kate however kept her dark eyebrows knitted in a piquant frown  to think of his intimating what he would allow falkner to say and yet you believe he has no evil influence over the young man  mrs hale laughed where are you going so fast kate she called mischievously as the young lady flounced out of the room  where why to tidy johns room he may be coming at any moment now or do you want to do it yourself  no no returned mrs hale hurriedly you do it ill look in a little later on  she turned away with a sigh the sun was shining brilliantly outside through the halfopen blinds its long shafts seemed to be searching the house for the lost guests and making the hollow shell appear doubly empty what a contrast to the dear dark days of mysterious seclusion and delicious security lit by lees laughter and the sparkling hearth which had passed so quickly the forgotten outer world seemed to have returned to the house through those open windows and awakened its dwellers from a dream  the morning seemed interminable and it was past noon while they were deep in a sympathetic conference with mrs scott who had drawn a pathetic wordpicture of the two friends perishing in the snowdrift without flannels brandy smellingsalts or jelly which they had forgotten when they were startled by the loud barking of spot on the lawn before the house the women looked hurriedly at each other  they have returned said mrs hale  kate ran to the window a horseman was approaching the house a single glance showed her that it was neither falkner lee nor hale but a stranger  perhaps he brings some news of them said mrs scott quickly so complete had been their preoccupation with the loss of their guests that they could not yet conceive of anything that did not pertain to it  the stranger who was at once ushered into the parlor was evidently disconcerted by the presence of the three women  i reckoned to see john hale yer he began awkwardly  a slight look of disappointment passed over their faces he has not yet returned said mrs hale briefly  sho i wanter know hes hed time to do it i reckon said the stranger  i suppose he hasnt been able to get over from the summit returned mrs hale the trail is closed  it aint now for i kem over it this mornin myself  you didntmeetanyone asked mrs hale timidly with a glance at the others  no  a long silence ensued the unfortunate visitor plainly perceived an evident abatement of interest in himself yet he still struggled politely to say something then i reckon you know what kept hale away he said dubiously  oh certainlythe stage robbery  i wish id known that said the stranger reflectively for i ez good ez rode over jist to tell it to ye ye see john hale he sent a note to ye splainin matters by a gentleman but the road agents tackled that man and left him for dead in the road  yes said mrs hale impatiently  luckily he didnt die but kem to and managed to crawl inter the brush whar i found him when i was lookin for stock and brought him to my house  you found him your house interrupted mrs hale  inter my house continued the man doggedly im thompson of thompsons pass over yon mebbe it aint much of a house but i brought him thar well ez he couldnt find the note that hale had guv him and like ez not the road agents had gone through him and got it ez soon ez the weather let up i made a break over yer to tell ye  you say mr lee came to your house repeated mrs hale and is there now  not much said the man grimly and i never said lee was thar i mean that bilson waz shot by lee and kem  certainly josephine said kate suddenly stepping between her sister and thompson and turning upon her a white face and eyes of silencing significance certainlydont you rememberthats the story we got from the chinaman you know only muddled go on sir she continued turning to thompson calmly you say that the man who brought the note from my brother was shot by lee  and another fellow they call falkner yes thats about the size of it  thank you its nearly the same story that we heard but you have had a long ride mr thompson let me offer you a glass of whiskey in the diningroom this way please  the door closed upon them none too soon for mrs hale already felt the room whirling around her and sank back into her chair with a hysterical laugh old mrs scott did not move from her seat but with her eyes fixed on the door impatiently waited kates return neither spoke but each felt that the young untried girl was equal to the emergency and would get at the truth  the sound of thompsons feet in the hall and the closing of the front door was followed by kates reappearance her face was still pale but calm  well said the two women in a breath  well returned kate slowly mr lee and mr falkner were undoubtedly the two men who took the paper from johns messenger and brought it here  you are sure said mrs scott  there can be no mistake mother  then said mrs scott with triumphant feminine logic i dont want anything more to satisfy me that they are perfectly innocent  more convincing than the most perfect masculine deduction this single expression of their common nature sent a thrill of sympathy and understanding through each they cried for a few moments on each others shoulders to think said mrs scott what that poor boy must have suffered to have been obliged to dothat totobilsonisnt that the creatures name i suppose we ought to send over there and inquire after him with some chicken and jelly kate its only common humanity and we must be just my dear for even if he shot mr lee and provoked the poor boy to shoot him he may have thought it his duty and then it will avert suspicions  to think murmured mrs hale what they must have gone through while they were heremomentarily expecting john to come and yet keeping up such a light heart  i believe if they had stayed any longer they would have told us everything said mrs scott  both the younger women were silent kate was thinking of falkners significant speech as they neared the house on their last walk josephine was recalling the remorseful picture drawn by lee which she knew was his own portrait suddenly she started  but john will be here soon what are we to tell him and then that package and that letter  dont be in a hurry to tell him anything at present my child said mrs scott gently it is unfortunate this mr thompson called here but we are not obliged to understand what he says now about johns message or to connect our visitors with his story im sure kate i should have treated them exactly as we did if they had come without any message from john so i do not know why we should lay any stress on that or even speak of it the simple fact is that we have opened our house to two strangers in distress your husband continued mr hales motherinlaw does not require to know more as to the letter and package we will keep that for further consideration it cannot be of much importance or they would have spoken of it before it is probably some trifling present as a return for your hospitality i should use no indecorous haste in having it opened  the two women kissed mrs scott with a feeling of relief and fell back into the monotony of their household duties it is to be feared however that the absence of their outlawed guests was nearly as dangerous as their presence in the opportunity it afforded for uninterrupted and imaginative reflection both kate and josephine were at first shocked and wounded by the discovery of the real character of the two men with whom they had associated so familiarly but it was no disparagement to their sense of propriety to say that the shock did not last long and was accompanied with the fascination of danger this was succeeded by a consciousness of the delicate flattery implied in their indirect influence over the men who had undoubtedly risked their lives for the sake of remaining with them the best woman is not above being touched by the effect of her power over the worst man and kate at first allowed herself to think of falkner in that light but if in her later reflections he suffered as a heroic experience to be forgotten he gained something as an actual man to be remembered now that the proposed rides from his friends house were a part of the illusion would he ever dare to visit them again would she dare to see him she held her breath with a sudden pain of parting that was new to her she tried to think of something else to pick up the scattered threads of her life before that eventful day but in vain that one week had filled the place with implacable memories or more terrible as it seemed to her and her sister they had both lost their feeble alien hold upon eagles court in the sudden presence of the real genii of these solitudes and henceforth they alone would be the strangers there they scarcely dared to confess it to each other but this return to the dazzling sunlight and cloudless skies of the past appeared to them to be the one unreal experience they had never known the true wild flavor of their home except in that week of delicious isolation without breathing it aloud they longed for some vague denoument to this experience that should take them from eagles court forever  it was noon the next day when the little household beheld the last shred of their illusion vanish like the melting snow in the strong sunlight of john hales return he was accompanied by colonel clinch and rawlins two strangers to the women was it fancy or the avenging spirit of their absent companions but he too looked a stranger and as the little cavalcade wound its way up the slope he appeared to sit his horse and wear his hat with a certain slouch and absence of his usual restraint that strangely shocked them even the old halfcondescending halfpunctilious gallantry of his greeting of his wife and family was changed as he introduced his companions with a mingling of familiarity and shyness that was new to him did mrs hale regret it or feel a sense of relief in the absence of his usual seignorial formality she only knew that she was grateful for the presence of the strangers which for the moment postponed a matrimonial confidence from which she shrank  proud to know you said colonel clinch with a sudden outbreak of the antique gallantry of some remote huguenot ancestor my friend judge hale must be a regular roman citizen to leave such a family and such a house at the call of public duty eh rawlins  you bet said rawlins looking from kate to her sister in undisguised admiration  and i suppose the duty could not have been a very pleasant one said mrs hale timidly without looking at her husband  gad madam thats just it said the gallant colonel seating himself with a comfortable air and an easy though by no means disrespectful familiarity we went into this fight a little more than a week ago the only scrimmage weve had has been with the detectives that were on the robbers track ha ha the best people weve met have been the friends of the men we were huntin and weve generally come to the conclusion to vote the other ticket ez judge hale and me agreed ez we came along the two men ez wed most like to see just now and shake hands with are george lee and ned falkner  the two leaders of the party who robbed the coach explained mr hale with a slight return of his usual precision of statement  the three women looked at each other with a blaze of thanksgiving in their grateful eyes without comprehending all that colonel clinch had said they understood enough to know that their late guests were safe from the pursuit of that party and that their own conduct was spared criticism i hardly dare write it but they instantly assumed the appearance of aggrieved martyrs and felt as if they were  yes ladies continued the colonel inspired by the bright eyes fixed upon him we havent taken the road ourselves yet butpohn honorwe wouldnt mind doing it in a case like this then with the fluent but somewhat exaggerated phraseology of a man trained to stump speaking he gave an account of the robbery and his own connection with it he spoke of the swindling and treachery which had undoubtedly provoked falkner to obtain restitution of his property by an overt act of violence under the leadership of lee he added that he had learned since at wild cat station that harkins had fled the country that a suit had been commenced by the excelsior ditch company and that all available property of harkins had been seized by the sheriff  of course it cant be proved yet but theres no doubt in my mind that lee who is an old friend of ned falkners got up that job to help him and that neds off with the money by this timeand im right glad of it i cant say ez weve done much towards it except to keep tumbling in the way of that detective party of stanners and so throw them off the trailha ha the judge here i reckon has had his share of fun for while he was at hennickers trying to get some facts from hennickers pretty daughter stanner tried to get up some sort of vigilance committee of the stage passengers to burn down hennickers ranch out of spite but the judge here stepped in and stopped that  it was really a highhanded proceeding josephine but i managed to check it said hale meeting somewhat consciously the first direct look his wife had cast upon him and falling back for support on his old manner in its way i think it was worse than the robbery by lee and falkner for it was done in the name of law and order while as far as i can judge from the facts the affair that we were following up was simply a rude and irregular restitution of property that had been morally stolen  i have no doubt you did quite right though i dont understand it said mrs hale languidly but i trust these gentlemen will stay to luncheon and in the meantime excuse us for running away as we are short of servants and manuel seems to have followed the example of the head of the house and left us in pursuit of somebody or something  when the three women had gained the vantageground of the drawingroom kate said earnestly as its all right hadnt we better tell him now  decidedly not child said mrs scott imperatively do you suppose they are in a hurry to tell us their whole story who are those hennicker people and they were there a week ago  and did you notice johns hat when he came in and the vulgar familiarity of calling him judge said mrs hale  well certainly anything like the familiarity of this man clinch i never saw said kate contrast his manner with mr falkners  at luncheon the three suffering martyrs finally succeeded in reducing hale and his two friends to an attitude of vague apology but their triumph was shortlived at the end of the meal they were startled by the trampling of hoofs without followed by loud knocking in another moment the door was opened and mr stanner strode into the room hale rose with a look of indignation  i thought as mr stanner understood that i had no desire for his company elsewhere he would hardly venture to intrude upon me in my house and certainly not after  ef youre alluding to the vigilantes shakin you and zeenie up at hennickers you cant make me responsible for that im here now on businessyou understandreglar business ef you want to see the papers yer ken i suppose you know what a warrant is  i know what you are said hale hotly and if you dont leave my house  steady boys interrupted stanner as his five henchmen filed into the hall theres no backin down here colonel clinch unless you and hale kalkilate to back down the state of californy the matter stands like this theres a halfbreed mexican called manuel arrested over at the summit who swears he saw george lee and edward falkner in this house the night after the robbery he says that they were makin themselves at home here as if they were among friends and considerin the kind of help weve had from mr john hale it looks ez if it might be true  its an infamous lie said hale  it may be true john said mrs scott suddenly stepping in front of her palecheeked daughters a wounded man was brought here out of the storm by his friend who claimed the shelter of your roof as your mother i should have been unworthy to stay beneath it and have denied that shelter or withheld it until i knew his name and what he was he stayed here until he could be removed he left a letter for you it will probably tell you if he was the man this person is seeking  thank you mother said hale lifting her hand to his lips quietly and perhaps you will kindly tell these gentlemen that as your son does not care to know who or what the stranger was there is no necessity for opening the letter or keeping mr stanner a moment longer  but you will oblige me john by opening it before these gentlemen said mrs hale recovering her voice and color please to follow me she said preceding them to the staircase  they entered mr hales room now restored to its original condition on the table lay a letter and a small package the eyes of mr stanner a little abashed by the attitude of the two women fastened upon it and glistened  josephine handed her husband the letter he opened it in breathless silence and read  john hale  we owe you no return for voluntarily making yourself a champion of justice and pursuing us except it was to offer you a fair field and no favor we didnt get that much from you but accident brought us into your house and into your family where we did get it and were fairly vanquished to the victors belong the spoils we leave the package of greenbacks which we took from colonel clinch in the sierra coach but which was first stolen by harkins from fortyfour shareholders of the excelsior ditch we have no right to say what you should do with it but if you arent tired of following the same line of justice that induced you to run after us you will try to restore it to its rightful owners  we leave you another trifle as an evidence that our intrusion into your affairs was not without some service to you even if the service was as accidental as the intrusion you will find a pair of boots in the corner of your closet they were taken from the burglarious feet of manuel your peon who believing the three ladies were alone and at his mercy entered your house with an accomplice at two oclock on the morning of the 21st and was kicked out by  your obedient servants  george lee  edward falkner   hales voice and color changed on reading this last paragraph he turned quickly towards his wife kate flew to the closet where the muffled boots of manuel confronted them we never knew it i always suspected something that night said mrs hale and mrs scott in the same breath  thats all very well and like george lees high falutin said stanner approaching the table but as long ez the greenbacks are here he can make what capital he likes outer manuel ill trouble you to pass over that package  excuse me said hale but i believe this is the package taken from colonel clinch is it not he added appealing to the colonel  it is said clinch  then take it said hale handing him the package the first restitution is to you but i believe you will fulfil lees instructions as well as myself  but said stanner furiously interposing ive a warrant to seize that wherever found and i dare you to disobey the law  mr stanner said clinch slowly there are ladies present if you insist upon having that package i must ask them to withdraw and im afraid youll find me better prepared to resist a second robbery than i was the first your warrant which was taken out by the express company is supplanted by civil proceedings taken the day before yesterday against the property of the fugitive swindler harkins you should have consulted the sheriff before you came here  stanner saw his mistake but in the faces of his grinning followers he was obliged to keep up his bluster you shall hear from me again sir he said turning on his heel  i beg your pardon said clinch grimly but do i understand that at last i am to have the honor  you shall hear from the companys lawyers sir said stanner turning red and noisily leaving the room  and so my dear ladies said colonel clinch you have spent a week with a highwayman i say a highwayman for it would be hard to call my young friend falkner by that name for his first offence committed under great provocation and undoubtedly instigated by lee who was an old friend of his and to whom he came no doubt in desperation  kate stole a triumphant glance at her sister who dropped her lids over her glistening eyes and this mr lee she continued more gently is he really a highwayman  george lee said clinch settling himself back oratorically in his chair my dear young lady is a highwayman but not of the common sort he is a gentleman born madam comes from one of the oldest families of the eastern shore of maryland he never mixes himself up with anything but some of the biggest strikes and hes an educated man he is very popular with ladies and children he was never known to do or say anything that could bring a blush to the cheek of beauty or a tear to the eye of innocence i think i may say im sure you found him so  i shall never believe him anything but a gentleman said mrs scott firmly  if he has a defect it is perhaps a too reckless indulgence in draw poker said the colonel musingly not unbecoming a gentleman understand me mrs scott but perhaps too reckless for his own good george played a grand game a glittering game but pardon me if i say an uncertain game ive told him so its the only point on which we ever differed  then you know him said mrs hale lifting her soft eyes to the colonel  i have that honor  did his appearance josephine broke in hale somewhat ostentatiously appear toerercorrespond with these qualities you know what i mean  he certainly seemed very simple and natural said mrs hale slightly drawing her pretty lips together he did not wear his trousers rolled up over his boots in the company of ladies as youre doing now nor did he make his first appearance in this house with such a hat as you wore this morning or i should not have admitted him  there were a few moments of embarrassing silence  do you intend to give that package to mr falkner yourself colonel asked mrs scott  i shall hand it over to the excelsior company said the colonel but i shall inform ned of what i have done  then said mrs scott will you kindly take a message from us to him  if you wish it  you will be doing me a great favor colonel said hale politely   whatever the message was six months later it brought edward falkner the reestablished superintendent of the excelsior ditch to eagles court as he and kate stood again on the plateau looking towards the distant slopes once more green with verdure falkner said  everything here looks as it did the first day i saw it except your sister  the place does not agree with her said kate hurriedly that is why my brother thinks of leaving it before the winter sets in  it seems so sad said falkner for the last words poor george said to me as he left to join his cousins corps at richmond were if im not killed ned i hope some day to stand again beside mrs hale at the window in eagles court and watch you and kate coming home
