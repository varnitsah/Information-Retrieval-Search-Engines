    recommendation of naval officers  message to congress  washington dc may 14 1862  to senate and house of representatives  the third section of the act further to promote the efficiency of the navy approved 21st of december 1861 provides  that the president of the united states by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall have the authority to detail from the retired list of the navy for the command of squadrons and single ships such officers as he may believe that the good of the service requires to be thus placed in command and such officers may if upon the recommendation of the president of the united states they shall receive a vote of thanks of congress for their services and gallantry in action against an enemy be restored to the active list and not otherwise  in conformity with this law captain david g farragut was nominated to the senate for continuance as the flagofficer in command of the squadron which recently rendered such important service to the union by his successful operations on the lower mississippi and capture of new orleans  believing that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond with the intention of the law or be more pregnant with happy influence as an example i cordially recommend that captain d g farragut receive a vote of thanks of congress for his services and gallantry displayed in the capture since 21st december 1861 of forts jackson and st philip city of new orleans and the destruction of various rebel gunboats rams etc     to the senate and house of representatives  i submit herewith a list of naval officers who commanded vessels engaged in the recent brilliant operations of the squadron commanded by flagofficer farragut which led to the capture of forts jackson and st philip city of new orleans and the destruction of rebel gunboats rams etc in april 1862 for their services and gallantry on those occasions i cordially recommend that they should by name receive a vote of thanks of

washington dc may 14 1862     telegram to general g b mcclellan  washington city may 15 1862  majorgeneral mcclellan cumberland virginia  your long despatch of yesterday is just received i will answer more fully soon will say now that all your despatches to the secretary of war have been promptly shown to me have done and shall do all i could and can to sustain you hoped that the opening of james river and putting wool and burnside in communication with an open road to richmond or to you had effected something in that direction i am still unwilling to take all our force off the direct line between richmond and here   a lincoln     speech to the 12th indiana regiment may 15 1862  soldiers of the twelfth indiana regiment  it has not been customary heretofore nor will it be hereafter for me to say something to every regiment passing in review it occurs too frequently for me to have speeches ready on all occasions as you have paid such a mark of respect to the chief magistrate it appears that i should say a word or two in reply your colonel has thought fit on his own account and in your name to say that you are satisfied with the manner in which i have performed my part in the difficulties which have surrounded the nation for your kind expressions i am extremely grateful but on the other hand i assure you that the nation is more indebted to you and such as you than to me it is upon the brave hearts and strong arms of the people of the country that our reliance has been placed in support of free government and free institutions  for the part which you and the brave army of which you are a part have under providence performed in this great struggle i tender more thanks especially to this regiment which has been the subject of good report the thanks of the nation will follow you and may gods blessing rest upon you now and forever i hope that upon your return to your homes you will find your friends and loved ones well and happy i bid you farewell     telegram to general i mcdowell  washington may 16 1862  majorgeneral mcdowell  what is the strength of your force now actually with you   a lincoln     memorandum of proposed additions to instructions of above date  to general mcdowell and general meigss indorsement thereon  may 17 1862 you will retain the separate command of the forces taken with you but while cooperating with general mcclellan you will obey his orders except that you are to judge and are not to allow your force to be disposed otherwise than so as to give the greatest protection to this capital which may be possible from that distance  indorsement  to the secretary of war  the president having shown this to me i suggested that it is dangerous to direct a subordinate not to obey the orders of his superior in any case and that to give instructions to general mcclellan to this same end and furnish general mcdowell with a copy thereof would effect the object desired by the president he desired me to say that the sketch of instructions to general mcclellan herewith he thought made this addition unnecessary  respectfully m c m     military emancipation  indorsement relating to general david hunters order of military emancipation  may 17 1862  no commanding general shall do such a thing upon my responsibility without consulting me   a lincoln     from secretary stanton to general mcclellan  washington may 18 1862  general your despatch to the president asking reinforcements has been received and carefully considered  the president is not willing to uncover the capital entirely and it is believed that even if this were prudent it would require more time to effect a junction between your army and that of the rappahannock by the way of the potomac and york rivers than by a land march in order therefore to increase the strength of the attack upon richmond at the earliest moment general mcdowell has been ordered to march upon that city by the shortest route he is ordered keeping himself always in position to save the capital from all possible attack so to operate as to put his left wing in communication with your right wing and you are instructed to cooperate so as to establish this communication as soon as possible by extending your rightwing to the north of richmond  it is believed that this communication can be safely established either north or south of the pamunkey river  in any event you will be able to prevent the main body of the enemys forces from leaving richmond and falling in overwhelming force upon general mcdowell he will move with between thirtyfive and forty thousand men  a copy of the instructions to general mcdowell are with this the specific task assigned to his command has been to provide against any danger to the capital of the nation  at your earnest call for reinforcements he is sent forward to cooperate in the reduction of richmond but charged in attempting this not to uncover the city of washington and you will give no order either before or after your junction which can put him out of position to cover this city you and he will communicate with each other by telegraph or otherwise as frequently as may be necessary for efficient cooperation when general mcdowell is in position on your right his supplies must be drawn from west point and you will instruct your staffofficers to be prepared to supply him by that route  the president desires that general mcdowell retain the command of the department of the rappahannock and of the forces with which he moves forward  by order of the president  edwin m stanton secretary of war  majorgeneral george b mcclellan commanding army of the potomac before richmond     proclamation revoking general hunters order of military emancipation  may 19 1862  by the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  whereas there appears in the public prints what purports to be a proclamation of major general hunter in the words and figures following to wit  general orders no 11 headquarters department of the south hilton head port royal s c may 9 1862  the three states of georgia florida and south carolina comprising the military department of the south having deliberately declared themselves no longer under the protection of the united states of america and having taken up arms against the said united states it became a military necessity to declare martial law this was accordingly done on the 25th day of april 1862 slavery and martial law in a free country are altogether incompatible the persons in these three states georgia florida and south carolinaheretofore held as slaves are therefore declared forever free  by command of majorgeneral d hunter officialed w smith acting assistant adjutantgeneral  and whereas the same is producing some excitement and misunderstanding therefore  i abraham lincoln president of the united states proclaim and declare that the government of the united states had no knowledge information or belief of an intention on the part of general hunter to issue such a proclamation nor has it yet any authentic information that the document is genuine and further that neither general hunter nor any other commander or person has been authorized by the government of the united states to make a proclamation declaring the slaves of any state free and that the supposed proclamation now in question whether genuine or false is altogether void so far as respects such a declaration  i further make known that whether it be competent for me as commanderinchief of the army and navy to declare the slaves of any state or states free and whether at any time in any case it shall have become a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the government to exercise such supposed power are questions which under my responsibility i reserve to myself and which i cannot feel justified in leaving to the decision of commanders in the field  these are totally different questions from those of police regulations in armies and camps  on the sixth day of march last by special message i recommended to congress the adoption of a joint resolution to be substantially as follows  resolved that the united states ought to cooperate with any state which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery giving to such state pecuniary aid to be used by such state in its discretion to compensate for the inconvenience public and private produced by such change of system  the resolution in the language above quoted was adopted by large majorities in both branches of congress and now stands an authentic definite and solemn proposal of the nation to the states and people most immediately interested in the subjectmatter to the people of those states i now earnestly appeal i do not arguei beseech you to make arguments for yourselves you cannot if you would be blind to the signs of the times i beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of them ranging if it may be far above personal and partisan politics this proposal makes common cause for a common object casting no reproaches upon any it acts not the pharisee the change it contemplates would come gently as the dews of heaven not rending or wrecking anything will you not embrace it so much good has not been done by one effort in all past time as in the providence of god it is now your high privilege to do may the vast future not have to lament that you have neglected it  in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed  done at the city of washington this nineteenth day of may in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixtytwo and of the independence of the united states the eightysixth   a lincoln  by the president  william h seward secretary of state     telegram to general g e mcclellan  washington may 21 1862  majorgeneral mcclellan  i have just been waited on by a large committee who present a petition signed by twentythree senators and eightyfour representatives asking me to restore general hamilton to his division i wish to do this and yet i do not wish to be understood as rebuking you please answer at once   a lincoln     telegram to general g b mcclellan  washington city may 22 1862  majorgeneral mcclellan  your long despatch of yesterday just received you will have just such control of general mcdowell and his forces as you therein indicate mcdowell can reach you by land sooner than he could get aboard of boats if the boats were ready at fredericksburg unless his march shall be resisted in which case the force resisting him will certainly not be confronting you at richmond by land he can reach you in five days after starting whereas by water he would not reach you in two weeks judging by past experience franklins single division did not reach you in ten days after i ordered it   a lincoln  president united states     telegram to general mcclellan  washington may 24 1862 4 pm  majorgeneral g b mcclellan  in consequence of general bankss critical position i have been compelled to suspend general mcdowells movements to join you the enemy are making a desperate push upon harpers ferry and we are trying to throw general fremonts force and part of general mcdowells in their rear   a lincoln president     telegram to general mcclellan  washington may 24 1862  majorgeneral george b mcclellan  i left general mcdowells camp at dark last evening shieldss command is there but it is so worn that he cannot move before monday morning the 26th we have so thinned our line to get troops for other places that it was broken yesterday at front royal with a probable loss to us of one regiment infantry two companies cavalry putting general banks in some peril  the enemys forces under general anderson now opposing general mcdowells advance have as their line of supply and retreat the road to richmond  if in conjunction with mcdowells movement against anderson you could send a force from your right to cut off the enemys supplies from richmond preserve the railroad bridges across the two forks of the pamunkey and intercept the enemys retreat you will prevent the army now opposed to you from receiving an accession of numbers of nearly 15000 men and if you succeed in saving the bridges you will secure a line of railroad for supplies in addition to the one you now have can you not do this almost as well as not while you are building the chickahominy bridges mcdowell and shields both say they can and positively will move monday morning i wish you to move cautiously and safely  you will have command of mcdowell after he joins you precisely as you indicated in your long despatch to us of the 21st   a lincoln     telegram to general rufus saxton  war department may 24 1862 2 pm  general saxton  geary reports jackson with 20000 moving from ashbys gap by the little river turnpike through aldie toward centreville this he says is reliable he is also informed of large forces south of him we know a force of some 15000 broke up saturday night from in front of fredericksburg and went we know not where please inform us if possible what has become of the force which pursued banks yesterday also any other information you have   a lincoln     telegram to colonel d s miles  war department may 24 1862 130 pm  colonel miles harpers ferry virginia  could you not send scouts from winchester who would tell whether enemy are north of banks moving on winchester what is the latest you have   a lincoln     telegram to general j c fremont  war department may 24 1862 4 pm  majorgeneral fremont franklin  you are authorized to purchase the 400 horses or take them wherever or however you can get them the exposed condition of general banks makes his immediate relief a point of paramount importance you are therefore directed by the president to move against jackson at harrisonburg and operate against the enemy in such way as to relieve banks this movement must be made immediately you will acknowledge the receipt of this order and specify the hour it is received by you   a lincoln     telegram to general j c fremont  war department may 24 1862 715 pm  majorgeneral fremont franklin virginia  many thanks for the promptness with which you have answered that you will execute the order muchperhaps alldepends upon the celerity with which you can execute it put the utmost speed into it do not lose a minute   a lincoln     telegram to general h w halleck  war department may 24 1862  majorgeneral halleck near corinth mississippi  several despatches from assistant secretary scott and one from governor morton asking reinforcements for you have been received i beg you to be assured we do the best we can i mean to cast no blame where i tell you each of our commanders along our line from richmond to corinth supposes himself to be confronted by numbers superior to his own under this pressure we thinned the line on the upper potomac until yesterday it was broken with heavy loss to us and general banks put in great peril out of which he is not yet extricated and may be actually captured we need men to repair this breach and have them not at hand my dear general i feel justified to rely very much on you i believe you and the brave officers and men with you can and will get the victory at corinth   a lincoln    telegram to general i mcdowell  war department may 24 1862  majorgeneral mcdowell fredricksburg  general fremont has been ordered by telegraph to move from franklin on harrisonburg to relieve general banks and capture or destroy jacksons and ewells forces you are instructed laying aside for the present the movement on richmond to put 20000 men in motion at once for the shenandoah moving on the line or in advance of the line of the manassas gap railroad your object will be to capture the forces of jackson and ewell either in cooperation with general fremont or in case want of supplies or of transportation interferes with his movements it is believed that the force which you move will be sufficient to accomplish this object alone the information thus far received here makes it probable that if the enemy operate actively against general banks you will not be able to count upon much assistance from him but may even have to release him reports received this moment are that banks is fighting with ewell eight miles from winchester   a lincoln     telegram to general mcdowell  war department washington city dc may 24 1862  majorgeneral i mcdowell  i am highly gratified by your alacrity in obeying my order the change was as painful to me as it can possibly be to you or to any one everything now depends upon the celerity and vigor of your movement   a lincoln     telegram to general j w geary  war department may 25 1862 145 pm  general geary white plains  please give us your best present impression as to the number of the enemys forces north of strasburg and front royal are the forces still moving north through the gap at front royal and between you and there   a lincoln     telegram to general g b mcclellan  washington may 25 1862 2 pm  majorgeneral mcclellan  the enemy is moving north in sufficient force to drive general banks before himprecisely in what force we cannot tell he is also threatening leesburg and geary on the manassas gap railroad from both north and southin precisely what force we cannot tell i think the movement is a general and concerted one such as would not be if he was acting upon the purpose of a very desperate defense of richmond i think the time is near when you must either attack richmond or give up the job and come to the defense of washington let me hear from you instantly   a lincoln president     order taking military possession of railroads  war department may 25 1862  ordered by virtue of the authority vested by act of congress the president takes military possession of all the railroads in the united states from and after this date until further order and directs that the respective railroad companies their officers and servants shall hold themselves in readiness for the transportation of such troops and munitions of war as may be ordered by the military authorities to the exclusion of all other business  by order of the secretary of war  m c meigs     telegram to secretary chase  war department may 25 1862  secretary chase fredericksburg virginia  it now appears that banks got safely into winchester last night and is this morning retreating on harpers ferry this justifies the inference that he is pressed by numbers superior to his own i think it not improbable that ewell jackson and johnson are pouring through the gap they made day before yesterday at front royal making a dash northward it will be a very valuable and very honorable service for general mcdowell to cut them off i hope he will put all possible energy and speed into the effort   a lincoln     telegram to general r saxton  war department may 25 1862  general saxton harpers ferry  if banks reaches martinsburg is he any the better for it will not the enemy cut him from thence to harpers ferry have you sent anything to meet him and assist him at martinsburg this is an inquiry not an order   a lincoln     telegram to general r saxton  war department may 25 1862 630 pm  general saxton harpers ferry  one good sixgun battery complete in its men and appointments is now on its way to you from baltimore eleven other guns of different sorts are on their way to you from here hope they will all reach you before morning as you have but 2500 men at harpers ferry where are the rest which were in that vicinity and which we have sent forward have any of them been cut off   a lincoln     telegram to general r saxton  war department may 25 1862  general saxton harpers ferry  i fear you have mistaken me i did not mean to question the correctness of your conduct on the contrary i approve what you have done as the 2500 reported by you seemed small to me i feared some had got to banks and been cut off with him please tell me the exact number you now have in hand   a lincoln     telegram to general g b mcclellan  sent in cipher  war department washington city d c may 251862 830 pm  majorgeneral mcclellan  your despatch received general banks was at strasburg with about 6000 men shields having been taken from him to swell a column for mcdowell to aid you at richmond and the rest of his force scattered at various places on the 23d a rebel force of 7000 to 10000 fell upon one regiment and two companies guarding the bridge at front royal destroying it entirely crossed the shenandoah and on the 24th yesterday pushed to get north of banks on the road to winchester banks ran a race with them beating them into winchester yesterday evening this morning a battle ensued between the two forces in which banks was beaten back into full retreat toward martinsburg and probably is broken up into a total rout geary on the manassas gap railroad just now reports that jackson is now near front royal with 10000 following up and supporting as i understand the forces now pursuing banks also that another force of 10000 is near orleans following on in the same direction stripped here as we are here it will be all we can do to prevent them crossing the potomac at harpers ferry or above we have about 20000 of mcdowells force moving back to the vicinity of front royal and general fremont who was at franklin is moving to harrisonburg both these movements intended to get in the enemys rear  one more of mcdowells brigades is ordered through here to harpers ferry the rest of his force remains for the present at fredericksburg we are sending such regiments and dribs from here and baltimore as we can spare to harpers ferry supplying their places in some sort by calling in militia from the adjacent states we also have eighteen cannon on the road to harpers ferry of which arm there is not a single one yet at that point this is now our situation  if mcdowells force was now beyond our reach we should be utterly helpless apprehension of something like this and no unwillingness to sustain you has always been my reason for withholding mcdowells force from you please understand this and do the best you can with the force you have   a lincoln     history of conspiracy of rebellion  message to congress  may 16 1862  to the senate and house of representatives  the insurrection which is yet existing in the united states and aims at the overthrow of the federal constitution and the union was clandestinely prepared during the winter of 1860 and 1861 and assumed an open organization in the form of a treasonable provisional government at montgomery in alabama on the 18th day of february 1861 on the 12th day of april 1861 the insurgents committed the flagrant act of civil war by the bombardment and the capture of fort sumter which cut off the hope of immediate conciliation immediately afterward all the roads and avenues to this city were obstructed and the capital was put into the condition of a siege the mails in every direction were stopped and the lines of telegraph cut off by the insurgents and military and naval forces which had been called out by the government for the defense of washington were prevented from reaching the city by organized and combined treasonable resistance in the state of maryland there was no adequate and effective organization for the public defense congress had indefinitely adjourned there was no time to convene them it became necessary for me to choose whether using only the existing means agencies and processes which congress had provided i should let the government fall at once into ruin or whether availing myself of the broader powers conferred by the constitution in cases of insurrection i would make an effort to save it with all its blessings for the present age and for posterity  i thereupon summoned my constitutional advisers the heads of all the departments to meet on sunday the 20th day of april 1861 at the office of the navy department and then and there with their unanimous concurrence i directed that an armed revenue cutter should proceed to sea to afford protection to the commercial marine and especially the california treasure ships then on their way to this coast i also directed the commandant of the navyyard at boston to purchase or charter and arm as quickly as possible five steamships for purposes of public defense i directed the commandant of the navyyard at philadelphia to purchase or charter and arm an equal number for the same purpose i directed the commandant at new york to purchase or charter and arm an equal number i directed commander gillis to purchase or charter and arm and put to sea two other vessels similar directions were given to commodore dupont with a view to the opening of passages by water to and from the capital i directed the several officers to take the advice and obtain the aid and efficient services in the matter of his excellency edwin d morgan the governor of new york or in his absence george d morgan william m evarts r m blatchford and moses h grinnell who were by my directions especially empowered by the secretary of the navy to act for his department in that crisis in matters pertaining to the forwarding of troops and supplies for the public defense  the several departments of the government at that time contained so large a number of disloyal persons that it would have been impossible to provide safely through official agents only for the performance of the duties thus confided to citizens favorably known for their ability loyalty and patriotism  the several orders issued upon these occurrences were transmitted by private messengers who pursued a circuitous way to the seaboard cities inland across the states of pennsylvania and ohio and the northern lakes i believe by these and other similar measures taken in that crisis some of which were without any authority of law the government was saved from overthrow i am not aware that a dollar of the public funds thus confided without authority of law to unofficial persons was either lost or wasted although apprehensions of such misdirection occurred to me as objections to those extraordinary proceedings and were necessarily overruled  i recall these transactions now because my attention has been directed to a resolution which was passed by the house of representatives on the 30th day of last month which is in these words  resolved that simon cameron late secretary of war by investing alexander cummings with the control of large sums of the public money and authority to purchase military supplies without restriction without requiring from him any guaranty for the faithful performance of his duties when the services of competent public officers were available and by involving the government in a vast number of contracts with persons not legitimately engaged in the business pertaining to the subjectmatter of such contracts especially in the purchase of arms for future delivery has adopted a policy highly injurious to the public service and deserves the censure of the house  congress will see that i should be wanting equally in candor and in justice if i should leave the censure expressed in this resolution to rest exclusively or chiefly upon mr cameron the same sentiment is unanimously entertained by the heads of department who participated in the proceedings which the house of representatives have censured it is due to mr cameron to say that although he fully approved the proceedings they were not moved nor suggested by himself and that not only the president but all the other heads of departments were at least equally responsible with him for whatever error wrong or fault was committed in the premises   a lincoln     telegram to general g b mcclellan  washington may 26 1862 1240  majorgeneral mcclellan  we have general bankss official report he has saved his army and baggage and has made a safe retreat to the river and is probably safe at williamsport he reports the attacking force at 15000   a lincoln president     telegram to general i mcdowell  war department may 26 1862 1 pm  majorgeneral mcdowell falmouth virginia  despatches from geary just received have been sent you should not the remainder of your forces except sufficient to hold the point at fredericksburg move this wayto manassas junction or alexandria as commander of this department should you not be here i ask these questions   a lincoln     telegram to general mcclellan  washington may 26 1862  majorgeneral george b mcclellan  can you not cut the alula creek railroad also what impression have you as to intrenched works for you to contend with in front of richmond can you get near enough to throw shells into the city   a lincoln president     telegram to general j c fremont  may 271862 958 pm  majorgeneral fremont  i see that you are at moorefield you were expressly ordered to march to harrisonburg what does this mean   a lincoln     telegram from secretary stanton to governor andrew  washington may 27 1862  governor andrew boston  the president directs that the militia be relieved and the enlistments made for three years or during the war this i think will practically not be longer than for a year the latest intelligence from general banks states that he has saved nearly his whole command with small loss  concentrations of our force have been made which it is hoped will capture the enemy  edwin m stanton secretary of war     telegram from secretary stanton to general j c fremont  washington may 28 1862  majorgeneral fremont moorefield  the president directs you to halt at moorefield and await orders unless you hear of the enemy being in the general direction of rodney in which case you will move upon him acknowledge the receipt of this order and the hour it is received  edwin m stanton secretary of war     telegram to general i mcdowell  washington may 28 1862  general mcdowell manassas junction  general mcclellan at 630 pm yesterday telegraphed that fitzjohn porters division had fought and driven 13000 of the enemy under general branch from hanover courthouse and was driving them from a stand they had made on the railroad at the time the messenger left two hours later he telegraphed that stoneman had captured an engine and six cars on the virginia central which he at once sent to communicate with porter nothing further from mcclellan  if porter effects a lodgment on both railroads near hanover courthouse consider whether your forces in front of fredericksburg should not push through and join him   a lincoln     telegram to general g b mcclellan  washington may 28 1862  majorgeneral mcclellan  what of fj porters expedition please answer   a lincoln     telegram to general i mcdowell  washington may 28 1862 4 pm  general mcdowell manassas junction  you say general gearys scouts report that they find no enemy this side of the blue ridge neither do i have they been to the blue ridge looking for them   a lincoln     telegram to general i mcdowell  washington may 28 1862 540 pm  general mcdowell manassas junction  i think the evidence now preponderates that ewell and jackson are still about winchester assuming this it is for you a question of legs put in all the speed you can i have told fremont as much and directed him to drive at them as fast as possible by the way i suppose you know fremont has got up to moorefield instead of going into harrisonburg   a lincoln     telegram to general g b mcclellan  washington may 28 1862 840 pm  majorgeneral mcclellan  i am very glad of general f j porters victory still if it was a total rout of the enemy i am puzzled to know why the richmond and fredericksburg railroad was not seized again as you say you have all the railroads but the richmond and fredericksburg i am puzzled to see how lacking that you can have any except the scrap from richmond to west point the scrap of the virginia central from richmond to hanover junction without more is simply nothing that the whole of the enemy is concentrating on richmond i think cannot be certainly known to you or me saxton at harpers ferry informs us that large forces supposed to be jacksons and ewells forced his advance from charlestown today general king telegraphs us from fredericksburg that contrabands give certain information that 15000 left hanover junction monday morning to reinforce jackson i am painfully impressed with the importance of the struggle before you and shall aid you all i can consistently with my view of due regard to all points   a lincoln     telegram from secretary stanton to general fremont  washington may 28 1862  majorgeneral john c fremont moorefield  the order to remain at moorefield was based on the supposition that it would find you there  upon subsequent information that the enemy were still operating in the vicinity

certainly do not disapprove the proposition   a lincoln     to general j c fremont washington june 12 1862  majorgeneral fremont  accounts which we do not credit represent that jackson is largely reinforced and turning upon you get your forces well in hand and keep us well and frequently advised and if you find yourself really pressed by a superior force of the enemy fall back cautiously toward or to winchester and we will have in due time banks in position to sustain you do not fall back upon harrisonburg unless upon tolerably clear necessity we understand jackson is on the other side of the shenandoah from you and hence cannot in any event press you into any necessity of a precipitate withdrawal   a lincoln  psyours preferring mount jackson to harrisonburg is just received on this point use your discretion remembering that our object is to give such protection as you can to western virginia many thanks to yourself officers and men for the gallant battle of last sunday a l     message to congress  executive mansion washington  june 13 1862  fellowcitizens of the senate and house of representatives i herewith transmit a memorial addressed and presented to me in behalf of the state of new york in favor of enlarging the locks of the erie and oswego canal while i have not given nor have leisure to give the subject a careful examination its great importance is obvious and unquestionable the large amount of valuable statistical information which is collated and presented in the memorial will greatly facilitate the mature consideration of the subject which i respectfully ask for it at your hands   a lincoln     to general j c fremont  washington june 13 1862  majorgeneral fremont  we cannot afford to keep your force and bankss and mcdowells engaged in keeping jackson south of strasburg and front royal you fought jackson alone and worsted him he can have no substantial reinforcements so long as a battle is pending at richmond surely you and banks in supporting distance are capable of keeping him from returning to winchester but if sigel be sent forward to you and mcdowell as he must be put to other work jackson will break through at front royal again he is already on the right side of the shenandoah to do it and on the wrong side of it to attack you the orders already sent you and banks place you and him in the proper positions for the work assigned you jackson cannot move his whole force on either of you before the other can learn of it and go to his assistance he cannot divide his force sending part against each of you because he will be too weak for either please do as i directed in the order of the 8th and my despatch of yesterday the 12th and neither you nor banks will be overwhelmed by jackson by proper scout lookouts and beacons of smoke by day and fires by night you can always have timely notice of the enemys approach i know not as to you but by some this has been too much neglected   a lincoln    to general j c fremont  war department washington city d c june 15 1862  majorgeneral fremont  my dear siryour letter of the 12th by colonel zagonyi is just received in answer to the principal part of it i repeat the substance of an order of the 8th and one or two telegraphic despatches sent you since  we have no definite power of sending reinforcements so that we are compelled rather to consider the proper disposal of the forces we have than of those we could wish to have we may be able to send you some dribs by degrees but i do not believe we can do more as you alone beat jackson last sunday i argue that you are stronger than he is today unless he has been reinforced and that he cannot have been materially reinforced because such reinforcement could only have come from richmond and he is much more likely to go to richmond than richmond is to come to him neither is very likely i think jacksons gamehis assigned worknow is to magnify the accounts of his numbers and reports of his movements and thus by constant alarms keep three or four times as many of our troops away from richmond as his own force amounts to thus he helps his friends at richmond three or four times as much as if he were there our game is not to allow this accordingly by the order of the 8th i directed you to halt at harrisonburg rest your force and get it well in hand the objects being to guard against jacksons returning by the same route to the upper potomac over which you have just driven him out and at the same time give some protection against a raid into west virginia  already i have given you discretion to occupy mount jackson instead if on full consideration you think best i do not believe jackson will attack you but certainly he cannot attack you by surprise and if he comes upon you in superior force you have but to notify us fall back cautiously and banks will join you in due time but while we know not whether jackson will move at all or by what route we cannot safely put you and banks both on the strasburg line and leave no force on the front royal linethe very line upon which he prosecuted his late raid the true policy is to place one of you on one line and the other on the other in such positions that you can unite once you actually find jackson moving upon it and this is precisely what we are doing this protects that part of our frontier so to speak and liberates mcdowell to go to the assistance of mcclellan i have arranged this and am very unwilling to have it deranged while you have only asked for sigel i have spoken only of banks and this because sigels force is now the principal part of banks force  about transferring general schencks commands the purchase of supplies and the promotion and appointment of officers mentioned in your letter i will consult with the secretary of war tomorrow  yours truly   a lincoln     to general j c fremont  washington june 16 1862  majorgeneral fremont mount jackson virginia  your despatch of yesterday reminding me of a supposed understanding that i would furnish you a corps of 35000 men and asking of me the fulfilment of this understanding is received i am ready to come to a fair settlement of accounts with you on the fulfilment of understandings  early in march last when i assigned you to the command of the mountain department i did tell you i would give you all the force i could and that i hoped to make it reach 35000 you at the same time told me that within a reasonable time you would seize the railroad at or east of knoxville tenn if you could there was then in the department a force supposed to be 25000 the exact number as well known to you as to me after looking about two or three days you called and distinctly told me that if i would add the blenker division to the force already in the department you would undertake the job the blenker division contained 10000 and at the expense of great dissatisfaction to general mcclellan i took it from his army and gave it to you my promise was literally fulfilled i have given you all i could and i have given you very nearly if not quite 35000  now for yours on the 23d of may largely over two months afterward you were at franklin va not within 300 miles of knoxville nor within 80 miles of any part of the railroad east of it and not moving forward but telegraphing here that you could not move for lack of everything now do not misunderstand me i do not say you have not done all you could i presume you met unexpected difficulties and i beg you to believe that as surely as you have done your best so have i i have not the power now to fill up your corps to 35000 i am not demanding of you to do the work of 35000 i am only asking of you to stand cautiously on the defensive get your force in order and give such protection as you can to the valley of the shenandoah and to western virginia  have you received the orders and will you act upon them   a lincoln     to general c schurz  washington june 16 1862  brigadiergeneral schurz mount jackson virginia  your long letter is received the information you give is valuable you say it is fortunate that fremont did not intercept jackson that jackson had the superior force and would have overwhelmed him if this is so how happened it that fremont fairly fought and routed him on the 8th or is the account that he did fight and rout him false and fabricated both general fremont and you speak of jackson having beaten shields by our accounts he did not beat shields he had no engagement with shields he did meet and drive back with disaster about 2000 of shieldss advance till they were met by an additional brigade of shieldss when jackson himself turned and retreated shields himself and more than half his force were not nearer than twenty miles to any of it   a lincoln     telegram to general h w halleck  washington june 18 1862  majorgeneral halleck corinth mississippi  it would be of both interest and value to us here to know how the expedition toward east tennessee is progressing if in your judgment you can give us the information with safety   a lincoln     telegram to general g b mcclellan  war department washington d c june 18 1862  majorgeneral mcclellan  yours of today making it probable that jackson has been reinforced by about 10000 from richmond is corroborated by a despatch from general king at fredericksburg saying a frenchman just arrived from richmond by way of gordonsville met 10000 to 15000 passing through the latter place to join jackson  if this is true it is as good as a reinforcement to you of an equal force i could better dispose of things if i could know about what day you can attack richmond and would be glad to be informed if you think you can inform me with safety   a lincoln     telegram to general g b mcclellan  washington june 19 1862  majorgeneral mcclellan  yours of last night just received and for which i thank you  if large reinforcements are going from richmond to jackson it proves one of two things either they are very strong at richmond or do not mean to defend the place desperately  on reflection i do not see how reinforcements from richmond to jackson could be in gordonsville as reported by the frenchman and your deserters have not all been sent to deceive   a lincoln     telegram to general g b mcclellan  war department washington june 20 1862  majorgeneral mcclellan  in regard to the contemplated execution of captains spriggs and triplett the government has no information whatever but will inquire and advise you   a lincoln     telegram to general g b mcclellan  washington city june 20 1862  majorgeneral mcclellan  we have this morning sent you a despatch of general sigel corroborative of the proposition that jackson is being reinforced from richmond this may be reality and yet may only be contrivance for deception and to determine which is perplexing if we knew it was not true we could send you some more force but as the case stands we do not think we safely can still we will watch the signs and do so if possible  in regard to a contemplated execution of captains spriggs and triplett the government has no information whatever but will inquire and advise you   a lincoln     telegram to general g b mcclellan  washington june 21 1862 6 pm  majorgeneral george b mcclellan  your despatch of yesterday 2 p m was received this morning if it would not divert too much of your time and attention from the army under your immediate command i would be glad to have your views as to the present state of military affairs throughout the whole country as you say you would be glad to give them i would rather it should be by letter than by telegraph because of the better chance of secrecy as to the numbers and positions of the troops not under your command in virginia and elsewhere even if i could do it with accuracy which i cannot i would rather not transmit either by telegraph or by letter because of the chances of its reaching the enemy i would be very glad to talk with you but you cannot leave your camp and i cannot well leave here   a lincoln president     telegram to general n p banks  war department june 22 1862  majorgeneral banks middletown  i am very glad you are looking well to the west for a movement of the enemy in that direction you know my anxiety on that point  all was quiet at general mcclellans headquarters at two oclock today   a lincoln     treaty with mexico  message to the senate  washington june 23 1862  to the senate of the united states  on the 7th day of december 1861 i submitted to the senate the project of a treaty between the united states and mexico which had been proposed to me by mr corwin our minister to mexico and respectfully requested the advice of the senate thereupon  on the 25th day of february last a resolution was adopted by the senate to the effect  that it is not advisable to negotiate a treaty that will require the united states to assume any portion of the principal or interest of the debt of mexico or that will require the concurrence of european powers  this resolution having been duly communicated to me notice thereof was immediately given by the secretary of state to mr corwin and he was informed that he was to consider his instructions upon the subject referred to modified by this resolution and would govern his course accordingly that despatch failed to reach mr corwin by reason of the disturbed condition of mexico until a very recent date mr corwin being without instructions or thus practically left without instructions to negotiate further with mexico  in view of the very important events occurring there he has thought that the interests of the united states would be promoted by the conclusion of two treaties which should provide for a loan to that republic he has therefore signed such treaties and they having been duly ratified by the government of mexico he has transmitted them to me for my consideration the action of the senate is of course conclusive against an acceptance of the treaties on my part i have nevertheless thought it just to our excellent minister in mexico and respectful to the government of that republic to lay the treaties before the senate together with the correspondence which has occurred in relation to them in performing this duty i have only to add that the importance of the subject thus submitted to the senate can not be over estimated and i shall cheerfully receive and consider with the highest respect any further advice the senate may think proper to give upon the subject   a lincoln     veto of a currency bill  message to the senate june 23 1862  to the senate of the united states  the bill which has passed the house of representatives and the senate entitled an act to repeal that part of an act of congress which prohibits the circulation of banknotes of a less denomination than five dollars in the district of columbia has received my attentive consideration and i now return it to the senate in which it originated with the following objections  1 the bill proposes to repeal the existing legislation prohibiting the circulation of banknotes of a less denomination than five dollars within the district of columbia without permitting the issuing of such bills by banks not now legally authorized to issue them in my judgment it will be found impracticable in the present condition of the currency to make such a discrimination the banks have generally suspended specie payments and a legal sanction given to the circulation of the irredeemable notes of one class of them will almost certainly be so extended in practical operation as to include those of all classes whether authorized or unauthorized if this view be correct the currency of the district should this act become a law will certainly and greatly deteriorate to the serious injury of honest trade and honest labor  2 this bill seems to contemplate no end which cannot be otherwise more certainly and beneficially attained during the existing war it is peculiarly the duty of the national government to secure to the people a sound circulating medium this duty has been under existing circumstances satisfactorily performed in part at least by authorizing the issue of united states notes receivable for all government dues except customs and made a legal tender for all debts public and private except interest on public debt the object of the bill submitted to menamely that of providing a small note currency during the present suspensioncan be fully accomplished by authorizing the issue as part of any new emission of united states notes made necessary by the circumstances of the country of notes of a similar character but of less denomination than five dollars such an issue would answer all the beneficial purposes of the bill would save a considerable amount to the treasury in interest would greatly facilitate payments to soldiers and other creditors of small sums and would furnish to the people a currency as safe as their own government  entertaining these objections to the bill i feel myself constrained to withhold from it my approval and return it for the further consideration and action of congress   a lincoln     speech at jersey city june 24 1862  when birds and animals are looked at through a fog they are seen to disadvantage and so it might be with you if i were to attempt to tell you why i went to see general scott i can only say that my visit to west point did not have the importance which has been attached to it but it concerned matters that you understand quite as well as if i were to tell you all about them now i can only remark that it had nothing whatever to do with making or unmaking any general in the country the secretary of war you know holds a pretty tight rein on the press so that they shall not tell more than they ought to and i m afraid that if i blab too much he might draw a tight rein on me     to general g b mcclellan  washington june 26 1862  majorgeneral mcclellan  your three despatches of yesterday in relation to the affair ending with the statement that you completely succeeded in making your point are very gratifying  the later one of 615 pm suggesting the probability of your being overwhelmed by two hundred thousand and talking of where the responsibility will belong pains me very much i give you all i can and act on the presumption that you will do the best you can with what you have while you continue ungenerously i think to assume that i could give you more if i would i have omitted and shall omit no opportunity to send you reinforcements whenever i possibly can   a lincoln  p s general pope thinks if you fall back it would be much better towards york river than towards the james as pope now has charge of the capital please confer with him through the telegraph     order constituting the army of virginia  executive mansion washington d c june 26 1862  ordered 1st the forces under majorgenerals fremont banks and mcdowell including the troops now under brigadiergeneral sturgis at washington shall be consolidated and form one army to be called the army of virginia  2d the command of the army of virginia is specially assigned to majorgeneral john pope as commanding general the troops of the mountain department heretofore under command of general fremont shall constitute the first army corps under the command of general fremont the troops of the shenandoah department now under general banks shall constitute the second army corps and be commanded by him the troops under the command of general mcdowell except those within the fortifications and city of washington shall form the third army corps and be under his command  3d the army of virginia shall operate in such manner as while protecting western virginia and the national capital from danger or insult it shall in the speediest manner attack and overcome the rebel forces under jackson and ewell threaten the enemy in the direction of charlottesville and render the most effective aid to relieve general mcclellan and capture richmond  4th when the army of the potomac and the army of virginia shall be in position to communicate and directly cooperate at or before richmond the chief command while so operating together shall be governed as in like cases by the rules and articles of war   a lincoln     telegram from secretary stanton to general h w halleck  war department june 28 1862  majorgeneral halleck  the enemy have concentrated in such force at richmond as to render it absolutely necessary in the opinion of the president for you immediately to detach 25000 of your force and forward it by the nearest and quickest route by way of baltimore and washington to richmond it is believed that the quickest route would be by way of columbus ky and up the ohio river but in detaching your force the president directs that it be done in such a way as to enable you to hold your ground and not interfere with the movement against chattanooga and east tennessee this condition being observed the forces to be detached and the routes they are to be sent are left to your own judgment  the direction to send these forces immediately is rendered imperative by a serious reverse suffered by general mcclellan before richmond yesterday the full extent of which is not yet known  you will acknowledge the receipt of this despatch stating the day and hour it is received and inform me what your action will be so that we may take measures to aid in river and railroad transportation  edwin m stanton secretary of war     telegrams to general a e burnside  washington june 28 1862  general burnside  i think you had better go with any reinforcements you can spare to general mcclellan   a lincoln     war department june 28 1862  majorgeneral burnside newbern  we have intelligence that general mcclellan has been attacked in large force and compelled to fall back toward the james river we are not advised of his exact condition but the president directs that you shall send him all the reinforcements from your command to the james river that you can safely do without abandoning your own position let it be infantry entirely as he said yesterday that he had cavalry enough  edwin m stanton  secretary of war     telegram to general g b mcclellan  war department washington city june 28 1862  majorgeneral mcclellan  save your army at all events will send reinforcements as fast as we can of course they cannot reach you today tomorrow or next day i have not said you were ungenerous for saying you needed reinforcements i thought you were ungenerous in assuming that i did not send them as fast as i could i feel any misfortune to you and your army quite as keenly as you feel it yourself if you have had a drawn battle or a repulse it is the price we pay for the enemy not being in washington we protected washington and the enemy concentrated on you had we stripped washington he would have been upon us before the troops could have gotten to you less than a week ago you notified us that reinforcements were leaving richmond to come in front of us it is the nature of the case and neither you nor the government is to blame please tell at once the present condition and aspect of things   a lincoln     to secretary seward  executive mansion june 28 1862  hon w h seward  my dear sirmy view of the present condition of the war is about as follows  the evacuation of corinth and our delay by the flood in the chickahominy have enabled the enemy to concentrate too much force in richmond for mcclellan to successfully attack in fact there soon will be no substantial rebel force anywhere else but if we send all the force from here to mcclellan the enemy will before we can know of it send a force from richmond and take washington or if a large part of the western army be brought here to mcclellan they will let us have richmond and retake tennessee kentucky missouri etc what should be done is to hold what we have in the west open the mississippi and take chattanooga and east tennessee without more a reasonable force should in every event be kept about washington for its protection then let the country give us a hundred thousand new troops in the shortest possible time which added to mcclellan directly or indirectly will take richmond without endangering any other place which we now hold and will substantially end the war i expect to maintain this contest until successful or till i die or am conquered or my term expires or congress or the country forsake me and i would publicly appeal to the country for this new force were it not that i fear a general panic and stampede would follow so hard it is to have a thing understood as it really is i think the new force should be all or nearly all infantry principally because such can be raised most cheaply and quickly  yours very truly   a lincoln     telegram

astor house new york  not much more than when you left fulton of baltimore american is now with us he left white house at 11 am yesterday he conversed fully with a paymaster who was with porters force during the fight of friday and fell back to nearer mcclellans quarters just a little sooner than porter did seeing the whole of it stayed on the richmond side of the chickahominy over night and left for white house at 5 am saturday he says porter retired in perfect order under protection of the guns arranged for the purpose under orders and not from necessity and with all other of our forces except what was left on purpose to go to white house was safely in pontoons over the chickahominy before morning and that there was heavy firing on the richmond side begun at 5 and ceased at 7 am saturday on the whole i think we have had the better of it up to that point of time what has happened since we still know not as we have no communication with general mcclellan a despatch from colonel ingalls shows that he thinks mcclellan is fighting with the enemy at richmond today and will be tomorrow we have no means of knowing upon what colonel ingalls founds his opinion confirmed about saving all property not a single unwounded straggler came back to white house from the field and the number of wounded reaching there up to 11 am saturday was not large   a lincoln   to what the president has above stated i will only add one or two points that may be satisfactory for you to know  first all the sick and wounded were safely removed  second a despatch from burnside shows that he is from white house not a man left behind in condition to afford efficient support and is probably doing so  third the despatch from colonel ingalls impresses me with the conviction that the movement was made by general mcclellan to concentrate on richmond and was successful to the latest point of which we have any information  fourth mr fulton says that on friday night between twelve and one oclock general mcclellan telegraphed commodore goldsborough that the result of the movement was satisfactory to him  fifth from these and the facts stated by the president my inference is that general mcclellan will probably be in richmond within two days  edwin m stanton secretary of war  unfortunately mcclellan did not do any of the things he was ordered and that it was very likely possible to do it is still some mystery what he was doing all these days other than hiding in the woods and staying out of communication so he would not receive any more uncomfortable orders this was another place where the north was close to wining the war and did not dw     telegram to secretary seward war department june 30 1862  hon wm h seward new york  we are yet without communication with general mcclellan and this absence of news is our point of anxiety up to the latest point to which we are posted he effected everything in such exact accordance with his plan contingently announced to us before the battle began that we feel justified to hope that he has not failed since he had a severe engagement in getting the part of his army on this side of the chickahominy over to the other side in which the enemy lost certainly as much as we did we are not dissatisfied with this only that the loss of enemies does not compensate for the loss of friends the enemy cannot come below white house certainly is not there now and probably has abandoned the whole line dixs pickets are at new kent courthouse   a lincoln     call for troops new york june 30 1862  to the governors of the several states  the capture of new orleans norfolk and corinth by the national forces has enabled the insurgents to concentrate a large force at and about richmond which place we must take with the least possible delay in fact there will soon be no formidable insurgent force except at richmond with so large an army there the enemy can threaten us on the potomac and elsewhere until we have reestablished the national authority all these places must be held and we must keep a respectable force in front of washington but this from the diminished strength of our army by sickness and casualties renders an addition to it necessary in order to close the struggle which has been prosecuted for the last three months with energy and success rather than hazard the misapprehension of our military condition and of groundless alarm by a call for troops by proclamation i have deemed it best to address you in this form to accomplish the object stated we require without delay 150000 men including those recently called for by the secretary of war thus reinforced our gallant army will be enabled to realize the hopes and expectations of the government and the people   a lincoln     telegram to general j a dix  war department washington city june 30 1862  majorgeneral dix fort monroe  is it not probable that the enemy has abandoned the line between white house and mcclellans rear he could have but little object to maintain it and nothing to subsist upon would not stoneman better move up and see about it i think a telegraphic communication can at once be opened to white house from williamsburg the wires must be up still   a lincoln     telegrams to general h w halleck  war department june 30 1862 3 p m  majorgeneral halleck corinth  your telegram of this date just received the chattanooga expedition must not on any account be given up the president regards that and the movement against east tennessee as one of the most important movements of the war and its occupation nearly as important as the capture of richmond he is not pleased with the tardiness of the movement toward chattanooga and directs that no force be sent here if you cannot do it without breaking up the operations against that point and east tennessee infantry only are needed our cavalry and artillery are strong enough the first reports from richmond were more discouraging than the truth warranted if the advantage is not on our side it is balanced general mcclellan has moved his whole force on the line of the james river and is supported there by our gunboats but he must be largely strengthened before advancing and hence the call on you which i am glad you answered so promptly let me know to what point on the river you will send your forces so as to provide immediately for transportation  edwin m stanton  secretary of war     washington dc june 30 1862  majorgeneral halleck corinth mississippi  would be very glad of 25000 infantry no artillery or cavalry but please do not send a man if it endangers any place you deem important to hold or if it forces you to give up or weaken or delay the expedition against chattanooga to take and hold the railroad at or east of

of the union impressed with the belief that the citizens of the states which they respectively represent are of one accord in the hearty desire that the recent successes of the federal arms may be followed up by measures which must insure the speedy restoration of the union and believing that in view of the present state of the important military movements now in progress and the reduced condition of our effective forces in the field resulting from the usual and unavoidable casualties in the service the time has arrived for prompt and vigorous measures to be adopted by the people in support of the great interests committed to your charge respectfully request if it meets with your entire approval that you at once call upon the several states for such number of men as may be required to fill up all military organizations now in the field and add to the armies heretofore organized such additional number of men as may in your judgment be necessary to garrison and hold all the numerous cities and military positions that have been captured by our armies and to speedily crush the rebellion that still exists in several of the southern states thus practically restoring to the civilized world our great and good government all believe that the decisive moment is near at hand and to that end the people of the united states are desirous to aid promptly in furnishing all

for your present emergency if we had a million of men we could not get them to you in time we have not the men to send if you are not strong enough to face the enemy you must find a place of security and wait rest and repair maintain your ground if you can but save the army at all events even if you fall back to fort monroe we still have strength enough in the country and will bring it out   a lincoln     to general g b mcclellan  war department washington dc july 2 1862  majorgeneral mcclellan  your despatch of tuesday morning induces me to hope your army is having some rest in this hope allow me to reason with you a moment when you ask for 50000 men to be promptly sent you you surely labor under some gross mistake of fact recently you sent papers showing your disposal of forces made last spring for the defense of washington and advising a return to that plan i find it included in and about washington 75000 men now please be assured i have not men enough to fill that very plan by 15000 all of fremonts in the valley all of bankss all of mcdowells not with you and all in washington taken together do not exceed if they reach 60000 with wool and dix added to those mentioned i have not outside of your army 75000 men east of the mountains thus the idea of sending you 50000 or any other considerable force promptly is simply absurd if in your frequent mention of responsibility you have the impression that i blame you for not doing more than you can please be relieved of such impression i only beg that in like manner you will not ask impossibilities of me if you think you are not strong enough to take richmond just now i do not ask you to try just now save the army material and personal and i will strengthen it for the offensive again as fast as i can the governors of eighteen states offer me a new levy of 300000 which i accept   a lincoln     telegram to general h w halleck  washington dc july 2 1862  majorgeneral halleck corinth mississippi  your several despatches of yesterday to secretary of war and myself received i did say and now repeat i would be exceedingly glad for some reinforcements from you still do not send a man if in your judgment it will endanger any point you deem important to hold or will force you to give up or weaken or delay the chattanooga expedition  please tell me could you not make me a flying visit for consultation without endangering the service in your department   a lincoln     message to the senate  executive mansion july 2 1862  to the senate of the united states  i herewith return to your honorable body in which it originated an act entitled an act to provide for additional medical officers of the volunteer service without my approval  my reason for so doing is that i have approved an act of the same title passed by congress after the passage of the one first mentioned for the express purpose of correcting errors in and superseding the same as i am informed   a lincoln     circular letter to the governors  private and confidential  war department july 3 18621030 am  governor washburn maine and other governors i should not want the half of 300000 new troops if i could have them now if i had 50000 additional troops here now i believe i could substantially close the war in two weeks but time is everything and if i get 50000 new men in a month i shall have lost 20000 old ones during the same month having gained only 30000 with the difference between old and new troops still against me the quicker you send the fewer you will have to send time is everything please act in view of this the enemy having given up corinth it is not wonderful that he is thereby enabled to check us for a time at richmond  yours truly   a lincoln     to general g b mcclellan  war department washington dc july 3 1862  majorgeneral george b mcclellan  yours of 530 yesterday is just received i am satisfied that yourself officers and men have done the best you could all accounts say better fighting was never done ten thousand thanks for it  on the 28th we sent general burnside an order to send all the force he could spare to you we then learned that you had requested him to go to goldsborough upon which we said to him our order was intended for your benefit and we did not wish to be in conflict with your views  we hope you will have help from him soon today we have ordered general hunter to send you all he can spare at last advices general halleck thinks he cannot send reinforcements without endangering all he has gained   a lincoln president     to general g b mcclellan  war department washington city dc july 4 1862  majorgeneral mcclellan  i understand your position as stated in your letter and by general marcy to reinforce you so as to enable you to resume the offensive within a month or even six weeks is impossible in addition to that arrived and now arriving from the potomac about 10000 men i suppose and about 10000 i hope you will have from burnside very soon and about 5000 from hunter a little later i do not see how i can send you another man within a month under these circumstances the defensive for the present must be your only care save the army first where you are if you can secondly by removal if you must you on the ground must be the judge as to which you will attempt and of the means for effecting it i but give it as my opinion that with the aid of the gunboats and the reinforcements mentioned above you can hold your present positionprovided and so long as you can keep the james river open below you if you are not tolerably confident you can keep the james river open you had better remove as soon as possible i do not remember that you have expressed any apprehension as to the danger of having your communication cut on the river below you yet i do not suppose it can have escaped your attention  yours very truly   a lincoln  psif at any time you feel able to take the offensive you are not restrained from doing so al     telegram to general h

condition as to health  general sumner as good as any part of western virginia  general heintzelman excellent for health and present health improving  general keyes a little improved but think camp is getting worse  general porter very good  general franklin not good  the president where is the enemy now  general mcclellan from four to five miles from us on all the roadsi think nearly the whole armyboth hills longstreet jackson magruder huger  the president to the corps commanders where and in what condition do you believe the enemy to be now  general sumner i think they have retired from our front were very much damaged especially in their best troops in the late actions from superiority of arms  general heintzelman dont think they are in force in our vicinity  general keyes think he has withdrawn and think preparing to go to washington  general porter believe he is mainly near richmond he feels he dare not attack us here  general franklin i learn he has withdrawn from our front and think that is probable  the president to the corps commanders what is the aggregate of your killed wounded and missing from the attack on the 26th ultimo till now       general sumner   1175

general mcclellan it would be a delicate and very difficult matter  the president to the corps commanders if it were desired to get the army away could it be safely effected  general sumner i think we could but i think we give up the cause if we do  general heintzelman perhaps we could but i think it would be ruinous to the country  general keyes i think it could if done quickly  general porter impossiblemove the army and ruin the country  general franklin i think we could and that we had betterthink rappahannock the true line  the president to the corps commanders is the army secure in its present position      general sumner perfectly so in my judgment     general heintzelman i think it is safe     general keyes with help of general b burnside can hold position     general porter

can with safety to the positions and operations within the department now under his charge   a lincoln     order concerning the southwest branch of the pacific railroad  whereas in the judgment of the president the public safety does require that the railroad line called and known as the southwest branch of the pacific railroad in the state of missouri be repaired extended and completed from rolla to lebanon in the direction to springfield in the said state the same being necessary to the successful and economical conduct of the war and to the maintenance of the authority of the government in the southwest  therefore under and in virtue of the act of congress entitled an act to authorize the president of the united states in certain cases to take possession of railroad and telegraph lines and for other purposes approved january 31 1862 it is ordered that the portion of the said railroad line which reaches from rolla to lebanon be repaired extended and completed so as to be made available for the military uses of the government as speedily as may be and inasmuch as upon the part of the said line from rolla to the stream called little piney a considerable portion of the necessary work has already been done by the railroad company and the road to this extent may be completed at comparatively small cost it is ordered that the said line from rolla to and across little piney be first completed and as soon as possible  the secretary of war is charged with the execution of this order and to facilitate the speedy execution of the work he is directed at his discretion to take possession and control of the whole or such part of the said railroad line and the whole or such part of the rolling stock offices shops buildings and all their appendages and appurtenances as he may judge necessary or convenient for the early completion of the road from rolla to lebanon  done at the city of washington july 11 1862   a lincoln     message to congress  washington d c july 11

received do you not my good friend perceive that what you ask is simply to put you in command in the west i do not suppose you desire this you only wish to control in your own localities but this you must know may derange all other posts can you not and will you not have a full conference with general halleck telegraph him and meet him at such place as he and you can agree upon i telegraph him to meet you and confer fully with you   a lincoln     telegram to general h w halleck war department july 11 1862  majorgeneral halleck corinth  governor johnson at nashville is in great trouble and anxiety about a raid into kentucky the governor is a true and valuable manindispensable to us in tennessee will you please get in communication with him and have a full conference with him before you leave for here i have telegraphed him on the subject   a lincoln     appeal to borderstates in favor of compensated emancipation  july 12 1862  gentlemenafter the adjournment of congress now very near i shall have no opportunity of seeing you for several months believing that you of the border states hold more power for good than any other equal number of members i feel it a duty which i cannot justifiably waive to make this appeal to you i intend no reproach or complaint when i assure you that in my opinion if you all had voted for the resolution in the gradualemancipation message of last march the war would now be substantially ended and the plan therein proposed is yet one of the most potent and swift means of ending it let the states which are in rebellion see definitely and certainly that in no event will the states you represent ever join their proposed confederacy and they cannot much longer maintain the contest but you cannot divest them of their hope to ultimately have you with them so long as you show a determination to perpetuate the institution within your own states beat them at elections as you have overwhelmingly done and nothing daunted they still claim you as their own you and i know what the lever of their power is break that lever before their faces and they can shake you no more forever most of you have treated me with kindness and consideration and i trust you will not now think i improperly touch what is exclusively your own when for the sake of the whole country i ask can you for your states do better than to take the course i urge discarding punctilio and maxims adapted to more manageable times and looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of our case can you do better in any possible event you prefer that the constitutional relation of the states to the nation shall be practically restored without disturbance of the institution and if this were done my whole duty in this respect under the constitution and my oath of office would be performed but it is not done and we are trying to accomplish it by war the incidents of the war cannot be avoided if the war continues long as it must if the object be not sooner attained the institution in your states will be extinguished by mere friction and abrasionby the mere incidents of the war it will be gone and you will have nothing valuable in lieu of it much of its value is gone already how much better for you and for your people to take the step which at once shortens the war and secures substantial compensation for that which is sure to be wholly lost in any other event how much better to thus save the money which else we sink forever in war how much better to do it while we can lest the war ere long render us pecuniarily unable to do it how much better for you as seller and the nation as buyer to sell out and buy out that without which the war could never have been than to sink both the thing to be sold and the price of it in cutting one anothers throats i do not speak of emancipation at once but of a decision at once to emancipate gradually room in south america for colonization can be obtained cheaply and in abundance and when numbers shall be large enough to be company and encouragement for one another the freed people will not be so reluctant to go  i am pressed with a difficulty not yet mentionedone which threatens division among those who united are none too strong an instance of it is known to you general hunter is an honest man he was and i hope still is my friend i valued him none the less for his agreeing with me in the general wish that all men everywhere could be free he proclaimed all men free within certain states and i repudiated the proclamation he expected more good and less harm from the measure than i could believe would follow yet in repudiating it i gave dissatisfaction if not offence to many whose support the country cannot afford to lose and this is not the end of it the pressure in this direction is still upon me and is increasing by conceding what i now ask you can relieve me and much more can relieve the country in this important point  upon these considerations i have again begged your attention to the message of march last before leaving the capital consider and discuss it among yourselves you are patriots and statesmen and as such i pray you consider this proposition and at the least commend it to the consideration of your states and people as you would perpetuate popular government for the best people in the world i beseech you that you do in nowise omit this our common country is in great peril demanding the loftiest views and boldest action to bring a speedy relief once relieved its form of government is saved to the world its beloved history and cherished memories are vindicated and its happy future fully assured and rendered inconceivably grand to you more than to any others the privilege is given to assure that happiness and swell that grandeur and to link your own names therewith forever     to general g b mcclellan  executive mansion washington july 13 1862  majorgeneral mcclellan  my dear siri am told that over 160000 men have

leave behind when can you reach here   a lincoln     telegram to general g b mcclellan  war department washington city july 14 1862  majorgeneral mcclellan  general burnsides force is at newport news ready to move on short notice one way or the other when ordered   a lincoln     to solomon foot  executive mansion washington july 15 1862  hon solomon foot president pro tempore of the senate  sirplease inform the senate that i shall be obliged if they will postpone the adjournment at least one day beyond the time which i understand to be now fixed for it  your obedient servant   a lincoln  the same message was addressed to hon galusha a grow speaker of the house of representatives     message to congress july 17 1862  fellowcitizens of the senate and house of representatives  i have inadvertently omitted so long to inform you that in march last mr cornelius vanderbilt of new york gratuitously presented to the united states the ocean steamer vanderbilt by many esteemed the finest merchant ship in the world she has ever since been and still is doing valuable service to the government for the patriotic act of making this magnificent and valuable present to the country i recommend that some suitable acknowledgment be made   a lincoln     message to congress july 17 1862  fellowcitizens of the senate and house of representatives  considering the bill for an act to suppress insurrection to punish treason and rebellion to seize and confiscate the property of rebels and for other purposes and the joint resolution explanatory of said act as being substantially one i have approved and signed both  before i was informed of the passage of the resolution i had prepared the draft of a message stating objections to the bill becoming a law a copy of which draft is herewith transmitted   a lincoln     fellowcitizens of the house of representatives  i herewith return to your honorable body in which it originated the bill for an act entitled an act to suppress treason and rebellion to seize and confiscate the property of rebels and for other purposes together with my objections to its becoming a law  there is much in the bill to which i perceive no objection it is wholly prospective and touches neither person nor property of any loyal citizen in which particulars it is just and proper the first and second sections provide for the conviction and punishment of persons who shall be guilty of treason and persons who shall incite set on foot assist or engage in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the united states or the laws thereof or shall give aid and comfort thereto or shall engage in or give aid and comfort to any such existing rebellion or insurrection by fair construction persons within these sections are not to be punished without regular trials in duly constituted courts under the forms and all the substantial provisions of law and of the constitution applicable to their several cases to this i perceive no objection especially as such persons would be within the general pardoning power and also the special provision for pardon and amnesty contained in this act  it is also provided that the slaves of persons convicted under these sections shall be free i think there is an unfortunate form of expression rather than a substantial objection in this it is startling to say that congress can free a slave within a state and yet if it were said the ownership of the slave had first been transferred to the nation and that congress had then liberated him the difficulty would at once vanish and this is the real case the traitor against the general government forfeits his slave at least as justly as he does any other property and he forfeits both to the government against which be offends the government so far as there can be ownership thus owns the forfeited slaves and the question for congress in regard to them is shall they be made free or be sold to new masters i perceive no objection to congress deciding in advance that they shall be free to the high honor of kentucky as i am informed she is the owner of some slaves by escheat and has sold none but liberated all i hope the same is true of some other states indeed i do not believe it will be physically possible for the general government to return persons so circumstanced to actual slavery i believe there would be physical resistance to it which could neither be turned aside by argument nor driven away by force in this view i have no objection to this feature of the bill another matter involved in these two sections and running through other parts of the act will be noticed hereafter  i perceive no objection to the third or fourth sections  so far as i wish to notice the fifth and sixth sections they may be considered together that the enforcement of these sections would do no injustice to the persons embraced within them is clear that those who make a causeless war should be compelled to pay the cost of it is too obviously just to be called in question to give governmental protection to the property of persons who have abandoned it and gone on a crusade to overthrow the same government is absurd if considered in the mere light of justice the severest justice may not always be the best policy the principle of seizing and appropriating the property of the persons embraced within these sections is certainly not very objectionable but a justly discriminating application of it would be very difficult and to a great extent impossible and would it not be wise to place a power of remission somewhere so that these persons may know they have something to lose by persisting and something to gain by desisting  a man without hope is a most dangerous manhe has nothing to lose  i am not sure whether such power of remission is or is not in section thirteen without any special act of congress i think our military commanders whenin military phrase they are within the enemys country should in an orderly manner seize and use whatever of real or personal property may be necessary or convenient for their commands at the same time preserving in some way the evidence of what they do  what i have said in regard to slaves while commenting on the first and second sections is applicable to the ninth with the difference that no provision is made in the whole act for determining whether a particular individual slave does or does not fall within the classes defined in that section he is to be free upon certain conditions but whether those conditions do or do not pertain to him no mode of ascertaining is provided this could be easily supplied  to the tenth section i make no objection the oath therein required seems to be proper and the remainder of the section is substantially identical with a law already existing  the eleventh section simply assumes to confer discretionary power upon the executive without the law i have no hesitation to go as far in the direction indicated as i may at any time deem expedient and i am ready to say nowi think it is proper for our military commanders to employ as laborers as many persons of african descent as can be used to advantage  the twelfth and thirteenth sections are something better than unobjectionable and the fourteenth is entirely proper if all other parts of the act shall stand  that to which i chiefly object pervades most parts of the act but more distinctly appears in the first second seventh and eighth sections it is the sum of those provisions which results in the divesting of title forever  for the causes of treason and ingredients of treason not amounting to the full crime it declares forfeiture extending beyond the lives of the guilty parties whereas the constitution of the united states declares that no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted true there is to be no formal attainder in this case still i think the greater punishment cannot be constitutionally inflicted in a different form for the same offence  with great respect i am constrained to say i think this feature of the act is unconstitutional it would not be difficult to modify it  i may remark that the provision of the constitution put in language borrowed from great britain applies only in this country as i understand to real or landed estate  again this act in rem forfeits property for the ingredients of treason without a conviction of the supposed criminal or a personal hearing given him in any proceeding that we may not touch property lying within our reach because we cannot give personal notice to an owner who is absent endeavoring to destroy the government is certainly not satisfactory still the owner may not be thus engaged and i think a reasonable time should be provided for such parties to appear and have personal hearings similar provisions are not uncommon in connection with proceedings in rem  for the reasons stated i return the bill to the house in which it originated     telegram to general g b mcclellan  war department washington city dc july 21 1862  majorgeneral mcclellan  this is monday i hope to be able to tell you on thursday what is to be done with burnside   a lincoln     order in regard to behavior of aliens  war department adjutantgenerals office  washington july 21 1862  the following order has been received from the president of the united states  representations have been made to the president by the ministers of various foreign powers in amity with the united states that subjects of such powers have during the present insurrection been obliged or required by military authorities to take an oath of general or qualified allegiance to this government it is the duty of all aliens residing in the united states to submit to and obey the laws and respect the authority of the government for any proceeding or conduct inconsistent with this obligation and subversive of that authority they may rightfully be subjected to military restraints when this may be necessary but they cannot be required to take an oath of allegiance to this government because it conflicts with the duty they owe to their own sovereigns all such obligations heretofore taken are therefore remitted and annulled military commanders will abstain from imposing similar obligations in future and will in lieu thereof adopt such other restraints of the character indicated as they shall find necessary convenient and effectual for the public safety it is further directed that whenever any order shall be made affecting the personal liberty of an alien reports of the same and of the causes thereof shall be made to the war department for the consideration of the department of state  by order of the secretary of war  l thomas adjutantgeneral     order authorizing employment of contrabands  war department july 22 1862  ordered  1 that military commanders within the states of virginia south carolina georgia florida alabama mississippi louisiana texas and arkansas in an orderly manner seize and use any property real or personal which may be necessary or convenient for their several commands as supplies or for other military purposes and that while property may be destroyed for proper military objects none shall be destroyed in wantonness or malice  2 that military and naval commanders shall employ as laborers within and from said states so many persons of african descent as can be advantageously used for military or naval purposes giving them reasonable wages for their labor  3 that as to both property and persons of african descent accounts shall be kept sufficiently accurate and in detail to show quantities and amounts and from whom both property and such persons shall have come as a basis upon which compensation can be made in proper cases and the several departments of this government shall attend to and perform their appropriate parts toward the execution of these orders  by order of the president edwin m stanton secretary of war     warning to rebel sympathizers  proclamation july 25 1862  the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  in pursuance of the sixth section of the act of congress entitled an act to suppress insurrection and to punish treason and rebellion to seize and confiscate property of rebels and for other purposes approved july 17 1862 and which act and the joint resolution explanatory thereof are herewith published i abraham lincoln president of the united states do hereby proclaim to and warn all persons within the contemplation of said sixth section to cease participating in aiding countenancing or abetting the existing rebellion or any rebellion against the government of the united states and to return to their proper allegiance to the united states on pain of the forfeitures and seizures as within and by said sixth section provided  in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed  done at the city of washington this twentyfifth day of july ad 1862 and of the independence of the united states the eightyseventh   a lincoln  by the president  william h seward secretary of state     hold my hand whilst the enemy stabs me  to reverdy johnson  private  executive mansion washington july 26 1862  hon reverdy johnson  my dear siryours of the 16th is received  you are ready to say i apply to friends what is due only to enemies i distrust the wisdom if not the sincerity of friends who would hold my hands while my enemies stab me this appeal of professed friends has paralyzed me more in this struggle than any other one thing you remember telling me the day after the baltimore mob in april 1861 that it would crush all union feeling in maryland for me to attempt bringing troops over maryland soil to washington i brought the troops notwithstanding and yet there was union feeling enough left to elect a legislature the next autumn which in turn elected a very excellent union united states senator i am a patient manalways willing to forgive on the christian terms of repentance and also to give ample time for repentance still i must save this government if possible what i cannot do of course i will not do but it may as well be understood once for all that i shall not surrender this game leaving any available card unplayed  yours truly   a lincoln     to cuthbert bullitt  private  washington d c july 28 1862   cuthbert bullitt esq new orleans louisiana  sirthe copy of a letter addressed to yourself by mr thomas j durant has been shown to me the writer appears to be an able a dispassionate and an entirely sincere man the first part of the letter is devoted to an effort to show that the secession ordinance of louisiana was adopted against the will of a majority of the people this is probably true and in that fact may be found some instruction why did they allow the ordinance to go into effect why did they not assert themselves why stand passive and allow themselves to be trodden down by minority why did they not hold popular meetings and have a convention of their own to express and enforce the true sentiment of the state if preorganization was against them then why not do this now that the united states army is present to protect them the paralysisthe dead palsyof the government in this whole struggle is that this class of men will do nothing for the government nothing for themselves except demanding that the government shall not strike its open enemies lest they be struck by accident  mr durant complains that in various ways the relation of master and slave is disturbed by the presence of our army and he considers it particularly vexatious that this in part is done under cover of an act of congress while constitutional guaranties are suspended on the plea of military necessity the truth is that what is done and omitted about slaves is done and omitted on the same military necessity it is a military necessity to have men and money and we can get neither in sufficient numbers or amounts if we keep from or drive from our lines slaves coming to them mr durant cannot be ignorant of the pressure in this direction nor of my efforts to hold it within bounds till he and such as he shall have time to help themselves  i am not posted to speak understandingly on all the police regulations of which mr durant complains if experience shows any one of them to be wrong let them be set right i think i can perceive in the freedom of trade which mr durant urges that he would relieve both friends and enemies from the pressure of the blockade by this he would serve the enemy more effectively than the enemy is able to serve himself i do not say or believe that to serve the enemy is the purpose of mr durant or that he is conscious of any purpose other than national and patriotic ones still if there were a class of men who having no choice of sides in the contest were anxious only to have quiet and comfort for themselves while it rages and to fall in with the victorious side at the end of it without loss to themselves their advice as to the mode of conducting the contest would be precisely such as his is he speaks of no dutyapparently thinks of noneresting upon union men he even thinks it injurious to the union cause that they should be restrained in trade and passage without taking sides they are to touch neither a sail nor a pump but to be merely passengersdeadheads at thatto be carried snug and dry throughout the storm and safely landed right side up nay more even a mutineer is to go untouched lest these sacred passengers receive an accidental wound of course the rebellion will never be suppressed in louisiana if the professed union men there will neither help to do it nor permit the government to do it without their help now i think the true remedy is very different from what is suggested by mr durant it does not lie in rounding the rough angles of the war but in removing the necessity for the war the people of louisiana who wish protection to person and property have but to reach forth their hands and take it let them in good faith reinaugurate the national authority and set up a state government conforming thereto under the constitution they know how to do it and can have the protection of the army while doing it the army will be withdrawn so soon as such state government can dispense with its presence and the people of the state can then upon the old constitutional terms govern themselves to their own liking this is very simple and easy  if they will not do thisif they prefer to hazard all for the sake of destroying the governmentit is for them to consider whether it is probable i will surrender the government to save them from losing all if they decline what i suggest you scarcely need to ask what i will do what would you do in my position would you drop the war where it is or would you prosecute it in future with elderstalk squirts charged with rose water would you deal lighter blows rather than heavier ones would you give up the contest leaving any available means unapplied i am in no boastful mood i shall not do more than i can and i shall do all i can to save the government which is my sworn duty as well as my personal inclination i shall do nothing in malice what i deal with is too vast for malicious dealing  yours truly   a lincoln     to loyal governors  war department washington dc  july 28 1862  governors of all loyal states  it would be of great service here for us to know as fully as you can tell what progress is made and making in recruiting for old regiments in your state also about what day the first regiments can move with you what the second what the third and so on this information is important to us in making calculations please give it as promptly and accurately as you call   a lincoln     broken eggs cannot be mended  extract from letter to august belmont  july 31 1862  broken eggs cannot be mended but louisiana has nothing to do now but to take her place in the union as it was barring the already broken eggs the sooner she does so the smaller will be the amount of that which will be past mending this government cannot much longer play a game in which it stakes all and its enemies stake nothing those enemies must understand that they cannot experiment for ten years trying to destroy the government and if they fail still come back into the union unhurt if they expect in any contingency to ever have the union as it was i join with the writer in saying now is the time  how much better it would have been for the writer to have gone at this under the protection of the army at new orleans than to have sat down in a closet writing complaining letters northward  yours truly  a lincoln     to count gasparin  executive mansion washington  august 4 1863  to count a de gasparin  dear siryour very acceptable letter dated orbe canton de vaud switzerland 18th of july 1862 is received the moral effect was the worst of the affair before richmond and that has run its course downward we are now at a stand and shall soon be rising again as we hope i believe it is true that in men and material the enemy suffered more than we in that series of conflicts while it is certain that he is less able to bear it  with us every soldier is a man of character and must be treated with more consideration than is customary in europe hence our great army for slighter causes than could have prevailed there has dwindled rapidly bringing the necessity for a new call earlier than was anticipated we shall easily obtain the new levy however be not alarmed if you shall learn that we shall have resorted to a draft for part of this it seems strange even to me but it is true that the government is now pressed to this course by a popular demand thousands who wish not to personally enter the service are nevertheless anxious to pay and send substitutes provided they can have assurance that unwilling persons similarly situated will be compelled to do likewise besides this volunteers mostly choose to enter newly forming regiments while drafted men can be sent to fill up the old ones wherein man for man they are quite doubly as valuable  you ask why is it that the north with her great armies so often is found with inferiority of numbers face to face with the armies of the south while i painfully know the fact a military man which i am not would better answer the question the fact i know has not been overlooked and i suppose the cause of its continuance lies mainly in the other facts that the enemy holds the interior and we the exterior lines and that we operate where the people convey information to the enemy while he operates where they convey none to us  i have received the volume and letter which you did me the honor of addressing to me and for which please accept my sincere thanks you are much admired in america for the ability of your writings and much loved for your generosity to us and your devotion to liberal principles generally  you are quite right as to the importance to us for its bearing upon europe that we should achieve military successes and the same is true for us at home as well as abroad yet it seems unreasonable that a series of successes extending through half a year and clearing more than 100000 square miles of country should help us so little while a single halfdefeat should hurt us so much but let us be patient  i am very happy to know that my course has not conflicted with your judgment of propriety and policy i can only say that i have acted upon my best convictions without selfishness or malice and that by the help of god i shall continue to do so  please be assured of my highest respect and esteem   a lincoln     speech at a war meeting washington august 6 1862  fellow citizens i believe there is no precedent for my appearing before you on this occasion but it is also true that there is no precedent for your being here yourselves and i offer in justification of myself and of you that upon examination i have found nothing in the constitution against it i however have an impression that there are younger gentlemen who will entertain you better and better address your understanding than i will or could and therefore i propose but to detain you a moment longer i am very little inclined on any occasion to say anything unless i hope to produce some good by it the only thing i think of just now not likely to be better said by some one else is a matter in which we have heard some other persons blamed for what i did myself there has been a very widespread attempt to have a quarrel between general mcclellan and the secretary of war now i occupy a position that enables me to believe that these two gentlemen are not nearly so deep in the quarrel as some presuming to be their friends general mcclellans attitude is such that in the very selfishness of his nature he cannot but wish to be successfuland i hope he willand the secretary of war is precisely in the same situation if the military commanders in the field cannot be successful not only the secretary of war but myself for the time being the master of both cannot but be failures i know general mcclellan wishes to be successful and i know he does not wish it any more than the secretary of war for him and both of them together no more than i wish it sometimes we have a dispute about how many men general mcclellan has had and those who would disparage him say he has had a very large number and those who would disparage the secretary of war insist that general mcclellan has had a very small number the basis for this is there is always a wide difference and on this occasion perhaps a wider one between the grand total on mcclellans rolls and the men actually fit for duty and those who would disparage him talk of the grand total on paper and those who would disparage the secretary of war talk of those at present fit for duty general mcclellan has sometimes asked for things that the secretary of war did not give him general mcclellan is not to blame for asking for what he wanted and needed and the secretary of war is not to blame for not giving when he had none to give and i say here so far as i know the secretary of war has withheld no one thing at any time in my power to give him i have no accusation against him i believe he is a brave and able man and i stand here as justice requires me to do to take upon myself what has been charged on the secretary of war as withholding from him i have talked longer than i expected to do and now i avail myself of my privilege of saying no more     telegram to governor andrew august 12 1862  war department washington city dc  governor andrew

 would the completion of the railroad some distance farther in the direction of springfield mo be of any military advantage to you please answer   a lincoln     address on colonization to a deputation of colored men  washington thursday august 14 1862  this afternoon the president of the united states gave an audience to a committee of colored men at the white house they were introduced by rev j mitchell commissioner of emigration e m thomas the chairman remarked that they were there by invitation to hear what the executive had to say to them  having all been seated the president after a few preliminary observations informed them that a sum of money had been appropriated by congress and placed at his disposition for the purpose of aiding the colonization in some country of the people or a portion of them of african descent thereby making it his duty as it had for a long time been his inclination to favor that cause and why he asked should the people of your race be colonized and where why should they leave this country this is perhaps the first question for proper consideration you and we are different races we have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races whether it is right or wrong i need not discuss but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both as i think your race suffer very greatly many of them by living among us while ours suffer from your presence in a word we suffer on each side if this is admitted it affords a reason at least why we should be separated you here are free men i suppose  a voiceyes sir  perhaps you have long been free or all your lives your race are suffering in my judgment the greatest wrong inflicted on any people but even when you cease to be slaves you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race you are cut off from many of the advantages which the other race enjoys the aspiration of men is to enjoy equality with the best when free but on this broad continent not a single man of your race is made the equal of a single man of ours go where you are treated the best and the ban is still upon you i do not propose to discuss this but to present it as a fact with which we have to deal i cannot alter it if i would it is a fact about which we all think and feel alike i and you we look to our condition owing to the existence of the two races on this continent i need not recount to you the effects upon white men growing out of the institution of slavery  i believe in its general evil effects on the white race see our present conditionthe country engaged in warwhite men cutting one anothers throatsnone knowing how far it will extendand then consider what we know to be the truth but for your race among us there could not be war although many men engaged on either side do not care for you one way or the other nevertheless i repeat without the institution of slavery and the colored race as a basis the war could not have an existence it is better for us both therefore to be separated i know that there are free men among you who even if they could better their condition are not as much inclined to go out of the country as those who being slaves could obtain their freedom on this condition i suppose one of the principal difficulties in the way of colonization is that the free colored man cannot see that his comfort would be advanced by it you may believe that you can live in washington or elsewhere in the united states the remainder of your life as easily perhaps more so than you can in any foreign country and hence you may come to the conclusion that you have nothing to do with the idea of going to a foreign country  this is i speak in no unkind sense an extremely selfish view of the case you ought to do something to help those who are not so fortunate as yourselves there is an unwillingness on the part of our people harsh as it may be for you free colored people to remain with us now if you could give a start to the white people you would open a wide door for many to be made free if we deal with those who are not free at the beginning and whose intellects are clouded by slavery we have very poor material to start with if intelligent colored men such as are before me would move in this matter much might be accomplished  it is exceedingly important that we have men at the beginning capable of thinking as white men and not those who have been systematically oppressed there is much to encourage you for the sake of your race you should sacrifice something of your present comfort for the purpose of being as grand in that respect as the white people it is a cheering thought throughout life that something can be done to ameliorate the condition of those who have been subject to the hard usages of the world it is difficult to make a man miserable while he feels he is worthy of himself and claims kindred to the great god who made him in the american revolutionary war sacrifices were made by men engaged in it but they were cheered by the future general washington himself endured greater physical hardships than if he had remained a british subject yet he was a happy man because he had engaged in benefiting his race in doing something for the children of his neighbors having none of his own  the colony of liberia has been in existence a long time in a certain sense it is a success the old president of liberia roberts has just been with methe first time i ever saw him he says they have within the bounds of that colony between three and four hundred thousand people or more than in some of our old states such as rhode island or delaware or in some of our newer states and less than in some of our larger ones they are not all american colonists or their descendants something less than 12000 have been sent thither from this country many of the original settlers have died yet like people elsewhere their offspring outnumber those deceased the question is if the colored people are persuaded to go anywhere why not there  one reason for unwillingness to do so is that some of you would rather remain within reach of the country of your nativity i do not know how much attachment you may have toward our race it does not strike me that you have the greatest reason to love them but still you are attached to them at all events  the place i am thinking about for a colony is in central america it is nearer to us than liberia not much more than one fourth as far as liberia and within seven days run by steamers unlike liberia it is a great line of travelit is a highway the country is a very excellent one for any people and with great natural resources and advantages and especially because of the similarity of climate with your native soil thus being suited to your physical condition the particular place i have in view is to be a great highway from the atlantic or caribbean sea to the pacific ocean and this particular place has all the advantages for a colony on both sides there are harborsamong the finest in the world again there is evidence of very rich coalmines a certain amount of coal is valuable in any country why i attach so much importance to coal is it will afford an opportunity to the inhabitants for immediate employment till they get ready to settle permanently in their homes if you take colonists where there is no good landing there is a bad show and so where there is nothing to cultivate and of which to make a farm but if something is started so that you can get your daily bread as soon as reach you there it is a great advantage coal land is the best thing i know of with which to commence an enterprise to returnyou have been talked to upon this subject and told that a speculation is intended by gentlemen who have an interest in the country including the coalmines we have been mistaken all our lives if we do not know whites as well as blacks look to their selfinterest unless among those deficient of intellect everybody you trade with makes something you meet with these things here and everywhere if such persons have what will be an advantage to them the question is whether it cannot be made of advantage to you you are intelligent and know that success does not so much depend on external help as on selfreliance much therefore depends upon yourselves as to the coalmines i think i see the means available for your selfreliance i shall if i get a sufficient number of you engaged have provision made that you shall not be wronged if you will engage in the enterprise i will spend some of the money intrusted to me i am not sure you will succeed the government may lose the money but we cannot succeed unless we try and we think with care we can succeed the political affairs in central america are not in quite as satisfactory a condition as i wish there are contending factions in that quarter but it is true all the factions are agreed alike on the subject of colonization and want it and are more generous than we are here  to your colored race they have no objection i would endeavor to have you made the equals and have the best assurance that you should be the equals of the best  the practical thing i want to ascertain is whether i can get a number of ablebodied men with their wives and children who are willing to go when i present evidence of encouragement and protection could i get a hundred tolerably intelligent men with their wives and children and able to cut their own fodder so to speak can i have fifty if i could find twentyfive ablebodied men with a mixture of women and childrengood things in the family relation i thinki could make a successful commencement i want you to let me know whether this can be done or not this is the practical part of my wish to see you these are subjects of very great importance worthy of a months study instead of a speech delivered in an hour i ask you then to consider seriously not pertaining to yourselves merely nor for your race and ours for the present time but as one of the things if successfully managed the good of mankindnot confined to the present generation but as    from age to age descends the lay    to millions yet to be    till far its echoes roll away    into eternity  the above is merely given as the substance of the presidents remarks  the chairman of the delegation briefly replied that they would hold a consultation and in a short time give an answer  the president said take your full timeno hurry at all  the delegation then withdrew     telegram to officer at camp chase ohio  war department washington d c august 14 1862

you say i have not meant to leave any one in doubt  i would save the union i would save it the shortest way under the constitution the sooner the national authority can be restored the nearer the union will be the union as it was if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time save slavery i do not agree with them if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery i do not agree with them my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and is not either to save or destroy slavery if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could do it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save this union and what i forbear i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union i shall do less whenever i shall believe what i am doing hurts the cause and i shall do more whenever i shall believe doing more will help the cause i shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors and i shall adopt new

my anxious desire to afford as far as possible the means and power of the federal government to protect the state of pennsylvania from invasion by the rebel forces and since in your judgment the militia of the state are required and have been called upon by you to organize for home defense and protection i sanction the call that you have made and will receive them into the service and pay of the united states to the extent they can be armed equipped and usefully employed the arms and equipments now belonging to the general government will be needed for the troops called out for the national armies so that arms can only be furnished for the quota of militia furnished by the draft of nine months men heretofore ordered but as arms may be supplied by the militia under your call these with the 30000 in your arsenal will probably be sufficient for the purpose contemplated by your call you will be authorized to provide such equipments as may be required according to the regulations of the united states service which upon being turned over to the united states quartermasters department will be paid for at regulation prices or the rates allowed by the department for such articles railroad transportation will also be paid for as in other cases such general officers will be supplied as the exigencies of the service will permit  yours truly   a lincoln     telegram

corroborates the idea that the enemy is crossing the potomac please do not let him get off without being hurt   a lincoln      but he did dw     reply to request the president issue a proclamation of emancipation  a committee from the religious denominations of chicago    september 131862  the subject presented in the memorial is one upon which i have thought much for weeks past and i may even say for months i am approached with the most opposite opinions and advice and that by religious men who are equally certain that they represent the divine will i am sure that either the one or the other class is mistaken in that belief and perhaps in some respects both i hope it will not be irreverent for me to say that if it is probable that god would reveal his will to others on a point so connected with my duty it might be supposed he would reveal it directly to me for unless i am more deceived in myself than i often am it is my earnest desire to know the will of providence in this matter and if i can learn what it is i will do it these are not however the days of miracles and i suppose it will be granted that i am not to expect a direct revelation i must study the plain physical facts of the case ascertain what is possible and learn what appears to be wise and right  the subject is difficult and good men do not agree for instance the other day four gentlemen of standing and intelligence from new york called as a delegation on business connected with the war but before leaving two of them earnestly besought me to proclaim general emancipation upon which the other two at once attacked them you know also that the last session of congress had a decided majority of antislavery men yet they could not unite on this policy and the same is true of the religious people why the rebel soldiers are praying with a great deal more earnestness i fear than our own troops and expecting god to favor their side for one of our soldiers who had been taken prisoner told senator wilson a few days since that he met nothing so discouraging as the evident sincerity of those he was among in their prayers but we will talk over the merits of the case  what good would a proclamation of emancipation from me do especially as we are now situated i do not want to issue a document that the whole world will see must necessarily be inoperative like the popes bull against the comet would my word free the slaves when i cannot even enforce the constitution in the rebel states is there a single court or magistrate or individual that would be influenced by it there and what reason is there to think it would have any greater effect upon the slaves than the late law of congress which i approved and which offers protection and freedom to the slaves of rebel masters who come within our lines yet i cannot learn that that law has caused a single slave to come over to us and suppose they could be induced by a proclamation of freedom from me to throw themselves upon us what should we do with them how can we feed and care for such a multitude general butler wrote me a few days since that he was issuing more rations to the slaves who have rushed to him than to all the white troops under his command they eat and that is all though it is true general butler is feeding the whites also by the thousand for it nearly amounts to a famine there if now the pressure of the war should call off our forces from new orleans to defend some other point what is to prevent the masters from reducing the blacks to slavery again for i am told that whenever the rebels take any black prisoners free or slave they immediately auction them off they did so with those they took from a boat that was aground in the tennessee river a few days ago and then i am very ungenerously attacked for it for instance when after the late battles at and near bull run an expedition went out from washington under a flag of truce to bury the dead and bring in the wounded and the rebels seized the blacks who went along to help and sent them into slavery horace greeley said in his paper that the government would probably do nothing about it what could i do  now then tell me if you please what possible result of good would follow the issuing of such a proclamation as you desire understand i raise no objections against it on legal or constitutional grounds for as commanderinchief of the army and navy in time of war i suppose i have a right to take any measure which may best subdue the enemy nor do i urge objections of a moral nature in view of possible consequences of insurrection and massacre at the south i view this matter as a practical war measure to be decided on according to the advantages or disadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the rebellion  i admit that slavery is the root of the rebellion or at least its sine qua non the ambition of politicians may have instigated them to act but they would have been impotent without slavery as their instrument i will also concede that emancipation would help us in europe and convince them that we are incited by something more than ambition i grant further that it would help somewhat at the north though not so much i fear as you and those you represent imagine still some additional strength would be added in that way to the war and then unquestionably it would weaken the rebels by drawing off their laborers which is of great importance but i am not so sure we could do much with the blacks if we were to arm them i fear that in a few weeks the arms would be in the hands of the rebels and indeed thus far we have not had arms enough to equip our white troops i will mention another thing though it meet only your scorn and contempt there are fifty thousand bayonets in the union armies from the border slave states it would be a serious matter if in consequence of a proclamation such as you desire they should go over to the rebels i do not think they all wouldnot so many indeed as a year ago or as six months agonot so many today as yesterday every day increases their union feeling they are also getting their pride enlisted and want to beat the rebels let me say one thing more i think you should admit that we already have an important principle to rally and unite the people in the fact that constitutional government is at stake this is a fundamental idea going down about as deep as anything  do not misunderstand me because i have mentioned these objections they indicate the difficulties that have thus far prevented my action in some such way as you desire i have not decided against a proclamation of liberty to the slaves but hold the matter under advisement and i can assure you that the subject is on my mind by day and night more than any other whatever shall appear to be gods will i will do i trust that in the freedom with which i have canvassed your views i have not in any respect injured your feelings     telegram to general h g wright  war department

hereafter as heretofore the war will be prosecuted for the object of practically restoring the constitutional relation between the united states and each of the states and the people thereof in which states that relation is or may be suspended or disturbed  that it is my purpose upon the next meeting of congress to again recommend the adoption of a practical measure tendering pecuniary aid to the free acceptance or rejection of all slave states so called the people whereof may not then be in rebellion against the united states and which states may then have voluntarily adopted or thereafter may voluntarily adopt immediate or gradual abolishment of slavery within their respective limits and that the effort to colonize persons of african descent with their consent upon this continent or elsewhere with the previously obtained consent of the governments existing there will be continued  that on the 1st day of january ad 1863 all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states shall be then thenceforward and forever free and the executive government of the united states including the military and naval authority thereof will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons and will do no act or acts to repress such persons or any of them in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom   that the executive will on the 1st day of january aforesaid by proclamation designate the states and parts of states if any in which the people thereof respectively shall then be in rebellion against the united states and the fact that any state or the people thereof shall on that day be in good faith represented in the congress of the united states by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such state shall have participated shall in the absence of strong countervailing testimony be deemed conclusive evidence that such state and the people thereof are not then in rebellion against the united states  that attention is hereby called to an act of congress entitled an act to make an additional article of war approved march 13 1862 and which act is in the words and figure following  be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled that hereafter the following shall be promulgated as an additional article of war for the government of the army of the united states and shall be obeyed and observed as such  art all officers or persons in the military or naval service of the united states are prohibited from employing any of the forces under their respective commands for the purpose of returning fugitives from service or labor who may have escaped from any person to whom such service or labor is claimed to be due and any officer who shall be found guilty by a courtmartial of violating this article shall be dismissed from the service  sec 2 and be it further enacted that this act shall take effect from and after its passage  also to the ninth and tenth sections of an act entitled an act to suppress insurrection to punish treason and rebellion to seize and confiscate the property of rebels and for other purposes approved july 17 1862 and which sections are in the words and figures following   sec 9 and be it further enacted that all slaves of persons who shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against the government of the united states or who shall in any way give aid or comfort thereto escaping from such persons and taking refuge within the lines of the army and all slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them and coming under the control of the government of the united states and all slaves of such persons found on or being within any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by the forces of the united states shall be deemed captives of war and shall be forever free of their servitude and not again held as slaves  sec 9 and be it further enacted that no slave escaping into any state territory or the district of columbia from any other state shall be delivered up or in any way impeded or hindered of his liberty except for crime or some offence against the laws unless the person claiming said fugitive shall first make oath that the person to whom the labor or service of such fugitive is alleged to be due is his lawful owner and has not borne arms against the united states in the present rebellion nor in any way given aid and comfort thereto and no person engaged in the military or naval service of the united states shall under any pretense whatever assume to decide on the validity of the claim of any person to the service or labor of any other person or surrender up any such person to the claimant on pain of being dismissed from the service  and i do hereby enjoin upon and order all persons engaged in the military and naval service of the united states to observe obey and enforce within their respective spheres of service the act and sections above recited  and the executive will in due time recommend that all citizens of the united states who shall have remained loyal thereto throughout the rebellion shall upon the restoration of the constitutional relation between the united states and their respective states and people if that relation shall have been suspended or disturbed be compensated for all losses by acts of the united states including the loss of slaves  in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed

lincoln  by the president william h seward secretary of state     proclamation suspending the writ of habeas corpus  september 24 1862  the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  whereas it has become necessary to call into service not only volunteers but also portions of the militia of the states by draft in order to suppress the insurrection existing in the united states and disloyal persons are not adequately restrained by the ordinary processes of law from hindering this measure and from giving aid and comfort in various ways to the insurrection  now therefore be it ordered  first that during the existing insurrection and as a necessary measure for suppressing the same all rebels and insurgents their aiders and abettors within the united states and all persons discouraging volunteer enlistments resisting militia drafts or guilty of any disloyal practice affording aid and comfort to rebels against the authority of the united states shall be subject to martial law and liable to trial and punishment by courtsmartial or military commissions  second that the writ of habeas corpus is suspended in respect to all persons arrested or who are now or hereafter during the rebellion shall be imprisoned in any fort camp arsenal military prison or other place of confinement by any military authority or by the sentence of any courtmartial or military commission  in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed  done at the city of washington this twentyfourth day of september ad eighteen hundred and sixtytwo and of the independence of the united states the eightyseventh   a lincoln  by the president  william h seward secretary of state     reply to serenade september 24 1862  i appear before you to do little more than acknowledge the courtesy you pay me and to thank you for it i have not been distinctly informed why it is that on this occasion you appear to do me this honor though i suppose it is because of the proclamation what i did i did after a very full deliberation and under a very heavy and solemn sense of responsibility i can only trust in god i have made no mistake i shall make no attempt on this occasion to sustain what i have done or said by any comment it is now for the country and the world to pass judgment and maybe take action upon it  i will say no more upon this subject in my position i am environed with difficulties yet they are scarcely so great as the difficulties of those who upon the battlefield are endeavoring to purchase with their blood and their lives the future happiness and prosperity of this country let us never forget them on the fourteenth and seventeenth days of this present month there have been battles bravely skillfully and successfully fought we do not yet know the particulars let us be sure that in giving praise to certain individuals we do no injustice to others i only ask you at the conclusion of these few remarks to give three hearty cheers for all good and brave officers and men who fought those successful battles     record explaining the dismissal of major john j key  from the military service of the united states  executive mansion washington  september 26 1862  major john j key  i am informed that in answer to the question why was not the rebel army bagged immediately after the battle near sharpsburg propounded to you by major levi c turner judge advocate etc you said that is not the game the object is that neither army shall get much advantage of the other that both shall be kept in the field till they are exhausted when we will make a compromise and save slavery  i shall be very happy if you will within twentyfour hours from the receipt of this prove to me by major turner that you did not either literally or in substance make the answer stated  above delivered to major key at 1025 am september 27th  at about 11 oclock am september 27 1862 major key and major turner appeared before me major turner says  as i remember it the conversation was why did we not bag them after the battle of sharpsburg major keys reply was that was not the game that we should tire the rebels out and ourselves that that was the only way the union could be preserved we come together fraternally and slavery be saved  on crossexamination major turner says he has frequently heard major key converse in regard to the present troubles and never heard him utter a sentiment unfavorable to the maintenance of the union he has never uttered anything which he major t would call disloyalty the particular conversation detailed was a private one             indorsement on the above  in my view it is wholly inadmissible for any gentleman holding a military commission from the united states to utter such sentiments as major key is within proved to have done therefore let major john j key be forthwith dismissed from the military service of the united states   a lincoln     to hannibal hamlin  strictly private  executive mansion washington  september 28 1862  hon hannibal hamlin  my dear sir your kind letter of the 25th is just received it is known to some that while i hope something from the proclamation my expectations are not as sanguine as are those of some friends the time for its effect southward has not come but northward the effect should be instantaneous it is six days old and while commendation in newspapers and by distinguished individuals is all that a vain man could wish the stocks have declined and troops come forward more slowly than ever this looked soberly in the face is not very satisfactory we have fewer troops in the field at the end of the six days than we had at the beginningthe attrition among the old outnumbering the addition by the new the north responds to the proclamation sufficiently in breath but breath alone kills no rebels  i wish i could write more cheerfully nor do i thank you the less for the kindness of your letter  yours very truly   a lincoln     to general halleck  mcclellans headquarters october 3 1862  majorgeneral halleck  general stuart of the rebel army has sent in a few of our prisoners under a flag of truce paroled with terms to prevent their fighting the indians and evidently seeking to commit us to their right to parole prisoners in that way my inclination is to send the prisoners back with a definite notice that we will recognize no paroles given to our prisoners by the rebels as extending beyond a prohibition against fighting them though i wish your opinion upon it based both upon the general law and our cartel i wish to avoid violations of the law and bad faith answer as quickly as possible as the thing if done at all should be done at once   a lincoln president     remarks to the army of the potomac at frederick maryland  october 4 1862  i am surrounded by soldiers and a little farther off by the citizens of this good city of frederick nevertheless i can only say as i did five minutes ago it is not proper for me to make speeches in my present position i return thanks to our soldiers for the good services they have rendered the energy they have shown the hardships they have endured and the blood they have shed for this union of ours and i also return thanks not only to the soldiers but to the good citizens of frederick and to the good men women and children in this land of ours for their devotion to this glorious cause and i say this with no malice in my heart towards those who have done otherwise may our children and childrens children for a thousand generations continue to enjoy the benefits conferred upon us by a united country and have cause yet to rejoice under these glorious institutions bequeathed to us by washington and his compeers now my friends soldiers and citizens i can only say once morefarewell     telegram from general halleck  to general g b mcclellan washington d c october 6 1862  majorgeneral mcclellan  i am instructed to telegraph you as follows the president directs that you cross the potomac and give battle to the enemy or drive him south your army must move now while the roads are good if you cross the river between the enemy and washington and cover the latter by your operation you can be reinforced by thirty thousand men if you move up the valley of the shenandoah not more than twelve or fifteen thousand can be sent you the president advises the interior line between washington and the enemy but does not order it he is very desirous that your army move as soon as possible you will immediately report what line you adopt and when you intend to cross the river also to what point the reinforcements are to be sent it is necessary that the plan of your operations be positively determined on before orders are given for building bridges and repairing railroads i am directed to add that the secretary of war and the generalinchief fully concur with the president in these directions  h w halleck generalinchief     telegram to general mcclellan  executive mansion washington october 7 1862  majorgeneral mcclellan hdqs army of the potomac  you wish to see your family and i wish to oblige you it might be left to your own discretion certainly so if mrs m could meet you here at washington   a lincoln     to t h clay  war department october 8 1862  thomas h clay cincinnati ohio  you cannot have reflected seriously when you ask that i shall order general morgans command to kentucky as a favor because they have marched from cumberland gap the precedent established by it would evidently break up the whole army buells old troops now in pursuit of bragg have done more hard marching recently and in fact if you include marching and fighting there are scarcely any old troops east or west of the mountains that have not done as hard service i sincerely wish war was an easier and pleasanter business than it is but it does not admit of holidays on morgans command where it is now sent as i understand depends the question whether the enemy will get to the ohio river in another place   a lincoln     telegram to general u s grant  washington dc october 8 1862  majorgeneral grant  i congratulate you and all concerned in your recent battles and victories how does it all sum up i especially regret the death of general hackleman and am very anxious to know the condition of general oglesby who is an intimate personal friend   a lincoln     telegram to general j t boyle  war department october 111862 4 pm  general boyle louisville kentucky  please send any news you have from general buell today   a lincoln     telegram to general j t boyle  war department october 12 1862 410 pm  general boyle louisville kentucky  we are anxious to hear from general buells army we have heard nothing since day before yesterday have you anything   a lincoln     telegram to general curtis  washington d c october 12 1862  majorgeneral curtis saint louis missouri  would the completion of the railroad some distance further in the direction of springfield mo be of any military advantage to you please answer   a lincoln     to general g b mcclellan  executive mansion washington october 13 1862  my dear siryou remember my speaking to you of what i called your overcautiousness are you not overcautious when you assume that you cannot do what the enemy is constantly doing should you not claim to be at least his equal in prowess and act upon the claim  as i understand you telegraphed general halleck that you cannot subsist your army at winchester unless the railroad from harpers ferry to that point be put in working order but the enemy does now subsist his army at winchester at a distance nearly twice as great from railroad transportation as you would have to do without the railroad last named he now wagons from culpepper courthouse which is just about twice as far as you would have to do from harpers ferry he is certainly not more than half as well provided with wagons as you are i certainly should be pleased for you to have the advantage of the railroad from harpers perry to winchester but it wastes an the remainder of autumn to give it to you and in fact ignores the question of time which cannot and must not be ignored  again one of the standard maxims of war as you know is to operate upon the enemys communications as much as possible without exposing your own you seem to act as if this applies against you but cannot apply in your favor change positions with the enemy and think you not he would break your communication with richmond within the next twentyfour hours you dread his going into pennsylvania but if he does so in full force he gives up his communications to you absolutely and you have nothing to do but to follow and ruin him if he does so with less than full force fall upon and beat what is left behind all the easier  exclusive of the water line you are now nearer to richmond than the enemy is by the route that you can and he must take why can you not reach there before him unless you admit that he is more than your equal on a march his route is the arc of a circle while yours is the chord the roads are as good on yours as on his  you know i desired but did not order you to cross the potomac below instead of above the shenandoah and blue ridge my idea was that this would at once menace the enemys communications which i would seize if he would permit if he should move northward i would follow him closely holding his communications if he should prevent our seizing his communications and move toward richmond i would press closely to him fight him if a favorable opportunity should present and at least try to beat him to richmond on the inside track i say try if we never try we shall never succeed if he makes a stand at winchester moving neither north or south i would fight him there on the idea that if we cannot beat him when he bears the wastage of coming to us we never can when we bear the wastage of going to him this proposition is a simple truth and is too important to be lost sight of for a moment in coming to us he tenders us an advantage which we should not waive we should not so operate as to merely drive him away as we must beat him somewhere or fail finally we can do it if at all easier near to us than far away if we cannot beat the enemy where he now is we never can he again being within the entrenchments of richmond  and indeed the enemy was let back into richmond and it took another two years and thousands of dead for mcclelland cowardiceif that was all that it was i still suspect and i think the evidence is overwhelming that he was either secretly a supporter of the south or what is more likely a politician readying for a different campaign that of the presidency of the united states  recurring to the idea of going to richmond on the inside track the facility of supplying from the side away from the enemy is remarkable as it were by the different spokes of a wheel extending from the hub toward the rim and this whether you move directly by the chord or on the inside arc hugging the blue ridge more closely the chord line as you see carries you by aldie hay market and fredericksburg and you see how turnpikes railroads and finally the potomac by aquia creek meet you at all points from washington the same only the lines lengthened a little if you press closer to the blue ridge part of the way  the gaps through the blue ridge i understand to be about the following distances from harpers ferry to wit vestals 5 miles gregorys 13 snickers 18 ashbys 28 manassas 38 chester 45 and thorntons 53 i should think it preferable to take the route nearest the enemy disabling him to make an important move without your knowledge and compelling him to keep his forces together for dread of you the gaps would enable you to attack if you should wish for a great part of the way you would be practically between the enemy and both washington and richmond enabling us to spare you the greatest number of troops from here when at length running for richmond ahead of him enables him to move this way if he does so turn and attack him in rear but i think he should be engaged long before such a point is reached it is all easy if our troops march as well as the enemy and it is unmanly to say they cannot do it this letter is in no sense an order  yours truly   a

whether i am mistaken in this   a lincoln     executive order establishing a provisional court in louisiana  executive mansion washington city  october 20 1862  the insurrection which has for some time prevailed in several of the states of this union including louisiana having temporarily subverted and swept away the civil institutions of that state including the judiciary and the judicial authorities of the union so that it has become necessary to hold the state in military occupation and it being indispensably necessary that there shall be some judicial tribunal existing there capable of administering justice i have therefore thought it proper to appoint and i do hereby constitute a provisional court which shall be a court of record for the state of louisiana and i do hereby appoint charles a peabody of new york to be a provisional judge to hold said court with authority to hear try and determine all causes civil and criminal including causes in law equity revenue and admiralty and particularly all such powers and jurisdiction as belong to the district and circuit courts of the united states conforming his proceedings so far as possible to the course of proceedings and practice which has been customary in the courts of the united states and louisiana his judgment to be final and conclusive and i do hereby authorize and empower the said judge to make and establish such rules and regulations as may be necessary for the exercise of his jurisdiction and empower the said judge to appoint a prosecuting attorney marshal and clerk of the said court who shall perform the functions of attorney marshal and clerk according to such proceedings and practice as before mentioned and such rules and regulations as may be made and established by said judge these appointments are to continue during the pleasure of the president not extending beyond the military occupation of the city of new orleans or the restoration of the civil authority in that city and in the state of louisiana these officers shall be paid out of the contingent fund of the war department compensation as follows  the judge at the rate of 3500 per annum the prosecuting attorney including the fees at the rate of 3000 per annum the marshal including the fees at the rate of 3000 per annum and the clerk including the fees at the rate of 2500 per annum such compensations to be certified by

have sent to the army every fresh horse we possibly could amounting in the whole to 7918 that the cavalry horses were too much fatigued to move presents a very cheerless almost hopeless prospect for the future and it may have forced something of impatience in my despatch if not recruited and rested then when could they ever be i suppose the river is rising and i am glad to believe you are

order made general halleck went to the secretary of war with it stating his approval of the plan the secretary assented and general halleck wrote the order it was a military question which the

sections of the said act of congress and the attorneygeneral is authorized and required to give to the attorneys and marshals of the united states such instructions and directions as he may find needful and convenient touching all such seizures prosecutions and condemnations and moreover to authorize all such attorneys and marshals whenever there may be reasonable ground to fear any forcible resistance to them in the discharge of their respective duties in this behalf to call upon any military officer in command of the forces of the united states to give to them such aid protection and

in the service of god and their country without abandoning themselves to vice and immorality the first general order issued by the father of his country after the declaration of independence indicates

f shepley  dear sirdr kennedy bearer of this has some apprehension that federal officers not citizens of louisiana may be set up as candidates for congress in that state in my view there could be no possible object in such an election we do not particularly need members of congress from there to enable us to get along with legislation here what we do want is the conclusive evidence that respectable citizens of louisiana are willing to be members of congress and to swear support to the constitution and that other respectable citizens there are willing to vote for them and send them to send a parcel of northern men here as representatives elected as would be understood and perhaps really so at the point of the bayonet would be disgusting and outrageous and were i a member of congress here i would vote against admitting any such man to a seat  yours very truly   a lincoln     order prohibiting the export of arms and munitions of war  executive mansion washington  november

banksearly last week you left me in high hope with your assurance that you would be off with your expedition at the end of that week or early in this it is now the end of this and i have just been overwhelmed and confounded with the sight of a requisition made by you which i am assured cannot be filled and got off within an hour short of two months i enclose you a copy of the requisition in some hope that it is not genuinethat you have never seen it my dear general this expanding and piling up of impedimenta has been so far almost our ruin and will be our final ruin if it is not abandoned if you had the articles of this requisition upon the wharf with the necessary animals to make them of any use and forage for the animals you could not get vessels together in two weeks to carry the whole to say nothing of your twenty thousand men and having the vessels you could not put the cargoes aboard in two weeks more and after all where you are going you have no use for them when you parted with me you had no such ideas in your mind i know you had not or you could not have expected to be off so soon as you said you must get back to something like the plan you had then or your expedition is a failure before you start you must be off before congress meets you would be better off anywhere and especially where you are going for not having a thousand wagons doing nothing but hauling forage to feed the animals that draw them and taking at least two thousand men to care for the wagons and animals who otherwise might be two thousand good soldiers now dear general do not think this is an illnatured letter it is the very reverse the simple publication of this requisition would ruin you  very truly your friend   a lincoln     to carl schurz  executive mansion washington november 24 1862  general carl schurz  my dear siri have just received and read your letter of the 20th the purport of it is that we lost the late elections and the administration is failing because the war is unsuccessful and that i must not flatter myself that i am not justly to blame for it i certainly know that if the war fails the administration fails and that i will be blamed for it whether i deserve it or not and i ought to be blamed if i could do better you think i could do better therefore you blame me already i think i could not do better therefore i blame you for blaming me i understand you now to be willing to accept the help of men who are not republicans provided they have heart in it agreed i want no others but who is to be the judge of hearts or of heart in it if i must discard my own judgment and take yours i must also take that of others and by the time i should reject all i should be advised to reject i should have none left republicans or others not even yourself for be assured my dear sir there are men who have heart in it that think you are performing your part as poorly as you think i am performing mine i certainly have been dissatisfied with the slowness of buell and mcclellan but before i relieved them i had great fears i should not find successors to them who would do better and i am sorry to add that i have seen little since to relieve those fears  i do not see clearly the prospect of any more rapid movements i fear we shall at last find out that the difficulty is in our case rather than in particular generals i wish to disparage no one certainly not those who sympathize with me but i must say i need success more than i need sympathy and that i have not seen the so much greater evidence of getting success from my sympathizers than from those who are denounced as the contrary it does seem to me that in the field the two classes have been very much alike in what they have done and what they have failed to do in sealing their faith with their blood baker and lyon and bohien and richardson republicans did all that men could do but did they any more than kearny and stevens and reno and mansfield none of whom were republicans and some at least of whom have been bitterly and repeatedly denounced to me as secession sympathizers i will not perform the ungrateful task of comparing cases of failure  in answer to your question has it not been publicly stated in the newspapers and apparently proved as a fact that from the commencement of the war the enemy was continually supplied with information by some of the confidential subordinates of as important an officer as adjutantgeneral thomas i must say no as far as my knowledge extends and i add that if you can give any tangible evidence upon the subject i will thank you to come to this city and do so  very truly your friend   a lincoln     telegram to general a e burnside  executive mansion washington november 25 1862  majorgeneral burnside falmouth virginia  if i should be in boat off aquia creek at dark tomorrow wednesday evening could you without inconvenience meet me and pass an hour or two with me   a lincoln     to attorneygeneral bates  executive mansion washington  november 29 1862  hon attorneygeneral  my dear sirfew things perplex me more than this question between governor gamble and the war department as to whether the peculiar force organized by the former in missouri are state troops or united states troops now this is either an immaterial or a mischievous question first if no more is desired than to have it settled what name the force is to be called by it is immaterial secondly if it is desired for more than the fixing a name it can only be to get a position from which to draw practical inferences then it is mischievous instead of settling one dispute by deciding the question i should merely furnish a nestfull of eggs for hatching new disputes i believe the force is not strictly either state troops or united states troops it is of mixed character i therefore think it is safer when a practical question arises to decide that question directly and not indirectly by deciding a general abstraction supposed to include it and also including a great deal more without dispute governor gamble appoints the officers of this force and fills vacancies when they occur the question now practically in dispute is can governor gamble make a vacancy by removing an officer or accepting a resignation now while it is proper that this question shall be settled i do not perceive why either governor gamble or the government here should care which way it is settled i am perplexed with it only because there seems to be pertinacity about it it seems to me that it might be either way without injury to the service or that the offer of the secretary of war to let governor gamble make vacancies and he the secretary to ratify the making of them ought to be satisfactory  yours truly  a lincoln     telegram to general curtis  cipher

last annual assembling another year of health and bountiful harvests has passed and while it has not pleased the almighty to bless us with a return of peace we can but press on guided by the best light he gives us trusting that in his own good time and wise way all will yet be well  the correspondence touching foreign affairs which has taken place during the last year is herewith submitted in virtual compliance with a request to that effect made by the house of representatives near the close of the last session of congress  if the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at former periods it is certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are might reasonably have apprehended in the month of june last there were some grounds to expect that the maritime powers which at the beginning of our domestic difficulties so unwisely and unnecessarily as we think recognized the insurgents as a belligerent would soon recede from that position which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to our own country but the temporary reverses which afterward befell the national arms and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens abroad have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice  the civil war which has so radically changed for the moment the occupations and habits of the american people has necessarily disturbed the social condition and affected very deeply the prosperity of the nations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily increasing throughout a period of half a century it has at the same time excited political ambitions and apprehensions which have produced a profound agitation throughout the civilized world in this unusual agitation we have forborne from taking part in any controversy between foreign states and between parties or factions in such states we have attempted no propagandism and acknowledged no revolution but we have left to every nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own affairs our struggle has been of course contemplated by foreign nations with reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and often exaggerated effects and consequences resulting to those nations themselves nevertheless complaint on the part of this government even if it were just would certainly be unwise  the treaty with great britain for the suppression of the slave trade has been put into operation with a good prospect of complete success it is an occasion of special pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it on the part of her majestys government has been marked with a jealous respect for the authority of the united states and the rights of their moral and loyal citizens  the convention with hanover for the abolition of the state dues has been carried into full effect under the act of congress for that purpose  a blockade of 3000 miles of seacoast could not be established and vigorously enforced in a season of great commercial activity like the present without committing occasional mistakes and inflicting unintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their subjects  a civil war occurring in a country where foreigners reside and carry on trade under treaty stipulations is necessarily fruitful of complaints of the violation of neutral rights all such collisions tend to excite misapprehensions and possibly to produce mutual reclamations between nations which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship in clear cases of these kinds i have so far as possible heard and redressed complaints which have been presented by friendly powers there is still however a large and an augmenting number of doubtful cases upon which the government is unable to agree with the governments whose protection is demanded by the claimants there are moreover many cases in which the united states or their citizens suffer wrongs from the naval or military authorities of foreign nations which the governments of those states are not at once prepared to redress i have proposed to some of the foreign states thus interested mutual conventions to examine and adjust such complaints this proposition has been made especially to great britain to france to spain and to prussia in each case it has been kindly received but has not yet been formally adopted  i deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in behalf of the owners of the norwegian bark admiral p tordenskiold which vessel was in may 1861 prevented by the commander of the blockading force off charleston from leaving that port with cargo notwithstanding a similar privilege had shortly before been granted to an english vessel i have directed the secretary of state to cause the papers in the case to be communicated to the proper committees  applications have been made to me by many free americans of african descent to favor their emigration with a view to such colonization as was contemplated in recent acts of congress other parties at home and abroadsome from interested motives others upon patriotic considerations and still others influenced by philanthropic sentimentshave suggested similar measures while on the other hand several of the spanish american republics have protested against the sending of such colonies to their respective territories under these circumstances i have declined to move any such colony to any state without first obtaining the consent of its government with an agreement on its part to receive and protect such emigrants in all the rights of freemen and i have at the same time offered to the several states situated within the tropics or having colonies there to negotiate with them subject to the advice and consent of the senate to favor the voluntary emigration of persons of that class to their respective territories upon conditions which shall be equal just and humane liberia and haiti are as yet the only countries to which colonists of african descent from here could go with certainty of being received and adopted as citizens and i regret to say such persons contemplating colonization do not seem so willing to migrate to those countries as to some others nor so willing as i think their interest demands i believe however opinion among them in this respect is improving and that ere long there will be an augmented and considerable migration to both these countries from the united states  the new commercial treaty between the united states and the sultan of turkey has been carried into execution  a commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated subject to the senates consent with liberia and a similar negotiation is now pending with the republic of haiti a considerable improvement of the national commerce is expected to result from these measures  our relations with great britain france spain portugal russia prussia denmark sweden austria the netherlands italy rome and the other european states remain undisturbed very favorable relations also continue to be maintained with turkey morocco china and japan  during the last year there has not only been no change of our previous relations with the independent states of our own continent but more friendly sentiments than have heretofore existed are believed to be entertained by these neighbors whose safety and progress are so intimately connected with our own this statement especially applies to mexico nicaragua costa rica honduras peru and chile  the commission under the convention with the republic of new granada closed its session without having audited and passed upon all the claims which were submitted to it a proposition is pending to revive the convention that it may be able to do more complete justice the joint commission between the united states and the republic of costa rica has completed its labors and submitted its report  i have favored the project for connecting the united states with europe by an atlantic telegraph and a similar project to extend the telegraph from san francisco to connect by a pacific telegraph with the line which is being extended across the russian empire  the territories of the united states with unimportant exceptions have remained undisturbed by the civil war and they are exhibiting such evidence of prosperity as justifies an expectation that some of them will soon be in a condition to be organized as states and be constitutionally admitted into the federal union  the immense mineral resources of some of those territories ought to be developed as rapidly as possible every step in that direction would have a tendency to improve the revenues of the government and diminish the burdens of the people it is worthy of your serious consideration whether some extraordinary measures to promote that end cannot be adopted the means which suggests itself as most likely to be effective is a scientific exploration of the mineral regions in those territories with a view to the publication of its results at home and in foreign countriesresults which cannot fail to be auspicious  the condition of the finances win claim your most diligent consideration the vast expenditures incident to the military and naval operations required for the suppression of the rebellion have hitherto been met with a promptitude and certainty unusual in similar circumstances and the public credit has been fully maintained the continuance of the war however and the increased disbursements made necessary by the augmented forces now in the field demand your best reflections as to the best modes of providing the necessary revenue without injury to business and with the least possible burdens upon labor  the suspension of specie payments by the banks soon after the commencement of your last session made large issues of united states notes unavoidable in no other way could the payment of troops and the satisfaction of other just demands be so economically or so well provided for the judicious legislation of congress securing the receivability of these notes for loans and internal duties and making them a legal tender for other debts has made them an universal currency and has satisfied partially at least and for the time the longfelt want of an uniform circulating medium saving thereby to the people immense sums in discounts and exchanges  a return to specie payments however at the earliest period compatible with due regard to all interests concerned should ever be kept in view fluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious and to reduce these fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a leading purpose in wise legislation convertibility prompt and certain convertibility into coin is generally acknowledged to be the best and surest safeguard against them and it is extremely doubtful whether a circulation of united states notes payable in coin and sufficiently large for the wants of the people can be permanently usefully and safely maintained  is there then any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public wants can be made and the great advantages of a safe and uniform currency secured  i know of none which promises so certain results and is at the same time so unobjectionable as the organization of banking associations under a general act of congress well guarded in its provisions to such associations the government might furnish circulating notes on the security of united states bonds deposited in the treasury these notes prepared under the supervision of proper officers being uniform in appearance and security and convertible always into coin would at once protect labor against the evils of a vicious currency and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe exchanges  a moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate the united states for the preparation and distribution of the notes and a general supervision of the system and would lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employed as securities the public credit moreover would be greatly improved and the negotiation of new loans greatly facilitated by the steady market demand for government bonds which the adoption of the proposed system would create  it is an additional recommendation of the measure of considerable weight in my judgment that it would reconcile as far as possible all existing interests by the opportunity offered to existing institutions to reorganize under the act substituting only the secured uniform national circulation for the local and various circulation secured and unsecured now issued by them  the receipts into the treasury from all sources including loans and balance from the preceding year for the fiscal year ending on the 30th june 1862 were 58388524706 of which sum 4905639762 were derived from customs 179533173 from the direct tax from public lands 15220377 from miscellaneous sources 93178764 from loans in all forms 52969246050 the remainder 225706580 was the balance from last year  the disbursements during the same period were for congressional executive and judicial purposes 593900929 for foreign intercourse 133971035 for miscellaneous expenses including the mints loans postoffice deficiencies collection of revenue and other like charges 1412977150 for expenses under the interior department 310298552 under the war department 39436840736 under the navy department 4267456969 for interest on public debt 1319032445 and for payment of public debt including reimbursement of temporary loan and redemptions 9609692209 making an aggregate of 57084170025 and leaving a balance in the treasury on the 1st day of july 1862 of 1304354681  it should be observed that the sum of 9609692209 expended for reimbursements and redemption of public debt being included also in the loans made may be properly deducted both from receipts and expenditures leaving the actual receipts for the year 48778832497 and the expenditures 47474477816  other information on the subject of the finances will be found in the report of the secretary of the treasury to whose statements and views i invite your most candid and considerate attention  the reports of the secretaries of war and of the navy are herewith transmitted these reports though lengthy are scarcely more than brief abstracts of the very numerous and extensive transactions and operations conducted through those departments nor could i give a summary of them here upon any principle which would admit of its being much shorter than the reports themselves i therefore content myself with laying the reports before you and asking your attention to them  it gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in the financial condition of the postoffice department as compared with several preceding years the receipts for the fiscal year 1861 amounted to 834929640 which embraced the revenue from all the states of the union for three quarters of that year notwithstanding the cessation of revenue from the socalled seceded states during the last fiscal year the increase of the correspondence of the loyal states has been sufficient to produce a revenue during the same year of 829982090 being only 50000 less than was derived from all the states of the union during the previous year the expenditures show a still more favorable result the amount expended in 1861 was 1360675911 for the last year the amount has been reduced to 1112536413 showing a decrease of about 2481000 in the expenditures as compared with the preceding year and about 3750000 as compared with the fiscal year 1860 the deficiency in the department for the previous year was 455196698 for the last fiscal year it was reduced to 211281457 these favorable results are in part owing to the cessation of mail service in the insurrectionary states and in part to a careful review of all expenditures in that department in the interest of economy the efficiency of the postal service it is believed has also been much improved the postmastergeneral has also opened a correspondence through the department of state with foreign governments proposing a convention of postal representatives for the purpose of simplifying the rates of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign mails this proposition equally important to our adopted citizens and to the commercial interests of this country has been favorably entertained and agreed to by all the governments from whom replies have been received  i ask the attention of congress to the suggestions of the postmastergeneral in his report respecting the further legislation required in his opinion for the benefit of the postal service  the secretary of the interior reports as follows in regard to the public lands  the public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue from the 1st july 1861 to the 30th september 1862 the entire cash receipts from the sale of lands were 1374762a sum much less than the expenses of our land system during the same period the homestead law which will take effect on the 1st of january next offers such inducements to settlers that sales for cash cannot be expected to an extent sufficient to meet the expenses of the general land office and the cost of surveying and bringing the land into market  the discrepancy between the sum here stated as arising from the sales of the public lands and the sum derived from the same source as reported from the treasury department arises as i understand from the fact that the periods of time though apparently were not really coincident at the beginning point the treasury report including a considerable sum now which had previously been reported from the interior sufficiently large to greatly overreach the sum derived from the three months now reported upon by the interior and not by the treasury  the indian tribes upon our frontiers have during the past year manifested a spirit of insubordination and at several points have engaged in open hostilities against the white settlements in their vicinity the tribes occupying the indian country south of kansas renounced their allegiance to the united states and entered into treaties with the insurgents those who remained loyal to the united states were driven from the country the chief of the cherokees has visited this city for the purpose of restoring the former relations of the tribe with the united states he alleges that they were constrained by superior force to enter into treaties with the insurgents and that the united states neglected to furnish the protection which their treaty stipulations required  in the month of august last the sioux indians in minnesota attacked the settlements in their vicinity with extreme ferocity killing indiscriminately men women and children this attack was wholly unexpected and therefore no means of defense had been provided it is estimated that not less than 800 persons were killed by the indians and a large amount of property was destroyed how this outbreak was induced is not definitely known and suspicions which may be unjust need not to be stated information was received by the indian bureau from different sources about the time hostilities were commenced that a simultaneous attack was to be made upon white settlements by all the tribes between the mississippi river and the rocky mountains the state of minnesota has suffered great injury from this indian war a large portion of her territory has been depopulated and a severe loss has been sustained by the destruction of property the people of that state manifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond the limits of the state as a guaranty against future hostilities the commissioner of indian affairs will furnish full details i submit for your especial consideration whether our indian system shall not be remodeled many wise and good men have impressed me with the belief that this can be profitably done  i submit a statement of the proceedings of commissioners which shows the progress that has been made in the enterprise of constructing the pacific railroad and this suggests the earliest completion of this road and also the favorable action of congress upon the projects now pending before them for enlarging the capacities of the great canals in new york and illinois as being of vital and rapidly increasing importance to the whole nation and especially to the vast interior region hereinafter to be noticed at some greater length i purpose having prepared and laid before you at an early day some interesting and valuable statistical information upon this subject the military and commercial importance of enlarging the illinois and michigan canal and improving the illinois river is presented in the report of colonel webster to the secretary of war and now transmitted to congress i respectfully ask attention to it  to carry out the provisions of the act of congress of the 15th of may last i have caused the department of agriculture of the united states to be organized  the commissioner informs me that within the period of a few months this department has established an extensive system of correspondence and exchanges both at home and abroad which promises to effect highly beneficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent improvements in agriculture in the introduction of new products and in the collection of the agricultural statistics of the different states  also that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely seeds cereals plants and cuttings and has already published and liberally diffused much valuable information in anticipation of a more elaborate report which will in due time be furnished embracing some valuable tests in chemical science now in progress in the laboratory  the creation of this department was for the more immediate benefit of a large class of our most valuable citizens and i trust that the liberal basis upon which it has been organized will not only meet your approbation but that it will realize at no distant day all the fondest anticipations of its most sanguine friends and become the fruitful source of advantage to all our people  on the 22d day of september last a proclamation was issued by the executive a copy of which is herewith submitted  in accordance with the purpose expressed in the second paragraph of that paper i now respectfully recall your attention to what may be called compensated emancipation  a nation may be said to consist of its territory its people and its laws the territory is the only part which is of certain durability one generation passeth away and another generation cometh but the earth abideth forever it is of the first importance to duly consider and estimate this ever enduring part that portion of the earths surface which is owned and inhabited by the people of the united states is well adapted to be the home of one national family and it is not well adapted for two or more its vast extent and its variety of climate and productions are of advantage in this age for one people whatever they might have been in former ages steam telegraphs and intelligence have brought these to be an advantageous combination for one united people  in the inaugural address i briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of disunion as a remedy for the differences between the people of the two sections i did so in language which i cannot improve and which therefore i beg to repeat  one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended this is the only substantial dispute the fugitiveslave clause of the constitution and the laws for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced perhaps as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases and a few break over in each this i think cannot be perfectly cured and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before the foreign slave trade now imperfectly suppressed would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section while fugitive slaves now only partially surrendered would not be surrendered at all by the other  physically speaking we can not separate we can not remove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between them a husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other but the different parts of our country cannot do this they cannot but remain face to face and intercourse either amicable or hostile must continue between them is it possible then to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends suppose you go to war you cannot fight always and when after much loss on both sides and no gain on either you cease fighting the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you  there is no line straight or crooked suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide trace through from east to west upon the line between the free and slave country and we shall find a little more than one third of its length are rivers easy to be crossed and populated or soon to be populated thickly upon both sides while nearly all its remaining length are merely surveyors lines over which people may walk back and forth without any consciousness of their presence no part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on paper or parchment as a national boundary the fact of separation if it comes gives up on the part of the seceding section the fugitiveslave clause along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section seceded from while i should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be made to take its place  but there is another difficulty the great interior region bounded east by the alleghenies north by the british dominions west by the rocky mountains and south by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets and which includes part of virginia part of tennessee all of kentucky ohio indiana michigan wisconsin illinois missouri kansas iowa minnesota and the territories of dakota nebraska and part of colorado already has above 10000000 people and will have 50000000 within fifty years if not prevented by any political folly or mistake it contains more than one third of the country owned by the united statescertainly more than 1000000 square miles once half as populous as massachusetts already is it would have more than 75000000 people a glance at the map shows that territorially speaking it is the great body of the republic the other parts are but marginal borders to it the magnificent region sloping west from the rocky mountains to the pacific being the deepest and also the richest in undeveloped resources in the production of provisions grains grasses and all which proceed from them this great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the world ascertain from statistics the small proportion of the region which has yet been brought into cultivation and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of products and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect presented and yet this region has no seacoasttouches no ocean anywhere as part of one nation its people now find and may forever find their way to europe by new york to south america and africa by new orleans and to asia by san francisco but separate our common country into two nations as designed by the present rebellion and every man of this great interior region is thereby cut off from some one or more of these outlets not perhaps by a physical barrier but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations  and this is true wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed place it between the now free and slave country or place it south of kentucky or north of ohio and still the truth remains that none south of it can trade to any port or place north of it and none north of it can trade to any port or place south of it except upon terms dictated by a government foreign to them these outlets east west and south are indispensable to the wellbeing of the people inhabiting and to inhabit this vast interior region which of the three may be the best is no proper question all are better than either and all of right belong to that people and to their successors forever true to themselves they will not ask where a line of separation shall be but will vow rather that there shall be no such line  nor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to and through them to the great outside world they too and each of them must have access to this egypt of the west without paying toll at the crossing of any national boundary  our national strife springs not from our permanent part not from the land we inhabit not from our national homestead there is no possible severing of this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us in all its adaptations and aptitudes it demands union and abhors separation in fact it would ere long force reunion however much of blood and treasure the separation might have cost  our strife pertains to ourselvesto the passing generations of menand it can without convulsion be hushed forever with the passing of one generation  in this view i recommend the adoption of the following resolution and articles amendatory to the constitution of the united states  resolved by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled two thirds of both houses concurring that the following articles be proposed to the legislatures or conventions of the several states as amendments to the constitution of the united states all or any of which articles when ratified by three fourths of the said legislatures or conventions to be valid as part or parts of the said constitution viz  artevery state wherein slavery now exists which shall abolish the same therein at any time or times before the 1st day of january ad 1900 shall receive compensation from the united states as follows to wit  the president of the united states shall deliver to every such state bonds of the united states bearing interest at the rate of  per cent per annum to an amount equal to the aggregate sum of  for each slave shown to have been therein by the eighth census of the united states said bonds to be delivered to such state by instalments or in one parcel at the completion of the abolishment accordingly as the same shall have been gradual or at one time within such state and interest shall begin to run upon any such bond only from the proper time of its delivery as aforesaid any state having received bonds as aforesaid and afterwards reintroducing or tolerating slavery therein shall refund to the united states the bonds so received or the value thereof and all interest paid thereon  artall slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the chances of the war at any time before the end of the rebellion shall be forever free but all owners of such who shall not have been disloyal shall be compensated for them at the same rates as is provided for states adopting abolishment of slavery but in such way that no slave shall be twice accounted for  artcongress may appropriate money and otherwise provide for colonizing free colored persons with their own consent at any place or places without the united states  i beg indulgence to discuss these proposed articles at some length without slavery the rebellion could never have existed without slavery it could not continue  among the friends of the union there is great diversity of sentiment and of policy in regard to slavery and the african race amongst us some would perpetuate slavery some would abolish it suddenly and without compensation some would abolish it gradually and with compensation some would remove the freed people from us and some would retain them with us and there are yet other minor diversities because of these diversities we waste much strength in struggles among ourselves by mutual concession we should harmonize and act together this would be compromise but it would be compromise among the friends and not with the enemies of the union these articles are intended to embody a plan of such mutual concessions if the plan shall be adopted it is assumed that emancipation will follow at least in several of the states  as to the first article the main points are first the emancipation secondly the length of time for consummating it thirtyseven years and thirdly the compensation  the emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual slavery but the length of time should greatly mitigate their dissatisfaction the time spares both races from the evils of sudden derangementin fact from the necessity of any derangementwhile most of those whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measure will have passed away before its consummation they will never see it another class will hail the prospect of emancipation but will deprecate the length of time they will feel that it gives too little to the now living slaves but it really gives them much it saves them from the vagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate emancipation in localities where their numbers are very great and it gives the inspiring assurance that their posterity shall be free forever the plan leaves to each state choosing to act under it to abolish slavery now or at the end of the century or at any intermediate tune or by degrees extending over the whole or any part of the period and it obliges no two states to proceed alike it also provides for compensation and generally the mode of making it this it would seem must further mitigate the dissatisfaction of those who favor perpetual slavery and especially of those who are to receive the compensation doubtless some of those who are to pay and not to receive will object yet the measure is both just and economical in a certain sense the liberation of slaves is the destruction of propertyproperty acquired by descent or by purchase the same as any other property it is no less true for having been often said that the people of the south are not more responsible for the original introduction of this property than are the people of the north and when it is remembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar and share the profits of dealing in them it may not be quite safe to say that the south has been more responsible than the north for its continuance if then for a common object this property is to be sacrificed is it not just that it be done at a common charge  and if with less money or money more easily paid we can preserve the benefits of the union by this means than we can by the war alone is it not also economical to do it let us consider it then let us ascertain the sum we have expended in the war since compensated emancipation was proposed last march and consider whether if that measure had been promptly accepted by even some of the slave states the same sum would not have done more to close the war than has been otherwise done if so the measure would save money and in that view would be a prudent and economical measure certainly it is not so easy to pay something as it is to pay nothing but it is easier to pay a large sum than it is to pay a larger one and it is easier to pay any sum when we are able than it is to pay it before we are able the war requires large sums and requires them at once the aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation of course would be large but it would require no ready cash nor the bonds even any faster than the emancipation progresses this might not and probably would not close before the end of the thirtyseven years at that time we shall probably have a hundred millions of people to share the burden instead of thirtyone millions as now and not only so but the increase of our population may be expected to continue for a long time after that period as rapidly as before because our territory will not have become full i do not state this inconsiderately at the same ratio of increase which we have maintained on an average from our first national census in 1790 until that of 1860 we should in 1900 have a population of 103208415 and why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period our abundant room our broad national homestead is our ample resource were our territory as limited as are the british isles very certainly our population could not expand as stated instead of receiving the foreign born as now we should be compelled to send part of the native born away but such is not our condition we have 2963000 square miles europe has 3800000 with a population averaging 73 persons to the square mile why may not our country at some time average as many is it less fertile has it more waste surface by mountains rivers lakes deserts or other causes is it inferior to europe in any natural advantage if then we are at some time to be as populous as europe how soon as to when this may be we can judge by the past and the present as to when it will be if ever depends much on whether we maintain the union            a page of tables of projected statistics  these figures show that our country may be as populous as europe now is at some point between 1920 and 1930 say about 1925our territory at 73 persons to the square mile being of capacity to contain 217186000  and we will reach this too if we do not ourselves relinquish the chance by the folly and evils of disunion or by long and exhausting war springing from the only great element of national discord among us while it cannot be foreseen exactly how much one huge example of secession breeding lesser ones indefinitely would retard population civilization and prosperity no one can doubt that the extent of it would be very great and injurious  the proposed emancipation would shorten the war perpetuate peace insure this increase of population and proportionately the wealth of the country with these we should pay all the emancipation would cost together with our other debt easier than we should pay our other debt without it if we had allowed our old national debt to run at six per cent per annum simple interest from the end of our revolutionary struggle until today without paying anything on either principal or interest each man of us would owe less upon that debt now than each man owed upon it then and this because our increase of men through the whole period has been greater than six per centhas run faster than the interest upon the debt thus time alone relieves a debtor nation so long as its population increases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its debt  this fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly due but it shows the great importance of time in this connectionthe great advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number 100000000 what by a different policy we would have to pay now when we number but 31000000 in a word it shows that a dollar will be much harder to pay for the war than will be a dollar for emancipation on the proposed plan and then the latter will cost no blood no precious life it will be a saving of both  as to the second article i think it would be impracticable to return to bondage the class of persons therein contemplated some of them doubtless in the property sense belong to loyal owners and hence provision is made in this article for compensating such  the third article relates to the future of the freed people it does not oblige but merely authorizes congress to aid in colonizing such as may consent this ought nut to be regarded as objectionable on the one hand or on the other insomuch as it comes to nothing unless by the mutual consent of the people to be deported and the american voters through their representatives in congress  i cannot make it better known than it already is that i strongly favor colonization and yet i wish to say there is an objection urged against free colored persons remaining in the country which is largely imaginary if not sometimes malicious  it is insisted that their presence would injure and displace white labor and white laborers if there ever could be a proper time for mere catch arguments that time surely is not now in times like the present men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through time and in eternity is it true then that colored people can displace any more white labor by being free than by remaining slaves if they stay in their old places they jostle no white laborers if they leave their old places they leave them open to white laborers logically there is neither more nor less of it emancipation even without deportation would probably enhance the wages of white labor and very surely would not reduce them thus the customary amount of labor would still have to be performed the freed people would surely not do more than their old proportion of it and very probably for a time would do less leaving an increased part to white laborers bringing their labor into greater demand and consequently enhancing the wages of it with deportation even to a limited extent enhanced wages to white labor is mathematically certain labor is like any other commodity in the marketincrease the demand for it and you increase the price of it reduce the supply of black labor by colonizing the black laborer out of the country and by precisely so much you increase the demand for and wages of white labor  but it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the whole land are they not already in the land will liberation make them any more numerous equally distributed among the whites of the whole country and there would be but one colored to seven whites could the one in any way greatly disturb the seven there are many communities now having more than one free colored person to seven whites and this without any apparent consciousness of evil from it the district of columbia and the states of maryland and delaware are all in this condition the district has more than one free colored to six whites and yet in its frequent petitions to congress i believe it has never presented the presence of free colored persons as one of its grievances but why should emancipation south send the free people north people of any color seldom run unless there be something to run from heretofore colored people to some extent have fled north from bondage and now perhaps from both bondage and destitution but if gradual emancipation and deportation be adopted they will have neither to flee from their old masters will give them wages at least until new laborers can be procured and the freedmen in turn will gladly give their labor for the wages till new homes can be found for them in congenial climes and with people of their own blood and race this proposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved and in any event cannot the north decide for itself whether to receive them  again as practice proves more than theory in any case has there been any irruption of colored people northward because of the abolishment of slavery in this district last spring  what i have said of the proportion of free colored persons to the whites in the district is from the census of 1860 having no reference to persons called contrabands nor to those made free by the act of congress abolishing slavery here  the plan consisting of these articles is recommended not but that a restoration of the national authority would be accepted without its adoption  nor will the war nor proceedings under the proclamation of september 22 1862 be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan its timely adoption i doubt not would bring restoration and thereby stay both  and notwithstanding this plan the recommendation that congress provide by law for compensating any state which may adopt emancipation before this plan shall have been acted upon is hereby earnestly renewed such would be only an advance part of the plan and the same arguments apply to both  this plan is recommended as a means not in exclusion of but additional to all others for restoring and preserving the national authority throughout the union the subject is presented exclusively in its economical aspect the plan would i am confident secure peace more speedily and maintain it more permanently than can be done by force alone while all it would cost considering amounts and manner of payment and times of payment would be easier paid than will be the additional cost of the war if we rely solely upon force it is much very much that it would cost no blood at all  the plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law it cannot become such without the concurrence of first two thirds of congress and afterwards three fourths of the states the requisite three fourths of the states will necessarily include seven of the slave states their concurrence if obtained will give assurance of their severally adopting emancipation at no very distant day upon the new constitutional terms this assurance would end the struggle now and save the union forever  i do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to the congress of the nation by the chief magistrate of the nation nor do i forget that some of you are my seniors nor that many of you have more experience than i in the conduct of public affairs yet i trust that in view of the great responsibility resting upon me you will perceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness i may seem to display  is it doubted then that the plan i propose if adopted would shorten the war and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood is it doubted that it would restore the national authority and national prosperity and perpetuate both indefinitely is it doubted that we herecongress and executivecan secure its adoption will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us can we can they by any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital objects we can succeed only by concert it is not can any of us imagine better but can we all do better object whatsoever is possible still the question recurs can we do better the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present the occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion as our case is new so we must think anew and act anew we must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country  fellowcitizens we can not escape history we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation we say we are for the union the world will not forget that we say this we know how to save the union the world knows we do know how to save it we even we here hold the power and bear the responsibility in giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the freehonorable alike in what we give and what we preserve we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth other means may succeed this could not fail the way is plain peaceful generous justa way which if followed the world will forever applaud and god must forever bless   a lincoln     message to congress  washington december 3 1862  to the senate and house of representatives  on the 3d of november 1861 a collision took place off the coast of cuba between the united states war steamer san jacinto and the french brig jules et marie resulting in serious damage to the latter the obligation of this government to make amends therefor could not be questioned if the injury resulted from any fault on the part of the san jacinto with a view to ascertain this the subject was referred to a commission of the united states and french naval officers at new york with a naval officer of italy as an arbiter the conclusion arrived at was that the collision was occasioned by the failure of the san jacinto seasonably to reverse her engine it then became necessary to ascertain the amount of indemnification due to the injured party the united states consulgeneral at havana was consequently instructed to confer with the consul of france on this point and they have determined that the sum of 9500 is an equitable allowance under the circumstances  i recommend an appropriation of this sum for the benefit of the owners of the jules et marie  a copy of the letter of mr shufeldt the consulgeneral of the united states at havana to the secretary of state on the subject is herewith transmitted   a lincoln     telegram to

him in the late remarkable battle between the united states ironclad steamer monitor under his command and the rebel ironclad steamer merrimac in march last  the thanks of congress for his services on the occasion referred to were tendered by a resolution approved july 11 1862 but the recommendation is now specially made in order to comply with the requirements of the ninth section of the act of july 16 1862 which is in the following words viz  that any line officer of the navy or marine corps may be advanced one grade if upon recommendation of the president by name he receives the thanks of

illinois in relation to the mccallister and stebbins bonds i promised him that upon certain conditions i would ask members of the legislature to give him a full and fair hearing of his case i do not now remember nor have i time to recall exactly what the conditions were nor whether they were completely performed but there can be in no case any harm in his having a full and fair hearing and i sincerely wish it may be given him  yours truly   a lincoln     message to the senate  december 11 1862  to the senate of the united states  in compliance with your resolution of december 5 1862 requesting the president to furnish the senate with all information in his possession touching the late indian barbarities in the state of minnesota and also the evidence in his possession upon which some of the principal actors and head men were tried and condemned to death i have the honor to state that on receipt of said resolution i transmitted the same to the secretary of the interior accompanied by a note a copy of which is herewith inclosed marked a and in response to which i received through that department a letter of the commissioner of indian affairs a copy of which is herewith inclosed marked b  i further state that on the eighth day of november last i received a long telegraphic despatch from majorgeneral pope at st paul minnesota simply announcing the names of the persons sentenced to be hanged i immediately telegraphed to have transcripts of the records in all cases forwarded to me which transcripts however did not reach me until two or three days before the present meeting of congress meantime i received through telegraphic despatches and otherwise appeals in behalf of the condemned appeals for their execution and expressions of opinion as to the proper policy in regard to them and to the indians generally in that vicinity none of which as i understand falls within the scope of your inquiry after the arrival of the transcripts of records but before i had sufficient opportunity to examine them i received a joint letter from one of the senators and two of the representatives from minnesota which contains some statements of fact not found in the records of the trials and for which reason i herewith transmit a copy marked c i also for the same reason inclose a printed memorial of the citizens of st paul addressed to me and forwarded with the letter aforesaid  anxious to not act with so much clemency as to encourage another outbreak on the one hand nor with so much severity as to be real cruelty on the other i caused a careful examination of the records of trials to be made in view of first ordering the execution of such as had been proved guilty of violating females contrary to my expectation only two of this class were found i then directed a further examination and a classification of all who were proven to have participated in massacres as distinguished from participation in battles this class numbered forty and included the two convicted of female violation one of the number is strongly recommended by the commission which tried them for commutation to ten years imprisonment i have ordered the other thirtynine to be executed on friday the 19th instant the order was despatched from here on monday the 8th instant by a messenger to general sibley and a copy of which order is herewith transmitted marked d  an abstract of the evidence as to the forty is herewith inclosed marked e  to avoid the immense amount of copying i lay before the senate the original transcripts of the records of trials as received by me  this is as full and complete a response to the resolution as it is in my power to make   a lincoln     message to congress  december 12 1862  fellowcitizens of the senate and house of

by majorgeneral benjamin f butler if they or any of them shall be by congress disposed of in reward or compliment of military service i think general butler is entitled to the first consideration a copy of the generals letter to me accompanying the swords is herewith transmitted   a lincoln     to fernando wood  executive mansion washington december 12 1862  hon fernando wood  my dear siryour letter of the 8th with the accompanying note of same date was received yesterday the most important paragraph in the letter as i consider is in these words  on the 25th of november last i was advised by an authority which i deemed likely to be well informed as well as reliable and truthful that the southern states would send representatives to the next congress provided that a full and general amnesty should permit them to do so no guarantee or terms were asked for other than the amnesty referred to  i strongly suspect your information will prove to be groundless nevertheless i thank you for communicating it to me understanding the phrase in the paragraph just quotedthe southern states would send representatives to the next congressto be substantially the same as that the people of the southern states would cease resistance and would reinaugurate submit to and maintain the national authority within the limits of such states under the constitution of the united states i say that in such case the war would cease on the part of the united states and that if within a reasonable time a full and general amnesty were necessary to such end it would not be withheld  i do not think it would be proper now to communicate this formally or informally to the people of the southern states my belief is that they already know it and when they choose if ever they can communicate with me unequivocally nor do i think it proper now to suspend military operations to try any experiment of negotiation  i should nevertheless receive with great pleasure the exact information you now have and also such other as you may in any way obtain such information might be more valuable before the 1st of january than afterwards  while there is nothing in this letter which i shall dread to see in history it is perhaps better for the present that its existence should not become public i therefore have to request that you will regard it as confidential  your obedient servant  a lincoln

failure other than accident the courage with which you in an open field maintained the contest against an intrenched foe and the consummate skill and success with which you crossed and recrossed the

practicable confer with the officers getting their judgment and ascertaining their temperin a word gather all the elements for forming a judgment of your own and then tell general burnside that you do

of the treasury and secretary of war in case of the death absence from the seat of government or sickness of either of those officers   a lincoln     to general s r curtis  executive mansion washington january 2 1863  majorgeneral curtis  my dear siryours of december 29 by the hand of mr strong is just received the day i telegraphed you suspending the order in relation to dr mcpheeters he with mr bates the attorneygeneral appeared before me and left with me a copy of the order mentioned the doctor also showed me the copy of an oath which he said he had taken which is indeed very strong and specific he also verbally assured me that he had constantly prayed in church for the president and government as he had always done before the present war in looking over the recitals in your order i do not see that this matter of the prayer as he states it is negatived nor that any violation of his oath is charged nor in fact that anything specific is alleged against him the charges are all general that he has a rebel wife and rebel relations that he sympathies with rebels and that he exercises rebel influence now after talking with him i tell you frankly i believe he does sympathize with the rebels but the question remains whether such a man of unquestioned good moral character who has taken such an oath as he has and cannot even be charged with violating it and who can be charged with no other specific act or omission can with safety to the government be exiled upon the suspicion of his secret sympathies but i agree that this must be left to you who are on the spot and if after all you think the public good requires his removal my suspension of the order is withdrawn only with this qualification that the time during the suspension is not to be counted against him i have promised him this but i must add that the united states government must not as by this order undertake to run the churches when an individual in a church or out of it becomes dangerous to the public interest he must be checked but let the churches as such take care of themselves it will not do for the united states to appoint trustees supervisors or other agents for the churches  yours very truly   a lincoln  p sthe committee composed of messrs yeatman and filley mr broadhead not attending has presented your letter and the memorial of sundry citizens on the whole subject embraced

in each case be consistent with the perfect and complete efficiency of the naval service and with military expediency   a lincoln     to general s l curtis  executive mansion washington january 5 1863  majorgeneral curtis  my dear siri am having a good deal of trouble with missouri matters and i now sit down to write you particularly about it one class of friends believe in greater severity and another in greater leniency in regard to arrests banishments and assessments as usual in such cases each questions the others motives on the one hand it is insisted that governor gambles unionism at most is not better than a secondary spring of action that hunkerism and a wish for political influence stand before unionism with him on the other hand it is urged that arrests banishments and assessments are made more for private malice revenge and pecuniary interest than for the public good this morning i was told by a gentleman who i have no doubt believes what he says that in one case of assessments for 10000 the different persons who paid compared receipts and found they had paid 30000 if this be true the inference is that the collecting agents pocketed the odd 20000 and true or not in the instance nothing but the sternest necessity can justify the making and maintaining of a system so liable to such abuses doubtless the necessity for the making of the system in missouri did exist and whether it continues for the maintenance of it is now a practical and very important question some days ago governor gamble telegraphed me asking that the assessments outside of st louis county might be suspended as they already have been within it and this morning all the members of congress here from missouri but one laid a paper before me asking the same thing now my belief is that governor gamble is an honest and true man not less so than yourself that you and he could confer together on this and other missouri questions with great advantage to the public that each knows something which the other does not and that acting together you could about double your stock of pertinent information may i not hope that you and he will attempt this i could at once safely do or you could safely do without me whatever you and he agree upon there is absolutely no reason why you should not agree  yours as ever   a lincoln  p si forgot to say that hon james s rollins member of congress from one of the missouri districts wishes that upon his personal responsibility rev john m robinson of columbia missouri james l matthews of boone county missouri and james l stephens also of

says he has many constituents who he thinks are rightly exiled but that he thinks these three should be allowed to return please look into the case and oblige major rollins if you consistently can  yours truly  a lincoln  copy sent to governor gamble     to caleb russell and sallie a fenton  executive mansion washington january 5 1863  my good friends the honorable senator harlan has just placed in my hands your letter of the 27th of december which i have read with pleasure and gratitude  it is most cheering and encouraging for me to know that in the efforts which i have made and am making for the restoration of a righteous peace to our country i am upheld and sustained by the good wishes and prayers of gods people no one is more deeply than myself aware that without his favor our highest wisdom is but as foolishness and that our most strenuous efforts would avail nothing in the shadow of his displeasure  i am conscious of no desire for my countrys welfare that is not in consonance with his will and of no plan upon which we may not ask his blessing it seems to me that if there be one subject upon which all good men may unitedly agree it is imploring the gracious favor of the god of nations upon the struggles our people are making for the preservation of their precious birthright of civil and religious liberty  very truly your friend   a lincoln     telegram to

united states  since my return to the army i have become more than ever convinced that the general officers of this command are almost unanimously opposed to another crossing of the river but i am still of the opinion that the crossing should be attempted and i have accordingly issued orders to the engineers and artillery to prepare for it there is much hazard in it as there always is in the majority of military movements and i cannot begin the movement without giving you notice of it particularly as i know so little of the effect that it may have upon other movements of distant armies  the influence of your telegram the other day is still upon me and has impressed me with the idea that there are many parts of the problem which influence you that are not known to me  in order to relieve you from all embarrassment in my case i inclose with this my resignation of my commission as majorgeneral of volunteers which you can have accepted if my movement is not in accordance with the views of yourself and your military advisers  i have taken the liberty to write to you personally upon this subject because it was necessary as i learned from general halleck for you to approve of my general plan written at warrenton before i could commence the movement and i think it quite as necessary that you should know of the important movement i am about to make particularly as it will have to be made in opposition to the views of nearly all my general officers and after the receipt of a despatch from you informing me of the opinion of some of them who had visited you  in conversation with you on new years morning i was led to express some opinions which i afterward felt it my duty to place on paper and to express them verbally to the gentleman of whom we were speaking which i did in your presence after handing you the letter you were not disposed then as i saw to retain the letter and i took it back but i now return it to you for record if you wish it  i beg leave to say that my resignation is not sent in in any spirit of insubordination but as i before said simply to relieve you from any embarrassment in changing commanders where lack of confidence may have rendered it necessary  the bearer of this will bring me any answer or i should be glad to hear from you by telegraph in cipher  i have the honor to be very respectfully your obedient servant  a e burnside  majorgeneral commanding army of the potomac     headquarters of the army washington january 7 1863  majorgeneral burnside commanding etc falmouth  generalyour communication of the 5th was delivered to me by your aidedecamp at 12 m today  in all my communications and interviews with you since you took command of the army of the potomac i have advised a forward movement across the rappahannock at our interview at warrenton i urged that you should cross by the fords above fredericksburg rather than to fall down to that place and when i left you at warrenton it was understood that at least a considerable part of your army would cross by the fords and i so represented to the president it was this modification of the plan proposed by you that i telegraphed you had received his approval when the attempt at fredericksburg was abandoned i advised you to renew the attempt at some other point either in whole or in part to turn the enemys works or to threaten their wings or communications in other words to keep the enemy occupied till a favorable opportunity offered to strike a decisive blow i particularly advised you to use your cavalry and light artillery upon his communications and attempt to cut off his supplies and engage him at an advantage  in all our interviews i have urged that our first object was not richmond but the defeat or scattering of lees army which threatened washington and the line of the upper potomac i now recur to these things simply to remind you of the general views which i have expressed and which i still hold  the circumstances of the case however have somewhat changed since the early part of november the chances of an extended line of operations are now on account of the advanced season much less than then but the chances are still in our favor to meet and defeat the enemy on the rappahannock if we can effect a crossing in a position where we can meet the enemy on favorable or even equal terms i therefore still advise a movement against him the character of that movement however must depend upon circumstances which may change any day and almost any hour if the enemy should concentrate his forces at the place you have selected for a crossing make it a feint and try another place again the circumstances at the time may be such as to render an attempt to cross the entire army not advisable in that case theory suggests that while the enemy concentrates at that point advantages can be gained by crossing smaller forces at other points to cut off his lines destroy his communication and capture his rearguards outposts etc the great object is to occupy the enemy to prevent his making large detachments or distant raids and to injure him all you can with the least injury to yourself if this can be best accomplished by feints of a general crossing and detached real crossings take that course if by an actual general crossing with feints on other points adopt that course there seem to me to be many reasons why a crossing at some point should be attempted it will not do to keep your large army inactive as you yourself admit it devolves on you to decide upon the time place and character of the crossing which you may attempt i can only advise that an attempt be made and as early as possible  very respectfully your obedient servant  h w halleck generalinchief   indorsement  january 8 1863  general burnside  i understand general halleck has sent you a letter of which this is a copy i approve this letter i deplore the want of concurrence with you in opinion by your general officers but i do not see the remedy be cautious and do not understand that the government or country is driving you i do not yet see how i could profit by changing the command of the army of the potomac and if i did i should not wish to do it by accepting the resignation of your commission   a lincoln     telegram to governor johnson  executive mansion washington january 8 1863  governor johnson nashville tenn  a dispatch of

january 14 1863  to the house of representatives the secretary of state has submitted to me a resolution of the house of representatives of the 5th instant which has been delivered to him and which is in the following words  resolved that the secretary of state be requested to communicate to this house if not in his judgment incompatible with the public interest why our minister in new granada has not presented his credentials to the actual government of that country also the reasons for which senor murillo is not recognized by the united states as the diplomatic representative of the mosquera government of that country also what negotiations have been had if any with general herran as the representative of ospinas government in new granada since it went into existence  on the 12th day of december 1846 a treaty of amity peace and concord was concluded between the united states of america and the republic of new granada which is still in force on the 7th day of december 1847 general pedro alcantara herran who had been duly accredited was received here as the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of that republic on the 30th day of august 1849 senor don rafael rivas was received by this government as charge daffaires of the same republic on the 5th day of december 1851 a consular convention was concluded between that republic and the united states which treaty was signed on behalf of the republic of granada by the same senor rivas this treaty is still in force on the 27th of april 1852 senor don victoriano de diego paredes was received as charge daffaires of the republic of new granada on the 20th of june 1855 general pedro alcantara herran was again received as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary duly accredited by the republic of new granada and he has ever since remained under the same credentials as the representative of that republic near the government of the united states on the 10th of september 1857 a claims convention was concluded between the united states and the republic of granada this convention is still in force and has in part been executed in may 1858 the constitution of the republic was remodelled and the nation assumed the political title of the granadian confederacy this fact was formally announced to this government but without any change in their representative here previously to the 4th day of march 1861 a revolutionary war against the republic of new granada which had thus been recognized and treated with by the united states broke out in new granada assuming to set up a new government under the name of united states of colombia this war has had various vicissitudes sometimes favorable sometimes adverse to the revolutionary movements the revolutionary organization has hitherto been simply a military provisionary power and no definitive constitution of government has yet been established in new granada in place of that organized by the constitution of 1858 the minister of the united states to the granadian confederacy who was appointed on the 29th day of may 1861 was directed in view of the occupation of the capital by the revolutionary party and of the uncertainty of the civil war not to present his credentials to either the government of the granadian confederacy or to the provisional military government but to conduct his affairs informally as is customary in such cases and to report the progress of events and await the instructions of this government the advices which have been received from him have not hitherto been sufficiently conclusive to determine me to recognize the revolutionary government general herran being here with full authority from the government of new canada which has been so long recognized by the united states i have not received any representative from the revolutionary government which has not yet been recognized because such a proceeding would be in itself an act of recognition  official communications have been had on various incidental and occasional questions with general herran as the minister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary of the granadian confederacy but in no other character no definitive measure or proceeding has resulted from these communications and a communication of them at present would not in my judgment be compatible with the public interest   a lincoln     to secretary of war  washington january 15 1863  secretary of war  please see mr stafford who wants to assist in raising colored troops in missouri   a lincoln     printing money  message to congress  january 17 1863  to the senate and house of representatives  i have signed the joint resolution to provide for the immediate payment of the army and navy of the united states passed by the house of representatives on the 14th and by the senate on the 15th instant  the joint resolution is a simple authority amounting however under existing circumstances to a direction to the secretary of the treasury to make an additional issue of 100000000 in united states notes if so much money is needed for the payment of the army and navy  my approval is given in order that every possible facility may be afforded for the prompt discharge of all arrears of pay due to our soldiers and our sailors  while giving this approval however i think it my duty to express my sincere regret that it has been found necessary to authorize so large an additional issue of united states notes when this circulation and that of the suspended banks together have become already so redundant as to increase prices beyond real values thereby augmenting the cost of living to the injury of labor and the cost of supplies to the injury of the whole country  it seems very plain that continued issues of united states notes without any check to the issues of suspended banks and without adequate provision for the raising of money by loans and for funding the issues so as to keep them within due limits must soon produce disastrous consequences and this matter appears to me so important that i feel bound to avail myself of this occasion to ask the special attention of congress to it  that congress has power to regulate the currency of the country can hardly admit of doubt and that a judicious measure to prevent the deterioration of this currency by a seasonable taxation of bank circulation or otherwise is needed seems equally clear independently of this general consideration it would be unjust to the people at large to exempt banks enjoying the special privilege of circulation from their just proportion of the public burdens  in order to raise money by way of loans most easily and cheaply it is clearly necessary to give every possible support to the public credit to that end a uniform currency in which taxes subscriptions to loans and all other ordinary public dues as well as all private dues may be paid is almost if not quite indispensable such a currency can be furnished by banking associations organized under a general act of congress as suggested in my message at the beginning of the present session the securing of this circulation by the pledge of united states bonds as therein suggested would still further facilitate loans by increasing the present and causing a future demand for such bonds  in view of the actual financial embarrassments of the government and of the greater embarrassment sure to come if the necessary means of relief be not afforded i feel that i should not perform my duty by a simple announcement of my approval of the joint resolution which proposes relief only by increased circulation without expressing my earnest desire that measures such in substance as those i have just referred to may receive the early sanction of congress by such measures in my opinion will payment be most certainly secured not only to the army and navy but to all honest creditors of the government and satisfactory provision made for future demands on the treasury   a lincoln     to the workingmen of manchester england  executive mansion washington january 1863  to the workingmen of manchester  i have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the address and resolutions which you sent me on the eve of the new year when i came on the 4th of march 1861 through a free and constitutional election to fireside in the government of the united states the country was found at the verge of civil war whatever might have been the cause or whosesoever the fault one duty paramount to all others was before me namely to maintain and preserve at once the constitution and the integrity of the federal republic a conscientious purpose to perform this duty is the key to all the measures of administration which have been and to all which will hereafter be pursued under our frame of government and my official oath i could not depart from this purpose if i would it is not always in the power of governments to enlarge or restrict the scope of moral results which follow the policies that they may deem it necessary for the public safety from time to time to adopt  i have understood well that the duty of selfpreservation rests solely with the american people but i have at the same time been aware that favor or disfavor of foreign nations might have a material influence in enlarging or prolonging the struggle with disloyal men in which the country is engaged a fair examination of history has served to authorize a belief that the past actions and influences of the united states were generally regarded as having been beneficial toward mankind i have therefore reckoned upon the forbearance of nations circumstancesto some of which you kindly alludeinduce me especially to expect that if justice and good faith should be practised by the united states they would encounter no hostile influence on the part of great britain it is now a pleasant duty to acknowledge the demonstration you have given of your desire that a spirit of amity and peace toward this country may prevail in the councils of your queen who is respected and esteemed in your own country only more than she is by the kindred nation which has its home on this side of the atlantic  i know and deeply deplore the sufferings which the workingmen at manchester and in all europe are called to endure in this crisis it has been often and studiously represented that the attempt to overthrow this government which was built upon the foundation of human rights and to substitute for it one which should rest exclusively on the basis of human slavery was likely to obtain the favor of europe through the action of our disloyal citizens the workingmen of europe have been subjected to severe trials for the purpose of forcing their sanction to that attempt under the circumstance i cannot but regard your decisive utterances upon the question as an instance of sublime christian heroism which has not been surpassed in any age or in any country it is indeed an energetic and inspiring assurance of the inherent power of truth and of the ultimate and universal triumph of justice humanity and freedom i do not doubt that the sentiments you have expressed will be sustained by your great nation and on the other hand i have no hesitation in assuring you that they will excite admiration esteem and the most reciprocal feelings of friendship among the american people  i hail this interchange of sentiment therefore as an augury that whatever else may happen whatever misfortune may befall your country or my own the peace and friendship which now exist between the two nations will be as it shall be my desire to make them perpetual   a lincoln     message to congress  washington january 21 1863  gentlemen of the senate and house of representatives  i submit herewith for your consideration the joint

it is possible that they may not be able to pass or reduce port hudson they however will do everything in their power to form a junction with you at vicksburg if they should not be able to effect this they will at least occupy a portion of the enemys forces and prevent them from reinforcing vicksburg i hope however that they will do still better and be able to join you  it may be proper to give you some explanation of the revocation of your order expelling all jews from your department the president has no objection to your expelling traitors and jew peddlers which i suppose was the object of your order but as it in terms proscribed an entire religious class some of whom are fighting in our ranks the president deemed it necessary to revoke it  very respectfully your obedient servant  h w

that there are some things in regard to which i am not quite satisfied with you i believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier which of course i like i also believe you do not mix politics with your profession in which you are right you have confidence in yourself which is a valuable if not an indispensable quality you are ambitious which within reasonable bounds does good rather than harm but i think that during general burnsides command of the army you have taken counsel of your ambition and thwarted him as much as you could in which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most meritorious and honorable brother officer i have heard in such a way as to believe it of your recently saying that both the army and the government needed a dictator of course it was not for this but in spite of it that i have given you the command only those generals who gain successes can set up dictators what i now ask of you is military success and i will risk the dictatorship the government will support you to the utmost of its ability which is neither more nor less than it has done and will do for all commanders i much fear that the spirit that you have aided to infuse into the army of criticizing their commander and withholding confidence from him will now turn upon you i shall assist you as far as i can to put it down neither you nor napoleon if he were alive again could get any good out of an army while such a spirit prevails in it and now beware of rashness beware of rashness but with energy and sleepless vigilance go forward and give us victories  yours very truly   a

february 12 1863  to the senate of the united states  on the 4th of september 1862 commander george henry preble united states navy then senior officer in command of the naval force off the harbor of

inflicted on the service and the country his name was stricken from the list of naval officers and he was dismissed from the service  since his dismissal earnest application has been made for his restoration to his former position by senators and naval officers on the ground that his fault was an error of judgment and that the example in his case has already had its effect in preventing a repetition of similar neglect  i therefore on this application and representation and in consideration of his previous fair record do hereby nominate george henry preble to be a commander in the navy

march 26 1863  hon andrew johnson  my dear siri am told you have at least thought of raising a negro military force in my opinion the country now needs no specific thing so much as some man of your ability and position to go to this work when i speak of your position i mean that of an eminent citizen of a slave state and himself a slaveholder the colored population is the great available and yet unavailed of force for restoring the union the bare sight of fifty thousand armed and drilled black soldiers upon the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once and who doubts that we can present that sight if we but take hold in earnest if you have been thinking of it please do not dismiss the thought  yours very truly   a lincoln     proclamation appointing a national fastday  by the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  march 30 1863  whereas the senate of the united states devoutly recognizing the supreme authority and just government of almighty god in all the affairs of men and of nations has by a resolution requested the president to designate and set apart a day for national prayer and humiliation  and whereas it is the duty of nations as well as men to own their dependence upon the overruling power of god to confess their sins and transgressions in humble sorrow yet with assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon and to recognize the sublime truth announced in the holy scriptures and proven by all history that those nations only are blessed whose god is the lord  and insomuch as we know that by his divine law nations like individuals are subjected to punishments and chastisements in this world may we not justly fear that the awful calamity of civil war which now desolates the land may be but a punishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous sins to the needful end of our national reformation as a whole people we have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of heaven we have been preserved these many years in peace and prosperity we have grown in numbers wealth and power as no other nation has ever grown but we have forgotten god we have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us and we have vainly imagined in the deceitfulness of our hearts that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own intoxicated with unbroken success we have become too selfsufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace too proud to pray to the god that made us  it behooves us then to humble ourselves before the offended power to confess our national sins and to pray for clemency and forgiveness  now therefore in compliance with the request and fully concurring in the views of the senate i do by this my proclamation designate and set apart thursday the 30th day of april 1863 as a day of national humiliation fasting and prayer and i do hereby request all the people to abstain on that day from their ordinary secular pursuits and to unite at their several places of public worship and their respective homes in keeping the day holy to the lord and devoted to the humble discharge of the religious duties proper to that solemn occasion all this being done in sincerity and truth let us then rest humbly in the hope authorized by the divine teachings that the united cry of the nation will be heard on high and answered with blessings no less than the pardon of our national sins and the restoration of our now divided and suffering country to its former happy condition of unity and peace  in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed  done at the city of washington this thirtieth day of march in the year of our lord one

all commercial intercourse between the inhabitants of such states as should by proclamation be declared in insurrection against the united states and the citizens of the rest of the united states was prohibited so long as such condition of hostility should continue except as the same shall be licensed and permitted by the president to be conducted and carried on only in pursuance of rules and regulations prescribed by the secretary of the treasury and  whereas it appears that a partial restoration of such intercourse between the inhabitants of sundry places and sections heretofore declared in insurrection in pursuance of said act and the citizens of the rest of the united states will favorably affect the public interests  now therefore i abraham lincoln president of the united states exercising the authority and discretion confided to me by the said act of congress do hereby license and permit such commercial intercourse between the citizens of loyal states and the inhabitants of such insurrectionary states in the cases and under the restrictions described and expressed in the regulations prescribed by the secretary of the treasury bearing even date with these presents or in

due enforcement of said act of july 13 1861 and the proper regulation of the commercial intercourse authorized by said act with the loyal citizens of said states  now therefore i abraham lincoln president of the united states do hereby revoke the said exceptions and declare that the inhabitants of the states of georgia south carolina north carolina tennessee alabama louisiana texas arkansas

subject i respectfully refer mr to the secretaries of war and navy for conference and consultation i have a single idea of my own about harbor defense it is a steam ram built so as to sacrifice nearly all capacity for carrying to those of speed and strength so as to be able to split any vessel having hollow enough in her to carry supplies for a voyage of any distance such ram of course could not herself carry supplies for a voyage of considerable distance and her business would be to guard a particular harbor as a bulldog guards his masters door   a lincoln     telegram to the secretary of

now centred upon charleston official intelligence was made public early yesterday morning that the enemys ironclad fleet had attempted to cross the bar and failed but later in the day it was announced that the gunboats and transports had succeeded in crossing and were at anchor our ironclads lay between the forts quietly awaiting the attack further intelligence is looked for with eager anxiety the yankees have made no secret of this vast preparation for an attack on charleston and we may well anticipate a desperate conflict at last the hour of trial has come for charleston the hour of deliverance or destruction for no one believes the other alternative surrender possible the heart of the whole country yearns toward the beleaguered city with intense solicitude yet with hopes amounting to confidence charleston knows what is expected of her and which is due to her fame and to the relation she sustains to the cause the devoted the heroic the greathearted beauregard is there and he too knows what is expected of him and will not disappoint that expectation we predict a saragossa defense and that if charleston is taken it will be only a heap of ruins  the rebel pickets are reported as calling over to our pickets today that we had taken some rebel fort this is not very intelligible and i think is entirely unreliable   a lincoln     telegram to officer in command at

continue operations before charleston and the former one to remove to another point in a certain contingency no censure upon you or either of you is intended we still hope that by cordial and judicious cooperation you can take the batteries on morris island and sullivans island and fort sumter but whether you can or not we wish the demonstration kept up for a time for a collateral and very important object we wish the attempt to be a real one though not a desperate one if it affords any considerable chance of success but if prosecuted as a demonstration only this must not become public or the whole effect will be lost once again before charleston do not leave until further orders from here of course this is not intended to force you to leave unduly exposed hilton head or other near

would be very glad of another movement early enough to give us some benefit from the fact of the enemys communication being broken but neither for this reason nor any other do i wish anything done in

at its last session enacted a law entitled an act for enrolling and calling out the national forces and for other purposes which was approved on the 3d day of march last and  whereas it is recited in the said act that there now exists in the united states an insurrection and rebellion against the authority thereof and it is under the constitution of the united states the duty of the government to suppress insurrection and rebellion to guarantee to each state a republican form of government and to preserve the public tranquillity and  whereas for these high purposes a military force is indispensable to raise and support which all persons ought willingly to contribute and  whereas no service can be more praiseworthy and honorable than that which is rendered for the maintenance of the constitution and the union and the consequent preservation of free government and  whereas for the reasons thus recited it was enacted by the said statute that all ablebodied male citizens of the united states and persons of foreign birth who shall have declared on oath their intention to become citizens under and in pursuance of the laws thereof between the ages of twenty and fortyfive years with certain exceptions not necessary to be here mentioned are declared to constitute the national forces and shall be liable to perform military duty in the service of the united states when called out by the president for that purpose and  whereas it is claimed by and in behalf of persons of foreign birth within the ages specified in said act who have heretofore declared on oath their intentions to become citizens under and in pursuance of the laws of the united states and who have not exercised the right of suffrage or any other political franchise under the laws of the united states or of any of the states thereof that they are not absolutely concluded by their aforesaid declaration of intention from renouncing their purpose to become citizens and that on the contrary such persons under treaties or the law of nations retain a right to renounce that purpose and to forego the privileges of citizenship and residence within the united states under the obligations imposed by the aforesaid act of congress  now therefore to avoid all misapprehensions concerning the liability of persons concerned to perform the service required by such enactment and to give it full effect i do hereby order and proclaim that no plea of alienage will be received or allowed to exempt from the obligations imposed by the aforesaid act of congress any person of foreign birth who shall have declared on oath his intention to become a citizen of the united states under the laws thereof and who shall be found within the united states at any time during the continuance of the present insurrection and rebellion at or after the expiration of the period of sixtyfive days from the date of this proclamation nor shall any such plea of alienage be allowed in favor of any such person who has so as aforesaid declared his intention to become a citizen of the united states and shall have exercised at any time the right of suffrage or any other political franchise within the united states under the laws thereof or under the laws of any of the several states  in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed done at the city of

possibly by an early movement you could get some advantage from the supposed facts that the enemys communications were disturbed and that he was somewhat deranged in position that idea has now passed away the enemy having reestablished his communications regained his positions and actually received reinforcements it does not now appear probable to me that you can gain anything by an early renewal of the attempt to cross the rappahannock i therefore shall not complain if you do no more for a time than to keep the enemy at bay and out of other mischief by menaces and occasional cavalry raids if practicable and to put your own army in good condition again still if in your own clear judgment you can renew the attack successfully i do not mean to restrain you bearing upon this last point i must tell you that i have some painful intimations that some of your corps and division commanders are not giving you their entire confidence this would be ruinous if true and you should therefore first of

27 1863  general john m schofield  my dear sirhaving relieved general curtis and assigned you to the command of the department of the missouri i think it may be of some advantage for me to state why i did it i did not relieve general curtis because of any full conviction that he had done wrong by commission or omission i did it because of a conviction in my mind that the union men of missouri constituting when united a vast majority of the whole people have entered into a pestilent factional quarrel among themselvesgeneral curtis perhaps not of choice being the head of one faction and governor gamble that of the other after months of labor to reconcile the difficulty it seemed to grow worse and worse until i felt it my duty to break it up somehow and as i could not remove governor gamble i had to remove general curtis now that you are in the position i wish you to undo nothing merely because general curtis or governor gamble did it but to exercise your own judgment and do right for the public interest let your military measures be strong enough to repel the invader and keep the peace and not so strong as to unnecessarily harass and persecute the people it is a difficult role

assault or general fighting whatever and in fact they so speak as to almost exclude the idea that there can have been any since monday the 25th which was not very heavy neither do they mention any demand made by grant upon pemberton for a surrender they speak of our troops as being in good health condition and spirits some of them do say that banks has port hudson invested   a lincoln     to

yours of today was received an hour ago so much of professional military skill is requisite to answer it that i have turned the task over to general halleck he promises to perform it with his utmost care i have but one idea which i think worth suggesting to you and that is in case you find lee coming to the north of the rappahannock i would by no means cross to the south of it if he should leave a rear force at fredericksburg tempting you to fall upon it it would fight in entrenchments and have you at advantage and so man for man worst you at that point while his main force would in some way be getting an advantage of you northward in one word i would not take any risk of being entangled up on the river like an ox jumped half over a fence and liable to be torn by dogs front and rear without a fair chance to gore one way or to kick the other  if lee would come to my side of the river i would keep on the same side and fight him or act on the defensive according as might be my estimate of his strength relatively to my own but these are mere suggestions which i desire to be controlled by the judgment of yourself and general halleck   a lincoln     telegram to mrs grimsley

have nothing reliable from vicksburg since sunday now we here have a despatch from there sunday and others of almost every day preceding since the investment and while they show the siege progressing they do not show any general fighting since the 21st and 22d we have nothing from port hudson later than the 29th when things looked reasonably well for us i have thought this might be of some interest to you   a lincoln     telegram to general dix  executive mansion washington june 8 1863  majorgeneral dix fort monroe  we have despatches from vicksburg of the 3d siege progressing no

1863  hon erastus corning and others  gentlemenyour letter of may 19 inclosing the resolutions of a public meeting held at albany new york on the 16th of the same month was received several days ago  the resolutions as i understand them are resolvable into two propositionsfirst the expression of a purpose to sustain the cause of the union to secure peace through victory and to support the administration in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the rebellion and secondly a declaration of censure upon the administration for supposed unconstitutional action such as the making of military arrests and from the two propositions a third is deduced which is that the gentlemen composing the meeting are resolved on doing their part to maintain our common government and country despite the folly or wickedness as they may conceive of any administration this position is eminently patriotic and as such i thank the meeting and congratulate the nation for it my own purpose is the same so that the meeting and myself have a common object and can have no difference except in the choice of means or measures for effecting that object  and here i ought to close this paper and would close it if there were no apprehension that more injurious consequences than any merely personal to myself might follow the censures systematically cast upon me for doing what in my view of duty i could not forbear the resolutions promise to support me in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the rebellion and i have not knowingly employed nor shall knowingly employ any other but the meeting by their resolutions assert and argue that certain military arrests and proceedings following them for which i am ultimately responsible are unconstitutional i think they are not the resolutions quote from the constitution the definition of treason and also the limiting safeguards and guarantees therein provided for the citizen on trial for treason and on his being held to answer for capital or otherwise infamous crimes and in criminal prosecutions his right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury they proceed to resolve that these safeguards of the rights of the citizen against the pretensions of arbitrary power were intended more especially for his protection in times of civil commotion and apparently to demonstrate the proposition the resolutions proceed they were secured substantially to the english people after years of protracted civil war and were adopted into our constitution at the close of the revolution would not the demonstration have been better if it could have been truly said that these safeguards had been adopted and applied during the civil wars and during our revolution instead of after the one and at the close of the other i too am devotedly for them after civil war and before civil war and at all times except when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require their suspension the resolutions proceed to tell us that these safeguards have stood the test of seventysix years of trial under our republican system under circumstances which show that while they constitute the foundation of all free government they are the elements of the enduring stability of the republic no one denies that they have so stood the test up to the beginning of the present rebellion if we except a certain occurrence at new orleans hereafter to be mentioned nor does any one question that they will stand the same test much longer after the rebellion closes but these provisions of the constitution have no application to the case we have in hand because the arrests complained of were not made for treasonthat is not for the treason defined in the constitution and upon the conviction of which the punishment is deathnor yet were they made to hold persons to answer for any capital or otherwise infamous crimes nor were the proceedings following in any constitutional or legal sense criminal prosecutions the arrests were made on totally different grounds and the proceedings following accorded with the grounds of the arrests let us consider the real case with which we are dealing and apply to it the parts of the constitution plainly made for such cases  prior to my installation here it had been inculcated that any state had a lawful right to secede from the national union and that it would be expedient to exercise the right whenever the devotees of the doctrine should fail to elect a president to their own liking i was elected contrary to their liking and accordingly so far as it was legally possible they had taken seven states out of the union had seized many of the united states forts and had fired upon the united states flag all before i was inaugurated and of course before i had done any official act whatever the rebellion thus begun soon ran into the present civil war and in certain respects it began on very unequal terms between the parties the insurgents had been preparing for it more than thirty years while the government had taken no steps to resist them the former had carefully considered all the means which could be turned to their account it undoubtedly was a wellpondered reliance with them that in their own unrestricted effort to destroy union constitution and law all together the government would in great degree be restrained by the same constitution and law from arresting their progress their sympathizers invaded all departments of the government and nearly all communities of the people from this material under cover of liberty of speech liberty of the press and habeas corpus they hoped to keep on foot amongst us a most efficient corps of spies informers suppliers and aiders and abettors of their cause in a thousand ways they knew that in times such as they were inaugurating by the constitution itself the habeas corpus might be suspended but they also knew they had friends who would make a question as to who was to suspend it meanwhile their spies and others might remain at large to help on their cause or if as has happened the executive should suspend the writ without ruinous waste of time instances of arresting innocent persons might occur as are always likely to occur in such cases and then a clamor could be raised in regard to this which might be at least of some service to the insurgent cause it needed no very keen perception to discover this part of the enemies program so soon as by open hostilities their machinery was fairly put in motion yet thoroughly imbued with a reverence for the guaranteed rights of individuals i was slow to adopt the strong measures which by degrees i have been forced to regard as being within the exceptions of the constitution and as indispensable to the public safety nothing is better known to history than that courts of justice are utterly incompetent to such cases civil courts are organized chiefly for trials of individualsor at most a few individuals acting in concert and this in quiet times and on charges of crimes well defined in the law even in times of peace bands of horsethieves and robbers frequently grow too numerous and powerful for the ordinary courts of justice but what comparison in numbers have such bands ever borne to the insurgent sympathizers even in many of the loyal states again a jury too frequently has at least one member more ready to hang the panel than to hang the traitor and yet again he who dissuades one man from volunteering or induces one soldier to desert weakens the union cause as much as he who kills a union soldier in battle yet this dissuasion or inducement may be so conducted as to be no defined crime of which any civil court would take cognizance   ours is a case of rebellionso called by the resolutions before mein fact a clear flagrant and gigantic case of rebellion and the provision of the constitution that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it is the provision which specially applies to our present case this provision plainly attests the understanding of those who made the constitution that ordinary courts of justice are inadequate to cases of rebellionattests their purpose that in such cases men may be held in custody whom the courts acting on ordinary rules would discharge habeas corpus does not discharge men who are proved to be guilty of defined crime and its suspension is allowed by the constitution on purpose that men may be arrested and held who can not be proved to be guilty of defined crime when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it  this is precisely our present casea case of rebellion wherein the public safety does require the suspensionindeed arrests by process of courts and arrests in cases of rebellion do not proceed altogether upon the same basis the former is directed at the small percentage of ordinary and continuous perpetration of crime while the latter is directed at sudden and extensive uprisings against the government which at most will succeed or fail in no great length of time in the latter case arrests are made not so much for what has been done as for what probably would be done the latter is more for the preventive and less for the vindictive than the former in such cases the purposes of men are much more easily understood than in cases of ordinary crime the man who stands by and says nothing when the peril of his government is discussed cannot be misunderstood if not hindered he is sure to help the enemy much more if he talks ambiguouslytalks for his country with buts and ifs and ands of how little value the constitutional provision i have quoted will be rendered if arrests shall never be made until defined crimes shall have been committed may be illustrated by a few notable examples general john c breckinridge general robert e lee general joseph e johnston general john b magruder general william b preston general simon b buckner and commodore franklin buchanan now occupying the very highest places in the rebel war service were all within the power of the government since the rebellion began and were nearly as well known to be traitors then as now unquestionably if we had seized and had them the insurgent cause would be much weaker but no one of them had then committed any crime defined in the law every one of them if arrested would have been discharged on habeas corpus were the writ allowed to operate in view of these and similar cases i think the time not unlikely to come when i shall be blamed for having made too few arrests rather than too many  by the third resolution the meeting indicate their opinion that military arrests may be constitutional in localities where rebellion actually exists but that such arrests are unconstitutional in localities where rebellion or insurrection does not actually exist they insist that such arrests shall not be made outside of the lines of necessary military occupation and the scenes of insurrection inasmuch however as the constitution itself makes no such distinction i am unable to believe that there is any such constitutional distinction i concede that the class of arrests complained of can be constitutional only when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require them and i insist that in such casesthey are constitutional wherever the public safety does require them as well in places to which they may prevent the rebellion extending as in those where it may be already prevailing as well where they may restrain mischievous interference with the raising and supplying of armies to suppress the rebellion as where the rebellion may actually be as well where they may restrain the enticing men out of the army as where they would prevent mutiny in the army equally constitutional at all places where they will conduce to the public safety as against the dangers of rebellion or invasion take the particular case mentioned by the meeting it is asserted in substance that mr vallandigham was by a military commander seized and tried for no other reason than words addressed to a public meeting in criticism of the course of the administration and in condemnation of the military orders of the general now if there be no mistake about this if this assertion is the truth and the whole truth if there were no other reason for the arrest then i concede that the arrest was wrong but the arrest as i understand was made for a very different reason mr vallandigham avows his hostility to the war on the part of the union and his arrest was made because he was laboring with some effect to prevent the raising of troops to encourage desertions from the army and to leave the rebellion without an adequate military force to suppress it he was not arrested because he was damaging the political prospects of the administration or the personal interests of the commanding general but because he was damaging the army upon the existence and vigor of which the life of the nation depends he was warring upon the military and thus gave the military constitutional jurisdiction to lay hands upon him if mr vallandigham was not damaging the military power of the country then his arrest was made on mistake of fact which i would be glad to correct on reasonably satisfactory evidence  i understand the meeting whose resolutions i am considering to be in favor of suppressing the rebellion by military forceby armies long experience has shown that armies cannot be maintained unless desertion shall be punished by the severe penalty of death the case requires and the law and the constitution sanction this punishment must i shoot a simpleminded boy and not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induced him to desert this is none the less injurious when effected by getting a father or brother or friend into a public meeting and there working upon his feelings till he is persuaded to write the soldier boy that he is fighting in a bad cause for a wicked administration of a contemptible government too weak to arrest and punish him if he shall desert i think that in such a case to silence the agitator and save the boy is not only constitutional but withal a great mercy  if i be wrong on this question of constitutional power my error lies in believing that certain proceedings are constitutional when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety requires them which would not be constitutional when in absence of rebellion or invasion the public safety does not require them in other words that the constitution is not in its application in all respects the same in cases of rebellion or invasion involving the public safety as it is in times of profound peace and public security the constitution itself makes the distinction and i can no more be persuaded that the government can constitutionally take no strong measures in time of rebellion because it can be shown that the same could not be lawfully taken in times of peace than i can be persuaded that a particular drug is not good medicine for a sick man because it can be shown to not be good food for a well one nor am i able to appreciate the danger apprehended by the meeting that the american people will by means of military arrests during the rebellion lose the right of public discussion the liberty of speech and the press the law of evidence trial by jury and habeas corpus throughout the indefinite peaceful future which i trust lies before them any more than i am able to believe that a man could contract so strong an appetite for emetics during temporary illness as to persist in feeding upon them during the remainder of his healthful life  in giving the resolutions that earnest consideration which you request of me i cannot overlook the fact that the meeting speak as democrats nor can i with full respect for their known intelligence and the fairly presumed deliberation with which they prepared their resolutions be permitted to suppose that this occurred by accident or in any way other than that they preferred to designate themselves democrats rather than american citizens in this time of national peril i would have preferred to meet you upon a level one step higher than any party platform because i am sure that from such more elevated position we could do better battle for the country we all love than we possibly can from those lower ones where from the force of habit the prejudices of the past and selfish hopes of the future we are sure to expend much of our ingenuity and strength in finding fault with and aiming blows at each other but since you have denied me this i will yet be thankful for the countrys sake that not all democrats have done so he on whose discretionary judgment mr vallandigham was arrested and tried is a democrat having no old party affinity with me and the judge who rejected the constitutional view expressed in these resolutions by refusing to discharge mr vallandigham on habeas corpus is a democrat of better days than these having received his judicial mantle at the hands of president jackson and still more of all those democrats who are nobly exposing their lives and shedding their blood on the battlefield i have learned that many approve the course taken with mr vallandigham while i have not heard of a single one condemning it i cannot assert that there are none such and the name of president jackson recalls an instance of pertinent history after the battle of new orleans and while the fact that the treaty of peace had been concluded was well known in the city but before official knowledge of it had arrived general jackson still maintained martial or military law now that it could be said that the war was over the clamor against martial law which had existed from the first grew more furious among other things a mr louaillier published a denunciatory newspaper article general jackson arrested him a lawyer by the name of morel procured the united states judge hall to order a writ of habeas corpus to release mr louaillier general jackson arrested both the lawyer and the judge a mr hollander ventured to say of some part of the matter that it was a dirty trick general jackson arrested him when the officer undertook to serve the writ of habeas corpus general jackson took it from him and sent him away with a copy holding the judge in custody a few days the general sent him beyond the limits of his encampment and set him at liberty with an order to remain till the ratification of peace should be regularly announced or until the british should have left the southern coast a day or two more elapsed the ratification of the treaty of peace was regularly announced and the judge and others were fully liberated a few days more and the judge called general jackson into court and fined him 1000 for having arrested him and the others named the general paid the fine and then the matter rested for nearly thirty years when congress refunded principal and interest the late senator douglas then in the house of representatives took a leading part in the debates in which the constitutional question was much discussed i am not prepared to say whom the journals would show to have voted for the measure  it may be remarkedfirst that we had the same constitution then as now secondly that we then had a case of invasion and now we have a case of rebellion and thirdly that the permanent right of the people to public discussion the liberty of speech and of the press the trial by jury the law of evidence and the habeas corpus suffered no detriment whatever by that conduct of general jackson or its subsequent approval by the american congress  and yet let me say that in my own discretion i do not know whether i would have ordered the arrest of mr vallandigham while i cannot shift the responsibility from myself i hold that as a general rule the commander in the field is the better judge of the necessity in any particular case of course i must practice a general directory and revisory power in the matter  one of the resolutions expresses the opinion of the meeting that arbitrary arrests will have the effect to divide and distract those who should be united in suppressing the rebellion and i am specifically called on to discharge mr vallandigham i regard this as at least a fair appeal to me on the expediency of exercising a constitutional power which i think exists in response to such appeal i have to say it gave me pain when i learned that mr vallandigham had been arrested that is i was pained that there should have seemed to be a necessity for arresting him and that it will afford me great pleasure to discharge him so soon as i can by any means believe the public safety will not suffer by it  i further say that as the war progresses it appears to me opinion and action which were in great confusion at first take shape and fall into more regular channels so that the necessity for strong dealing with them gradually decreases i have every reason to desire that it should cease altogether and far from the least is my regard for the opinions and wishes of those who like the meeting at albany declare their purpose to sustain the government in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the rebellion still i must continue to do so much as may seem to be required by the public safety   a lincoln     to the secretary of the treasury  executive mansion june 14 1863  hon secretary of the treasury  siryour note of this

others  executive mansion washington june 19 1863  messrs b b malhiot bradish johnson and thomas cottman  gentlemenyour letter which follows has been received and considered  the undersigned a committee appointed by the planters of the state of louisiana respectfully represent that they have been delegated to seek of the general government a full recognition of all the rights of the state as they existed previous to the passage of an act of secession upon the principle of the existence of the state constitution unimpaired and no legal act having transpired that could in any way deprive them of the advantages conferred by that constitution under this constitution the state wishes to return to its full allegiance in the enjoyment of all rights and privileges exercised by the other states under the federal constitution with the view of accomplishing the desired object we further request that your excellency will as commanderinchief of the army of the united states direct the military governor of louisiana to order an election in conformity with the constitution and laws of the state on the first monday of november next for all state and federal officers  with high consideration and resect we have the honor to subscribe ourselves  your obedient servants       e e malhiot      bradish johnson      thomas cottman  since receiving the letter reliable information has reached me that a respectable portion of the louisiana people desire to amend their state constitution and contemplate holding a state convention for that object this fact alone as it seems to me is a sufficient reason why the general government should not give the committal you seek to the existing state constitution i may add that while i do not perceive how such committal could facilitate our military operations in louisiana i really apprehend it might be so used as to embarrass them  as to an election to be held next november there is abundant time without any order or proclamation from me just now the people of louisiana shall not lack an opportunity for a fair election for both federal and state officers by want of anything within my power to give them  your obedient servant   a lincoln     to general j m schofield  executive mansion washington  june 22 1863  general john m schofield my dear siryour despatch asking in substance whether in case missouri shall adopt gradual emancipation the general government will protect slave owners in that species of property during the short time it shall be permitted by the state to exist within it has been received desirous as i am that emancipation shall be adopted by missouri and believing as i do that gradual can be made better than immediate for both black and white except when military necessity changes the case my impulse is to say that such protection would be given i cannot know exactly what shape an act of emancipation may take if the period from the initiation to the final end should be comparatively short and the act should prevent persons being sold during that period into more lasting slavery the whole would be easier i do not wish to pledge the general government to the affirmative support of even temporary slavery beyond what can be fairly claimed under the constitution i suppose however this is not desired but that it is desired for the military force of the united states while in missouri to not be used in subverting the temporarily reserved legal rights in slaves during the progress of emancipation this i would desire also i have very earnestly urged the slave states to adopt emancipation and it ought to be and is an object with me not to overthrow or thwart what any of them may in good faith do to that end you are therefore authorized to act in the spirit of this letter in conjunction with what may appear to be the military necessities of your department although this letter will become public at some time it is not intended to be made so now  yours truly   a lincoln     telegram

houk et al  gentlementhe resolutions of the ohio democratic state convention which you present me together with your introductory and closing remarks being in position and argument mainly the same as the resolutions of the democratic meeting at albany new york i refer you to my response to the latter as meeting most of the points in the former  this response you evidently used in preparing your remarks and i desire no more than that it be used with accuracy in a single reading of your remarks i only discovered one inaccuracy in matter which i suppose you took from that paper it is where you say the undersigned are unable to agree with you in the opinion you have expressed that the constitution is different in time of insurrection or invasion from what it is in time of peace and public security  a recurrence to the paper will show you that i have not expressed the opinion you suppose i expressed the opinion that the constitution is different in its application in cases of rebellion or invasion involving the public safety from what it is in times of profound peace and public security and this opinion i adhere to simply because by the constitution itself things may be done in the one case which may not be done in the other  i dislike to waste a word on a merely personal point but i must respectfully assure you that you will find yourselves at fault should you ever seek for evidence to prove your assumption that i opposed in discussions before the people the policy of the mexican war   you say expunge from the constitution this limitation upon the power of congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus and yet the other guarantees of personal liberty would remain unchanged doubtless if this clause of the constitution improperly called as i think a limitation upon the power of congress were expunged the other guarantees would remain the same but the question is not how those guarantees would stand with that clause out of the constitution but how they stand with that clause remaining in it in case of rebellion or invasion involving the public safety if the liberty could be indulged of expunging that clause letter and spirit i really think the constitutional argument would be with you  my general view on this question was stated in the albany response and hence i do not state it now i only add that as seems to me the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus is the great means through which the guarantees of personal liberty are conserved and made available in the last resort and corroborative of this view is the fact that mr vallandigham in the very case in question under the advice of able lawyers saw not where else to go but to the habeas corpus but by the constitution the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus itself may be suspended when in case of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it  you ask in substance whether i really claim that i may override all the guaranteed rights of individuals on the plea of conserving the public safety when i may choose to say the public safety requires it this question divested of the phraseology calculated to represent me as struggling for an arbitrary personal prerogative is either simply a question who shall decide or an affirmation that nobody shall decide what the public safety does require in cases of rebellion or invasion  the constitution contemplates the question as likely to occur for decision but it does not expressly declare who is to decide it by necessary implication when rebellion or invasion comes the decision is to be made from time to time and i think the man whom for the time the people have under the constitution made the commanderinchief of their army and navy is the man who holds the power and bears the responsibility of making it if he uses the power justly the same people will probably justify him if he abuses it he is in their hands to be dealt with by all the modes they have reserved to themselves in the constitution  the earnestness with which you insist that persons can only in times of rebellion be lawfully dealt with in accordance with the rules for criminal trials and punishments in times of peace induces me to add a word to what i said on that point in the albany response  you claim that men may if they choose embarrass those whose duty it is to combat a giant rebellion and then be dealt with in turn only as if there were no rebellion the constitution itself rejects this view the military arrests and detentions which have been made including those of mr vallandigham which are not different in principle from the others have been for prevention and not for punishmentas injunctions to stay injury as proceedings to keep the peace and hence like proceedings in such cases and for like reasons they have not been accompanied with indictments or trials by juries nor in a single case by any punishment whatever beyond what is purely incidental to the prevention the original sentence of imprisonment in mr vallandighams case was to prevent injury to the military service only and the modification of it was made as a less disagreeable mode to him of securing the same prevention  i am unable to perceive an insult to ohio in the case of mr vallandigham quite surely nothing of the sort was or is intended i was wholly unaware that mr vallandigham was at the time of his arrest a candidate for the democratic nomination for governor until so informed by your reading to me the resolutions of the convention i am grateful to the state of ohio for many things especially for the brave soldiers and officers she has given in the present national trial to the armies of the union  you claim as i understand that according to my own position in the albany response mr vallandigham should be released and this because as you claim he has not damaged the military service by discouraging enlistments encouraging desertions or otherwise and that if he had he should have been turned over to the civil authorities under the recent acts of congress i certainly do not know that mr vallandigham has specifically and by direct language advised against enlistments and in favor of desertion and resistance to drafting  we all know that combinations armed in some instances to resist the arrest of deserters began several months ago that more recently the like has appeared in resistance to the enrolment preparatory to a draft and that quite a number of assassinations have occurred from the same animus these had to be met by military force and this again has led to bloodshed and death and now under a sense of responsibility more weighty and enduring than any which is merely official i solemnly declare my belief that this hindrance of the military including maiming and murder is due to the course in which mr vallandigham has been engaged in a greater degree than to any other cause and it is due to him personally in a greater degree than to any other one man  these things have been notorious known to all and of course known to mr vallandigham perhaps i would not be wrong to say they originated with his special friends and adherents with perfect knowledge of them he has frequently if not constantly made speeches in congress and before popular assemblies and if it can be shown that with these things staring him in the face he has ever uttered a word of rebuke or counsel against them it will be a fact greatly in his favor with me and one of which as yet i am totally ignorant when it is known that the whole burden of his speeches has been to stir up men against the prosecution of the war and that in the midst of resistance to it he has not been known in any instance to counsel against such resistance it is next to impossible to repel the inference that he has counseled directly in favor of it  with all this before their eyes the convention you represent have nominated mr vallandigham for governor of ohio and both they and you have declared the purpose to sustain the national union by all constitutional means but of course they and you in common reserve to yourselves to decide what are constitutional means and unlike the albany meeting you omit to state or intimate that in your opinion an army is a constitutional means of saving the union against a rebellion or even to intimate that you are conscious of an existing rebellion being in progress with the avowed object of destroying that very union at the same time your nominee for governor in whose behalf you appeal is known to you and to the world to declare against the use of an army to suppress the rebellion your own attitude therefore encourages desertion resistance to the draft and the like because it teaches those who incline to desert and to escape the draft to believe it is your purpose to protect them and to hope that you will become strong enough to do so  after a short personal intercourse with you gentlemen of the committee i cannot say i think you desire this effect to follow your attitude but i assure your that both friends and enemies of the union look upon it in this light it is a substantial hope and by consequence a real strength to the enemy if it is a false hope and one which you would willingly dispel i will make the way exceedingly easy  i send you duplicates of this letter in order that you or a majority of you may if you choose indorse your names upon one of them and return it thus indorsed to me with the understanding that those signing are thereby committed to the following propositions and to nothing else  1 that there is now a rebellion in the united states the object and tendency of which is to destroy the national union and that in your opinion an army and navy are constitutional means for suppressing that rebellion  2 that no one of you will do anything which in his own judgment will tend to hinder the increase or favor the decrease or lessen the efficiency of the army or navy while engaged in the effort to suppress that rebellion and  3 that each of you will in his sphere do all he can to have the officers soldiers and seamen of the army and navy while engaged in the effort to suppress the rebellion paid fed clad and otherwise well provided for and supported  and with the further understanding that upon receiving the letter and names thus indorsed i will cause them to be published which publication shall be within itself a revocation of the order in relation to mr vallandigham it will not escape observation that i consent to the release of mr vallandigham upon terms not embracing any pledge from him or from others as to what he will or will not do i do this because he is not present to speak for himself or to authorize others to speak for him and because i should expect that on his returning he would not put himself practically in antagonism with the position of his friends but i do it chiefly because i thereby prevail on other influential gentlemen of ohio to so define their position as to be of immense value to the armythus more than compensating for the consequences of any mistake in allowing mr vallandigham to return so that on the whole the public safety will not have suffered by it still in regard to mr vallandigham and all others i must hereafter as heretofore do so much as the public safety may seem to require  i have the honor to be respectfully yours etc   a lincoln     telegram to governor

is crossing his wounded over the river in flats without saying why he does not stop it or even intimating a thought that it ought to be stopped still later another despatch from general pleasonton by direction of general meade to general french stating that the main army is halted because it is believed the rebels are concentrating on the road towards hagerstown beyond fairfield and is not to move until it is ascertained that the rebels intend to evacuate cumberland valley  these things appear to me to be connected with a purpose to cover baltimore and washington and to get the enemy across the river again without a further collision and they do not appear connected with a purpose to prevent his crossing and to destroy him i do fear the former purpose is acted upon and the latter rejected  if you are satisfied the latter purpose is entertained and is judiciously pursued i am content if you are not so satisfied please look to it  yours truly   a lincoln     response to a serenade  july 7

long ago is it eightyodd years since on the fourth of july for the first time in the history of the world a nation by its representatives assembled and declared as a selfevident truth that all men are created equal that was the birthday of the united states of america since then the fourth of july has had several very peculiar recognitions the two men most distinguished in the framing and support of the declaration were thomas jefferson and john adams the one having penned it and the other sustained it the most forcibly in debatethe only two of the fiftyfive who signed it and were elected presidents of the united states precisely fifty years after they put their hands to the paper it pleased almighty god to take both from this stage of action this was indeed an extraordinary and remarkable event in our history another president five years after was called from this stage of existence on the same day and month of the year and now on this last fourth of july just passed when we have a gigantic rebellion at the bottom of which is an effort to overthrow the principle that all men were created equal we have the surrender of a most powerful position and army on that very day and not only so but in the succession of battles in pennsylvania near to us through three days so rapidly fought that they might be called one great battle on the first second and third of the month of july and on the fourth the cohorts of those who opposed the declaration that all men are created equal turned tail and run  gentlemen this is a glorious theme and the occasion for a speech but i am not prepared to make one worthy of the occasion i would like to speak in terms of praise due to the many brave officers and soldiers who have fought in the cause of the union and liberties of their country from the beginning of the war these are trying occasions not only in success but for the want of success i dislike to mention the name of one single officer lest i might do wrong to those i

my dear sirmy former business partner mr frederic kidder of boston has forwarded to me a letter he has recently received from his brother edward kidder of wilmington in which edward kidder says that he has had an interview with you in which you expressed an anxiety for any peace compatible with honor that you regard slavery as already dead and the establishment of the confederacy as hopeless and that you should exert all your influence to bring about any reunion that would admit the south on terms of perfect equality with the north  on receipt of this letter i lost no time in laying it before the president of the united states who expressed great gratification at hearing such sentiments from you one of the most influential and honored of the southern governors and he desires me to say that he fully shares your anxiety for the restoration of peace between the states and for a reunion of all the states on the basis of the abolition of slaverythe bone we are fighting overand the full reinstatement of every confederate citizen in all the rights of citizenship in our common country these points conceded the president authorizes me to say that he will be glad to receive overtures from any man or body of men who have authority to control the armies of the confederacy and that he and the united states congress will be found very liberal on all collateral points that may come up in the settlement  his views on the collateral points that may naturally arise the president desires me to say he will communicate to you through me if you should suggest the personal interview that mr edward kidder recommends in his letter to his brother in that case you will please forward to me through mr kidder your official permit as governor of north carolina to enter and leave the state and to remain in it in safety during the pendency of these negotiations which i suppose should be conducted in entire secrecy until they assume an official character with high consideration i am

preserved and their peace and prosperity permanently restored but these victories have been accorded not without sacrifices of life limb health and liberty incurred by brave loyal and patriotic citizens domestic affliction in every part of the country follows in the train of these fearful bereavements it is meet and right to recognize and confess the presence of the almighty father and the

praise and prayer and i invite the people of the united states to assemble on that occasion in their customary places of worship and in the forms approved by their own consciences render the homage due to the divine majesty for the wonderful things he has done in the nations behalf and invoke the influence of his holy spirit to subdue the anger which has produced and so long sustained a needless

have general blunt removed or interfered with in his military operations he has asked that he the governor be allowed to commission officers for troops raised in kansas as other governors of loyal states do and i think he is right in this  he has asked that general blunt shall not take persons charged with civil crimes out of the hands of the courts and turn them over to mobs to be hung and i think he is right in this also he has asked that general ewings department be extended to include all kansas and i have not determined whether this is right or not  yours truly   a lincoln     telegram to governor morton  washington d c july 18 1863  governor o p morton indianapolis  what do you remember about the case of john o brown convicted of mutinous conduct and sentenced to death what do you desire about it   a lincoln     to governor parker  executive mansion washington  july 20 1863  his excellency joel parker governor of new jersey  dear siryours of the 15th has been received and considered by the secretary of war and myself i was pained to be informed this morning by the provostmarshalgeneral that new jersey is now behind twelve thousand irrespective of the draft i did not have time to ascertain by what rules this was made out and i shall be very glad if it shall by any means prove to be incorrect he also tells me that eight thousand will be about the quota of new jersey on the first draft and the secretary of war says the first draft in that state would not be made for some time in any event as every man obtained otherwise lessens the draft so much and this may supersede it altogether i hope you will push forward your volunteer regiments as fast as possible  it is a very delicate matter to postpone the draft in one state because of the argument it furnishes others to have postponement also if we could have a reason in one case which would be good if presented in all cases we could act upon it  i will thank you therefore to inform me if you can by what day at the earliest you can promise to have ready to be mustered into the united states service the eight thousand men  if you can make a reliable promise i mean one which you can rely on yourself of this sort it will be of great value if the day is not too remote  i beg you to be assured i wish to avoid the difficulties you dread as much as yourself  your obedient servant   a lincoln     to general schofield  executive mansion washington dc july 20 1863  major general john m schofield  my dear generali have received and read your letter of the 14th of july  i think the suggestion you make of discontinuing proceedings against mr mckee a very proper one while i admit that there is an apparent impropriety in the publication of the letter mentioned without my consent or yours it is still a case where no evil could result and which i am entirely willing to overlook  yours truly   a lincoln     telegram to general j m schofield  washington dc july 22 1863  major general

siryesterday little indorsements of mine went to you in two cases of postmasterships sought for widows whose husbands have fallen in the battles of this war these cases occurring on the same day brought me to reflect more attentively than i had before done as to what is fairly due from us herein the dispensing of patronage toward the men who by fighting our battles bear the chief burden of serving our country my conclusion is that other claims and qualifications being equal they have the better right and this is especially applicable to the disabled and the soldier deceased soldiers family  your obedient servant   a lincoln     to secretary of the navy  executive mansion washington july 25 1863  hon secretary of the navy  sircertain matters have come to my notice and considered by me which induce me to believe that it will conduce to the public interest for you to add to the general instructions given to our naval commanders in relation to contraband trade propositions substantially as follows to wit  first you will avoid the reality and as far as possible the appearance of using any neutral port to watch neutral vessels and then to dart out and seize them on their departure  notecomplaint is made that this has been practiced at the port of st thomas which practice if it exists is disapproved and must cease  second you will not in any case detain the crew of a captured neutral vessel or any other subject of a neutral power on board such vessel as prisoners of war or otherwise except the small number necessary as witnesses in the prize court  notethe practice here forbidden is also charged to exist which if true is disapproved and must cease  my dear sir it is not intended to be insinuated that you have been remiss in the performance of the arduous and responsible duties of your department which i take pleasure in affirming has in your hands been conducted with admirable success yet while your subordinates are almost of necessity brought into angry collision with the subjects of foreign states the representatives of those states and yourself do not come into immediate contact for the purpose of keeping the peace in spite of such collisions at that point there is an ultimate and heavy responsibility upon me  what i propose is in strict accordance with international law and is therefore unobjectionable whilst if it does no other good it will contribute to sustain a considerable portion of the present british ministry in their places who if displaced are sure to be replaced by others more unfavorable to us  your obedient servant   a lincoln     letter to governor parker  executive mansion washington  july 25 1863  his excellency governor joel parker  siryours of the 21st is received and i have taken time and considered and discussed the subject with the secretary of war and provostmarshal general in order if possible to make you a more favorable answer than i finally find myself able to do  it is a vital point with us to not have a special stipulation with the governor of any one state because it would breed trouble in many if not all other states and my idea was when i wrote you as it still is to get a point of time to which we could wait on the reason that we were not ready ourselves to proceed and which might enable you to raise the quota of your state in whole or in large part without the draft the points of time you fix are much farther off than i had hoped we might have got along in the way i have indicated for twenty or possibly thirty days as it stands the best i can say is that every volunteer you will present us within thirty days from this date fit and ready to be mustered into the united states service on the usual terms shall be pro tanto an abatement of your quota of the draft that quota i can now state at eight thousand seven hundred and eightythree 8783 no draft from new jersey other than for the above quota will be made before an additional draft common to all the states shall be required and i may add that if we get well through with this draft i entertain a strong hope that any further one may never be needed this expression of hope however must not be construed into a promise  as to conducting the draft by townships i find it would require such a waste of labor already done and such an additional amount of it and such a loss of time as to make it i fear inadmissible  your obedient servant   a lincoln  p ssince writing the above getting additional information i am enabled to say that the draft may be made in subdistricts as the enrolment has been made or is in process of making this will amount practically to drafting by townships as the enrollment subdistricts are generally about the extent of townships al     to general g g meade private  executive mansion washington july 27 1863  majorgeneral meade  i have not thrown general hooker away and therefore i would like to know whether it would be agreeable to you all things considered for him to take a corps under you if he himself is willing to do so write me in perfect freedom with the assurance that i will not subject you to any embarrassment by making your letter or its contents known to any one i wish to know your wishes before i decide whether to break the subject to him do not lean a hairs breadth against your own feelings or your judgment of the public service on the idea of gratifying me  yours truly   a lincoln     telegram to general a b burnside  war department washington july 27 1863  majorgeneral burnside cincinnati o  let me explain in general grants first despatch after the fall of vicksburg he said among other things he would send the ninth corps to you thinking it would be pleasant to you i asked the secretary of war to telegraph you the news for some reasons never mentioned to us by general grant they have not been sent though we have seen outside intimations that they took part in the expedition against jackson general grant is a copious worker and fighter but a very meager writer or telegrapher no doubt he changed his purpose in regard to the ninth corps for some sufficient reason but has forgotten to notify us of it   a lincoln     to general h w halleck  executive mansion july 29 1863  majorgeneral halleck  seeing general meades despatch of yesterday to yourself causes me to fear that he supposes the government here is demanding of him to bring on a general engagement with lee as soon as possible i am claiming no such thing of him in fact my judgment is against it which judgment of course i will yield if yours and his are the contrary if he could not safely engage lee at williamsport it seems absurd to suppose he can safely engage him now when he has scarcely more than two thirds of the force he had at williamsport while it must be that lee has been reinforced true i desired general meade to pursue lee across the potomac hoping as has proved true that he would thereby clear the baltimore and ohio railroad and get some advantages by harassing him on his retreat these being past i am unwilling he should now get into a general engagement on the impression that we here are pressing him and i shall be glad for you to so inform him unless your own judgment is against it  yours truly  a lincoln  h w halleck generalinchief     to secretary stanton  executive mansion washington july 29 1863  hon secretary of war  sircan we not renew the effort to organize a force to go to western texas  please consult with the generalinchief on the subject  if the governor of new jersey shall furnish any new regiments might not they be put into such an expedition please think of it  i believe no local object is now more desirable  yours truly   a lincoln     order of retaliation  executive mansion washington july 30 1863  it is the duty of every government to give protection to its citizens of whatever class color or condition and especially to those who are duly organized as soldiers in the public service the law of nations and the usages and customs of war as carried on by civilized powers permit no distinction as to color in the treatment of prisoners of war as public enemies to sell or enslave any captured person on account of his color and for no offense against the laws of war is a relapse into barbarism and a crime against the civilization of the age  the government of the united states will give the same protection to all its soldiers and if the enemy shall sell or enslave any one because of his color the offense shall be punished by retaliation upon the enemys prisoners in our possession  it is therefore ordered that for every soldier of the united states killed in violation of the laws of war a rebel soldier shall be executed and for every one enslaved by the enemy or sold into slavery a rebel soldier shall be placed at hard labor on the public works and continued at such labor until the other shall be released and receive the treatment due to a prisoner of war   a lincoln     to general s a hurlbut  executive mansion washington july 31 1863  my dear general hurlbut  your letter by mr dana was duly received i now learn that your resignation has reached the war department i also learn that an active command has been assigned you by general grant the secretary of war and general halleck are very partial to you as you know i also am we all wish you to reconsider the question of resigning not that we would wish to retain you greatly against your wish and interest but that your decision may be at least a very wellconsidered one  i understand that senator william k sebastian of arkansas thinks of offering to resume his place in the senate of course the senate and not i would decide whether to admit or reject him still i should feel great interest in the question it may be so presented as to be one of the very greatest national importance and it may be otherwise so presented as to be of no more than temporary personal consequence to him  the emancipation proclamation applies to arkansas i think it is valid in law and will be so held by the courts i think i shall not retract or repudiate it those who shall have tasted actual freedom i believe can never be slaves or quasislaves again for the rest i believe some plan substantially being gradual emancipation would be better for both white and black the missouri plan recently adopted i do not object to on account of the time for ending the institution but i am sorry the beginning should have been postponed for seven years leaving all that time to agitate for the repeal of the whole thing it should begin at once giving at least the newborn a vested interest in freedom which could not be taken away if senator sebastian could come with something of this sort from arkansas i at least should take great interest in his case and i believe a single individual will have scarcely done the world so great a service see him if you can and read this to him but charge him not to make it public for the present write me again  yours very truly   a lincoln     telegram from governor seymour  albany august 1 1863 recvd 2 pm  to the president of the united states  i ask that the draft be suspended in this state until i can send you a communication i am preparing  horatio seymour     telegram to governor seymour  washington dc august 1 1863 4 pm  his excellency governor seymour albany ny  by what day may i expect your communication to reach me are you anxious about any part except the city and vicinity   a lincoln     telegram to general foster  executive mansion washington august 3 1863  majorgeneral foster or whoever may be in command of the military department with headquarters at fort monroe va  if dr wright on trial at norfolk has been or shall be convicted send me a transcript of his trial and conviction and do not let execution be done upon him until my further order   a lincoln     to general n p banks  executive mansion washington august 51863  my dear general banks  while i very well know what i would be glad for louisiana to do it is quite a different thing for me to assume direction of the matter i would be glad for her to make a new constitution recognizing the emancipation proclamation and adopting emancipation in those parts of the state to which the proclamation does not apply and while she is at it i think it would not be objectionable for her to adopt some practical system by which the two races could gradually live themselves out of their old relation to each other and both come out better prepared for the new education for young blacks should be included in the plan after all the power or element of contract may be sufficient for this probationary period and by its simplicity and flexibility may be the better  as an antislavery man i have a motive to desire emancipation which proslavery men do not have but even they have strong enough reason to thus place themselves again under the shield of the union and to thus perpetually hedge against the recurrence of the scenes through which we are now passing  governor shepley has informed me that mr durant is now taking a registry with a view to the election of a constitutional convention in louisiana this to me appears proper if such convention were to ask my views i could present little else than what i now say to you i think the thing should be pushed forward so that if possible its mature work may reach here by the meeting of congress  for my own part i think i shall not in any event retract the emancipation proclamation nor as executive ever return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of congress  if louisiana shall send members to congress their admission to seats will depend as you know upon the respective houses and not upon the president  yours very truly   a lincoln     to governor seymour  executive mansion washington august 7 1863  his excellency horatio seymour governor of new york  your communication of the 3rd instant has been received and attentively considered  i cannot consent to suspend the draft in new york as you request because among other reasons time is too important  by the figures you send which i presume are correct the twelve districts represented fall into two classes of eight and four respectively the disparity of the quotas for the draft in these two classes is certainly very striking being the difference between an average of 2200 in one class and 4864 in the other assuming that the districts are equal one to another in entire population as required by the plan on which they were made this disparity is such as to require attention much of it however i suppose will be accounted for by the fact that so many more persons fit for soldiers are in the city than are in the country who have too recently arrived from other parts of the united states and from europe to be either included in the census of 1860 or to have voted in 1862 still making due allowance for this i am yet unwilling to stand upon it as an entirely sufficient explanation of the great disparity  i shall direct the draft to proceed in all the districts drawing however at first from each of the four districtsto wit the second fourth sixth and eighthonly 2200 being the average quota of the other class after this drawing these four districts and also the seventeenth and twentyninth shall be carefully reenrolled and if you please agents of yours may witness every step of the process any deficiency which may appear by the new enrolment will be supplied by a special draft for that object allowing due credit for volunteers who may be obtained from these districts respectively during the interval and at all points so far as consistent with practical convenience due credits shall be given for volunteers and your excellency shall be notified of the time fixed for commencing the draft in each district  i do not object to abide a decision of the united states supreme court or of the judges thereof on the constitutionality of the draft law in fact i should be willing to facilitate the obtaining of it but i cannot consent to lose the time while it is being obtained we are contending with an enemy who as i understand drives every ablebodied man he can reach into his ranks very much as a butcher drives bullocks into the slaughterpen no time is wasted no argument is used this produces an army which will soon turn upon our now victorious soldiers already in the field if they shall not be sustained by recruits as they should be it produces an army with a rapidity not to be matched on our side if we first waste time to reexperiment with the volunteer system already deemed by congress and palpably in fact so far exhausted as to be inadequate and then more time to obtain a court decision as to whether a law is constitutional which requires a part of those not now in the service to go to the aid of those who are already in it and still more time to determine with absolute certainty that we get those who are to go in the precisely legal proportion to those who are not to go my purpose is to be in my action just and constitutional and yet practical in performing the important duty with which i am charged of maintaining the unity and the free principles of our common country  your obedient servant   a lincoln     to general us grant  executive mansion washington august 9 1863  my dear general grant  i see by a despatch of yours that you incline quite strongly toward an expedition against mobile this would appear tempting to me also were it not that in view of recent events in mexico i am greatly impressed with the importance of reestablishing the national authority in western texas as soon as possible i am not making an order however that i leave for the present at least to the generalinchief  a word upon another subject general thomas has gone again to the mississippi valley with the view of raising colored troops i have no reason to doubt that you are doing what you reasonably can upon the same subject i believe it is a resource which if vigorously applied now will soon close the contest it works doubly weakening the enemy and strengthening us we were not fully ripe for it until the river was opened now i think at least one hundred thousand can and ought to be rapidly organized along its shores relieving all white troops to serve elsewhere mr dana understands you as believing that the emancipation proclamation has helped some in your military operations i am very glad if this is so  did you receive a short letter from me dated the 13th of july  yours very truly   a lincoln     to general w s rosecrans  executive mansion washington august 10 1863  my dear general rosecrans  yours of the 1st was received two days ago i think you must have inferred more than general halleck has intended as to any dissatisfaction of mine with you i am sure you as a reasonable man would not have been wounded could you have heard all my words and seen all my thoughts in regard to you i have not abated in my kind feeling for and confidence in you i have seen most of your despatches to general halleckprobably all of them after grant invested vicksburg i was very anxious lest johnston should overwhelm him from the outside and when it appeared certain that part of braggs force had gone and was going to johnston it did seem to me it was exactly the proper time for you to attack bragg with what force he had left in all kindness let me say it so seems to me yet finding from your despatches to general halleck that your judgment was different and being very anxious for grant i on one occasion told general halleck i thought he should direct you to decide at once to immediately attack bragg or to stand on the defensive and send part of your force to grant he replied he had already so directed in substance soon after despatches from grant abated my anxiety for him and in proportion abated my anxiety about any movement of yours when afterward however i saw a despatch of yours arguing that the right time for you to attack bragg was not before but would be after the fall of vicksburg it impressed me very strangely and i think i so stated to the secretary of war and general halleck it seemed no other than the proposition that you could better fight bragg when johnston should be at liberty to return and assist him than you could before he could so return to his assistance  since grant has been entirely relieved by the fall of vicksburg by which johnston is also relieved it has seemed to me that your chance for a stroke has been considerably diminished and i have not been pressing you directly or indirectly true i am very anxious for east tennessee to be occupied by us but i see and appreciate the difficulties you mention the question occurs can the thing be done at all does preparation advance at all do you not consume supplies as fast as you get them forward have you more animals today than you had at the battle of stones river and yet have not more been furnished you since then than your entire present stock i ask the same questions as to your mounted force  do not misunderstand i am not casting blame upon you i rather think by great exertion you can get to east tennessee but a very important question is can you stay there i make no order in the casethat i leave to general halleck and yourself  and now be assured once more that i think of you in all kindness and confidence and that i am not watching you with an evil eye  yours very truly   a lincoln     to governor seymour  executive mansion washington august 111863  his excellency horatio seymour governor of new york  yours of the 8th with judgeadvocategeneral waterburys report was received today  asking you to remember that i consider time as being very important both to the general cause of the country and to the soldiers in the field i beg to remind you that i waited at your request from the 1st until the 6th inst to receive your communication dated the 3d in view of its great length and the known time and apparent care taken in its preparation i did not doubt that it contained your full case as you desired to present it it contained the figures for twelve districts omitting the other nineteen as i suppose because you found nothing to complain of as to them i answered accordingly in doing so i laid down the principle to which i purpose adhering which is to proceed with the draft at the same time employing infallible means to avoid any great wrong with the communication received today you send figures for twentyeight districts including the twelve sent before and still omitting three for which i suppose the enrolments are not yet received in looking over the fuller list of twentyeight districts i find that the quotas for sixteen of them are above 2000 and below 2700 while of the rest six are above 2700 and six are below 2000 applying the principle to these new facts the fifth and seventh districts must be added to the four in which the quotas have already been reduced to 2200 for the first draft and with these four others just be added to those to be reenrolled the correct case will then stand the quotas of the second fourth fifth sixth seventh and eighth districts fixed at 2200 for the first draft the provostmarshalgeneral informs me that the drawing is already completed in the sixteenth seventeenth eighteenth twentysecond twentyfourth twentysixth twentyseventh twentyeighth twentyninth and thirtieth districts in the others except the three outstanding the drawing will be made upon the quotas as now fixed after the first draft the second fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth sixteenth seventeenth twentyfirst twentyfifth twentyninth and thirtyfirst will be enrolled for the purpose and in the manner stated in my letter of the 7th inst the same principle will be applied to the now outstanding districts when they shall come in no part of my former letter is repudiated by reason of not being restated in this or for any other cause  your obedient servant   a lincoln     to general j a mcclernand  executive mansion washington august 12 1863  majorgeneral mcclernand  my dear sirour friend william g greene has just presented a kind letter in regard to yourself addressed to me by our other friends yates hatch and dubois  i doubt whether your present position is more painful to you than to myself grateful for the patriotic stand so early taken by you in this lifeanddeath struggle of the nation i have done whatever has appeared practicable to advance you and the public interest together no charges with a view to a trial have been preferred against you by any one nor do i suppose any will be all there is so far as i have heard is general grants statement of his reasons for relieving you and even this i have not seen or sought to see because it is a case as appears to me in which i could do nothing without doing harm general grant and yourself have been conspicuous in our most important successes and for me to interfere and thus magnify a breach between you could not but be of evil effect better leave it where the law of the case has placed it for me to force you back upon general grant would be forcing him to resign i cannot give you a new command because we have no forces except such as already have commanders  i am constantly pressed by those who scold before they think or without thinking at all to give commands respectively to fremont mcclellan butler sigel curtis hunter hooker and perhaps others when all else out of the way i have no commands to give them this is now your case which as i have said pains me not less than it does you my belief is that the permanent estimate of what a general does in the field is fixed by the cloud of witnesses who have been with him in the field and that relying on these he who has the right needs not to fear  your friend as ever   a lincoln     telegram to governor seymour  executive mansion washington august 16 1863  governor seymour new york  your despatch of this morning is just received and i fear i do not perfectly understand it  my view of the principle is that every soldier obtained voluntarily leaves one less to be obtained by draft the only difficulty is in applying the principle properly looking to time as heretofore i am unwilling to give up a drafted man now even for the certainty much less for the mere chance of getting a volunteer hereafter again after the draft in any district would it not make trouble to take any drafted man out and put a volunteer infor how shall it be determined which drafted man is to have the privilege of thus going out to the exclusion of all the others and even before the draft in any district the quota must be fixed and the draft must be postponed indefinitely if every time a volunteer is offered the officers must stop and reconstruct the quota at least i fear there might be this difficulty but at all events let credits for volunteers be given up to the last moment which will not produce confusion or delay that the principle of giving credits for volunteers shall be applied by districts seems fair and proper though i do not know how far by present statistics it is practicable when for any cause a fair credit is not given at one time it should be given as soon thereafter as practicable my purpose is to be just and fair and yet to not lose time   a lincoln     to j h hackett  executive mansion washington august 17 1863  james h hackett esq  my dear sirmonths ago i should have acknowledged the receipt of your book and accompanying kind note and i now have to beg your pardon for not having done so  for one of my age i have seen very little of the drama the first presentation of falstaff i ever saw was yours here last winter or spring perhaps the best compliment i can pay is to say as i truly can i am very anxious to see it again some of shakespeares plays i have never read while others i have gone over perhaps as frequently as any unprofessional reader among the latter are lear richard iii henry viii hamlet and especially macbeth i think nothing equals macbeth it is wonderful  unlike you gentlemen of the profession i think the soliloquy in hamlet commencing oh my offense is rank surpasses that commencing to be or not to be but pardon this small attempt at criticism i should like to hear you pronounce the opening speech of richard iii will you not soon visit washington again if you do please call and let me make your personal acquaintance  yours truly   a lincoln     to f f lowe  washington d c august 17 1863  hon p f lowe san francisco cal  there seems to be considerable misunderstanding about the recent movement to take possession of the new almaden mine it has no reference to any other mine or mines  in regard to mines and miners generally no change of policy by the government has been decided on or even thought of so far as i know  the new almaden mine was peculiar in this that its occupants claimed to be the legal owners of it on a mexican grant and went into court on that claim the case found its way into the supreme court of the united states and last term in and by that court the claim of the occupants was decided to be utterly fraudulent thereupon it was considered the duty of the government by the secretary of the interior the attorneygeneral and myself to take possession of the premises and the attorneygeneral carefully made out the writ and i signed it it was not obtained surreptitiously although i suppose general halleck thought it had been when he telegraphed simply because he thought possession was about being taken by a military order while he knew no such order had passed through his hands as generalinchief  the writ was suspended upon urgent representations from california simply to keep the peace it never had any direct or indirect reference to any mine place or person except the new almaden mine and the persons connected with it   a lincoln     telegram to general meade  executive mansion washington august 21 1863  majorgeneral meade warrenton

to attend a mass meeting of unconditional union men to be held at the capital of illinois on the 3d day of september has been received it would be very agreeable for me thus to meet my old friends at my own home but i cannot just now be absent from here so long as a visit there would require  the meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional devotion to the union and i am sure that my old political friends will thank me for tendering as i do the nations gratitude to those other noble men whom no partisan malice or partisan hope can make false to the nations life  there are those who are dissatisfied with me to such i would say you desire peace and you blame me that we do not have it but how can we obtain it there are but three conceivable ways  firstto suppress the rebellion by force of arms this i am trying to do are you for it if you are so far we are agreed if you are not for it a second way is to give up the union i am against this are you for it if you are you should say so plainly if you are not for force nor yet for dissolution there only remains some imaginable compromise  i do not believe that any compromise embracing the maintenance of the union is now possible all that i learn leads to a directly opposite belief the strength of the rebellion is its military its army that army dominates all the country and all the people within its range any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range in opposition to that army is simply nothing for the present because such man or men have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise if one were made with them  to illustrate suppose refugees from the south and peace men of the north get together in convention and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing a restoration of the union in what way can that compromise be used to keep lees army out of pennsylvania meades army can keep lees army out of pennsylvania and i think can ultimately drive it out of existence but no paper compromise to which the controllers of lees army are not agreed can at all affect that army in an effort at such compromise we would waste time which the enemy would improve to our disadvantage and that would be all  a compromise to be effective must be made either with those who control the rebel army or with the people first liberated from the domination of that army by the success of our own army now allow me to assure you that no word or intimation from that rebel army or from any of the men controlling it in relation to any peace compromise has ever come to my knowledge or belief all charges and insinuations to the contrary are deceptive and groundless and i promise you that if any such proposition shall hereafter come it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from you i freely acknowledge myself to be the servant of the people according to the bond of service the united states constitution and that as such i am responsible to them  but to be plain you are dissatisfied with me about the negro quite likely there is a difference of opinion between you and myself upon that subject i certainly wish that all men could be free while you i suppose do not yet i have neither adopted nor proposed any measure which is not consistent with even your view provided you are for the union i suggested compensated emancipation to which you replied you wished not to be taxed to buy negroes but i had not asked you to be taxed to buy negroes except in such way as to save you from greater taxation to save the union exclusively by other means  you dislike the emancipation proclamation and perhaps would have it retracted you say it is unconstitutional i think differently i think the constitution invests its commanderinchief with the law of war in time of war the most that can be said if so much is that slaves are property is there has there ever been any question that by the law of war property both of enemies and friends may be taken when needed and is it not needed whenever it helps us and hurts the enemy armies the world over destroy enemies property when they cannot use it and even destroy their own to keep it from the enemy civilized belligerents do all in their power to help themselves or hurt the enemy except a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished foes and noncombatants male and female  but the proclamation as law either is valid or is not valid if it is not valid it needs no retraction if it is valid it cannot be retracted any more than the dead can be brought to life some of you profess to think its retraction would operate favorably for the union why better after the retraction than before the issue there was more than a year and a half of trial to suppress the rebellion before the proclamation was issued the last one hundred days of which passed under an explicit notice that it was coming unless averted by those in revolt returning to their allegiance the war has certainly progressed as favorably for us since the issue of the proclamation as before  i know as fully as one can know the opinions of others that some of the commanders of our armies in the field who have given us our most important victories believe the emancipation policy and the use of colored troops constitute the heaviest blows yet dealt to the rebellion and that at least one of those important successes could not have been achieved when it was but for the aid of black soldiers  among the commanders who hold these views are some who have never had any affinity with what is called abolitionism or with republican party politics but who hold them purely as military opinions i submit their opinions are entitled to some weight against the objections often urged that emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures and were not adopted as such in good faith  you say that you will not fight to free negroes some of them seem willing to fight for you but no matter fight you then exclusively to save the union i issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the union whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the union if i shall urge you to continue fighting it will be an apt time then for you to declare you will not fight to free negroes i thought that in your struggle for the union to whatever extent the negroes should cease helping the enemy to that extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance to you do you think differently i thought that whatever negroes can be got to do as soldiers leaves just so much less for white soldiers to do in saving the union does it appear otherwise to you but negroes like other people act upon motives why should they do anything for us if we will do nothing for them if they stake their lives for us they must be prompted by the strongest motive even the promise of freedom and the promise being made must be kept  the signs look better the father of waters again goes unvexed to the sea

argument with you on military questions you had informed me you were impressed through general halleck that i was dissatisfied with you and i could not bluntly deny that i was without unjustly implicating him i therefore concluded to tell you the plain truth being satisfied the matter would thus appear much smaller than it would if seen by mere glimpses i repeat that my appreciation of you has not abated i can never forget whilst i remember anything that about the end of last year and the beginning of this you gave us a hardearned victory which had there been a defeat instead the nation

time for reinaugurating a loyal state government not a moment should be lost you and the cooperating friends there can better judge of the ways and means than can be judged by any here i only offer a few suggestions the reinauguration must not be such as to give control of the state and its representation in congress to the enemies of the union driving its friends there into political exile the whole struggle for tennessee will have been profitless to both state and nation if it so ends that governor johnson is put down and governor harris put up it must not be so you must have it otherwise let the reconstruction be the work of such men only as can be trusted for the union exclude all others and trust that your government so organized will be recognized here as being the one of republican form to be guaranteed to the state and to be protected against invasion and domestic violence it is something on the question of time to remember that it cannot be known who is next to occupy the position i now hold nor what he will do i see that you have declared in favor of emancipation in tennessee for which may god bless you get emancipation into your new state government

suspending writ of habeas corpus september 15 1863  by the president of the united states of america  a proclamation  whereas the constitution of the united states has ordained that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it and  whereas a rebellion was existing on the third day of march 1863 which rebellion is still existing and  whereas by a statute which was approved on that day it was enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states in congress assembled that during the present insurrection the president of the united states whenever in his judgment the public safety may require is authorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in any case throughout the united states or any part thereof and  whereas in the judgment of the president the public safety does require that the privilege of the said writ shall new be suspended throughout the united states in the cases where by the authority of the president of the united states military naval and civil officers of the united states or any of them hold persons under their command or in their custody either as prisoners of war spies or aiders or abettors of the enemy or officers soldiers or seamen enrolled or drafted or mustered or enlisted in or belonging to the land or naval forces of the united states or as deserters therefrom or otherwise amenable to military law or the rules and articles of war or the rules or regulations prescribed for the military or naval services by authority of the president of the united states or for resisting a draft or for any other offense against the military or naval service  now therefore i abraham lincoln president of the united states do hereby proclaim and make known to all whom it may concern that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is suspended throughout the united states in the several cases before mentioned and that this suspension will continue throughout the duration of the said rebellion or until this proclamation shall by a subsequent one to be issued by the president of the united states be modified or revoked and i do hereby require all magistrates attorneys and other civil officers within the united states and all officers and others in the military and naval services of the united states to take distinct notice of this suspension and to give it full effect and all citizens of the united states to conduct and govern themselves accordingly and in conformity with the constitution of the united

private  executive mansion washington d c september 191863  hon andrew johnson  my dear sirherewith i send you a paper substantially the same as the one drawn up by yourself and mentioned in your despatch but slightly changed in two particulars first yours was so drawn as that i authorized you to carry into effect the fourth section etc whereas i so modify it as to authorize you to so act as to require the united states to carry into effect that section  secondly you had a clause committing me in some sort to the state constitution of tennessee which i feared might embarrass you in making a new constitution if you desire so i dropped that clause  yours very truly   a lincoln  inclosure  executive mansion washington d c  september 19 1863  hon andrew johnson military governor of tennessee  in addition to the matters contained in the orders and instructions given you by the secretary of war you are hereby authorized to exercise such powers as may be necessary and proper to enable the loyal people of tennessee to present such a republican form of state government as will entitle the state to the guaranty of the united states therefor and to be protected under such state government by the united states against invasion and domestic violence all according to the fourth section of the fourth article of the constitution of the united states   a lincoln     military strategy  to general h w halleck  executive mansion washington dc september 19 1863  majorgeneral halleck  by general meades despatch to you of yesterday it appears that he desires your views and those of the government as to whether he shall advance upon the enemy i am not prepared to order or even advise an advance in this case wherein i know so little of particulars and wherein he in the field thinks the risk is so great and the promise of advantage so small  and yet the case presents matter for very serious consideration in another aspect these two armies confront each other across a small river substantially midway between the two capitals each defending its own capital and menacing the other general meade estimates the enemys infantry in front of him at not less than 40000 suppose we add fifty per cent to this for cavalry artillery and extraduty men stretching as far as richmond making the whole force of the enemy 60000  general meade as shown by the returns has with him and between him and washington of the same classes of well men over 90000 neither can bring the whole of his men into a battle but each can bring as large a percentage in as the other for a battle then general meade has three men to general lees two yet it having been determined that choosing ground and standing on the defensive gives so great advantage that the three cannot safely attack the two the three are left simply standing on the defensive also  if the enemys 60000 are sufficient to keep our 90000 away from richmond why by the same rule may not 40000 of ours keep their 60000 away from washington leaving us 50000 to put to some other use having practically come to the mere defensive it seems to be no economy at all to employ twice as many men for that object as are needed with no object certainly to mislead myself i can perceive no fault in this statement unless we admit we are not the equal of the enemy man for man i hope you will consider it  to avoid misunderstanding let me say that to attempt to fight the enemy slowly back into his entrenchments at richmond and then to capture him is an idea i have been trying to repudiate for quite a year  my judgment is so clear against it that i would scarcely allow the attempt to be made if the general in command should desire to make it my last attempt upon richmond was to get mcclellan when he was nearer there than the enemy was to run in ahead of him since then i have constantly desired the army of the potomac to make lees army and not richmond its objective point if our army cannot fall upon the enemy and hurt him where he is it is plain to me it can gain nothing by attempting to follow him over a succession of intrenched lines into a fortified city  yours truly   a lincoln     telegram to mrs lincoln  war

apparently healthy that i would be glad for you to come nothing very particular but i would be glad to see you and tad   a lincoln     to general h w halleck  executive mansion washington d c september 21 1863  majorgeneral halleck  i think it very important for general rosecrans to hold his position at or about chattanooga because if held from that place to cleveland both inclusive it keeps all tennessee clear of the enemy and also breaks one of his most important railroad lines to prevent these consequences is so vital to his cause that he cannot give up the effort to dislodge us from the position thus bringing him to us and saving us the labor expense and hazard of going farther to find him and also giving us the advantage of choosing our own ground and preparing it to fight him upon the details must of course be left to general rosecrans while we must furnish him the means to the utmost of our ability if you concur i think he would better be informed that we are not pushing him beyond this position and that in fact our judgment is rather against his going beyond it if he can only maintain this position without more this rebellion can only eke out a short and feeble existence as an animal sometimes may with a thorn in its vitals  yours truly  a lincoln     telegram to general a e burnside  executive mansion washington dc september 21 1863  general burnside

executive mansion washington  october 1 1863  general john m schofield  there is no organized military force in avowed opposition to the general government now in missouri and if any shall reappear your duty in regard to it will be too plain to require any special instruction still the condition of things both there and elsewhere is such as to render it indispensable to maintain for a time the united states military establishment in that state as well as to rely upon it for a fair contribution of support to that establishment generally your immediate duty in regard to missouri now is to advance the efficiency of that establishment and to so use it as far as practicable to compel the excited people there to let one another alone  under your recent order which i have approved you will only arrest individuals and suppress assemblies or newspapers when they may be working palpable injury to the military in your charge and in no other case will you interfere with the expression of opinion in any form or allow it to be interfered with violently by others in this you have a discretion to exercise with great caution calmness and forbearance  with the matter of removing the inhabitants of certain counties en masse and of removing certain individuals from time to time who are supposed to be mischievous i am not now interfering but am leaving to your own discretion  nor am i interfering with what may still seem to you to be necessary restrictions upon trade and intercourse i think proper however to enjoin upon you the following allow no part of the military under your command to be engaged in either returning fugitive slaves or in forcing or enticing slaves from their homes and so far as practicable enforce the same forbearance upon the people  report to me your opinion upon the availability for good of the enrolled militia of the state allow no one to enlist colored troops except upon orders from you or from here through you  allow no one to assume the functions of confiscating property under the law of congress or otherwise except upon orders from here  at elections see that those and only those are allowed to vote who are entitled to do so by the laws of missouri including as of those laws the restrictions laid by the missouri convention upon those who may have participated in the rebellion  so far as practicable you will by means of your military force expel guerrillas marauders and murderers and all who are known to harbor aid or abet them but in like manner you will repress assumptions of unauthorized individuals to perform the same service because under pretense of doing this they become marauders and murderers themselves  to now restore peace let the military obey orders and those not of the military leave each other alone thus not breaking the peace themselves  in giving the above directions it is not intended to restrain you in other expedient and necessary matters not falling within their range  your obedient servant   a lincoln     telegram to general s m schofield  washington dc october 2 1863  majorgeneral schofield  i have just seen your despatch to halleck about majorgeneral blunt if possible you better allow me

free colored   a lincoln     proclamation for thanksgiving october 3 1863  by the president of the united states america  a proclamation  the year that is drawing towards its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies to these bounties which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come others have been added which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the everwatchful providence of almighty god in the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity which has sometimes seemed to invite and provoke the aggressions of foreign states peace has been preserved with all nations order has been maintained the laws have been respected and obeyed and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the union the needful diversion of wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defense has not arrested the plough the shuttle or the ship the axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements and the mines as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore population has steadily increased notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp the siege and the battlefield and the country rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor is permitted to expect a continuance of years with large increase of freedom  no human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things they are the gracious gifts of the most high god who while dealing with us in anger for our sins hath nevertheless remembered mercy  it has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be reverently solemnly and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and voice by the whole american people i do therefore invite my fellowcitizens in every part of the united states and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands to set apart and observe the last thursday of november next as a day of thanksgiving and prayer to our beneficent father who dwelleth in the heavens and i recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to him for such singular deliverances and blessings they do also with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience commend to his tender care all those who have become widows orphans mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged and fervently implore the interposition of the almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it as soon as may be consistent with divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace harmony tranquillity and union  in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed  done at the city of washington this third day of october in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixtythree and of the independence of the united states the eightyeighth   a lincoln  by the president  william h seward   secretary of state     telegram to general j m schofield  washington dc october 4 1863  majorgeneral schofield st louis mo  i think you will not have just cause to complain of my action   a lincoln     telegram to general w s rosecrans  war department october 4 1863 1130 am  majorgeneral rosecrans chattanooga tenn  yours of yesterday received if we can hold chattanooga and east tennessee i think the rebellion must dwindle and die i think you and burnside can do this and hence doing so is your main object of course to greatly damage or destroy the enemy in your front would be a greater object because it would include the former and more but it is not so certainly within your power i understand the main body of the enemy is very near you so near that you could board at home so to speak and menace or attack him any day would not the doing of this be your best mode of counteracting his raid on your communications but this is not an order i intend doing something like what you suggest whenever the case shall appear ripe enough to have it accepted in the true understanding rather than as a confession of weakness and fear   a lincoln     to c d drake and others  executive mansion washington october 5 1863  hon charles d drake and others committee  gentlemenyour original address presented on the 30th ult and the four supplementary ones presented on the 3d inst have been carefully considered i hope you will regard the other duties claiming my attention together with the great length and importance of these documents as constituting a sufficient apology for not having responded sooner  these papers framed for a common object consist of the things demanded and the reasons for demanding them  the things demanded are  first that general schofield shall be relieved and general butler be appointed as commander of the military department of missouri  second that the system of enrolled militia in missouri may be broken up and national forces he substituted for it and  third that at elections persons may not be allowed to vote who are not entitled by law to do so  among the reasons given enough of suffering and wrong to union men is certainly and i suppose truly stated yet the whole case as presented fails to convince me that general schofield or the enrolled militia is responsible for that suffering and wrong the whole can be explained on a more charitable and as i think a more rational hypothesis  we are in a civil war in such cases there always is a main question but in this case that question is a perplexing compoundunion and slavery it thus becomes a question not of two sides merely but of at least four sides even among those who are for the union saying nothing of those who are against it thus those who are for the union with but not without slavery those for it without but not with those for it with or without but prefer it with and those for it with or without but prefer it without  among these again is a subdivision of those who are for gradual but not for immediate and those who are for immediate but not for gradual extinction of slavery  it is easy to conceive that all these shades of opinion and even more may be sincerely entertained by honest and truthful men yet all being for the union by reason of these differences each will prefer a different way of sustaining the union at once sincerity is questioned and motives are assailed actual war comming blood grows hot and blood is spilled thought is forced from old channels into confusion deception breeds and thrives confidence dies and universal suspicion reigns each man feels an impulse to kill his neighbor lest he be killed by him revenge and retaliation follow and all this as before said may be among honest men only but this is not all every foul bird comes abroad and every dirty reptile rises up these add crime to confusion strong measures deemed indispensable but harsh at best such men make worse by maladministration murders for old grudges and murders for self proceed under any cloak that will best serve for the occasion  these causes amply account for what has occurred in missouri without ascribing it to the weakness or wickedness of any general the newspaper files those chroniclers of current events will show that the evils now complained of were quite as prevalent under fremont hunter halleck and curtis as under schofield if the former had greater force opposed to them they also had greater force with which to meet it when the organized rebel army left the state the main federal force had to go also leaving the department commander at home relatively no stronger than before without disparaging any i affirm with confidence that no commander of that department has in proportion to his means done better than general schofield  the first specific charge against general schofield is that the enrolled militia was placed under his command whereas it had not been placed under the command of general curtis the fact is i believe true but you do not point out nor can i conceive how that did or could injure loyal men or the union cause  you charge that general curtis being superseded by general schofield franklin a dick was superseded by james o broadhead as provostmarshal general no very specific showing is made as to how this did or could injure the union cause it recalls however the condition of things as presented to me which led to a change of commander of that department  to restrain contraband intelligence and trade a system of searches seizures permits and passes had been introduced i think by general fremont when general halleck came he found and continued the system and added an order applicable to some parts of the state to levy and collect contributions from noted rebels to compensate losses and relieve destitution caused by the rebellion the action of general fremont and general halleck as stated constituted a sort of system which general curtis found in full operation when he took command of the department that there was a necessity for something of the sort was clear but that it could only be justified by stern necessity and that it was liable to great abuse in administration was equally clear agents to execute it contrary to the great prayer were led into temptation some might while others would not resist that temptation it was not possible to hold any to a very strict accountability and those yielding to the temptation would sell permits and passes to those who would pay most and most readily for them and would seize property and collect levies in the aptest way to fill their own pockets money being the object the man having money whether loyal or disloyal would be a victim this practice doubtless existed to some extent and it was a real additional evil that it could be and was plausibly charged to exist in greater extent than it did  when general curtis took command of the department mr dick against whom i never knew anything to allege had general charge of this system a controversy in regard to it rapidly grew into almost unmanageable proportions one side ignored the necessity and magnified the evils of the system while the other ignored the evils and magnified the necessity and each bitterly assailed the other i could not fail to see that the controversy enlarged in the same proportion as the professed union men there distinctly took sides in two opposing political parties i exhausted my wits and very nearly my patience also in efforts to convince both that the evils they charged on each other were inherent in the case and could not be cured by giving either party a victory over the other  plainly the irritating system was not to be perpetual and it was plausibly urged that it could be modified at once with advantage the case could scarcely be worse and whether it could be made better could only be determined by a trial in this view and not to ban or brand general curtis or to give a victory to any party i made the change of commander for the department i now learn that soon after this change mr dick was removed and that mr broadhead a gentleman of no less good character was put in the place the mere fact of this change is more distinctly complained of than is any conduct of the new officer or other consequence of the change  i gave the new commander no instructions as to the administration of the system mentioned beyond what is contained in the private letter afterwards surreptitiously published in which i directed him to act solely for the public good and independently of both parties neither any thing you have presented me nor anything i have otherwise learned has convinced me that he has been unfaithful to this charge  imbecility is urged as one cause for removing general schofield and the late massacre at lawrence kansas is pressed as evidence of that imbecility to my mind that fact scarcely tends to prove the proposition that massacre is only an example of what grierson john morgan and many others might have repeatedly done on their respective raids had they chosen to incur the personal hazard and possessed the fiendish hearts to do it  the charge is made that general schofield on purpose to protect the lawrence murderers would not allow them to be pursued into missouri while no punishment could be too sudden or too severe for those murderers i am well satisfied that the preventing of the threatened remedial raid into missouri was the only way to avoid an indiscriminate massacre there including probably more innocent than guilty instead of condemning i therefore approve what i understand general schofield did in that respect  the charges that general schofield has purposely withheld protection from loyal people and purposely facilitated the objects of the disloyal are altogether beyond my power of belief i do not arraign the veracity of gentlemen as to the facts complained of but i do more than question the judgment which would infer that those facts occurred in accordance with the purposes of general schofield  with my present views i must decline to remove general schofield in this i decide nothing against general butler i sincerely wish it were convenient to assign him a suitable command in order to meet some existing evils i have addressed a letter of instructions to general schofield a copy of which i enclose to you  as to the enrolled militia i shall endeavor to ascertain better than i now know what is its exact value let me say now however that your proposal to substitute national forces for the enrolled militia implies that in your judgment the latter is doing something which needs to be done and if so the proposition to throw that force away and to supply its place by bringing other forces from the field where they are urgently needed seems to me very extraordinary whence shall they come shall they be withdrawn from banks or grant or steele or rosecrans few things have been so grateful to my anxious feelings as when in june last the local force in missouri aided general schofield to so promptly send a large general force to the relief of general grant then investing vicksburg and menaced from without by general johnston was this all wrong should the enrolled militia then have been broken up and general herron kept from grant to police missouri so far from finding cause to object i confess to a sympathy for whatever relieves our general force in missouri and allows it to serve elsewhere i therefore as at present advised cannot attempt the destruction of the enrolled militia of missouri i may add that the force being under the national military control it is also within the proclamation in regard to the habeas corpus  i concur in the propriety of your request in regard to elections and have as you see directed general schofield accordingly i do not feel justified to enter upon the broad field you present in regard to the political differences between radicals and conservatives from time to time i have done and said what appeared to me proper to do and say the public knows it all it obliges nobody to follow me and i trust it obliges me to follow nobody the radicals and conservatives each agree with me in some things and disagree in others i could wish both to agree with me in all things for then they would agree with each other and would be too strong for any foe from any quarter they however choose to do otherwise and i do not question their right i too shall do what seems to be my duty i hold whoever commands in missouri or elsewhere responsible to me and not to either radicals or conservatives it is my duty to hear all but at last i must within my sphere judge what to do and what to forbear  your obedient

the examination thereof aided by the report thereon of the judgeadvocategeneral and on full hearing of counsel for the accused being specified that no proper question remained open except as to the sanity of the accused i caused a very full examination to be made on that question upon a great amount of evidence including all effort by the counsel for accused by an expert of high reputation in

sanborn that he has not been insane since and is not insane now oct 7 1863 i therefore approve the finding and sentence of the military commission and direct that the majorgeneral in command of the

majorgeneral foster port monroe va  it would be useless for mrs dr wright to come here the subject is a very painful one but the case is settled   a lincoln     telegram to w b thomas  executive mansion washington dc october 17 1863  hon william b thomas philadelphia pa  i am grateful for your offer of 100000 men but as at present advised i do not consider that washington is in danger or that there is any emergency requiring 60 or 90 days men   a lincoln     telegram to j williams and n g taylor  war department october 17 1863  john williams and n g taylor knoxville tenn  you do not estimate the holding of east tennessee more highly than i do there is no absolute purpose of withdrawing our forces from it and only a contingent one to withdraw them temporarily for the purpose of not losing the position permanently i am in great hope of not finding it necessary to withdraw them at all particularly if you raise new troops rapidly for us there   a lincoln     telegram to t c durant  executive mansion washington city october 18 1863  t c durant new york  as i do with others so i will try to see you when you come   a lincoln     telegram to general w s rosecrans  war department october 19 18639 am  majorgeneral rosecrans chattanooga tenn  there has been no battle recently at bull run i suppose what you have heard a rumor of was not a general battle but an affair at bristow station on the railroad a few miles beyond manassas junction toward the rappahannock on wednesday the 14th it began by an attack of the enemy upon general warren and ended in the enemy being repulsed with a loss of four cannon and from four to seven hundred prisoners   a lincoln     telegram to general r c schenck  executive mansion washington october 21 1863245  majorgeneral schenck baltimore md  a delegation is here saying that our armed colored troops are at many if not all the landings on the patuxent river and by their presence with arms in their hands are frightening quiet people and producing great confusion have they been sent there by any order and if so for what reason   a lincoln     telegram to general r c schenck  executive mansion washington october 22 1863130 pm  majorgeneral schenck baltimore md  please come over here the fact of one of our officers being killed on the patuxent is a specimen of what i would avoid it seems to me we could send white men to recruit better than to send negroes and thus inaugurate homicides on punctilio  please come over   a lincoln     to general h w halleck  executive mansion washington october 24 1863  majorgeneral halleck  taking all our information together i think it probable that ewells corps has started for east tennessee by way of abingdon marching last monday say from meades front directly to the railroad at charlottesville  first the object of lees recent movement against meade his destruction of the alexandria and orange railroad and subsequent withdrawal without more motive not otherwise apparent would be explained by this hypothesis  secondly the direct statement of sharpes men that ewell has gone to tennessee  thirdly the irishmans northern spy in richmond statement that he has not gone through richmond and his further statement of an appeal made to the people at richmond to go and protect their salt which could only refer to the works near abingdon  fourthly grahams statement from martinsburg that imboden is in retreat for harrisonburg this last matches with the idea that lee has retained his cavalry sending imboden and perhaps other scraps to join ewell upon this probability what is to be done  if you have a plan matured i have nothing to say if you have not then i suggest that with all possible expedition the army of the potomac get ready to attack lee and that in the meantime a raid shall at all hazards break the railroad at or near lynchburg  yours truly   a lincoln     to e b washburne  private and confidential  executive mansion washington
