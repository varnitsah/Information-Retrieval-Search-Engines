of louis xv   chapter 11i  louis the wellbeloved  president henault remarking on royal surnames of honour how difficult it often is to ascertain not only why but even when they were conferred takes occasion in his sleek official way to make a philosophical reflection the surname of bienaime wellbeloved says he which louis xv bears will not leave posterity in the same doubt this prince in the year 1744 while hastening from one end of his kingdom to the other and suspending his conquests in flanders that he might fly to the assistance of alsace was arrested at metz by a malady which threatened to cut short his days at the news of this paris all in terror seemed a city taken by storm the churches resounded with supplications and groans the prayers of priests and people were every moment interrupted by their sobs and it was from an interest so dear and tender that this surname of bienaime fashioned itself a title higher still than all the rest which this great prince has earned abrege chronologique de lhistoire de france paris 1775 p 701  so stands it written in lasting memorial of that year 1744 thirty other years have come and gone and this great prince again lies sick but in how altered circumstances now churches resound not with excessive groanings paris is stoically calm sobs interrupt no prayers for indeed none are offered except priests litanies read or chanted at fixed moneyrate per hour which are not liable to interruption the shepherd of the people has been carried home from little trianon heavy of heart and been put to bed in his own chateau of versailles the flock knows it and heeds it not at most in the immeasurable tide of french speech which ceases not day after day and only ebbs towards the short hours of night may this of the royal sickness emerge from time to time as an article of news bets are doubtless depending nay some people express themselves loudly in the streets memoires de m le baron besenval paris 1805 ii 5990 but for the rest on green field and steepled city the may sun shines out the may evening fades and men ply their useful or useless business as if no louis lay in danger  dame dubarry indeed might pray if she had a talent for it duke daiguillon too maupeou and the parlement maupeou these as they sit in their high places with france harnessed under their feet know well on what basis they continue there look to it daiguillon sharply as thou didst from the mill of st cast on quiberon and the invading english thou covered if not with glory yet with meal fortune was ever accounted inconstant and each dog has but his day  forlorn enough languished duke daiguillon some years ago covered as we said with meal nay with worse for la chalotais the breton parlementeer accused him not only of poltroonery and tyranny but even of concussion official plunder of money which accusations it was easier to get quashed by backstairs influences than to get answered neither could the thoughts or even the tongues of men be tied thus under disastrous eclipse had this grandnephew of the great richelieu to glide about unworshipped by the world resolute choiseul the abrupt proud man disdaining him or even forgetting him little prospect but to glide into gascony to rebuild chateaus there arthur young travels during the years 17878889 bury st edmunds 1792 i 44 and die inglorious killing game however in the year 1770 a certain young soldier dumouriez by name returning from corsica could see with sorrow at compiegne the old king of france on foot with doffed hat in sight of his army at the side of a magnificent phaeton doing homage thedubarry la vie et les memoires du general dumouriez paris 1822 i 141  much lay therein thereby for one thing could daiguillon postpone the rebuilding of his chateau and rebuild his fortunes first for stout choiseul would discern in the dubarry nothing but a wonderfully dizened scarletwoman and go on his way as if she were not intolerable the source of sighs tears of pettings and pouting which would not end till france la france as she named her royal valet finally mustered heart to see choiseul and with that quivering in the chin tremblement du menton natural in such cases besenval memoires ii 21 faltered out a dismissal dismissal of his last substantial man but pacification of his scarletwoman thus daiguillon rose again and culminated and with him there rose maupeou the banisher of parlements who plants you a refractory president at croe in combrailles on the top of steep rocks inaccessible except by litters there to consider himself likewise there rose abbe terray dissolute financier paying eightpence in the shillingso that wits exclaim in some press at the playhouse where is abbe terray that he might reduce us to twothirds and so have these individuals verily by blackart built them a domdaniel or enchanted dubarrydom call it an armidapalace where they dwell pleasantly chancellor maupeou playing blindmansbuff with the scarlet enchantress or gallantly presenting her with dwarf negroesand a most christian king has unspeakable peace within doors whatever he may have without my chancellor is a scoundrel but i cannot do without him dulaure histoire de paris paris 1824 vii 328  beautiful armidapalace where the inmates live enchanted lives lapped in soft music of adulation waited on by the splendours of the worldwhich nevertheless hangs wondrously as by a single hair should the most christian king die or even get seriously afraid of dying for alas had not the fair haughty chateauroux to fly with wet cheeks and flaming heart from that feverscene at metz driven forth by sour shavelings she hardly returned when fever and shavelings were both swept into the background pompadour too when damiens wounded royalty slightly under the fifth rib and our drive to trianon went off futile in shrieks and madly shaken torcheshad to pack and be in readiness yet did not go the wound not proving poisoned for his majesty has religious faith believes at least in a devil and now a third peril and who knows what may be in it for the doctors look grave ask privily if his majesty had not the smallpox long agoand doubt it may have been a false kind yes maupeou pucker those sinister brows of thine and peer out on it with thy malign rateyes it is a questionable case sure only that man is mortal that with the life of one mortal snaps irrevocably the wonderfulest talisman and all dubarrydom rushes off with tumult into infinite space and ye as subterranean apparitions are wont vanish utterlyleaving only a smell of sulphur  these and what holds of these may prayto beelzebub or whoever will hear them but from the rest of france there comes as was said no prayer or one of an opposite character expressed openly in the streets chateau or hotel were an enlightened philosophism scrutinises many things is not given to prayer neither are rossbach victories terray finances nor say only sixty thousand lettres de cachet which is maupeous share persuasives towards that o henault prayers from a france smitten by blackart with plague after plague and lying now in shame and pain with a harlots foot on its neck what prayer can come those lank scarecrows that prowl hungerstricken through all highways and byways of french existence will they pray the dull millions that in the workshop or furrowfield grind foredone at the wheel of labour like haltered ginhorses if blind so much the quieter or they that in the bicetre hospital eight to a bed lie waiting their manumission dim are those heads of theirs dull stagnant those hearts to them the great sovereign is known mainly as the great regrater of bread if they hear of his sickness they will answer with a dull tant pis pour lui or with the question will he die  yes will he die that is now for all france the grand question and hope whereby alone the kings sickness has still some interest    chapter 11ii  realised ideals  such a changed france have we and a changed louis changed truly and further than thou yet seestto the eye of history many things in that sickroom of louis are now visible which to the courtiers there present were invisible for indeed it is well said in every object there is inexhaustible meaning the eye sees in it what the eye brings means of seeing to newton and to newtons dog diamond what a different pair of universes while the painting on the optical retina of both was most likely the same let the reader here in this sickroom of louis endeavour to look with the mind too  time was when men could so to speak of a given man by nourishing and decorating him with fit appliances to the due pitch make themselves a king almost as the bees do and what was still more to the purpose loyally obey him when made the man so nourished and decorated thenceforth named royal does verily bear rule and is said and even thought to be for example prosecuting conquests in flanders when he lets himself like luggage be carried thither and no light luggage covering miles of road for he has his unblushing chateauroux with her bandboxes and rougepots at his side so that at every new station a wooden gallery must be run up between their lodgings he has not only his maisonbouche and valetaille without end but his very troop of players with their pasteboard coulisses thunderbarrels their kettles fiddles stagewardrobes portable larders and chaffering and quarrelling enough all mounted in wagons tumbrils secondhand chaisessufficient not to conquer flanders but the patience of the world with such a flood of loud jingling appurtenances does he lumber along prosecuting his conquests in flanders wonderful to behold so nevertheless it was and had been to some solitary thinker it might seem strange but even to him inevitable not unnatural  for ours is a most fictile world and man is the most fingent plastic of creatures a world not fixable not fathomable an unfathomable somewhat which is not we which we can work with and live amidstand model miraculously in our miraculous being and name worldbut if the very rocks and rivers as metaphysic teaches are in strict language made by those outward senses of ours how much more by the inward sense are all phenomena of the spiritual kind dignities authorities holies unholies which inward sense moreover is not permanent like the outward ones but forever growing and changing does not the black african take of sticks and old clothes say exported monmouthstreet castclothes what will suffice and of these cunningly combining them fabricate for himself an eidolon idol or thing seen and name it mumbojumbo which he can thenceforth pray to with upturned awestruck eye not without hope the white european mocks but ought rather to consider and see whether he at home could not do the like a little more wisely  so it was we say in those conquests of flanders thirty years ago but so it no longer is alas much more lies sick than poor louis not the french king only but the french kingship this too after long rough tear and wear is breaking down the world is all so changed so much that seemed vigorous has sunk decrepit so much that was not is beginning to beborne over the atlantic to the closing

possessions and attainments unspeakably the noblest are his symbols divine or divineseeming under which he marches and fights with victorious assurance in this lifebattle what we can call his realised ideals of which realised ideals omitting the rest consider only these two his church or spiritual guidance his kingship or temporal one the church what a word was there richer than golconda and the treasures of the world in the heart of the remotest mountains rises the little kirk the dead all slumbering round it under their white memorialstones in hope of a happy resurrectiondull wert thou o reader if never in any hour say of moaning midnight when such kirk hung spectral in the sky and being was as if swallowed up of darkness it spoke to theethings unspeakable that went into thy souls soul strong was he that had a church what we can call a church he stood thereby though in the centre of immensities in the conflux of eternities yet manlike towards god and man the vague shoreless universe had become for him a firm city and dwelling which he knew such virtue was in belief in these words well spoken i believe well might men prize their credo and raise stateliest temples for it and reverend hierarchies and give it the tithe of their substance it was worth living for and dying for  neither was that an inconsiderable moment when wild armed men first raised their strongest aloft on the bucklerthrone and with clanging armour and hearts said solemnly be thou our acknowledged strongest in such acknowledged strongest well named king konning canning or man that was able what a symbol shone now for themsignificant with the destinies of the world a symbol of true guidance in return for loving obedience properly if he knew it the prime want of man a symbol which might be called sacred for is there not in reverence for what is better than we an indestructible sacredness on which ground too it was well said there lay in the acknowledged strongest a divine right as surely there might in the strongest whether acknowledged or notconsidering who made him strong and so in the midst of confusions and unutterable incongruities as all growth is confused did this of royalty with loyalty environing it spring up and grow mysteriously subduing and assimilating for a principle of life was in it till it also had grown worldgreat and was among the main facts of our modern existence such a fact that louis xiv for example could answer the expostulatory magistrate with his letat cest moi the state i am the state and be replied to by silence and abashed looks so far had accident and forethought had your louis elevenths with the leaden virgin in their hatband and torturewheels and conical oubliettes maneating under their feet your henri fourths with their prophesied social millennium when every peasant should have his fowl in the pot and on the whole the fertility of this most fertile existence named of good and evilbrought it in the matter of the kingship wondrous concerning which may we not again say that in the huge mass of evil as it rolls and swells there is ever some good working imprisoned working towards deliverance and triumph  how such ideals do realise themselves and grow wondrously from amid the incongruous everfluctuating chaos of the actual this is what worldhistory if it teach any thing has to teach us how they grow and after long stormy growth bloom out mature supreme then quickly for the blossom is brief fall into decay sorrowfully dwindle and crumble down or rush down noisily or noiselessly disappearing the blossom is so brief as of some centennial cactusflower which after a century of waiting shines out for hours thus from the day when rough clovis in the champ de mars in sight of his whole army had to cleave retributively the head of that rough frank with sudden battleaxe and the fierce words it was thus thou clavest the vase st remis and mine at soissons forward to louis the grand and his letat cest moi we count some twelve hundred years and now this the very next louis is dying and so much dying with himnay thus too if catholicism with and against feudalism but not against nature and her bounty gave us english a shakspeare and era of shakspeare and so produced a blossom of catholicismit was not till catholicism itself so far as law could abolish it had been abolished here  but of those decadent ages in which no ideal either grows or blossoms when belief and loyalty have passed away and only the cant and false echo of them remains and all solemnity has become pageantry and the creed of persons in authority has become one of two things an imbecility or a macchiavelism alas of these ages worldhistory can take no notice they have to become compressed more and more and finally suppressed in the annals of mankind blotted out as spuriouswhich indeed they are hapless ages wherein if ever in any it is an unhappiness to be born to be born and to learn only by every tradition and example that gods universe is belials and a lie and the supreme quack the hierarch of men in which mournfulest faith nevertheless do we not see whole generations two and sometimes even three successively live what they call living and vanishwithout chance of reappearance  in such a decadent age or one fast verging that way had our poor louis been born grant also that if the french kingship had not by course of nature long to live he of all men was the man to accelerate nature the blossom of french royalty cactuslike has accordingly made an astonishing progress in those metz days it was still standing with all its petals though bedimmed by orleans regents and roue ministers and cardinals but now in 1774 we behold it bald and the virtue nigh gone out of it  disastrous indeed does it look with those same realised ideals one and all the church which in its palmy season seven hundred years ago could make an emperor wait barefoot in penanceshift three days in the snow has for centuries seen itself decaying reduced even to forget old purposes and enmities and join interest with the kingship on this younger strength it would fain stay its decrepitude and these two will henceforth stand and fall together alas the sorbonne still sits there in its old mansion but mumbles only jargon of dotage and no longer leads the consciences of men not the sorbonne it is encyclopedies philosophie and who knows what nameless innumerable multitude of ready writers profane singers romancers players disputators and pamphleteers that now form the spiritual guidance of the world the worlds practical guidance too is lost or has glided into the same miscellaneous hands who is it that the king ableman named also roi rex or director now guides his own huntsmen and prickers

extorting ransoms for them the mothers fill the public places with cries of despair crowds gather get excited so many women in destraction run about exaggerating the alarm an absurd and horrid fable

from amid the wrecks and dust of this universal decay new powers are fashioning themselves adapted to the new time and its destinies besides the old noblesse originally of fighters there is a new recognised noblesse of lawyers whose galaday and proud battleday even now is an unrecognised noblesse of commerce powerful enough with money in its pocket lastly powerfulest of all least recognised of all a noblesse of literature without steel on their thigh without gold in their purse but with the grand thaumaturgic faculty of thought in their head french philosophism has arisen in which little word how much do we include here indeed lies properly the cardinal symptom of the whole widespread malady faith is gone out scepticism is come in evil abounds and accumulates no man has faith to withstand it to amend it to begin by amending himself it must even go on accumulating while hollow langour and vacuity is the lot of the upper and want and stagnation of the lower and universal misery is very certain what other thing is certain that a lie cannot be believed philosophism knows only this her other belief is mainly that in spiritual supersensual matters no belief is possible unhappy nay as yet the contradiction of a lie is some kind of belief but the lie with its contradiction once swept away what will remain the five unsatiated senses will remain the sixth insatiable sense of vanity the whole daemonic nature of man will remainhurled forth to rage blindly without rule or rein savage itself yet with all the tools and weapons of civilisation a spectacle new in history  in such a france as in a powdertower where fire unquenched and now unquenchable is smoking and smouldering all round has louis xv lain down to die with pompadourism and dubarryism his fleurdelis has been shamefully struck down in all lands and on all seas poverty invades even the royal exchequer and taxfarming can squeeze out no more there is a quarrel of twentyfive years standing with the parlement everywhere want dishonesty unbelief and hotbrained sciolists for statephysicians it is a portentous hour  such things can the eye of history see in this sickroom of king louis which were invisible to the courtiers there it is twenty years gone christmasday since lord chesterfield summing up what he had noted of this same france wrote and sent off by post the following words that have become memorable in short all the symptoms which i have ever met with in history previous to great changes and revolutions in government now exist and daily increase in france chesterfields letters december 25th 1753    chapter 11iii  viaticum  for the present however the grand question with the governors of france is shall extreme unction or other ghostly viaticum to louis not to france be administered  it is a deep question for if administered if so much as spoken of must not on the very threshold of the business witch dubarry vanish hardly to return should louis even recover with her vanishes duke daiguillon and company and all their armidapalace as was said chaos swallows the whole again and there is left nothing but a smell of brimstone but then on the other hand what will the dauphinists and choiseulists say nay what may the royal martyr himself say should he happen to get deadly worse without getting delirious for the present he still kisses the dubarry hand so we from the anteroom can note but afterwards doctors bulletins may run as they are ordered but it is confluent smallpoxof which as is whispered too the gatekeeperss once so buxom daughter lies ill and louis xv is not a man to be trifled with in his viaticum was he not wont to catechise his very girls in the parcauxcerfs and pray with and for them that they might preserve theirorthodoxy dulaure viii 217 besenval c a strange fact not an unexampled one for there is no animal so strange as man  for the moment indeed it were all well could archbishop beaumont but be prevailed uponto wink with one eye alas beaumont would

could bring it to mind it is the resource of the ostrich who hard hunted sticks his foolish head in the ground and would fain forget that his foolish unseeing body is not unseen too or sometimes with a spasmodic antagonism significant of the same thing and of more he would go or stopping his court carriages would send into churchyards and ask how many new graves there were today though it gave his poor pompadour the disagreeablest qualms we can figure the thought of louis that day when all royally caparisoned for hunting he met at some sudden turning in the wood of senart a ragged peasant with a coffin for whomit was for a poor brother slave whom majesty had sometimes noticed slaving in those quarters what did he die ofof hungerthe king gave his steed the spur campan iii 39  but figure his thought when death is now clutching at his own heartstrings unlooked for inexorable yes poor louis death has found thee no palace walls or lifeguards gorgeous tapestries or gilt buckram of stiffest ceremonial could keep him out but he is here here at thy very lifebreath and will extinguish it thou whose whole existence hitherto was a chimera and scenic show at length becomest a reality sumptuous versailles bursts asunder like a dream into void immensity time is done and all the scaffolding of time falls wrecked with hideous clangour round thy soul the pale kingdoms yawn open there must thou

it is not thy works which are all mortal infinitely little and the greatest no greater than the least but only the spirit thou workest in that can have worth or continuance  but reflect in any case what a lifeproblem this of poor louis when he rose as bienaime from that metz sickbed really was what son of adam could have swayed such incoherences into coherence could he blindest fortune alone has cast him on the top of it he swims there can as little sway it as the driftlog sways the windtossed moonstirred atlantic what have i done to be so loved he said then he may say now what have i done to

other clear wisdom there was none for him as it was he stood gazing dubiously the absurdest mortal extant a very solecism incarnate into the absurdest confused worldwherein at lost nothing seemed so certain as that he the incarnate solecism had five senses that were flying tables tables volantes which vanish through the floor to come back reloaded and a parcauxcerfs  whereby at least we have again this historical curiosity a human being in an original position swimming passively as on some boundless mother of dead dogs towards issues which he partly saw for louis had withal a kind of insight in him so when a new minister of marine or what else it might be came announcing his new era the scarletwoman would hear from the lips of majesty at supper he laid out his ware like another

creation for a time say wretcheder his lifesolecism was seen and felt of a whole scandalised world him endless oblivion cannot engulf and swallow to endless depthsnot yet for a generation or two  however be this as it will we remark not without interest that on the evening of the 4th dame dubarry issues from the sickroom with perceptible trouble in her visage it is the fourth evening of may year of grace 1774 such a whispering in the oeildeboeuf is he dying then what can be said is that dubarry seems making up her packages she sails weeping through her gilt boudoirs as if taking leave daiguilon and company are near their last card nevertheless they will not yet throw up the game but as for the sacramental controversy it is as good as settled without being mentioned louis can send for his abbe moudon in the course of next night be confessed by him some say for the space of seventeen minutes and demand the sacraments of his own accord  nay already in the afternoon behold is not

has lit on this occasion and blown out at the moment of death what candles might be lit or blown out in so large an establishment as that of versailles no man at such distance would like to affirm at the same time as it was two oclock in a may afternoon and these royal stables must have been some five or six hundred yards from the royal sickroom the candle does threaten to go out in spite of us it remains burning indeedin her fantasy throwing light on much in those memoires of hers and hark across the oeildeboeuf what sound is that sound terrible and absolutely like thunder it is the rush of the whole court rushing as in wager to salute the new sovereigns hail to your majesties the dauphin and dauphiness are king and queen overpowered with many emotions they two fall on their knees together and with streaming tears exclaim o god guide us protect us we are too young to reigntoo young indeed  thus in any case with a sound absolutely like thunder has the horologe of time struck and an old era passed away the louis that was lies forsaken a mass of abhorred clay abandoned to some poor persons and priests of the chapelle ardentewho make haste to put him in two lead coffins pouring in abundant spirits of wine the new louis with his court is rolling towards choisy through the summer afternoon the royal tears still flow but a word mispronounced by monseigneur dartois sets them all laughing and they weep no more light mortals how ye walk your light lifeminuet over bottomless abysses divided from you by a film  for the rest the proper authorities felt that no funeral could be too unceremonious besenval himself thinks it was unceremonious enough two carriages containing two noblemen of the usher species and a versailles clerical person some score of mounted pages some fifty palfreniers these with torches but not so much as in black start from versailles on the second evening with their leaden bier at a high trot they start and keep up that pace for the jibes brocards of

carrying to the uttermost length that aphorism of montesquieus happy the people whose annals are tiresome has said happy the people whose annals are vacant in which saying mad as it looks may there not still be found some grain of reason for truly as it has been written silence is divine and of heaven so in all earthly things too there is a silence which is better than any speech consider it well the event the thing which can be spoken of and recorded is it not in all cases some disruption some solution of continuity were it even a glad event it involves change involves loss of active force and so far either in the past or in the present is an irregularity a disease stillest perseverance were our blessedness not dislocation and alterationcould they be avoided  the oak grows silently in the forest a thousand years only in the thousandth year when the woodman arrives with his axe is there heard an echoing through the solitudes and the oak announces itself when with a farsounding crash it falls how silent too was the planting of the acorn scattered from the lap of some wandering wind nay when our oak flowered or put on its leaves its glad events what shout of proclamation could there be hardly from the most observant a word of recognition these things befell not they were slowly done not in an hour but through the flight of days what was to be said of it this hour seemed altogether as the last was as the next would be  it is thus everywhere that foolish rumour babbles not of what was done but of what was misdone or undone and foolish history ever more or less the written epitomised synopsis of rumour knows so little that were not as well unknown attila invasions walterthepenniless crusades sicilian vespers thirtyyears wars mere sin and misery not work but hindrance of work for the earth all this while was yearly green and yellow with her kind harvests the hand of the craftsman the mind of the thinker rested not and so after all and in spite of all we have this so glorious highdomed blossoming world concerning which poor history may well ask with wonder whence it came she knows so little of it knows so much of what obstructed it what would have rendered it impossible such nevertheless by necessity or foolish choice is her rule and practice whereby that paradox happy the people whose annals are vacant is not without its true side  and yet what seems more pertinent to note here there is a stillness not of unobstructed growth but of passive inertness and symptom of imminent downfall as victory is silent so is defeat of the opposing forces the weaker has resigned itself the stronger marches on noiseless now but rapid inevitable the fall and overturn will not be noiseless how all grows and has its period even as the herbs of the fields be it annual centennial millennial all grows and dies each by its own wondrous laws in wondrous fashion of its own spiritual things most wondrously of all inscrutable to the wisest are these latter not to be prophesied of or understood if when the oak stands proudliest flourishing to the eye you know that its heart is sound it is not so with the man how much less with the society with the nation of men of such it may be affirmed even that the superficial aspect that the inward feeling of full health is generally ominous for indeed it is of apoplexy so to speak and a plethoric lazy habit of body that churches kingships social institutions oftenest die sad when such institution plethorically says to itself take thy ease thou hast goods laid uplike the fool of the gospel to whom

product of still fouler corruption thou with the corruption art doomed  meanwhile it is singular how long the rotten will hold together provided you do not handle it roughly for whole generations it continues standing with a ghastly affectation of life after all life and truth has fled out of it so loth are men to quit their old ways and conquering indolence and inertia venture on new great truly is the actual is the thing that has rescued itself from bottomless deeps of theory and possibility and stands there as a definite indisputable fact whereby men do work and live or once did so widely shall men cleave to that while it will endure and quit it with regret when it gives way under them rash enthusiast of change beware hast thou well considered all that habit does in this life of ours how all knowledge and all practice hang wondrous over infinite abysses of the unknown impracticable and our whole being is an infinite abyss overarched by habit as by a thin earthrind laboriously built together  but if every man as it has been written holds confined within him a madman what must every society dosociety which in its commonest state is called the standing miracle of this world without such earthrind of habit continues our author call it system of habits in a word fixed ways of acting and of believingsociety would not exist at all with such it exists better or worse herein too in this its system of habits acquired retained how you will lies the true lawcode and constitution of a society the only code though an unwritten one which it can in nowise disobey the thing we call written code constitution form of government and the like what is it but some miniature image and solemnly expressed summary of this unwritten code isor rather alas is not but only should be and always tends to be in which latter discrepancy lies struggle without end and now we add in the same dialect let but by ill chance in such everenduring struggleyour thin earthrind be once broken the fountains of the great deep boil forth firefountains enveloping engulfing your earthrind is shattered swallowed up instead of a green flowery world there is a waste wildweltering chaoswhich has again with tumult and struggle to make itself into a world  on the other hand be this conceded where thou findest a lie that is oppressing thee extinguish it lies exist there only to be extinguished they wait and cry earnestly for extinction think well meanwhile in what spirit thou wilt do it not with hatred with headlong selfish violence but in clearness of heart with holy zeal gently almost with pity thou wouldst not replace such extinct lie by a new lie which a new injustice of thy own were the parent of still other lies whereby the latter end of that business were worse than the beginning  so however in this world of ours which has both an indestructible hope in the future and an indestructible tendency to persevere as in the past must innovation and conservation wage their perpetual conflict as they may and can wherein the daemonic element that lurks in all human things may doubtless some once in the thousand yearsget vent but indeed may we not regret that such conflictwhich after all is but like that classical one of hatefilled amazons with heroic youths and will end in embracesshould usually be so spasmodic for conservation strengthened by that mightiest quality in us our indolence sits for long ages not victorious only which she should be but tyrannical incommunicative she holds her adversary as if annihilated such adversary lying all the while like some buried enceladus who to gain the smallest freedom must stir a whole trinacria with it aetnas  wherefore on the whole we will honour a paper age too an era of hope for in this same frightful process of enceladus revolt when the task on which no mortal would willingly enter has become imperative inevitableis it not even a kindness of nature that she lures us forward by cheerful promises fallacious or not and a whole generation plunges into the erebus blackness lighted on by an era of hope it has been well said man is based on hope he has properly no other possession but hope this habitation of his is named the place of hope    chapter 12iv  maurepas  but now among french hopes is not that of old m de maurepas one of the bestgrounded who hopes that he by dexterity shall contrive to continue minister nimble old man who for all emergencies has his light jest and ever in the worst confusion will emerge corklike unsunk small care to him is perfectibility progress of the species and astraea

diminutive of scoundrel in courtier dialect he is now named the nestor of france such governing nestor as france has  at bottom nevertheless it might puzzle one to say where the government of france in these days specially is in that chateau of versailles we have nestor king queen ministers and clerks with paperbundles tied in tape but the government for government is a thing that governs that guides and if need be compels visible in france there is not such a thing invisible inorganic on the other hand there is in philosophe saloons in oeildeboeuf galleries in the tongue of the babbler in the pen of the pamphleteer her majesty appearing at the opera is applauded she returns all radiant with joy anon the applauses wax fainter or threaten to cease she is heavy of heart the light of her face has fled is sovereignty some poor montgolfier which blown into by the popular wind grows great and mounts or sinks flaccid if the wind be withdrawn france was long a despotism tempered by epigrams and now it would seem the epigrams have get the upper hand  happy were a young louis the desired to make france happy if it did not prove too troublesome and he only knew the way but there is endless discrepancy round him so many claims and clamours a mere confusion of tongues not reconcilable by man not manageable suppressible save by some strongest and wisest menwhich only a lightlyjesting lightlygyrating m de maurepas can so much as subsist amidst philosophism claims her new era meaning thereby innumerable things and claims it in no faint voice for france at large hitherto mute is now beginning to speak also and speaks in that same sense a huge manytoned sound distant yet not unimpressive on the other hand the oeildeboeuf which as nearest one can hear best claims with shrill vehemence that the monarchy be as heretofore a horn of plenty wherefrom loyal courtiers may drawto the just support of the throne let liberalism and a new era if such is the wish be introduced only no curtailment of the royal moneys which latter condition alas is precisely the impossible one  philosophism as we saw has got her turgot made controllergeneral and there shall be endless reformation unhappily this turgot could continue only twenty months with a miraculous fortunatus purse in his treasury it might have lasted longer with such purse indeed every french controllergeneral that would prosper in these days ought first to provide himself but here again may we not remark the bounty of nature in regard to hope man after man advances confident to the augean stable as if he could clean it expends his little fraction of an ability on it with such cheerfulness does in so far as he was honest accomplish something turgot has faculties honesty insight heroic volition but the fortunatus purse he has not sanguine controllergeneral a whole pacific french revolution may stand schemed in the head of the thinker but who shall pay the unspeakable indemnities that will be needed alas far from that on the very threshold of the business he proposes that the clergy the noblesse the very parlements be subjected to taxes one shriek of indignation and astonishment reverberates through all the chateau galleries m de maurepas has to gyrate the poor king who had written few weeks ago il ny a que vous et moi qui aimions le peuple there is none but you and i that has the peoples interest at heart must write now a dismissal in may 1776 and let the french revolution accomplish itself pacifically or not as it can  hope then is deferred deferred not destroyed or abated is not this for example our patriarch voltaire after long years of absence revisiting paris with face shrivelled to nothing with huge peruke a la louis quatorze which leaves only two eyes visible glittering like carbuncles the old man is here february 1778 what an outburst sneering paris has suddenly grown reverent devotional with heroworship nobles have disguised themselves

theatre with immortal vivats finally stifle him under rosesfor old richelieu recommended opium in such state of the nerves and the excessive patriarch took too much her majesty herself had some thought of sending for him but was dissuaded let majesty consider it nevertheless the purport of this mans existence has been to wither up and annihilate all whereon majesty and worship for the present rests and is it so that the world recognises him with apotheosis as its prophet and speaker who has spoken wisely the thing it longed to say add only that the body of this same rosestifled beatifiedpatriarch cannot get buried except by stealth it is wholly a notable business and france without doubt is big what the germans call of good hope we shall wish her a happy birthhour and

the symptoms i have ever met with in history  shall we say then wo to philosophism that it destroyed religion what it called extinguishing the abomination ecraser linfame wo rather to those that made the holy an abomination and extinguishable wo at all men that live in such a time of worldabomination and worlddestruction nay answer the courtiers it was turgot it was necker with their mad innovating it was the queens want of etiquette it was he it was she it was that friends it was every scoundrel that had lived and quacklike pretended to be doing and been only eating and misdoing in all provinces of life as shoeblack or as sovereign lord each in his degree from the time of charlemagne and earlier all this for be sure no falsehood perishes but is as seed sown out to grow has been storing itself for thousands of years and now the accountday has come and rude will the settlement be of wrath laid up against the day of wrath o my brother be not thou a quack die rather if thou wilt take counsel tis but dying once and thou art quit of it for ever cursed is that trade and bears curses thou knowest not how long ages after thou art departed and the wages thou hadst are all consumed nay as the ancient wise have writtenthrough eternity itself and is verily marked in the doombook of a god  hope deferred maketh the heart sick and yet as we said hope is but deferred not abolished not abolishable it is very notable and touching how this same hope does still light onwards the french nation through all its wild destinies for we shall still find hope shining be it for fond invitation be it for anger and menace as a mild heavenly light it shone as a red conflagration it shines burning sulphurous blue through darkest regions of terror it still shines and goes sent out at all since desperation itself is a kind of hope thus is our era still to be named of hope though in the saddest sensewhen there is nothing left but hope  but if any one would know summarily what a pandoras box lies there for the opening he may see it in what by its nature is the symptom of all symptoms the surviving literature of the period abbe raynal with his lubricity and loud loose rant has spoken his word and already the fasthastening generation responds to another glance at beaumarchais mariage de figaro which now in 1784 after difficulty enough has issued on the stage and runs its hundred nights to the admiration of all men by what virtue or internal vigour it so ran the reader of our day will rather wonderand indeed will know so much the better that it flattered some pruriency of the time that it spoke what all were feeling and longing to speak small substance in that figaro thin wiredrawn intrigues thin wiredrawn sentiments and sarcasms a thing lean barren yet which winds and whisks itself as through a wholly mad universe adroitly with a highsniffing air wherein each as was hinted which is the grand secret may see some image of himself and of his own state and ways so it runs its hundred nights and all france runs with it laughing applause if the soliloquising barber ask what has your lordship done to earn all this and can only answer you took the trouble to be born vous vous etes donne la peine de naitre all men must laugh and a gay horseracing anglomaniac noblesse loudest of all for how can small books have a great danger in them asks the sieur caron and fancies his thin epigram may be a kind of reason conqueror of a golden fleece by giant smuggling tamer of helldogs in the parlement maupeou and finally crowned orpheus in the theatre francais beaumarchais has now culminated and unites the attributes of several demigods we shall meet him once again in the course of his decline  still more significant are two books produced on the eve of the evermemorable explosion itself and read eagerly by all the world saintpierres paul et virginie and louvets chevalier de faublas noteworthy books which may be considered as the last speech of old feudal france in the first there rises melodiously as it were the wail of a moribund world everywhere wholesome nature in unequal conflict with diseased perfidious art cannot escape from it in the lowest hut in the remotest island of the sea ruin and death must strike down the loved one and what is most significant of all death even here not by necessity but by etiquette what a world of prurient corruption lies visible in that supersublime of modesty yet on the whole our good saintpierre is musical poetical though most morbid we will call his book the swansong of old dying france  louvets again let no man account musical truly if this wretched faublas is a deathspeech it is one under the gallows and by a felon that does not repent wretched cloaca of a book without depth even as a cloaca what picture of french society is here picture properly of nothing if not of the mind that gave it out as some sort of picture yet symptom of much above all of the world that could nourish itself thereon    book 1iii  the parlement of paris   chapter 13i  dishonoured bills  while the unspeakable confusion is everywhere weltering within and through so many cracks in the surface sulphursmoke is issuing the question arises through what crevice will the main explosion carry itself through which of the old craters or chimneys or must it at once form a new crater for itself in every society are such chimneys are institutions serving as such even constantinople is not without its safetyvalves there too discontent can vent itselfin material fire by the number of nocturnal conflagrations or of hanged bakers the reigning power can read the signs of the times and change course according to these  we may say that this french explosion will doubtless first try all the old institutions of escape for by each of these there is or at least there used to be some communication with the interior deep they are national institutions in virtue of that had they even become personal institutions and what we can call choked up from their original uses there nevertheless must the impediment be weaker than elsewhere through which of them then an observer might have guessed through the law parlements above all through the parlement of paris   men though never so thickly clad in dignities sit not inaccessible to the influences of their time especially men whose life is business who at all turns were it even from behind judgmentseats have come in contact with the actual workings of the world the counsellor of parlement the president himself who has bought his place with hard money that he might be looked up to by his fellowcreatures how shall he in all philosophesoirees and saloons of elegant culture become notable as a friend of darkness among the paris longrobes there may be more than one patriotic malesherbes whose rule is conscience and the public good there are clearly more than one hotheaded despremenil to whose confused thought any loud reputation of the brutus sort may seem glorious the lepelletiers lamoignons have titles and wealth yet at court are only styled noblesse of the robe there are duports of deep scheme freteaus sabatiers of incontinent tongue all nursed more or less on the milk of the contrat social nay for the whole body is not this patriotic opposition also a fighting for oneself awake parlement of paris renew thy long warfare was not the parlement maupeou abolished with ignominy not now hast thou to dread a louis xiv with the crack of his whip and his olympian looks not now a richelieu and bastilles no the whole nation is behind thee thou too o heavens mayest become a political power and with the shakings of thy horsehair wig shake principalities and dynasties like a very jove with his ambrosial curls  light old m de maurepas since the end of 1781 has been fixed in the frost of death never more said the good louis shall i hear his step overhead his light jestings and gyratings are at an end no more can the importunate reality be hidden by pleasant wit and todays evil be deftly rolled over upon tomorrow the morrow itself has arrived and now nothing but a solid phlegmatic m de vergennes sits there in dull matter of fact like some dull punctual clerk which he originally was admits what cannot be denied let the remedy come whence it will in him is no remedy only clerklike despatch of business according to routine the poor king grown older yet hardly more experienced must himself with such nofaculty as he has begin governing wherein also his queen will give help bright queen with her quick clear glances and impulses clear and even noble but all too superficial vehementshallow for that work to govern france were such a problem and now it has grown wellnigh too hard to govern even the oeildeboeuf for if a distressed people has its cry so likewise and more audibly has a bereaved court to the oeildeboeuf it remains inconceivable how in a france of such resources the horn of plenty should run dry did it not use to flow nevertheless necker with his revenue of parsimony has suppressed above six hundred places before the courtiers could oust him parsimonious financepedant as he was again a military pedant saintgermain with his prussian manoeuvres with his prussian notions as if merit and not coatofarms should be the rule of promotion has disaffected military men the mousquetaires with much else are suppressed for he too was one of your suppressors and unsettling and oversetting did mere mischiefto the oeildeboeuf complaints abound scarcity anxiety it is a changed oeildeboeuf besenval says already in these years 1781 there was such a melancholy such a tristesse about court compared with former days as made it quite dispiriting to look upon  no wonder that the oeildeboeuf feels melancholy when you are suppressing its places not a place can be suppressed but some purse is the lighter for it and more than one heart the heavier for did it not employ the workingclasses toomanufacturers male and female of laces essences of pleasure generally whosoever could manufacture pleasure miserable economies never felt over twentyfive millions so however it goes on and is not yet ended few years more and the wolfhounds shall fall suppressed the bearhounds the falconry places shall fall thick as autumnal leaves duke de polignac demonstrates to the complete silencing of ministerial logic that his place cannot be abolished then gallantly turning to the queen surrenders it since her majesty so wishes less chivalrous was duke de coigny and yet not luckier we got into a real quarrel coigny and i said king louis but if he had even struck me i could not have blamed him besenval iii 25558 in regard to such matters there can be but one opinion baron besenval with that frankness of speech which stamps the independent man plainly assures her majesty that it is frightful affreux you go to bed and are not sure but you shall rise impoverished on the morrow one might as well be in turkey it is indeed a dogs life  how singular this perpetual distress of the royal treasury and yet it is a thing not more incredible than undeniable a thing mournfully true the stumblingblock on which all ministers successively stumble and fall be it want of fiscal genius or some far other want there is the palpablest discrepancy between revenue and expenditure a deficit of the revenue you must choke combler the deficit or else it will swallow you this is the stern problem hopeless seemingly as squaring of the circle controller joly de fleury who succeeded necker could do nothing with it nothing but propose loans which were tardily filled up impose new taxes unproductive of money productive of clamour and discontent as little could controller dormesson do or even less for if joly maintained himself beyond year and day dormesson reckons only by months till the king purchased rambouillet without consulting him which he took as a hint to withdraw and so towards the end of 1783 matters threaten to come to stillstand vain seems human ingenuity in vain has our newlydevised council of finances struggled our intendants of finance controllergeneral of finances there are unhappily no finances to control fatal paralysis invades the social movement clouds of blindness or of blackness envelop us are we breaking down then into the black horrors of national bankruptcy  great is bankruptcy the great bottomless gulf into which all falsehoods public and private do sink disappearing whither from the first origin of them they were all doomed for nature is true and not a lie no lie you can speak or act but it will come after longer or shorter circulation like a bill drawn on natures reality and be presented there for paymentwith the answer no effects pity only that it often had so long a circulation that the original forger were so seldom he who bore the final smart of it lies and the burden of evil they bring are passed on shifted from back to back and from rank to rank and so land ultimately on the dumb lowest rank who with spade and mattock with sore heart and empty wallet daily come in contact with reality and can pass the cheat no further  observe nevertheless how by a just compensating law if the lie with its burden in this confused whirlpool of society sinks and is shifted ever downwards then in return the distress of it rises ever upwards and upwards whereby after the long pining and demistarvation of those twenty millions a duke de coigny and his majesty come also to have their real quarrel such is the law of just nature bringing though at long intervals and were it only by bankruptcy matters round again to the mark  but with a fortunatus purse in his pocket through what length of time might not almost any falsehood last your society your household practical or spiritual arrangement is untrue unjust offensive to the eye of god and man nevertheless its hearth is warm its larder well replenished the innumerable swiss of heaven with a kind of natural loyalty gather round it will prove by pamphleteering musketeering that it is a truth or if not an unmixed unearthly impossible truth then better a wholesomely attempered one as wind is to the shorn lamb and works well changed outlook however when purse and larder grow empty was your arrangement so true so accordant to natures ways then how in the name of wonder has nature with her infinite bounty come to leave it famishing there to all men to all women and all children it is now indutiable that your arrangement was false honour to bankruptcy ever righteous on the great scale though in detail it is so cruel under all falsehoods it works unweariedly mining no falsehood did it rise heavenhigh and cover the world but bankruptcy one day will sweep it down and make us free of it    chapter 13ii  controller calonne  under such circumstances of tristesse obstruction and sick langour when to an exasperated court it seems as if fiscal genius had departed from among men what apparition could be welcomer than that of m de calonne calonne a man of indisputable genius even fiscal genius more or less of experience both in managing finance and parlements for he has been intendant at metz at lille kings procureur at douai a man of weight connected with the moneyed classes of unstained nameif it were not some peccadillo of showing a clients letter in that old daiguillonlachalotais business as good as forgotten now he has kinsmen of heavy purse felt on the stock exchange our foulons berthiers intrigue for himold foulon who has now nothing to do but intrigue who is known and even seen to be what they call a scoundrel but of unmeasured wealth who from commissariatclerk which he once was may hope some think if the game go right to be minister himself one day  such propping and backing has m de calonne and then intrinsically such qualities hope radiates from his face persuasion hangs on his tongue for all straits he has present remedy and will make the world roll on wheels before him on the 3d of november 1783 the oeildeboeuf rejoices in its new controllergeneral calonne also shall have trial calonne also in his way as turgot and necker had done in theirs shall forward the consummation suffuse with one other flush of brilliancy our now too leadencoloured era of hope and wind it upinto fulfilment  great in any case is the felicity of the oeildeboeuf stinginess has fled from these royal abodes suppression ceases your besenval may go peaceably to sleep sure that he shall awake unplundered smiling plenty as if conjured by some enchanter has returned scatters contentment from her newflowing horn and mark what suavity of manners a bland smile distinguishes our controller to all men he listens with an air of interest nay of anticipation makes their own wish clear to themselves and grants it or at least grants conditional promise of it i fear this is a matter of difficulty said her majestymadame answered the controller if it is but difficult it is done if it is impossible it shall be done se fera a man of such facility withal to observe him in the pleasurevortex of society which none partakes of with more gusto you might ask when does he work and yet his work as we see is never behindhand above all the fruit of his work readymoney truly a man of incredible facility facile action facile elocution facile thought how in mild suasion philosophic depth sparkles up from him as mere wit and lambent sprightliness and in her majestys soirees with the weight of a world lying on him he is the delight of men and women by what magic does he accomplish miracles by the only true magic that of genius men name him the minister as indeed when was there another such crooked things are become straight by him rough places plain and over the oeildeboeuf there rests an unspeakable sunshine  nay in seriousness let no man say that calonne had not genius genius for persuading before all things for borrowing with the skilfulest judicious appliances of underhand money he keeps the stockexchanges flourishing so that loan after loan is filled up as soon as opened calculators likely to know besenval iii 216 have calculated that he spent in extraordinaries at the rate of one million daily which indeed is some fifty thousand pounds sterling but did he not procure something with it namely peace and prosperity for the time being philosophedom grumbles and croaks buys as we said 80000 copies of neckers new book but nonpareil calonne in her majestys apartment with the glittering retinue of dukes duchesses and mere happy admiring faces can let necker and philosophedom croak  the misery is such a time cannot last squandering and payment by loan is no way to choke a deficit neither is oil the substance for quenching conflagrationsbut only for assuaging them not permanently to the nonpareil himself who wanted not insight it is clear at intervals and dimly certain at all times that his trade is by nature temporary growing daily more difficult that changes incalculable lie at no great distance apart from financial deficit the world is wholly in such a newfangled humour all things working loose from their old fastenings towards new issues and combinations there is not a dwarf jokei a cropt brutushead or anglomaniac horseman rising on his stirrups that does not betoken change but what then the day in any case passes pleasantly for the morrow if the morrow come there shall be counsel too once mounted by munificence suasion magic of genius high enough in favour with the oeildeboeuf with the king queen stockexchange and so far as possible with all men a nonpareil controller may hope to go careering through the inevitable in some unimagined way as handsomely as another  at all events for these three miraculous years it has been expedient heaped on expedient till now with such cumulation and height the pile topples perilous and here has this worldswonder of a diamond necklace brought it at last to the clear verge of tumbling genius in that direction can no more mounted high enough or not mounted we must fare forth hardly is poor rohan the necklacecardinal safely bestowed in the auvergne mountains dame de lamotte unsafely in the salpetriere and that mournful business hushed up when our sanguine controller once more astonishes the world an expedient unheard of for these hundred and sixty years has been propounded and by dint of suasion for his light audacity his hope and eloquence are matchless has been got adoptedconvocation of the notables  let notable persons the actual or virtual rulers of their districts be summoned from all sides of france let a true tale of his majestys patriotic purposes and wretched pecuniary impossibilities be suasively told them and then the question put what are we to do surely to adopt healing measures such as the magic of genius will unfold such as once sanctioned by notables all parlements and all men must with more or less reluctance submit to    chapter 13iii  the notables  here then is verily a sign and wonder visible to the whole world bodeful of much the oeildeboeuf dolorously grumbles were we not well as we stoodquenching conflagrations by oil constitutional philosophedom starts with joyful surprise stares eagerly what the result will be the public creditor the public debtor the whole thinking and thoughtless public

prussian monarchies pamphlets on cagliostro writing with pay but not with honourable recognition innumerable despatches for his governmentscents or descries richer quarry from afar he like an eagle or vulture or mixture of both preens his wings for flight homewards fils adoptif memoires de mirabeau t iv livv 4 et 5  m de calonne has stretched out an aarons rod over france miraculous and is summoning quite unexpected things audacity and hope alternate in him with misgivings though the sanguinevaliant side carries it anon he writes to an intimate friend here me fais pitie a moimeme i am an object of pity to myself anon invites some dedicating poet or poetaster to sing this assembly of the notables and the revolution that is preparing biographie universelle para calonne by guizot preparing indeed and a matter to be sungonly not till we have seen it and what the issue of it is in deep obscure unrest all things have so long gone rocking and swaying will m de calonne with this his alchemy of the notables fasten all together again and get new revenues or wrench all asunder so that it go no longer rocking and swaying but clashing and colliding  be this as it may in the bleak short days we behold men of weight and influence threading the great vortex of french locomotion each on his several line from all sides of france towards the chateau of versailles summoned thither de par le roi there on the 22d day of february 1787 they have met and got installed notables to the number of a hundred and thirtyseven as we count them name by name lacretelle iii 286 montgaillard i 347 add seven princes of the blood it makes the round gross of notables men of the sword men of the robe peers dignified clergy parlementary presidents divided into seven boards bureaux under our seven princes of the blood monsieur dartois penthievre and the rest among whom let not our new duke dorleans for since 1785 he is chartres no longer be forgotten never yet made admiral and now turning the corner of his fortieth year with spoiled blood and prospects halfweary of a world which is more than halfweary of him monseigneurs future is most questionable not in illumination and insight not even in conflagration but as was said in dull smoke and ashes of outburnt sensualities does he live and digest sumptuosity and sordidness revenge lifeweariness ambition darkness putrescence and say in sterling money three hundred thousand a yearwere this poor prince once to burst loose from his courtmoorings to what regions with what phenomena might he not sail and drift happily as yet he affects to hunt daily sits there since he must sit presiding that bureau of his with dull moonvisage dull glassy eyes as if it were a mere tedium to him  we observe finally that count mirabeau has actually arrived he descends from berlin on the scene of action glares into it with flashing sunglance discerns that it will do nothing for him he had hoped these notables might need a secretary they do need one but have fixed on dupont de nemours a man of smaller fame but then of betterwho indeed as his friends often hear labours under this complaint surely not a universal one of having five kings to correspond with dumont souvenirs sur mirabeau paris 1832 p 20 the pen of a mirabeau cannot become an official one nevertheless it remains a pen in defect of secretaryship he sets to denouncing stockbrokerage denonciation de lagiotage testifying as his wont is by loud bruit that he is present and busytill warned by friend talleyrand and even by calonne himself underhand that a seventeenth lettredecachet may be launched against him he timefully flits over the marches  and now in stately royal apartments as pictures of that time still represent them our hundred and fortyfour notables sit organised ready to hear and consider controller calonne is dreadfully behindhand with his speeches his preparatives however the mans facility of work is known to us for freshness of style lucidity ingenuity largeness of view that opening harangue of his was unsurpassablehad not the subjectmatter been so appalling a deficit concerning which accounts vary and the controllers own account is not unquestioned but which all accounts agree in representing as enormous this is the epitome of our controllers difficulties and then his means mere turgotism for thither it seems we must come at last provincial assemblies new taxation nay strangest of all new landtax what he calls subvention territoriale from which neither privileged nor unprivileged noblemen clergy nor parlementeers shall be exempt  foolish enough these privileged classes have been used to tax levying toll tribute and custom at all hands while a penny was left but to be themselves taxed of such privileged persons meanwhile do these notables all but the merest fraction consist headlong calonne had given no heed to the composition or judicious packing of them but chosen such notables as were really notable trusting for the issue to offhand ingenuity good fortune and eloquence that never yet failed headlong controllergeneral eloquence can do much but not all orpheus with eloquence grown rhythmic musical what we call poetry drew iron tears from the cheek of pluto but by what witchery of rhyme or prose wilt thou from the pocket of plutus draw gold  accordingly the storm that now rose and began to whistle round calonne first in these seven bureaus and then on the outside of them awakened by them spreading wider and wider over all france threatens to become unappeasable a deficit so enormous mismanagement profusion is too clear peculation itself is hinted at nay lafayette and others go so far as to speak it out with attempts at proof the blame of his deficit our brave calonne as was natural had endeavoured to shift from himself on his predecessors not excepting even necker but now necker vehemently denies whereupon an angry correspondence which also finds its way into print  in the oeildeboeuf and her majestys private apartments an eloquent controller with his madame if it is but difficult had been persuasive but alas the cause is now carried elsewhither behold him one of these sad days in monsieurs bureau to which all the other bureaus have sent deputies he is standing at bay alone exposed to an incessant fire of questions interpellations objurgations from those hundred and thirtyseven pieces of logicordnancewhat we may well call bouches a feu firemouths literally never according to besenval or hardly ever had such display of intellect dexterity coolness suasive eloquence been made by man to the raging play of so many firemouths he opposes nothing angrier than lightbeams selfpossession and fatherly smiles with the imperturbablest bland clearness he for five hours long keeps answering the incessant volley of fiery captious questions reproachful interpellations in words prompt as lightning quiet as light nay the crossfire too such side questions and incidental interpellations as in the heat of the mainbattle he having only one tongue could not get answered these also he takes up at the first slake answers even these besenval iii 196 could blandest suasive eloquence have saved france she were saved  heavyladen controller in the seven bureaus seems nothing but hindrance in monsieurs bureau a lomenie de brienne archbishop of toulouse with

mere change which is ever wasteful but that all men may have share of what is going and so the strife of freedom indefinitely prolong itself and no harm be done  the notables mollified by easter festivities by the sacrifice of calonne are not in the worst humour already his majesty while the interlunar shadows were in office had held session of notables and from his throne delivered promissory conciliatory eloquence the queen stood waiting at a window till his carriage came back and monsieur from afar clapped hands to her in sign that all was well besenval iii 220 it has had the best effect if such do but last leading notables meanwhile can be caressed briennes new gloss lamoignons long head will profit somewhat conciliatory eloquence shall not be wanting on the whole however is it not undeniable that this of ousting calonne and adopting the plans of calonne is a measure which to produce its best effect should be looked at from a certain distance cursorily not dwelt on with minute near scrutiny in a word that no service the notables could now do were so obliging as in some handsome manner totake themselves away their six propositions about provisional assemblies suppression of corvees and suchlike can be accepted without criticism the subvention on landtax and much else one must glide hastily over safe nowhere but in flourishes of conciliatory eloquence till at length on this 25th of may year 1787 in solemn final session there bursts forth what we can call an explosion of eloquence king lomenie lamoignon and retinue taking up the successive strain in harrangues to the number of ten besides his majestys which last the livelong daywhereby as in a kind of choral anthem or bravura peal of thanks praises promises the notables are so to speak organed out and dismissed to their respective places of abode they had sat and talked some nine weeks they were the first notables since richelieus in the year 1626  by some historians sitting much at their ease in the safe distance lomenie has been blamed for this dismissal of his notables nevertheless it was clearly time there are things as we said which should not be dwelt on with minute close scrutiny over hot coals you cannot glide too fast in these seven bureaus where no work could be done unless talk were work the questionablest matters were coming up lafayette for example in monseigneur dartois bureau took upon him to set forth more than one deprecatory oration about lettresdecachet liberty of the subject agio and suchlike which monseigneur endeavouring to repress was

hideous abysses better left hid the unquietest humour possesses all men ferments seeks issue in pamphleteering caricaturing projecting declaiming vain jangling of thought word and deed  it is spiritual bankruptcy long tolerated verging now towards economical bankruptcy and become intolerable for from the lowest dumb rank the inevitable misery as was predicted has spread upwards in every man is some obscure feeling that his position oppressive or else oppressed is a false one all men in one or the other acrid dialect as assaulters or as defenders must give vent to the unrest that is in them of such stuff national wellbeing and the glory of rulers is not made o lomenie what a wildheaving wastelooking hungry and angry world hast thou after lifelong effort got promoted to take charge of  lomenies first edicts are mere soothing ones creation of provincial assemblies for apportioning the imposts when we get any suppression of corvees or statutelabour alleviation of gabelle soothing measures recommended by the notables long clamoured for by all liberal men oil cast on the waters has been known to produce a good effect before venturing with great essential measures lomenie will see this singular swell of the public mind abate somewhat  most proper surely but what if it were not a swell of the abating kind there are swells that come of upper tempest and windgust but again there are swells that come of subterranean pent wind some say and even of inward decomposion of decay that has become selfcombustionas when according to neptunoplutonic geology the world is all decayed down into due attritus of this sort and shall now be exploded and newmade these latter abate not by oilthe fool says in his heart how shall not tomorrow be as yesterday as all dayswhich were once tomorrows the wise man looking on this france moral intellectual economical sees in short all the symptoms he has ever met with in historyunabatable by soothing edicts  meanwhile abate or not cash must be had and for that quite another sort of edicts namely bursal or fiscal ones how easy were fiscal edicts did you know for certain that the parlement of paris would what they call register them such right of registering properly of mere writing down the parlement has got by old wont and though but a lawcourt can remonstrate and higgle considerably about the same hence many quarrels desperate maupeou devices and victory and defeata quarrel now near forty years long hence fiscal edicts which otherwise were easy enough become such problems for example is there not calonnes subvention territoriale universal unexempting landtax the sheetanchor of finance or to show so far as possible that one is not without original finance talent lomenie himself can devise an edit du timbre or stamptaxborrowed also it is true but then from america may it prove luckier in france than there  france has her resources nevertheless it cannot be denied the aspect of that parlement is questionable already among the notables in that final symphony of dismissal the paris president had an ominous tone adrien duport quitting magnetic sleep in this agitation of the world threatens to

our peers have in too many cases laid aside their frogs laces bagwigs and go about in english costume or ride rising in their stirrupsin the most headlong manner nothing but insubordination eleutheromania confused unlimited opposition in their heads questionable not to be ventured upon if we had a fortunatus purse but lomenie has waited all june casting on the waters what oil he had and now betide as it may the two finance edicts must out on the 6th of july he forwards his proposed stamptax and landtax to the parlement of paris and as if putting his own leg foremost not his borrowed

his majesty must decline to furnish discussions arise patriotic eloquence the peers are summoned does the nemean lion begin to bristle here surely is a duel which france and the universe may look upon with prayers at lowest with curiosity and bets paris stirs with new animation the outer courts of the palais de justice roll with unusual crowds coming and going their huge outer hum mingles with the clang of patriotic eloquence within and gives vigour to it poor lomenie gazes from the distance little comforted has his invisible emissaries flying to and fro assiduous without result  so pass the sultry dogdays in the most electric manner and the whole month of july and still in the sanctuary of justice sounds nothing but harmodiusaristogiton eloquence environed with the hum of crowding paris

there follow cachinnatory buzzes of approval what a word to be spoken in the palais de justice old dormesson the excontrollers uncle shakes his judicious head far enough from laughing but the outer courts and paris and france catch the glad sound and repeat it shall repeat it and reecho and reverberate it till it grow a deafening peal clearly enough here is no registering to be thought of  the pious proverb says there are remedies for all things but death when a parlement refuses registering the remedy by long practice has become familiar to the simplest a bed of justice one complete month this parlement has spent in mere idle jargoning and sound and fury the timbre edict not registered or like to be the subvention not yet so much as spoken of on the 6th of august let the whole refractory body roll out in wheeled vehicles as far as the kings chateau of versailles there shall the king holding his bed of justice order them by his own royal lips to register they may remonstrate in an under tone but they must obey lest a worse unknown thing befall them  it is done the parlement has rolled out on royal summons has heard the express royal order to register whereupon it has rolled back again amid the hushed expectancy of men and now behold on the morrow this parlement seated once more in its own palais with crowds inundating the outer courts not only does not register but o portent declares all that was done on the prior day to be null and the bed of justice as good as a futility in the history of france here verily is a new feature nay better still our heroic parlement getting suddenly enlightened on several things declares that for its part it is incompetent to register taxedicts at allhaving done it by mistake during these late centuries that for such act one authority only is competent the assembled three estates of the realm  to such length can the universal spirit of a nation penetrate the most isolated bodycorporate say rather with such weapons homicidal and suicidal in exasperated political duel will bodiescorporate fight but in any case is not this the real deathgrapple of war and internecine duel greek meeting greek whereon men had they

become a sceptre of the pen had got itself together better and worse as bodiescorporate do to satisfy some dim desire of the world and many clear desires of individuals and so had grown in the course of centuries on concession on acquirement and usurpation to be what we see it a prosperous social anomaly deciding lawsuits sanctioning or rejecting laws and withal disposing of its places and offices by sale for ready moneywhich method sleek president henault after meditation will demonstrate to be the indifferentbest abrege chronologique p 975  in such a body existing by purchase for readymoney

anomaly but in duel against another worse the exiled parlement is felt to have covered itself with glory there are quarrels in which even satan bringing help were not unwelcome even satan fighting

the most marked manner monsieur who is thought to be in opposition is met with vivats and strewed flowers monseigneur on the other hand with silence with murmurs which rise to hisses and groans nay an

hospitable as could be looked for nevertheless one has comparatively a dull life no crowds now to carry you shoulderhigh to the immortal gods scarcely a patriot or two will drive out so far and bid you be of firm courage you are in furnished lodgings far from home and domestic comfort little to do but wander over the unlovely champagne fields seeing the grapes ripen taking counsel about the thousandtimes consulted a prey to tedium in danger even that paris may forget you messengers come and go pacific lomenie is not slack in negotiating promising dormesson and the prudent elder members see no good in strife  after a dull month the parlement yielding and retaining makes truce as all parlements must the stamptax is withdrawn the subvention landtax is also withdrawn but in its stead there is granted what they call a prorogation of the second twentiethitself a kind of landtax but not so oppressive to the influential classes which lies mainly on the dumb class moreover secret promises exist on the part of the elders that finances may be raised by loan of the ugly word statesgeneral there shall be no mention  and so on the 20th of september our exiled parlement returns

nothingas from a thing drained dry more cannot be drawn hope is nowhere if not in the old refuge of loans  to lomenie aided by the long head of lamoignon deeply pondering this sea of troubles the thought suggested itself why not have a successive loan emprunt successif or loan that went on lending year after year as much as needful say till 1792 the trouble of registering such loan were the same we had then breathing time money to work with at least to subsist on edict of a successive loan must be proposed to conciliate the philosophes let a liberal edict walk in front of it for emancipation of protestants let a liberal promise guard the rear of it that when our loan ends in that final 1792 the statesgeneral shall be convoked  such liberal edict of protestant emancipation the time having come for it shall cost a lomenie as little as the deathpenalties to be put in execution did as for the liberal promise of statesgeneral it can be fulfilled or not the fulfilment is five good years off in five years much intervenes but the registering ah truly there is the difficultyhowever we have that promise of the elders given secretly at troyes judicious gratuities cajoleries underground intrigues with old foulon named ame damnee familiardemon of the parlement may perhaps do the rest at worst and lowest the royal authority has resourceswhich ought it not to put forth if it cannot realise money the royal authority is as good as dead dead of that surest and miserablest death inanition risk and win without risk all is already lost for the rest as in enterprises of pith a touch of stratagem often proves furthersome his majesty announces a royal hunt for the 19th of november next and all whom it concerns are joyfully getting their gear ready  royal hunt indeed but of twolegged unfeathered game at eleven in the morning of that royalhunt day 19th of november 1787 unexpected blare of trumpetting tumult of charioteering and cavalcading disturbs the seat of justice his majesty is come with gardedessceaux lamoignon and peers and retinue to hold royal session and have edicts registered what a change since louis xiv entered here in boots and whip in hand ordered his registering to be donewith an olympian look which none durst gainsay and did without stratagem in such unceremonious fashion hunt as well as register dulaure vi 306 for louis xvi on this day the registering will be enough if indeed he and the day suffice for it  meanwhile with fit ceremonial words the purpose of the royal breast is signifiedtwo edicts for protestant emancipation for successive loan of both which edicts our trusty gardedessceaux lamoignon will explain the purport on both which a trusty parlement is requested to deliver its opinion each member having free privilege of speech and so lamoignon too having perorated not amiss and wound up with that promise of statesgeneralthe spheremusic of parlementary eloquence begins explosive responsive sphere answering sphere

highness dorleans the rubicund moonhead goes wagging darker beams the copper visage like unscoured copper in the glazed eye is disquietude he rolls uneasy in his seat as if he meant something amid unutterable satiety has sudden new appetite for new forbidden fruit been vouchsafed him disgust and edacity laziness that cannot rest futile ambition revenge nonadmiralshipo within that carbuncled skin what a confusion of confusions sits bottled  eight couriers in course of the day gallop from versailles where lomenie waits palpitating and gallop back again not with the best news in the outer courts of the palais huge buzz of expectation reigns it is whispered the chief minister has lost six votes overnight and from within resounds nothing but forensic eloquence pathetic and even indignant heartrending appeals to the royal clemency that his majesty would please to summon statesgeneral forthwith and be the saviour of francewherein duskyglowing despremenil but still more sabatier de cabre and freteau since named commere freteau goody freteau are among the loudest for six mortal hours it lasts in this manner the infinite hubbub unslackened  and so now when brown dusk is falling through the windows and no end visible his majesty on hint of gardedessceaux lamoignon opens his royal lips once more to say in brief that he must have his loanedict registeredmomentary deep pausesee monseigneur dorleans rises with moonvisage turned towards the royal platform he asks with a delicate graciosity of manner covering unutterable things whether it is a bed of justice then or a royal session fire flashes on him from the throne and neighbourhood surly answer that it is a session in that case monseigneur will crave leave to remark that edicts cannot be registered by order in a session and indeed to enter against such registry his individual humble protest vous etes bien le maitre you will do your pleasure answers the king and thereupon in high state marches out escorted by his courtretinue dorleans himself as in duty bound escorting him but only to the gate which duty done dorleans returns in from the gate redacts his protest in the face of an applauding parlement an applauding france and sohas cut his courtmoorings shall we say and will now sail and drift fast enough towards chaos  thou foolish dorleans equality that art to be is royalty grown a mere wooden scarecrow whereon thou pert scaldheaded crow mayest alight at pleasure and peck not yet wholly  next day a lettredecachet sends dorleans to bethink himself in his chateau of villerscotterets where

stronghold of ham amid the norman marshes by a third sabatier de cabre into mont st michel amid the norman quicksands as for the parlement it must on summons travel out to versailles with its registerbook under its arm to have the protest biffe expunged not without admonition and even rebuke a stroke of authority which one might have hoped would quiet matters  unhappily no it is a mere taste of the whip to rearing coursers which makes them rear worse when a team of twentyfive millions begins rearing what is lomenies whip the parlement will nowise acquiesce meekly and set to register the protestant edict and do its other work in salutary fear of these three lettresdecachet far from that it begins questioning lettresdecachet generally their legality endurability emits dolorous

seen its enemy hurled prostrate and been itself ridden to foundering say rather jugulated for hide and shoes and lie dead in the ditch  under such omens however we have reached the spring of 1788 by no path can the kings government find passage for itself but is everywhere shamefully flung back beleaguered by twelve rebellious parlements which are grown to be the organs of an angry nation it can advance nowhither can accomplish nothing obtain nothing not so much as money to subsist on but must sit there seemingly to be eaten up of deficit  the measure of the iniquity then of the falsehood which has been gathering through long centuries is nearly full at least that of the misery is for the hovels of the twentyfive millions the misery permeating upwards and forwards as its law is has got so farto the very oeildeboeuf of versailles mans hand in this blind pain is set against man not only the low against the higher but the higher against each other provincial noblesse is bitter against court noblesse robe against sword rochet against pen but against the kings government who is not bitter not even besenval in these days to it all men and bodies of men are become as enemies it is the centre whereon infinite contentions unite and clash what new universal vertiginous movement is this of institution social arrangements individual minds which once worked cooperative now rolling and grinding in distracted collision inevitable it is the breakingup of a worldsolecism worn out at last down even to bankruptcy of money and so this poor versailles court as the chief or central solecism finds all the other solecisms arrayed against it most natural for your human solecism be it person or combination of persons is ever by law of nature uneasy if verging towards bankruptcy it is even miserableand when would the meanest solecism consent to blame or amend itself while there remained another to amend  these threatening signs do not terrify lomenie much less teach him lomenie though of light nature is not without courage of a sort nay have we not read of lightest creatures trained canarybirds that could fly cheerfully with lighted matches and fire cannon fire whole powdermagazines to sit and die of deficit is no part of lomenies plan the evil is considerable but can he not remove it can he not attack it at lowest he can attack the symptom of it these rebellious parlements he can attack and perhaps remove much is dim to lomenie but two things are clear that such parlementary duel with royalty is growing perilous nay internecine above all that money must be had take thought brave lomenie thou gardedessceaux lamoignon who hast ideas so often defeated balked cruelly when the golden fruit seemed within clutch rally for one other struggle to tame the

reasonable o maupeou thou bold man had we left thy work where it wasbut apart from exile or other violent methods is there not one method whereby all things are tamed even lions the method of hunger what if the parlements supplies were cut off namely its lawsuits  minor courts for the trying of innumerable minor causes might be instituted these we could call grand bailliages whereon the parlement shortened of its prey would look with yellow despair but the public fond of cheap justice with favour and hope then for finance for registering of edicts why not from our own oeildeboeuf dignitaries

posts this is what the court sat hatching as its accursed cockatriceegg and would not stir though provoked till the brood were out hie with it despremenil home to paris convoke instantaneous sessions let the parlement and the earth and the heavens know it    chapter 13viii  lomenies deaththroes  on the morrow which is the 3rd of may 1788 an astonished parlement sits convoked listens speechless to the speech of despremenil unfolding the infinite misdeed deed of treachery of unhallowed darkness such as despotism loves denounce it o parlement of paris awaken france and the universe roll what thunderbarrels of forensic eloquence thou hast with thee too it is verily now or never  the parlement is not wanting at such juncture in the hour of his extreme jeopardy the lion first incites himself by roaring by lashing his sides so here the parlement of paris on the motion of despremenil a most patriotic oath of the oneandall sort is sworn with united throatan excellent newidea which in these coming years shall not remain unimitated next comes indomitable declaration almost of the rights of man at least of the rights of parlement invocation to the friends of french freedom in this and in subsequent time all which or the essence of all which is brought to paper in a tone wherein something of plaintiveness blends with and tempers heroic valour and thus having sounded the stormbellwhich paris hears which all france will hear and hurled such defiance in the teeth of lomenie and despotism the parlement retires as from a tolerable first days work  but how lomenie felt to see his cockatriceegg so essential to the salvation of france broken in this premature manner let readers fancy indignant he clutches at his thunderbolts de cachet of the seal and launches two of them a bolt for despremenil a bolt for that busy goeslard whose service in the second twentieth and strict valuation is not forgotten such bolts clutched promptly overnight and launched with the early new morning shall strike agitated paris if not into requiescence yet into wholesome astonishment  ministerial thunderbolts may be launched but if they do not hit despremenil and goeslard warned both of them as is thought by the singing of some friendly bird elude the lomenie tipstaves escape disguised through skywindows over roofs to their own palais de justice the thunderbolts have missed paris for the buzz flies abroad is struck into astonishment not wholesome the two martyrs of liberty doff their disguises don their long gowns behold in the space of an hour by aid of ushers and swift runners the parlement with its counsellors presidents even peers sits anew assembled the assembled parlement declares that these its two martyrs cannot be given up to any sublunary authority moreover that the session is permanent admitting of no adjournment till pursuit of them has been relinquished  and so with forensic eloquence denunciation and protest with couriers going and returning the parlement in this state of continual explosion that shall cease neither night nor day waits the issue awakened paris once more inundates those outer courts boils in floods wilder than ever through all avenues dissonant hubbub there is jargon as of babel in the hour when they were first smitten as here with mutual unintelligibilty and the people had not yet dispersed  paris city goes through its diurnal epochs of working and slumbering and now for the second time most european and african mortals are asleep but here in this whirlpool of words sleep falls not the night spreads her coverlid of darkness

afflicted bretons send remonstrance to lomenie by a deputation of twelve whom however lomenie having heard them shuts up in the bastille a second larger deputation he meets by his scouts on the road

lamoignon looked so mysterious besenval had kept asking him one question whether they had cash to which as lamoignon always answered on the faith of lomenie that the cash was safe judicious besenval rejoined that then all was safe nevertheless the melancholy fact is that the royal coffers are almost getting literally void of coin indeed apart from all other things this invitation to thinkers and the great change now at hand are enough to arrest the circulation of capital and forward only that of pamphlets a few thousand gold louis are now all of money or moneys worth that remains in the kings

parlement but being met by a storm of mere hooting and howling from all men such opinion was blown straightway to the winds and the popularity of the parlement along with itnever to return the parlements part we said above was as good as played concerning which however there is this further to be noted the proximity of dates it was on the 22nd of september that the parlement returned from vacation or exile in its estates to be reinstalled amid boundless jubilee from all paris precisely next day it was that this same parlement came to its clearly declared opinion and then on the morrow after that you behold it covered with outrages its outer court one vast sibilation and the glory departed from it for evermore weber i 347 a popularity of twentyfour hours was in those times no

government sitting there on such principles in such an environment would have determined to demean itself at this new juncture may even yet be a question such a government would have felt too well that its long task was now drawing to a close that under the guise of these statesgeneral at length inevitable a new omnipotent unknown of democracy was coming into being in presence of which no versailles government either could or should except in a provisory character continue extant to enact which provisory character so unspeakably important might its whole faculties but have sufficed and so a peaceable gradual wellconducted abdication and dominedimittas have been the issue  this for our ideal allseeing versailles government but for the actual irrational versailles government alas that is a government existing there only for its own behoof without right except possession and now also without might it foresees nothing sees nothing has not so much as a purpose but has only purposesand

towards the antipatriotic side they stagger at the double representation at the vote by head there is not affirmative decision there is mere debating and that not with the best aspects for indeed were not these notables themselves mostly of the privileged classes they clamoured once now they have their misgivings make their dolorous representations let them vanish ineffectual and return no more they vanish after a months session on this 12th of december year 1788 the last terrestrial notables not to reappear any other time in the history of the world  and so the clamour still continuing and the pamphlets and nothing but patriotic addresses louder and louder pouting in on us from all corners of francenecker himself some fortnight after before the year is yet done has to present his report rapport fait au roi dans son conseil le 27 decembre 1788 recommending at his own risk that same double representation nay almost enjoining it so loud is the jargon and eleutheromania what dubitating

privileged orders and the unprivileged as a readymade battleprize and necessity of war from the very first which battleprize whosoever seizes itmay thenceforth bear as battleflag with the best omens

privileged backed by their aix parlement discover that such novelties enjoined though they be by royal edict tend to national detriment and what is still more indisputable to impair the dignity of the noblesse whereupon mirabeau protesting aloud this same noblesse amid huge tumult within doors and without flatly determines to expel him from their assembly no other method not even that of successive duels would answer with him the obstreperous fierceglaring man expelled he accordingly is  in all countries in all times exclaims he departing the aristocrats have implacably pursued every friend of

and specialty we note with how different an interest it is of the parlement of paris which starts forward like the others only with less audacity seeing better how it lay to nosering that behemoth of a statesgeneral worthy doctor guillotin respectable practitioner in paris has drawn up his little plan of a cahier of doleancesas had he not having the wish and gift the clearest liberty to do he is getting the people to sign it whereupon the surly parlement summons him to give an account of himself he goes but with all paris at his heels which floods the outer courts and copiously signs the cahier even there while the doctor is giving account of himself within the parlement cannot too soon dismiss guillotin with compliments to be borne home shoulderhigh deux amis de la liberte i 141 this

trading speculation commerce of all kinds has as far as possible come to a dead pause and the hand of the industrious lies idle in his bosom frightful enough when now the rigour of seasons has also done its part and to scarcity of work is added scarcity of food in the opening spring there come rumours of forestalment there come kings edicts petitions of bakers against millers and at length in

famishing men shall prior to death gather in groups and crowds as the poor fieldfares and plovers do in bitter weather were it but that they may chirp mournfully together and misery look in the eyes of misery if famishing men what famishing fieldfares cannot do should discover once congregated that they need not die while food is in the land since they are many and with empty wallets have right hands in all this what need were there of preternatural machinery to most people none but not to french people in a time of revolution these brigands as turgots also were fourteen years ago have all been set on enlisted though without tuck of drumby aristocrats by democrats by dorleans dartois and enemies of the public weal nay historians to this day will prove it by one argument these brigands pretending to have no victual nevertheless contrive to drink nay have been seen drunk lacretelle 18me siecle ii 155 an unexampled fact but on the whole may we not predict that a people with such a

mirabeau on account of his rotundity and the quantities of strong liquor he contains  there then walks our french noblesse all in the old pomp of chivalry and yet alas how changed from the old position drifted far down from their native latitude like arctic icebergs got into the equatorial sea and fast thawing there once these chivalry duces dukes as they are still named did actually lead the worldwere it only towards battlespoil where lay the worlds best wages then moreover being the ablest leaders going they had their lions share those duces which none could grudge them but now when

and marquis lafayette as the topmost of their two kinds and say once more looking at what they did and what they were o tempus ferax rerum  on the whole however has not this unfortunate clergy also drifted in the timestream far from its native latitude an anomalous mass of men of whom the whole world has already a dim understanding that it can understand nothing they were once a priesthood interpreters of wisdom revealers of the holy that is in man a true clerus or inheritance of god on earth but nowthey pass silently with such cahiers as they have been able to redact and none cries god

all towards eternityso many heterogeneities cast together into the fermentingvat there with incalculable action counteraction elective affinities explosive developments to work out healing for a sick moribund system of society probably the strangest body of men if we consider well that ever met together on our planet on such an errand so thousandfold complex a society ready to burstup from its infinite depths and these men its rulers and healers without liferule for themselvesother liferule than a gospel according to jean jacques to the wisest of them what we must call the wisest man is properly an accident under the sky man is without duty round him except it be to make the constitution he is without heaven above him or hell beneath him he has no god in the world  what further or better belief can be said to exist in these twelve hundred belief in highplumed hats of a feudal cut in heraldic scutcheons in the divine right of kings in the divine right of gamedestroyers belief or what is still worse canting halfbelief or worst of all mere macchiavellic pretenceofbeliefin consecrated doughwafers and the godhood of a poor old italian man nevertheless in that immeasurable confusion and corruption which struggles there so blindly to become less confused and corrupt there is as we said this one salient point of a new life discernible the deep fixed determination to have done with shams a determination which consciously or unconsciously is fixed which waxes ever more fixed into very madness and fixedidea which in such embodiment as lies provided there shall now unfold itself rapidly monstrous stupendous unspeakable new for long thousands of yearshow has the heavens light oftentimes in this earth to clothe itself in thunder and electric murkiness and descend as molten lightning blasting if purifying nay is it not rather the very murkiness and atmospheric suffocation that brings the lightning and the light the new evangel as the old had been was it to be born in the destruction of a world  but how the deputies assisted at high mass and heard sermon and applauded the preacher church as it was when he preached politics how next day with sustained pomp they are for the first time installed in their salles des menus hall no longer of amusements and become a statesgeneralreaders can fancy for themselves the king from his estrade gorgeous as solomon in all his glory runs his eye over that majestic hall manyplumed manyglancing brighttinted as rainbow in the galleries and near side spaces where beauty sits raining bright influence satisfaction as of one that after long voyaging had got to port plays over his broad simple face the innocent king he rises and speaks with sonorous tone a conceivable speech with which still more with the succeeding onehour and twohour speeches of gardedessceaux and m necker full of nothing but patriotism hope faith and deficiency of the revenueno reader of these pages shall be tried  we remark only that as his majesty on finishing the speech put on his plumed hat and the noblesse according to custom imitated him our tiersetat deputies did mostly not without a shade of fierceness in like manner clapon and even crush on their slouched hats and stand there awaiting the issue histoire parlementaire i 356 mercier nouveau paris c thick buzz among them between majority and minority of couvrezvous decrouvrezvous hats off hats on to which his majesty puts end by taking off his own royal hat again  the session terminates without further accident or omen than this with which significantly enough france has opened her statesgeneral    book 1v  the third estate   chapter 15i  inertia  that exasperated france in this same national assembly of hers has got something nay something great momentous indispensable cannot be doubted yet still the question were specially what a question hard to solve even for calm onlookers at this distance wholly insoluble to actors in the middle of it the statesgeneral created and conflated by the passionate effort of the whole nation is there as a thing high and lifted up hope jubilating cries aloud that it will prove a miraculous brazen serpent in the wilderness whereon whosoever looks with faith and obedience shall be healed of all woes and serpentbites  we may answer it will at least prove a symbolic banner round which the exasperating complaining twentyfive millions otherwise isolated and without power may rally and workwhat it is in them to work if battle must be the work as one cannot help expecting then shall it be a battlebanner say an italian gonfalon in its old republican carroccio and shall tower up carborne shining in the wind and with iron tongue peal forth many a signal a thing of prime necessity which whether in the van or in the centre whether leading or led and driven must do the fighting multitude incalculable services for a season while it floats in the very front nay as it were stands solitary there waiting whether force will gather round it this same national carroccio and the signalpeals it rings are a main object with us  the omen of the slouchhats clapt on shows the commons deputies to have made up their minds on one thing that neither noblesse nor clergy shall have precedence of them hardly even majesty itself to such length has the contrat social and force of public opinion carried us for what is majesty but the delegate of the nation delegated and bargained with even rather tightlyin some very singular posture of affairs which jean jacques has not fixed the date of  coming therefore into their hall on the morrow an inorganic mass of six hundred individuals these commons deputies perceive without terror that they have it all to themselves their hall is also the grand or general hall for all the three orders but the noblesse and clergy it would seem have retired to their two separate apartments or halls and are there verifying their powers not in a conjoint but in a separate capacity they are to constitute two separate perhaps separatelyvoting orders then it is as if both noblesse and clergy had silently taken for granted that they already were such two orders against one and so the third order to be left in a perpetual minority  much may remain unfixed but the negative of that is a thing fixed in the slouchhatted heads in the french nations head double representation and all else hitherto gained were otherwise futile null doubtless the powers must be verifieddoubtless the commission the electoral documents of your deputy must be inspected by his brother deputies and found valid it is the preliminary of all neither is this question of doing it separately or doing it conjointly a vital one but if it lead to such it must be resisted wise was that maxim resist the beginnings nay were resistance unadvisable even dangerous yet surely pause is very natural pause with twentyfive millions behind you may become resistance enoughthe inorganic mass of commons deputies will restrict itself to a system of inertia and for the present remain inorganic  such method recommendable alike to sagacity and to timidity do the commons deputies adopt and not without adroitness and with ever more tenacity they persist in it day after day week after week for six weeks their history is of the kind named barren which indeed as philosophy knows is often the fruitfulest of all these were their still creationdays wherein they sat incubating in fact what they did was to do nothing in a judicious manner daily the inorganic body reassembles regrets that they cannot get organisation verification of powers in common and begin regenerating france headlong motions may be made but let such be repressed inertia alone is at once unpunishable and unconquerable  cunning must be met by cunning proud pretension by inertia by a low tone of patriotic sorrow low but incurable unalterable wise as serpents harmless as doves what a spectacle for france six hundred inorganic individuals essential for its regeneration and salvation sit there on their elliptic benches longing passionately towards life in painful durance like souls waiting to be born speeches are spoken eloquent audible within doors and without mind agitates itself against mind the nation looks on with ever deeper interest thus do the commons deputies sit incubating  there are private conclaves supperparties consultations breton club club of viroflay germs of many clubs wholly an element of confused noise dimness angry heatwherein however the erosegg kept at the fit temperature may hover safe unbroken till it be hatched in your mouniers malouets lechapeliers in science sufficient for that fervour in your barnaves rabauts at times shall come an inspiration from royal mirabeau he is nowise yet recognised as royal nay he was groaned at when his name was first mentioned but he is struggling towards recognition  in the course of the week the commons having called their eldest to the chair and furnished him with young strongerlunged assistantscan speak articulately and in audible lamentable words declare as we said that they are an inorganic body longing to become organic letters arrive but an inorganic body cannot open letters they lie on the table unopened the eldest may at most procure for himself some kind of list or musterroll to take the votes by and wait what will betide noblesse and clergy are all elsewhere however an eager public crowds all galleries and vacancies which is some comfort with effort it is determined not that a deputation shall be sentfor how can an inorganic body send deputationsbut that certain individual commons members shall in an accidental way stroll into the clergy chamber and then into the noblesse one and mention there as a thing they have happened to observe that the commons seem to be sitting waiting for them in order to verify their powers that is the wiser method  the clergy among whom are such a multitude of undignified of mere commons in curates frocks depute instant respectful answer that they are and will now more than ever be in deepest study as to that very matter contrariwise the noblesse in cavalier attitude reply after four days that they for their part are all verified and constituted which they had trusted the commons also were such separate verification being clearly the proper constitutional wisdomofancestors methodas they the noblesse will have much pleasure in demonstrating by a commission of their number if the commons will meet them commission against commission directly in the rear of which comes a deputation of clergy reiterating in their insidious conciliatory way the same proposal here then is a complexity what will wise commons say to this  warily inertly the wise commons considering that they are if not a french third estate at least an aggregate of individuals pretending to some title of that kind determine after talking on it five days to name such a commissionthough as it were with proviso not to be convinced a sixth day is taken up in naming it a seventh and an eighth day in getting the forms of meeting place hour and the like settled so that it is not till the evening of the 23rd of may that noblesse commission first meets commons commission clergy acting as conciliators and begins the impossible task of convincing it one other meeting on the 25th will suffice the commons are inconvincible the noblesse and clergy irrefragably convincing the commissions retire each order persisting in its first pretensions reported debates 6th may to 1st june 1789 in histoire parlementaire i 379422  thus have three weeks passed for three weeks the thirdestate carroccio with farseen gonfalon has stood stockstill flouting the wind

there is talk of a whole hundred and fortynine of them about to desert in mass and only restrained by an archbishop of paris it seems a losing game  but judge if france if paris sat idle all this while addresses from far and near flow in for our commons have now grown organic enough to open letters or indeed to cavil at them thus poor marquis de breze supreme usher master of ceremonies or whatever his title was writing about this time on some ceremonial matter sees no harm in winding up with a monsieur yours with sincere attachmentto whom does it address itself this sincere attachment inquires mirabeau to the dean of the tiersetatthere is no man in france entitled to write that rejoins he whereat the galleries and the world will not be kept from applauding moniteur in histoire parlementaire i 405 poor de breze these commons have a still older grudge at him nor has he yet done with them  in another way mirabeau has had to protest against the quick suppression of his newspaper journal of the statesgeneraland to continue it under a new name in which act of valour the paris electors still busy redacting their cahier could not but support him by address to his majesty they claim utmost provisory freedom of the press they have spoken even about demolishing the bastille and erecting a bronze patriot king on the sitethese are the rich burghers but now consider how it went for example with such loose miscellany now all grown eleutheromaniac of loungers prowlers social nondescripts and the distilled rascality of our planet as whirls forever in the palais

with a sublime inertia of sorrow reduced to busy themselves with their internal police surer position no deputies ever occupied if they keep it with skill let not the temperature rise too high break not the erosegg till it be hatched till it break itself an eager public crowds all galleries and vacancies cannot be restrained from applauding the two privileged orders the noblesse all verified and constituted may look on with what face they will not without a secret tremor of heart the clergy always acting the part of conciliators make a clutch at the galleries and the popularity there and miss it deputation of them arrives with dolorous message about the dearth of grains and the necessity there is of casting aside vain formalities and deliberating on this an insidious proposal which however the commons moved thereto by seagreen robespierre dexterously accept as a sort of hint or even pledge that the clergy will forthwith come over to them constitute the statesgeneral and so cheapen grains bailly memoires i 114finally on the 27th day of may mirabeau judging the time now nearly come proposes that the inertia cease that leaving the noblesse to their own stiff ways the clergy be summoned in the name of the god of peace to join the commons and begin histoire parlementaire i 413 to which summons if they turn a deaf earwe shall see are not one hundred and fortynine of them ready

but can they conjure this necker himself were now welcome could he interfere to purpose  let necker interfere then and in the kings name happily that incendiary godofpeace message is not yet answered the three orders shall again have conferences under this patriot minister of theirs somewhat may be healed clouted upwe meanwhile getting forward swiss regiments and a hundred pieces of fieldartillery this is what the oeildeboeuf for its part resolves on  but as for neckeralas poor necker thy obstinate third estate has one firstlast word verification in common as the pledge of voting and deliberating in common halfway proposals from such a tried friend they answer with a stare the tardy conferences speedily break up the third estate now ready and resolute the whole world backing it

422478  and so the commons deputies are at last on their own strength getting under way instead of chairman or dean they have now got a president astronomer bailly under way with a vengeance with endless vociferous and temperate eloquence borne on newspaper wings to all lands they have now on this 17th day of june determined that their name is not third estate butnational assembly they then are the nation triumvirate of princes queen refractory noblesse and clergy what then are you a most deep questionscarcely answerable in living political dialects  all regardless of which our new national assembly proceeds to appoint a committee of subsistences dear to france though it can find little or no grain next as if our national assembly stood quite firm on its legsto appoint four other standing committees then to settle the security of the national debt then that of the annual taxation all within eightandforty hours at such rate of velocity it is going the conjurors of the oeildeboeuf may well ask themselves whither    chapter 15ii  mercury de breze  now surely were the time for a god from the machine there is a nodus worthy of one the only question is which god shall it be mars de broglie with his hundred pieces of cannonnot yet answers prudence so soft irresolute is king louis let it be messenger mercury our supreme usher de breze  on the morrow which is the 20th

in this dexterous way and reduced to do nothing not even to meet or articulately lamenttill majesty with seance royale and new miracles be ready in this manner shall de breze as mercury ex machina intervene and if the oeildeboeuf mistake not work deliverance from the nodus  of poor de breze we can remark that he has yet prospered in none of his dealings with these commons five weeks ago when they kissed the hand of majesty the mode he took got nothing but censure and then his sincere attachment how was it scornfully whiffed aside before supper this night he writes to president bailly a new letter to be delivered shortly after dawn tomorrow in the kings name which letter however bailly in the pride of office will merely crush together into his pocket like a bill he does not mean to pay  accordingly on saturday morning the 20th of june shrillsounding heralds proclaim through the streets of versailles that there is to be a seance royale next monday and no meeting of the statesgeneral till then and yet we observe president bailly in sound of this and with de brezes letter in his pocket is proceeding with national assembly at his heels to the accustomed salles des menus as if de breze and heralds were mere wind it is shut this salle occupied by gardes francaises where is your captain the captain shows his royal order workmen he is grieved to say are all busy setting up the platform for his majestys seance most unfortunately no admission admission at furthest for president and secretaries to bring away papers which the joiners might destroypresident bailly enters with secretaries and returns bearing papers alas within doors instead of patriotic eloquence there is now no noise but hammering sawing and operative screeching and rumbling a profanation without parallel  the deputies stand grouped on the paris road on this umbrageous avenue de versailles complaining aloud of the indignity done them courtiers it is supposed look from their windows and giggle the morning is none of the comfortablest raw it is even drizzling a little bailly memoires i 185206 but all travellers pause patriot gallerymen miscellaneous spectators increase the groups wild counsels alternate some desperate deputies propose to go and hold session on the great outer staircase at marly under the kings windows for his majesty it seems has driven over thither others talk of making the chateau forecourt what they call place darmes a runnymede and new champ de mai of free frenchmen nay of awakening to sounds of indignant patriotism the echoes of the oeildeboeuf itselfnotice is given that president bailly aided by judicious guillotin and others has found place in the tenniscourt of the rue st francois thither in longdrawn files hoarsejingling like cranes on wing the commons deputies angrily wend  strange sight was this in the rue st francois vieux versailles a naked tenniscourt as the pictures of that time still give it four walls naked except aloft some poor wooden penthouse or roofed spectatorsgallery hanging round themon the floor not now an idle teeheeing a snapping of balls and rackets but the bellowing din of an indignant national representation scandalously exiled hither however a cloud of witnesses looks down on them from wooden penthouse from walltop from adjoining roof and chimney rolls towards them from all quarters with passionate spoken blessings some table can be procured to write on some chair if not to sit on then to stand on the secretaries undo their tapes bailly has constituted the assembly  experienced mounier not wholly new to such things in parlementary revolts which he has seen or heard of thinks that it were well in these lamentable threatening circumstances to unite themselves by an oathuniversal acclamation as from smouldering bosoms getting vent the oath is redacted pronounced aloud by president baillyand indeed in such a sonorous tone that the cloud of witnesses even outdoors hear it and bellow response to it six hundred righthands rise with president baillys to take god above to witness that they will not separate for man below but will meet in all places under all circumstances wheresoever two or three can get together till they have made the constitution made the constitution friends that is a long task six hundred hands meanwhile will sign as they have sworn six hundred save one one loyalist abdiel still visible by this sole lightpoint and nameable poor m martin dauch from castelnaudary in languedoc him they permit to sign or signify refusal they even save him from the cloud of witnesses by declaring his head deranged at four oclock the signatures are all appended new meeting is fixed for monday morning earlier than the hour of the royal session that our hundred and fortynine clerical deserters be not balked we shall meet at the recollets church or elsewhere in hope that our hundred and fortynine will join usand now it is time to go to dinner  this then is the session of the tenniscourt famed seance du jeu de paume the fame of which has gone forth to all lands this is mercurius de brezes appearance as deus ex machina this is the fruit it brings the giggle of courtiers in the versailles avenue has already died into gaunt silence did the distracted court with gardesdessceaux barentin triumvirate and company imagine that they could scatter six hundred national deputies big with a national constitution like as much barndoor poultry big with next to nothingby the white or black rod of a supreme usher barndoor poultry fly cackling but national deputies turn round lionfaced and with uplifted righthand swear an oath that makes the four corners of france tremble  president bailly has covered himself with honour which shall become rewards the national assembly is now doubly and trebly the nations assembly not militant martyred only but triumphant insulted and which could not be insulted paris disembogues itself once more to witness with grim looks the seance royale see arthur young travels i 115118 a lameth c which by a new felicity is postponed till tuesday the hundred and fortynine and even with bishops among them all in processional mass have had free leisure to march off and solemnly join the commons sitting waiting in their church the commons welcomed them with shouts with embracings nay with tears dumont souvenirs sur mirabeau c 4 for it is growing a lifeanddeath matter now  as for the seance itself the carpenters seem to have accomplished their platform but all else remains unaccomplished futile we may say fatal was the whole matter king louis enters through seas of people all grimsilent angry with many thingsfor it is a bitter rain too enters to a third estate likewise grimsilent which has been wetted waiting under mean porches at backdoors while court and privileged were entering by the front king and gardedessceaux there is no necker visible make known not without longwindedness the determinations of the royal breast the three orders shall vote separately on the other hand france may look for considerable constitutional blessings as specified in these fiveandthirty articles histoire parlementaire i 13 which gardedessceaux is waxing hoarse with reading which fiveandthirty articles adds his majesty again rising if the three orders most unfortunately cannot agree together to effect them i myself will effect seul je ferai le bien de mes peupleswhich being interpreted may signify you contentious deputies of the statesgeneral have probably not long to be here but in fine all shall now withdraw for this day and meet again each order in its separate place tomorrow morning for despatch of business this is the determination of the royal breast pithy and clear and herewith king retinue noblesse majority of clergy file out as if the whole matter were satisfactorily completed  these file out through grimsilent seas of people only the commons deputies file not out but stand there in gloomy silence uncertain what they shall do one man of them is certain one man of them discerns and dares it is now that king mirabeau starts to the tribune and lifts up his lionvoice verily a word in season for in such scenes the moment is the mother of ages had not gabriel honore been thereone can well fancy how the commons deputies affrighted at the perils which now yawned dim all round them and waxing ever paler in each others paleness might very naturally one after one have glided off and the whole course of european history have been different  but he is there list to

lions voice roars loudest what apparition is this apparition of mercurius de breze muttering somewhatspeak out cry severalmessieurs shrills de breze repeating himself you have heard the kings ordersmirabeau glares on him with fireflashing face shakes the black lions mane yes monsieur we have heard what the king was advised to say and you who cannot be the interpreter of his orders to the statesgeneral you who have neither place nor right of speech here you are not the man to remind us of it go monsieur tell these who sent you that we are here by the will of the people and that nothing shall send us hence but the force of bayonets moniteur hist parl ii 22 and poor de breze shivers forth from the national assemblyand also if it be not in one faintest glimmer months later finally from the page of history  hapless de breze doomed to survive long ages in mens memory in this faint way with tremulent white rod he was true to etiquette which was his faith here below a martyr to respect of persons short woollen cloaks could not kiss majestys hand as long velvet ones did nay lately when the poor little dauphin lay dead and some ceremonial visitation came was he not punctual to announce it even to the dauphins dead body monseigneur a deputation of the statesgeneral montgaillard ii 38 sunt lachrymae rerum  but what does the oeildeboeuf now when de breze shivers back thither despatch that same force of bayonets not so the seas of people still hang multitudinous intent on what is passing nay rush and roll loudbillowing into the courts of the chateau itself for a report has risen that necker is to be dismissed worst of all the gardes francaises seem indisposed to act two companies of them do not fire when ordered histoire parlementaire ii 26 necker for not being at the seance shall be shouted for carried home in triumph and must not be dismissed his grace of paris on the other hand has to fly with broken coachpanels and owe his life to furious driving the

take down the platform ineffectual shift in few instants the very carpenters cease wrenching and knocking at their platform stand on it hammer in hand and listen openmouthed histoire parlementaire ii

unseemly soot poor triumvirate poor queen and above all poor queens husband who means well had he any fixed meaning folly is that wisdom which is wise only behindhand few months ago these thirtyfive concessions had filled france with a rejoicing which might have lasted for several years now it is unavailing the very mention of it slighted majestys express orders set at nought  all france is in a roar a sea of persons estimated at ten thousand whirls all this day in the palais royal arthur young i 119 the remaining clergy and likewise some fortyeight noblesse dorleans among them have now forthwith gone over to the victorious commons by whom as is natural they are received with acclamation  the third estate triumphs versailles town shouting round it ten thousand whirling all day in the palais royal and all france standing atiptoe not unlike whirling let the oeildeboeuf look to it as for king louis he will swallow his injuries will temporise keep silence will at all costs have present peace it was tuesday the 23d of june when he spoke that peremptory royal mandate and the week is not done till he has written to the remaining obstinate noblesse that they also must oblige him and give in despremenil rages his last barrel mirabeau breaks his sword making a vowwhich he might as well have kept the triple family is now therefore complete the third erring brother the noblesse having joined iterring but pardonable soothed so far as possible by sweet eloquence from president bailly  so triumphs the third estate and statesgeneral are become national assembly and all france may sing te deum by wise inertia and wise cessation of inertia great victory has been gained it is the last night of june all night you meet nothing on the streets of versailles but men running with torches with shouts of jubilation from the 2nd of may when they kissed the hand of majesty to this 30th of june when men run with torches we count seven weeks complete for seven weeks the national

and forging what may be needful be it billets of a new national bank munitions of war or things forever inscrutable to men  accordingly what means this apparatus of troops the national assembly can get no furtherance for its committee of subsistences can hear only that at paris the bakers shops are besieged that in the provinces people are living on mealhusks and boiled grass but on all highways

what means it  shall eight or even shall twelve deputies our mirabeaus barnaves at the head of them be whirled suddenly to the castle of ham the rest ignominiously dispersed to the winds no national assembly can make the constitution with cannon levelled on it from the queens mews what means this reticence of the oeildeboeuf broken only by nods and shrugs in the mystery of that cloudy ida what is it that they forge and shapesuch questions must distracted patriotism keep asking and receive no answer but an echo  enough of themselves but now above all while the hungry foodyear which runs from august to august is getting older becoming more and more a famineyear with mealhusks and boiled grass brigands may actually collect and in crowds at farm and mansion howl angrily food food it is in vain to send soldiers against them at sight of soldiers they disperse they vanish as under ground then directly reassemble elsewhere for new tumult and plunder frightful enough to look upon but what to hear of reverberated through twentyfive millions of suspicious minds brigands and broglie open conflagration preternatural rumour are driving mad most hearts in france what will the issue of these things be  at marseilles many weeks ago the townsmen have taken arms for suppressing of brigands and other purposes the military commandant may make of it what he will elsewhere everywhere could not the like be done dubious on the distracted patriot imagination wavers as a last deliverance some foreshadow of a national guard but conceive above all the wooden tent in the palais royal a universal

nor mans  for example the world may have heard how at bethune lately when there rose some riot about grains of which sort there are so many and the soldiers stood drawn out and the word fire was givennot a trigger stirred only the butts of all muskets rattled angrily against the ground and the soldiers stood glooming with a mixed expression of countenancetill clutched each under the arm of a patriot householder they were all hurried off in this manner to be treated and caressed and have their pay increased by subscription histoire parlementaire  neither have the gardes francaises the best regiment of the line shown any promptitude for streetfiring lately they returned grumbling from reveillons and have not burnt a single cartridge since nay as we saw not even when bid a dangerous humour dwells in these gardes notable men too in their way valadi the pythagorean was at one time an officer of theirs nay in the ranks under the threecornered felt and cockade what hard heads may there not be and reflections going onunknown to the public one head of the hardest we do now discern there on the shoulders of a certain sergeant hoche lazare hoche that is the name of him he used to be about the versailles royal stables nephew of a poor herbwoman a handy lad exceedingly addicted to reading he is now sergeant hoche and can rise no farther he lays out his pay in rushlights and cheap editions of books dictionnaire des hommes marquans londres paris 1800 ii 198  on the whole the best seems to be consign these gardes francaises to their barracks so besenval thinks and orders consigned to their barracks the gardes francaises do but form a secret association an engagement not to act against the national assembly debauched by valadi the pythagorean debauched by money and women cry besenval and innumerable others debauched by what you will or in need of no debauching behold them long files of them their consignment broken arrive headed by their sergeants on the 26th day of june at the palais royal welcomed with vivats with presents and a pledge of patriot liquor embracing and embraced declaring in words that the cause of france is their cause next day and the following days the like what is singular too except this patriot humour and breaking of their consignment they behave otherwise with the most rigorous accuracy besenval iii 3946  they are growing questionable these gardes eleven ringleaders of them are put in the abbaye prison it boots not in the least the imprisoned eleven have only by the hand of an individual to drop towards nightfall a

unhappily as we said they could see nothing pride which goes before a fall wrath if not reasonable yet pardonable most natural had hardened their hearts and heated their heads so with imbecility and

revolution shall mean for strictly considered they may have as many meanings as there are speakers of them all things are in revolution in change from moment to moment which becomes sensible from epoch to epoch in this timeworld of ours there is properly nothing else but revolution and mutation and even nothing else conceivable revolution you answer means speedier change whereupon one has still to ask how speedy at what degree of speed in what particular points of this variable course which varies in velocity but can never stop till time itself stops does revolution begin and end cease to be ordinary mutation and again become such it is a thing that will depend on definition more or less arbitrary  for ourselves we answer that french revolution means here the open violent rebellion and victory of disimprisoned anarchy against corrupt wornout authority how anarchy breaks prison bursts up from the infinite deep and rages uncontrollable immeasurable enveloping a world in phasis after phasis of feverfrenzytill the frenzy burning itself out and what elements of new order it held since all force holds such developing themselves the uncontrollable be got if not reimprisoned yet harnessed and its mad forces made to work towards their object as sane regulated ones for as hierarchies and dynasties of all kinds theocracies aristocracies autocracies strumpetocracies have ruled over the world so it was appointed in the decrees of providence that this same victorious anarchy jacobinism sansculottism french revolution horrors of french revolution or what else mortals name it should have its turn the destructive wrath of sansculottism this is what we speak having unhappily no voice for singing  surely a great phenomenon nay it is a transcendental one overstepping all rules and experience the crowning phenomenon of our modern time for here again most unexpectedly comes antique fanaticism in new and newest vesture miraculous as all fanaticism is call it the fanaticism of making away with formulas de humer les formulas the world of formulas the formed regulated world which all habitable world ismust needs hate such fanaticism like death and be at deadly variance with it the world of formulas must conquer it or failing that must die execrating it anathematising itcan nevertheless in nowise prevent its being and its having been the anathemas are there and the miraculous thing is there  whence it cometh whither it goeth these are questions when the age of miracles lay faded into the distance as an incredible tradition and even the age of conventionalities was now old and mans existence had for long generations rested on mere formulas which were grown hollow by course of time and it seemed as if no reality any longer existed but only phantasms of realities and gods universe were the work of the tailor and upholsterer mainly and men were buckram masks that went about becking and grimacing thereon a sudden the earth yawns asunder and amid tartarean smoke and glare of fierce brightness rises sansculottism manyheaded firebreathing and asks what think ye of me well may the buckram masks start together terrorstruck into expressive wellconcerted groups it is indeed friends a most singular most fatal thing let whosoever is but buckram and a phantasm look to it ill verily may it fare with him here methinks he cannot much longer be wo also to many a one who is not wholly buckram but partially real and human the age of miracles has come back behold the worldphoenix in fireconsummation and firecreation wide are her fanning wings loud is her deathmelody of battlethunders and falling towns skyward lashes the funeral flame enveloping all things it is the deathbirth of a world  whereby however as we often say shall one unspeakable blessing seem attainable this namely that man and his life rest no more on hollowness and a lie but on solidity and some kind of truth welcome the beggarliest truth so it be one in exchange for the royallest sham truth of any kind breeds ever new and better truth thus hard granite rock will crumble down into soil under the blessed skyey influences and cover itself with verdure with fruitage and umbrage but as for falsehood which in like contrary manner grows ever falserwhat can it or what should it do but decease being ripe decompose itself gently or even violently and return to the father of ittoo probably in flames of fire  sansculottism will burn much but what is incombustible it will not burn fear not sansculottism recognise it for what it is the portentous inevitable end of much the miraculous beginning of much one other thing thou mayest understand of it that it too came from god for has it not been from of old as it is written are his goings forth in the great deep of things fearful and wonderful now as in the beginning in the whirlwind also he speaks and the wrath of men is made to praise himbut to gauge and measure this immeasurable thing and what is called account for it and reduce it to a dead logicformula attempt not much less shalt thou shriek thyself hoarse cursing it for that to all needful lengths has been already done as an actually existing son of time look with unspeakable manifold interest oftenest in silence at what the time did bring therewith edify instruct nourish thyself or were it but to amuse and gratify thyself as it is given thee  another question which at every new turn will rise on us requiring ever new reply is this where the french revolution specially is in the kings palace in his majestys or her majestys managements and maltreatments cabals imbecilities and woes answer some fewwhom we do not answer in the national assembly answer a large mixed multitude who accordingly seat themselves in the reporters chair and therefrom noting what proclamations acts reports passages of logicfence bursts of parliamentary eloquence seem notable within doors and what tumults and rumours of tumult become audible from withoutproduce volume on volume and naming it history of the french revolution contentedly publish the same to do the like to almost any extent with so many filed newspapers choix des rapports histoires parlementaires as there are amounting to many horseloads were easy for us easy but unprofitable the national assembly named now constituent assembly goes its course making the constitution but the french revolution also goes its course  in general may we not say that the french revolution lies in the heart and head of every violentspeaking of every violentthinking french man how the twentyfive millions of such in their perplexed combination acting and counteracting may give birth to events which event successively is the cardinal one and from what point of vision it may best be surveyed this is a problem which problem the best insight seeking light from all possible sources shifting its point of vision whithersoever vision or glimpse of vision can be had may employ itself in solving and be well content to solve in some tolerably approximate way  as to the national assembly in so far as it still towers eminent over france after the manner of a carborne carroccio though now no longer in the van and rings signals for retreat or for advanceit is and continues a reality among other realities but in so far as it sits making the constitution on the other hand it is a fatuity and chimera mainly alas in the never so heroic building of montesquieumably cardcastles though shouted over by the world what interest is there occupied in that way an august national assembly becomes for us little other than a sanhedrim of pedants not of the gerundgrinding yet of no fruitfuller sort and its loud debatings and recriminations about rights of man right of peace and war veto suspensif veto absolu what are they but so many pedantscurses may god confound you for your theory of irregular verbs  a constitution can be built constitutions enough a la sieyes but the frightful difficulty is that of getting men to come and live in them could sieyes have drawn thunder and lightning out of heaven to sanction his constitution it had been well but without any thunder nay strictly considered is it not still true that without some such celestial sanction given visibly in thunder or invisibly otherwise no constitution can in the long run be worth much more than the wastepaper it is written on the constitution the set of laws or prescribed habits of acting that men will live under is the one which images their convictionstheir faith as to this wondrous universe and what rights duties capabilities they have there which stands sanctioned therefore by necessity itself if not by a seen deity then by an unseen one other laws whereof there are always enough readymade are usurpations which men do not obey but rebel against and abolish by their earliest convenience  the question of questions accordingly were who is it that especially for rebellers and abolishers can make a constitution he that can image forth the general belief when there is one that can impart one when as here there is none a most rare man ever as of old a godmissioned man here however in defect of such transcendent supreme man time with its infinite succession of merely superior men each yielding his little contribution does much force likewise for as antiquarian philosophers teach the royal sceptre was from the first something of a hammer to crack such heads as could not be convinced will all along find somewhat to do and thus in perpetual abolition and reparation rending and mending with struggle and strife with present evil and the hope and effort towards future good must the constitution as all human things do build itself forward or unbuild itself and sink as it can and may o sieyes and ye other committeemen and twelve hundred miscellaneous individuals from all parts of france what is the belief of france and yours if ye knew it properly that there shall be no belief that all formulas be swallowed the constitution which will suit that alas too clearly a noconstitution an anarchywhich also in due season shall be vouchsafed you  but after all what can an unfortunate national assembly do consider only this that there are twelve hundred miscellaneous individuals not a unit of whom but has his own thinkingapparatus his own speakingapparatus in every unit of them is some belief and wish different for each both that france should be regenerated and also that he individually should do it twelve hundred separate forces yoked miscellaneously to any object miscellaneously to all sides of it and bid pull for life  or is it the nature of national assemblies generally to do with endless labour and clangour nothing are representative governments mostly at bottom tyrannies too shall we say the tyrants the ambitious contentious persons from all corners of the country do in this manner get gathered into one place and there with motion and countermotion with jargon and hubbub cancel one another like the fabulous kilkenny cats and produce for netresult zerothe country meanwhile governing or guiding itself by such wisdom recognised or for most part unrecognised as may exist in individual heads here and therenay even that were a great improvement for of old with their guelf factions and ghibelline factions with their red roses and white roses they were wont to cancel the whole country as well besides they do it now in a much narrower cockpit within the four walls of their assembly house and here and there an outpost of hustings and barrelheads do it with tongues too not with swordsall which improvements in the art of producing zero are they not great nay best of all some happy continents as the western one with its savannahs where whosoever has four willing limbs finds food under his feet and an infinite sky over his head can do without governingwhat sphinxquestions which the distracted world in these very generations must answer or die    chapter 16ii  the constituent assembly  one thing an elected assembly of twelve hundred is fit for destroying which indeed is but a more decided exercise of its natural talent for doing nothing do nothing only keep agitating debating and things will destroy themselves  so and not otherwise proved it with an august national assembly it took the name constituent as if its mission and function had been to construct or build which also with its whole soul it endeavoured to do yet in the fates in the nature of things there lay for it precisely of all functions the most opposite to that singular what gospels men will believe even gospels according to jean jacques it was the fixed faith of these national deputies as of all thinking frenchmen that the constitution could be made that they there and then were called to make it how with the toughness of old hebrews or ishmaelite moslem did the otherwise light unbelieving people persist in this their credo quia impossibile and front the armed world with it and grow fanatic and even heroic and do exploits by it the constituent assemblys constitution and several others will being printed and not manuscript survive to future generations as an instructive wellnigh incredible document of the time the most significant picture of the then existing france or at lowest picture of these mens picture of it  but in truth and seriousness what could the national assembly have done the thing to be done was actually as they said to regenerate france to abolish the old france and make a new one quietly or forcibly by concession or by violence this by the law of nature has become inevitable with what degree of violence depends on the wisdom of those that preside over it with perfect wisdom on the part of the national assembly it had all been otherwise but whether in any wise it could have been pacific nay other than bloody and convulsive may still be a question  grant meanwhile that this constituent assembly does to the last continue to be something with a sigh it sees itself incessantly forced away from its infinite divine task of perfecting the theory of irregular verbsto finite terrestrial tasks which latter have still a significance for us it is the cynosure of revolutionary france this national assembly all work of government has fallen into its hands or under its control all men look to it for guidance in the middle of that huge revolt of twentyfive millions it hovers always aloft as carroccio or battlestandard impelling and impelled in the most confused way if it cannot give much guidance it will still seem to give some it emits pacificatory proclamations not a few with more or with less result it authorises the enrolment of national guardslest brigands come to devour us and reap the unripe crops it sends missions to quell effervescences to deliver men from the lanterne it can listen to congratulatory addresses which arrive daily by the sackful mostly in king cambyses vein also to petitions and complaints from all mortals so that every mortals complaint if it cannot get redressed may at least hear itself complain for the rest an august national assembly can produce parliamentary eloquence and appoint committees committees of the constitution of reports of researches and of much else which again yield mountains of printed paper the theme of new parliamentary eloquence in bursts or in plenteous smoothflowing floods and so from the waste vortex whereon all things go whirling and grinding organic laws or the similitude of such slowly emerge  with endless debating we get the rights of man written down and promulgated true paper basis of all paper constitutions neglecting cry the opponents to declare the duties of man forgetting answer we to ascertain the mights of manone of the fatalest omissionsnay sometimes as on the fourth of august our national assembly fired suddenly by an almost preternatural enthusiasm will get through whole masses of work in one night a memorable night this fourth of august dignitaries temporal and spiritual peers archbishops parlementpresidents each outdoing the other in patriotic devotedness come successively to throw their untenable possessions on the altar of the fatherland with louder and louder vivats for indeed it is after dinner toothey abolish tithes seignorial dues gabelle excessive preservation of game nay privilege immunity feudalism root and branch then appoint a te deum for it and so finally disperse about three in the morning striking the stars with their sublime heads such night unforeseen but for ever memorable was this of the fourth of august 1789 miraculous or semimiraculous some seem to think it a new night of pentecost shall we say shaped according to the new time and new church of jean jacques rousseau it had its causes also its effects  in such manner labour the national deputies perfecting their theory of irregular verbs governing france and being governed by it with toil and noisecutting asunder ancient intolerable bonds and for new ones assiduously spinning ropes of sand were their labours a nothing or a something yet the eyes of all france being reverently fixed on them history can never very long leave them altogether out of sight  for the present if we glance into that assembly hall of theirs it will be found as is natural most irregular as

16iv  in queue  if we look now at paris one thing is too evident that the bakers shops have got their queues or tails their long strings of purchasers arranged in tail so that the first come be the first servedwere the shop once open this waiting in tail not seen since the early days of july again makes its appearance in august in time we shall see it perfected by practice to the rank almost of an art and the art or quasiart of standing in tail become one of the characteristics of the parisian people distinguishing them from all other peoples whatsoever  but consider while work itself is so scarce how a man must not only realise money but stand waiting if his wife is too weak to wait and struggle for half days in the tail till he get it changed for dear bad bread controversies to the length sometimes of blood and battery must arise in these exasperated queues or if no controversy then it is but one accordant pange lingua of complaint against the powers that be france has begun her long curriculum of hungering instructive and productive beyond academic curriculums which extends over some seven most strenuous years as jean paul says of his own life to a great height shall the

then what was pearl in camille or others may be seen as such and continue as such  nor has public speaking declined though lafayette and his patrols look sour on it loud always is the palais royal loudest the cafe de foy such a miscellany of citizens and citizenesses circulating there now and then according to camille some citizens employ the liberty of the press for a private purpose so that this or the other patriot finds himself short of his watch or pockethandkerchief but for the rest in camilles opinion nothing can be a livelier image of the roman forum a patriot proposes his motion

there is in it slow regular growth though this also ends in death is what we name health and sanity  a sansculottism which has prostrated bastilles which has got pike and musket and now goes burning

element it is in one might expect the rapidity and monstrosity would be extreme  many things too especially all diseased things grow by shoots and fits the first grand fit and shooting forth of sansculottism with that of paris conquering its king for baillys figure of rhetoric was alltoo sad a reality the king is conquered going at large on his parole on condition say of absolutely good behaviourwhich in these circumstances will unhappily mean no behaviour whatever a quite untenable position that of majesty put on its good behaviour alas is it not natural that whatever lives try to keep itself living whereupon his majestys behaviour will soon become exceptionable and so the second grand fit of sansculottism that of putting him in durance cannot be distant  necker in the national assembly is making moan as usual about his deficit barriers and customhouses burnt the taxgatherer hunted not hunting his majestys exchequer all but empty the remedy is a loan of thirty millions then

jewels to a considerable extent has been solemnly made by certain parisian women and solemnly accepted with honourable mention whom forthwith all the world takes to imitating and emulating patriotic gifts always with some heroic eloquence which the president must answer and the assembly listen to flow in from far and near in such number that the honourable mention can only be performed in lists

yearly revenue for this once only be paid down so shall a national assembly make the constitution undistracted at least by insolvency their own wages as settled on the 17th of august are but eighteen francs a day each man but the public service must have sinews must have money to appease the deficit not to combler or choke the deficit if you or mortal could for withal as mirabeau was heard saying it is the deficit that saves us  towards the end of august our national assembly in its constitutional labours has got so far as the question of veto shall majesty have a veto on the national enactments or not have a veto what speeches were spoken within doors and without clear and also passionate logic imprecations comminations gone happily for most part to limbo through the cracked brain and uncracked lungs of sainthuruge the palais royal rebellows with veto journalism is busy france rings with veto i shall never forget says dumont my going to paris one of these days with mirabeau and the crowd of people we found waiting for his carriage about le jay the booksellers shop they flung themselves before him conjuring him with tears in their eyes not to suffer the veto absolu they were

and look into it not leave your wives and daughters to be starved murdered and worsepeace women the heart of man is bitter and heavy patriotism driven out by patrollotism knows not what to resolve on  the truth is the oeildeboeuf has rallied to a certain unknown extent a changed oeildeboeuf with versailles national guards in their tricolor cockades doing duty there a court all flaring with tricolor yet even to a tricolor court men will rally ye loyal hearts burntout seigneurs rally round your queen with wishes which will produce hopes which will produce attempts  for indeed selfpreservation being such a law of nature what can a rallied court do but attempt and endeavour or call it plotwith such wisdom and unwisdom as it has they will fly escorted to metz where brave bouille commands they will raise the royal standard the bondsignatures shall become armed men were not the king so languid their bond if at all signed must be signed without his privityunhappy king he has but one resolution not to have a civil war for the rest he still hunts having ceased lockmaking he still dozes and digests is clay in the hands of the potter ill will it fare with him in a world where all is helping itself where as has been written whosoever is not hammer must be stithy and the very hyssop on the wall grows there in that chink because the whole universe could not prevent its growing  but as for the coming up of this regiment de flandre may it not be urged that there were sainthuruge petitions and continual mealmobs undebauched soldiers be there plot or only dim elements of a plot are always good did not the versailles municipality an old monarchic one not yet refounded into a democratic instantly second the proposal nay the very versailles national guard wearied with continual duty at the chateau did not object only draper lecointre who is now major lecointre shook his headyes friends surely it was natural this regiment de flandre should be sent for since it could be got it was natural that at sight of military bandoleers the heart of the rallied oeildeboeuf should revive and maids of honour and gentlemen of honour speak comfortable words to epauletted defenders and to one another natural also and mere common civility that the bodyguards a regiment of gentlemen should invite their flandre brethren to a dinner of welcomesuch invitation in the last days of september is given and accepted  dinners are defined as the ultimate act of communion men that can have communion in nothing else can sympathetically eat together can still rise into some glow of brotherhood over food and wine the dinner is fixed on for thursday the first of october and ought to have a fine effect further as such dinner may be rather extensive and even the noncommissioned and the common

asked his countrymen but you gualches what have you invented they can now answer the art of insurrection it was an art needed in these last singular times an art for which the french nature so full of vehemence so free from depth was perhaps of all others the fittest  accordingly to what a height one may well say of perfection has this branch of human industry been carried by france within the last halfcentury insurrection which lafayette thought might be the most sacred of duties ranks now for the french people among the duties which they can perform other mobs are dull masses which roll onwards with a dull fierce tenacity a dull fierce heat but emit no lightflashes of genius as they go the french mob again is among the liveliest phenomena of our world so rapid audacious so clearsighted inventive prompt to seize the moment instinct with life to its fingerends that talent were there no other of spontaneously standing in queue distinguishes as we said the french people from all peoples ancient and modern  let the reader confess too that taking one thing with another perhaps few terrestrial appearances are better worth considering than mobs your mob is a genuine outburst of nature issuing from or communicating with the deepest deep of nature when so much goes grinning and grimacing as a lifeless formality and under the stiff buckram no heart can be felt beating here once more if nowhere else is a sincerity and reality shudder at it or even shriek over it if thou must nevertheless consider it such a complex of human forces and individualities hurled forth in their transcendental mood to act and react on circumstances and on one another to work out what it is in them to work the thing they will do is known to no man least of all to themselves it is the inflammablest immeasurable firework generating consuming itself with what phases to what extent with what results it will burn off philosophy and perspicacity conjecture in vain  man as has been written is for ever interesting to man nay properly there is nothing else interesting in which light also may we not discern why most battles have become so wearisome battles in these ages are transacted by mechanism with the slightest possible developement of human individuality or spontaneity men now even die and kill one another in an artificial manner battles ever since homers time when they were fighting mobs have mostly ceased to be worth looking at worth reading of or remembering how many wearisome bloody battles does history strive to represent or even in a husky way to singand

than the women of paris scarcely was maillard gone when m de gouvions message to all the districts and such tocsin and drumming of the generale began to take effect armed national guards from every district especially the grenadiers of the centre who are our old gardes francaises arrive in quick sequence on the place de greve an immense people is there saintantoine with pike and rusty firelock is all crowding thither be it welcome or unwelcome the centre grenadiers are received with cheering it is not cheers that we want answer they gloomily the nation has been insulted to arms and come with us for orders ha sits the wind so patriotism and patrollotism are now one  the three hundred have assembled all the committees are in activity lafayette is dictating despatches for versailles when a deputation of the centre grenadiers introduces itself to him the deputation makes military obeisance and thus speaks not without a kind of thought in it mon general we are deputed by the six companies of grenadiers we do not think you a traitor but we think the government betrays you it is time that this end we cannot turn our bayonets against women crying to us for bread the people are miserable the source of the mischief is at versailles we must go seek the king and bring him to paris we must exterminate exterminer the regiment de flandre and the gardesducorps who have dared to trample on the national cockade if the king be too weak to wear his crown let him lay it down you will crown his son you will name a council of regency and all will go better deux amis iii 161 reproachful astonishment paints itself on the face of lafayette speaks itself from his eloquent chivalrous lips in vain my general we would shed the last drop of our blood for you but the root of the mischief is at versailles we must go and bring the king to paris all the people wish it tout le peuple le veut  my general descends to the outer staircase and harangues once more in vain to versailles

down the drizzly day tends westward the cry is still to versailles  nay now borne from afar come quite sinister cries hoarse reverberating in longdrawn hollow murmurs with syllables too like those of lanterne or else irregular sansculottism may be marching off of itself with pikes nay with cannon the inflexible scipio does at length by aidedecamp ask of the municipals whether or not he may go a letter is handed out to him over armed heads sixty thousand faces flash fixedly on his there is stillness and no bosom breathes till he have read by heaven he grows suddenly pale do the municipals permit permit and even ordersince he can no other clangour of approval rends the welkin to your ranks then let us march  it is as we compute towards three in the afternoon indignant national guards

matter had his own forebodings surely for these four weary hours he has reclined not on roses the order of the day is getting forward a deputation to his majesty seems proper that it might please him to grant acceptance pure and simple to those constitutionarticles of ours the mixed qualified acceptance with its peradventures is satisfactory to neither gods nor men  so much is clear and yet there is more which no man speaks which all men now vaguely understand disquietude absence of mind is on every face members whisper uneasily come and go the order of the day is evidently not the days want

usher maillard with a deputation of fifteen muddy dripping womenhaving by incredible industry and aid of all the macers persuaded the rest to wait out of doors national assembly shall now therefore look its august task directly in the face regenerative constitutionalism has an unregenerate sansculottism bodily in front of it crying bread bread  shifty maillard translating frenzy into articulation repressive with the one hand expostulative with the other does his best and really though not bred to public speaking manages rather wellin the present dreadful rarity of grains a deputation of female citizens has as the august assembly can discern come out from paris to petition plots of aristocrats are too evident in the matter for example one miller has been bribed by a banknote of 200 livres not to grindname unknown to the usher but fact provable at least indubitable further it seems the national cockade has been trampled on also there are black cockades or were all which things will not an august national assembly the hope of france take into its wise immediate consideration  and menadic hunger impressible crying black cockades crying bread bread adds after such fashion will it notyes messieurs if a deputation to his majesty for the acceptance pure and simple seemed properhow much more now for the afflicting situation of paris for the calming of this

on going with him has not his majesty himself looking from the window sent out to ask what we wanted bread and speech with the king du pain et parler au roi that was the answer twelve women are clamorously added to the deputation and march with it across the esplanade through dissipated groups caracoling bodyguards and the pouring rain  president mounier unexpectedly augmented by twelve

tricolor ones your buckskins are wet your hearts heavy go and return not  the bodyguards file off as we hint giving and receiving shots drawing no lifeblood leaving boundless indignation some three times in the thickening dusk a glimpse of them is seen at this or the other portal saluted always with execrations with the whew of lead let but a bodyguard shew face he is hunted by rascalityfor

by superior order the bodyguards all but the few on immediate duty disappear or as it were abscond and march under cloud of night to rambouillet weber ubi supra  we remark also that the versaillese have now got ammunition all afternoon the official person could find none till in these so critical moments a patriotic sublieutenant set a pistol to his ear and would thank him to find somewhich he thereupon succeeded in doing likewise that flandre disarmed by pallas athene says openly it will not fight with citizens and for token of peace has exchanged cartridges with the versaillese  sansculottism is now among mere friends and can circulate freely indignant at bodyguardscomplaining also considerably of hunger    chapter 17viii  the equal diet  but why lingers mounier returns not with his deputation it is six it is seven oclock and still no mounier no acceptance pure and simple  and behold the dripping menads not now in deputation but in mass have penetrated into the assembly to the shamefullest interruption of public speaking and order of the day neither maillard nor vicepresident can restrain them except within wide limits not even except for minutes can the lionvoice of mirabeau though they applaud it but ever and anon they break in upon the regeneration of france with cries of bread not so much discoursing du pain pas tant de longs discoursso insensible were these poor creatures to bursts of parliamentary eloquence  one learns also that the royal carriages are getting yoked as if for metz carriages royal or not have verily showed themselves at the back gates they even produced or quoted a written order from our versailles municipalitywhich is a monarchic not a democratic one however versailles patroles drove them in again as the vigilant lecointre had strictly charged them to do  a busy man truly is major lecointre in these hours for colonel destaing loiters invisible in the oeildeboeuf invisible or still more questionably visible for instants then also a too loyal municipality requires supervision no order civil or military taken about any of these thousand things lecointre is at the versailles townhall he is at the grate of the grand court communing with swiss and bodyguards he is in the ranks of flandre he is here he is there studious to prevent bloodshed to prevent the royal family from flying to metz the menads from plundering versailles  at the fall of night we behold him advance to those armed groups of saintantoine hovering alltoo grim near the salle des menus they receive him in a halfcircle twelve speakers behind cannons with lighted torches in hand the cannonmouths towards lecointre a picture for salvator he asks in temperate but courageous language what they by this their journey to versailles do specially want the twelve speakers reply in few words inclusive of much bread and the end of these brabbles du pain et la fin des affaires when the affairs will end no major lecointre nor no mortal can say but as to bread he inquires how many are youlearns that they are six hundred that a loaf each will suffice and rides off to the municipality to get six hundred loaves  which loaves however a municipality of monarchic temper will not give it will give two tons of rice rathercould you but know whether it should be boiled or raw nay when this too is accepted the municipals have disappearedducked under as the sixandtwenty longgowned of paris did and leaving not the smallest vestage of rice in the boiled or raw state they there vanish from history  rice comes not ones hope of food is baulked even ones hope of vengeance is not m de moucheton of the scotch company as we said deceitfully smuggled off failing all which behold only m de mouchetons slain warhorse lying on the esplanade there saintantoine baulked esurient pounces on the slain warhorse flays it roasts it with such fuel of paling gates portable timber as can be come atnot without shouting and after the manner of ancient greek heroes they lifted their hands to the daintily readied repast such as it might be weber deux amis c other rascality prowls discursive seeking what it may devour flandre will retire to its barracks lecointre also with his versailleseall but the vigilant patrols charged to be doubly vigilant  so sink the shadows of night blustering rainy and all paths grow dark strangest night ever seen in these regionsperhaps since the bartholomew night when versailles as bassompierre writes of it was a chetif chateau o for the lyre of some orpheus to constrain with touch of melodious strings these mad masses into order for here all seems fallen asunder in wideyawning dislocation the highest as in downrushing of a world is come in contact with the lowest the rascality of france beleaguering the royalty of france ironshod batons lifted round the diadem not to guard it with denunciations of bloodthirsty antinational bodyguards are heard dark growlings against a queenly name  the court sits tremulous powerless varies with the varying temper of the esplanade with the varying colour of the rumours from paris thickcoming rumours now of peace now of war necker and all the ministers consult with a blank issue the oeildeboeuf is one tempest of whisperswe will fly to metz we will not fly the royal carriages again attempt egressthough for trial merely they are again driven in by lecointres patrols in six hours nothing has been resolved on not even the acceptance pure and simple  in six hours alas he who in such circumstances cannot resolve in six minutes may give up the enterprise him fate has already resolved for and menadism meanwhile and sansculottism takes counsel with the national assembly grows more and more tumultuous there mounier returns not authority nowhere shews itself the authority of france lies for the present with lecointre and usher maillardthis then is the abomination of desolation come suddenly though long foreshadowed as inevitable for to the blind all things are sudden misery which through long ages had no spokesman no helper will now be its own helper and speak for itself the dialect one of the rudest is what it could be this  at eight oclock there returns to our assembly not the deputation but doctor guillotin announcing that it will return also that there is hope of the acceptance pure and simple he himself has brought a royal letter authorising and commanding the freest circulation of grains which royal letter menadism with its whole heart applauds conformably to which the assembly forthwith passes a decree also received with rapturous menadic plauditsonly could not an august assembly contrive further to fix the price of bread at eight sous the halfquartern butchersmeat at six sous the pound which seem fair rates such motion do a multitude of men and women irrepressible by usher maillard now make does an august assembly hear made usher maillard himself is not always perfectly measured in speech but if rebuked he can justly excuse himself by the peculiarity of the circumstances moniteur in hist parl ii 105  but finally this decree well passed and the disorder continuing and members melting away and no president mounier returningwhat can the vicepresident do but also melt away the assembly melts under such pressure into deliquium or as it is officially called adjourns maillard is despatched to paris with the decree concerning grains in his pocket he and some women in carriages belonging to the king thitherward slim louison chabray has already set forth with that written answer which the twelve shedeputies returned in to seek slim sylph she has set forth through the black muddy country she has much to tell her poor nerves so flurried and travels as indeed today on this road all persons do with extreme slowness president mounier has not come nor the acceptance pure and simple though six hours with their events have come though courier on courier reports that lafayette is coming coming with war or with peace it is time that the chateau also should determine on one thing or another that the chateau also should show itself alive if it would continue living  victorious joyful after such delay mounier does arrive at last and the hardearned acceptance with him which now alas is of small value fancy mouniers surprise to find his senate whom he hoped to charm by the acceptance pure and simpleall gone and in its stead a senate of menads for as erasmuss ape mimicked say with wooden splint erasmus shaving so do these amazons hold in mock majesty some confused parody of national assembly they make motions deliver speeches pass enactments productive at least of loud laughter all galleries and benches are filled a strong dame of the market is in mouniers chair not without difficulty mounier by aid of macers and persuasive speaking makes his way to the femalepresident the strong dame before abdicating signifies that for one thing she and indeed her whole senate male and female for what was one roasted warhorse among so many are suffering very considerably from hunger  experienced mounier in these circumstances takes a twofold resolution to reconvoke his assembly members by sound of drum also to procure a supply of food swift messengers fly to all bakers cooks pastrycooks vintners restorers drums beat accompanied with shrill vocal proclamation through all streets they come the assembly members come what is still better the provisions come on tray and barrow come these latter loaves wine great store of sausages the nourishing baskets circulate harmoniously along the benches nor according to the father of epics did any soul lack a fair share of victual greek an equal diet highly desirable at the moment deux amis iii 208  gradually some hundred or so of assembly members get edged in menadism making way a little round mouniers chair listen to the acceptance pure and simple and begin what is the order of the night discussion of the penal code all benches are crowded in the dusky galleries duskier with unwashed heads is a strange coruscationof impromptu billhooks courier de provence mirabeaus newspaper no 50 p 19 it is exactly five months this day since these same galleries were filled with highplumed jewelled beauty raining bright influences and now to such length have we got in regenerating france methinks the travailthroes are of the sharpestmenadism will not be restrained from occasional remarks asks what is use of the penal code the thing we want is bread mirabeau turns round with lionvoiced rebuke menadism applauds him but recommences  thus they chewing tough sausages discussing the penal code make night hideous what the issue will be lafayette with his thirty thousand must arrive first him who cannot now be distant all men expect as the messenger of destiny    chapter 17ix  lafayette  towards midnight lights flare on the hill lafayettes lights the roll of his drums comes up the avenue de versailles with peace or with war patience friends with neither lafayette is come but not yet the catastrophe  he has halted and harangued so often on the march spent nine hours on four leagues of road at montreuil close on versailles the whole host had to pause and with uplifted right hand in the murk of night to these pouring skies swear solemnly to respect the kings dwelling to be faithful to king and national assembly rage is driven down out of sight by the laggard march the thirst of vengeance slaked in weariness and soaking clothes flandre is again drawn out under arms but flandre grown so patriotic now needs no exterminating the wayworn batallions halt in the avenue they have for the present no wish so pressing as that of shelter and rest  anxious sits president mounier anxious the chateau there is a message coming from the chateau that m mounier would please return thither with a fresh deputation swiftly and so at least unite our two anxieties anxious mounier does of himself send meanwhile to apprise the general that his majesty has been so gracious as to grant us the acceptance pure and simple the general with a small advance column makes answer in passing speaks vaguely some smooth words to the national presidentglances only with the eye at that so mixtiform national assembly then fares forward towards the chateau there are with him two paris municipals they were chosen from the three hundred for that errand he gets admittance through the locked and padlocked grates through sentries and ushers to the royal halls  the court male and female crowds on his passage to read their doom on his face which exhibits say historians a mixture of sorrow of fervour and valour singular to behold memoire de m le comte de lallytollendal janvier 1790 p 161165 the king with monsieur with ministers and marshals is waiting to receive him he is come in his highflown chivalrous way to offer his head for the safety of his majestys the two municipals state the wish of paris four things of quite pacific tenor first that the honour of guarding his sacred person be conferred on patriot national guardssay the centre grenadiers who as gardes francaises were wont to have that privilege second that provisions be got if possible third that the prisons all crowded with political delinquents may have judges sent them fourth that it would please his majesty to come and live in paris to all which four wishes except the fourth his majesty answers readily yes or indeed may almost say that he has already answered it to the fourth he can answer only yes or no would so gladly answer yes and nobut in any case are not their dispositions thank heaven so entirely pacific there is time for deliberation the brunt of the danger seems past  lafayette and destaing settle the watches centre grenadiers are to take the guardroom they of old occupied as gardes francaisesfor indeed the gardes du corps its late illadvised occupants are gone mostly to rambouillet that is the order of this night sufficient for the night is the evil thereof whereupon lafayette and the two municipals with highflown chivalry take their leave  so brief has the interview been mounier and his deputation were not yet got up so brief and satisfactory a stone is rolled from every heart the fair palace dames publicly declare that this lafayette detestable though he be is their saviour for once even the ancient vinaigrous tantes admit it the kings aunts ancient graille and sisterhood known to us of old queen marieantoinette has been heard often say the like she alone among all women and all men wore a face of courage of lofty calmness and resolve this day she alone saw clearly what she meant to do and theresas daughter dares do what she means were all france threatening her abide where her children are where her husband is  towards three in the morning all things are settled the watches set the centre grenadiers put into their old guardroom and harangued the swiss and few remaining bodyguards harangued the wayworn paris batallions consigned to the hospitality of versailles lie dormant in sparebeds sparebarracks coffeehouses empty churches a troop of them on their way to the church of saintlouis awoke poor weber dreaming troublous in the rue sartory weber has had his waistcoatpocket full of balls all day two hundred balls and two pears of powder for waistcoats were waistcoats then and had flaps down to midthigh so many balls he has had all day but no opportunity of using them he turns over now execrating disloyal bandits swears a prayer or two and straight to sleep again  finally the national assembly is harangued which thereupon on motion of mirabeau discontinues the penal code and dismisses for this night menadism sansculottism has cowered into guardhouses barracks of flandre to the light of cheerful fire failing that to churches officehouses sentryboxes wheresoever wretchedness can find a lair the troublous day has brawled itself to rest no lives yet lost but that of one warhorse insurrectionary chaos lies slumbering round the palace like ocean round a divingbellno crevice yet disclosing itself  deep sleep has fallen promiscuously on the high and on the low suspending most things even wrath and famine darkness covers the earth but far on the northeast paris flings up her great yellow gleam far into the wet black night for all is illuminated there as in the old july nights the streets deserted for alarm of war the municipals all wakeful patrols hailing with their hoarse whogoes there as we discover our poor slim louison chabray her poor nerves all fluttered is arriving about this very hour there usher maillard will arrive about an hour hence towards four in the morning they report successively to a wakeful hoteldeville what comfort they can report which again with early dawn large comfortable placards shall impart to all men  lafayette in the hotel de noailles not far from the chateau having now finished haranguing sits with his officers consulting at five oclock the unanimous best counsel is that a man so tost and toiled for twentyfour hours and more fling himself on a bed and seek some rest  thus then has ended the first act of the insurrection of women how it will turn on the morrow the morrow as always is with the fates but his majesty one may hope will consent to come honourably to paris at all events he can visit paris antinational bodyguards here and elsewhere must take the national oath make reparation to the tricolor flandre will swear there may be much swearing much public speaking there will infallibly be and so with harangues and vows may the matter in some handsome way wind itself up  or alas may it not be all otherwise unhandsome the consent not honourable but extorted ignominious boundless chaos of insurrection presses slumbering round the palace like ocean round a divingbell and may penetrate at any crevice let but that accumulated insurrectionary mass find entrance like the infinite inburst of water or say rather of inflammable selfigniting fluid for example turpentineandphosphorus oilfluid known to spinola santerre    chapter 17x  the grand entries  the dull dawn of a new morning drizzly and chill had but broken over versailles when it pleased destiny that a bodyguard should look out of window on the right wing of the chateau to see what prospect there was in heaven and in earth rascality male and female is prowling in view of him his fasting stomach is with good cause sour he perhaps cannot forbear a passing malison on them least of all can he forbear answering such  ill words breed worse till the worst word came and then the ill deed did the maledicent bodyguard getting as was too inevitable better malediction than he gave load

louder and louder it thunders at the oeildeboeuf what can now hinder its bursting inon a sudden it ceases the battering has ceased wild rushing the cries grow fainter there is silence or the tramp of regular steps then a friendly knocking we are the centre grenadiers old gardes francaises open to us messieurs of the gardeducorps we have not forgotten how you saved us at fontenoy toulongeon i 144 the door is opened enter captain gondran and the centre grenadiers there are military embracings there is sudden deliverance from death into life  strange sons of adam it was to exterminate these gardesducorps that the centre grenadiers left home and now they have rushed to save them from extermination the memory of common peril of old help melts the rough heart bosom is clasped to bosom not in war the king shews himself one moment through the door of his apartment with do not hurt my guardssoyons freres let us be brothers cries captain gondran and again dashes off with levelled bayonets to sweep the palace clear  now too lafayette suddenly roused not from sleep for his eyes had not yet closed arrives with passionate popular eloquence with prompt military word of command national guards suddenly roused by sound of trumpet and alarmdrum are all arriving the deathmelly ceases the first skylambent blaze of insurrection is got damped down it burns now if unextinguished yet flameless as charred coals do and not inextinguishable the kings apartments are safe ministers officials and even some loyal national deputies are assembling round their majesties the consternation will with sobs and confusion settle down gradually into plan and counsel better or worse  but glance now for a moment from the royal windows a roaring sea of human heads inundating both courts billowing against all passages menadic women infuriated men mad with revenge with love of mischief love of plunder rascality has slipped its muzzle and now bays threethroated like the dog of erebus fourteen bodyguards are wounded two massacred and as we saw beheaded jourdan asking was it worth while to come so far for two hapless deshuttes and varigny their fate surely was sad whirled down so suddenly to the abyss as men are suddenly by the wide thunder of the mountain avalanche awakened not by them awakened far off by others when the chateau clock last struck they two were pacing languid with poised musketoon anxious mainly that the next hour would strike it has struck to them inaudible their trunks lie mangled their heads parade on pikes twelve feet long through the streets of versailles and shall about noon reach the barriers of parisa too ghastly contradiction to the large comfortable placards that have been posted there  the other captive bodyguard is still circling the corpse of jerome amid indian warwhooping bloody tilebeard with tucked sleeves brandishing his bloody axe when gondran and the grenadiers come in sight comrades will you see a man massacred in cold bloodoff butchers answer they and the poor bodyguard is free busy runs gondran busy run guards and captains scouring at all corridors dispersing rascality and robbery sweeping the palace clear the mangled carnage is removed jeromes body to the townhall for inquest the fire of insurrection gets damped more and more into measurable manageable heat  transcendent things of all sorts as in the general outburst of multitudinous passion are huddled together the ludicrous nay the ridiculous with the horrible far over the billowy sea of heads may be seen rascality caprioling on horses from the royal stud the spoilers these for patriotism is always infected so with a proportion of mere thieves and scoundrels gondran snatched their prey from them in the chateau whereupon they hurried to the stables and took horse there but the generous diomedes steeds according to weber disdained such scoundrelburden and flinging up their royal heels did soon project most of it in parabolic curves to a distance amid peals of laughter and were caught mounted national guards secured the rest  now too is witnessed the touching lastflicker of etiquette which sinks not here in the cimmerian worldwreckage without a sign as the housecricket might still chirp in the pealing of a trump of doom monsieur said some master of ceremonies one hopes it might be de breze as lafayette in these fearful moments was rushing towards the inner royal apartments monsieur le roi vous accorde les grandes entrees monsieur the king grants you the grand entriesnot finding it convenient to refuse them toulongeon 1 app 120    chapter 17xi  from versailles  however the paris national guard wholly under arms has cleared the palace and even occupies the nearer external spaces extruding miscellaneous patriotism for most part into the grand court or even into the forecourt  the bodyguards you can observe have now of a verity hoisted the national cockade for they step forward to the windows or balconies hat aloft in hand on each hat a huge tricolor and fling over their bandoleers in sign of surrender and shout vive la nation to which how can the generous heart respond but with vive le roi vivent les gardesducorps his majesty himself has appeared with lafayette on the balcony and again appears vive le roi greets him from all throats but also from some one throat is heard le roi a paris the king to paris  her majesty too on demand shows herself though there is peril in it she steps out on the balcony with her little boy and girl no children point denfans cry the voices she gently pushes back her children and stands alone her hands serenely crossed on her breast should i die she had said i will do it such serenity of heroism has its effect lafayette with ready wit in his highflown chivalrous way takes that fair queenly hand and reverently kneeling kisses it thereupon the people do shout vive la reine nevertheless poor weber saw or even thought he saw for hardly the third part of poor webers experiences in such hysterical days will stand scrutiny one of these brigands level his musket at her majestywith or without intention to shoot for another of the brigands angrily struck it down  so that all and the queen herself nay the very captain of the bodyguards have grown national the very captain of the bodyguards steps out now with lafayette on the hat of the repentant man is an enormous tricolor large as a soupplatter or sunflower visible to the utmost forecourt he takes the national oath with a loud voice elevating his hat at which sight all the army raise their bonnets on their bayonets with shouts sweet is reconcilement to the heart of man lafayette has sworn flandre he swears the remaining bodyguards down in the marble court the people clasp them in their armso my brothers why would ye force us to slay you behold there is joy over you as over returning prodigal sonsthe poor bodyguards now national and tricolor exchange bonnets exchange arms there shall be peace and fraternity and still vive le roi and also le roi a paris not now from one throat but from all throats as one for it is the hearts wish of all mortals  yes the king to paris what else ministers may consult and national deputies wag their heads but there is now no other possibility you have forced him to go willingly at one oclock lafayette gives audible assurance to that purpose and universal insurrection with immeasurable shout and a discharge of all the firearms clear and rusty great and small that it has returns him acceptance what a sound heard for leagues a doom pealthat sound too rolls away into the silence of ages and the chateau of versailles stands ever since vacant hushed still its spacious courts grassgrown responsive to the hoe of the weeder times and generations roll on in their confused gulfcurrent and buildings like builders have their destiny  till one oclock then there will be three parties national assembly national rascality national royalty all busy enough rascality rejoices women trim themselves with tricolor nay motherly paris has sent her avengers sufficient cartloads of loaves which are shouted over which are gratefully consumed the avengers in return are searching for grainstores loading them in fifty waggons that so a national king probable harbinger of all blessings may be the evident bringer of plenty for one  and thus has sansculottism made prisoner its king revoking his parole the monarchy has fallen and not so much as honourably no ignominiously with struggle indeed oft repeated but then with unwise struggle wasting its strength in fits and paroxysms at every new paroxysm foiled more pitifully than before thus broglies whiff of grapeshot which might have been something has dwindled to the potvalour of an opera repast and o richard o mon roi which again we shall see dwindle to a favras conspiracy a thing to be settled by the hanging of one chevalier  poor monarchy but what save foulest defeat can await that man who wills and yet wills not apparently the king either has a right assertible as such to the death before god and man or else he has no right apparently the one or the other could he but know which may heaven pity him were louis wise he would this day abdicateis it not strange so few kings abdicate and none yet heard of has been known to commit suicide fritz the first of prussia alone tried it and they cut the rope  as for the national assembly which decrees this morning that it is inseparable from his majesty and will follow him to paris there may one thing be noted its extreme want of bodily health after the fourteenth of july there was a certain sickliness observable among honourable members so many demanding passports on account of infirm health but now for these following days there is a perfect murrian president mounier lally tollendal clermont tonnere and all constitutional twochamber royalists needing change of air as most nochamber royalists had formerly done  for in truth it is the second emigration this that has now come most extensive among commons deputies noblesse clergy so that to switzerland alone there go sixty thousand they will return in the day of accounts yes and have hot welcomebut emigration on emigration is the peculiarity of france one emigration follows another grounded on reasonable fear unreasonable hope largely also on childish pet the highflyers have gone first now the lower flyers and ever the lower will go down to the crawlers whereby however cannot our national assembly so much the more commodiously make the constitution your twochamber anglomaniacs being all safe distant on foreign shores abbe maury is seized and sent back again he tough as tanned leather with eloquent captain cazales and some others will stand it out for another year  but here meanwhile the question arises was philippe dorleans seen this day in the bois de boulogne in grey surtout waiting under the wet sere foliage what the day might bring forth alas yes the eidolon of him wasin webers and other such brains the chatelet shall make large inquisition into the matter examining a hundred and seventy witnesses and deputy chabroud publish his report but disclose nothing further rapport de chabroud moniteur du 31 december 1789 what then has caused these two unparalleled october days for surely such dramatic exhibition never yet enacted itself without

mirabeau and the sons of confusion hoping to drive the king to metz and gather the spoil nay was it not quite contrariwise the oeildeboeuf bodyguard colonel de guiche minister saintpriest and highflying loyalists hoping also to drive him to metz and try it by the sword of civil war good marquis toulongeon the historian and deputy feels constrained to admit that it was both toulongeon i 150  alas my friends credulous incredulity is a strange matter but when a whole nation is smitten with suspicion and sees a dramatic miracle in the very operation of the gastric juices what help is there such nation is already a mere hypochondriac bundle of diseases as good as changed into glass atrabiliar decadent and will suffer crises is not suspicion itself the one thing to be suspected as montaigne feared only fear  now however the short hour has struck his majesty is in his carriage with his queen sister elizabeth and two royal children not for another hour can the infinite procession get marshalled and under way the weather is dim drizzling the mind confused and noise great  processional marches not a few our world has seen roman triumphs and ovations cabiric cymbalbeatings royal progresses irish funerals but this of the french monarchy marching to its bed remained to be seen miles long and of breadth losing itself in vagueness for all the neighbouring country crowds to see slow stagnating along like shoreless lake yet with a noise like niagara like babel and bedlam a splashing and a tramping a hurrahing uproaring musketvolleyingthe truest segment of chaos seen in these latter ages till slowly it disembogue itself in the thickening dusk into expectant paris through a double row of faces all the way from passy to the hoteldeville  consider this vanguard of national troops with trains of artillery of pikemen and pikewomen mounted on cannons on carts hackneycoaches or on foottripudiating in tricolor ribbons from head to heel loaves stuck on the points of bayonets green boughs stuck in gun barrels mercier nouveau paris iii 21 next as mainmarch fifty cartloads of corn which have been lent for peace from the stores of versailles behind which follow stragglers of

menadic cohort menadic especially about the royal carriage tripudiating there covered with tricolor singing allusive songs pointing with one hand to the royal carriage which the illusions hit and

strongwomen some days hence ah madame our good queen dont be a traitor any more ne soyez plus traitre and we will all love you poor weber went splashing along close by the royal carriage with the tear in his eye their majesties did me the honour or i thought they did it to testify from time to time by shrugging of the shoulders by looks directed to heaven the emotions they felt thus like frail cockle floats the royal lifeboat helmless on black deluges of rascality  mercier in his loose way estimates the procession and assistants at two hundred thousand he says it was one boundless inarticulate hahatranscendent worldlaughter comparable to the saturnalia of the ancients why not here too as we said is human nature once more human shudder at it whoso is of shuddering humour yet behold it is human it has swallowed all formulas it tripudiates even so for which reason they that collect vases and antiques with figures of dancing bacchantes in wild and all but impossible positions may look with some interest on it  thus however has the slowmoving chaos or modern saturnalia of the ancients reached the barrier and must halt to be harangued by mayor bailly thereafter it has to lumber along between the double row of faces in the transcendent heavenlashing haha two hours longer towards the hoteldeville then again to be harangued there by several persons by moreau de saintmery among others moreau of the threethousand orders now national deputy for st domingo to all which poor louis who seemed to experience a slight emotion on entering this townhall can answer only that he comes with pleasure with confidence among his people mayor bailly in reporting it forgets confidence and the poor queen says eagerly add with confidencemessieurs rejoins bailly you are happier than if i had not forgot  finally the king is shewn on an upper balcony by torchlight with a huge tricolor in his hat and all the people says weber grasped one anothers handsthinking now surely the new era was born hardly till eleven at night can royalty get to its vacant longdeserted palace of the tuileries to lodge there somewhat in strollingplayer fashion it is tuesday the sixth of october 1789  poor louis has two other paris processions to make one ludicrousignominious like this the other not ludicrous nor ignominious but serious nay sublime   end of the first volume     volume ii  the constitution   book 2i  the feast of pikes   chapter 21i  in the tuileries  the victim having once got his strokeofgrace the catastrophe can be considered as almost come there is small interest now in watching his long low moans notable only are his sharper agonies what convulsive struggles he may take to cast the torture off from him and then finally the last departure of life itself and how he lies extinct and ended either wrapt like caesar in decorous mantlefolds or unseemly sunk together like one that had not the force even to die  was french royalty when wrenched forth from its tapestries in that fashion on that sixth of october 1789 such a victim universal france and royal proclamation to all the provinces answers anxiously no nevertheless one may fear the worst royalty was beforehand so decrepit moribund there is little life in it to heal an injury how much of its strength which was of the imagination merely has fled rascality having looked plainly in the kings face and not died when the assembled crows can pluck up their scarecrow and say to it here shalt thou stand and not there and can treat with it and make it from an infinite a quite finite constitutional scarecrowwhat is to be looked for not in the finite constitutional scarecrow but in what still unmeasured infiniteseeming force may rally round it is there thenceforth any hope for it is most true that all available authority is mystic in its conditions and comes by the grace of god  cheerfuller than watching the deathstruggles of royalism will it be to watch the growth and gambollings of sansculottism for in human things especially in human society all death is but a deathbirth thus if the sceptre is departing from louis it is only that in other forms other sceptres were it even pikesceptres may bear sway in a prurient element rich with nutritive influences we shall find that sansculottism grows lustily and even frisks in not ungraceful sport as indeed most young creatures are sportful nay may it not be noted further that as the grown cat and catspecies generally is the cruellest thing known so the merriest is precisely the kitten or growing cat  but fancy the royal family risen from its trucklebeds on the morrow of that mad day fancy the municipal inquiry how would your majesty please to lodgeand then that the kings rough answer each may lodge as he can i am well enough is congeed and bowed away in expressive grins by the townhall functionaries with obsequious upholsterers at their back and how the chateau of the tuileries is repainted regarnished into a golden royal residence and lafayette with his blue national guards lies encompassing it as blue neptune in the language of poets does an island wooingly thither may the wrecks of rehabilitated loyalty gather if it will become constitutional for constitutionalism thinks no evil sansculottism itself rejoices in the kings countenance the rubbish of a menadic insurrection as in this everkindly world all rubbish can and must be is swept aside and so again on clear arena under new conditions with something even of a new stateliness we begin a new course of action  arthur young has witnessed the strangest scene majesty walking unattended in the tuileries gardens and miscellaneous tricolor crowds who cheer it and reverently make way for it the very queen commands at lowest respectful silence

taskmaster who has lost his whip lafayette and the municipality and universal constitutionalism assert the former and do what is in them to realise it such patriotism as snarls dangerously and shows teeth patrollotism shall suppress or far better royalty shall soothe down the angry hair of it by gentle pattings and most effectual of all by fuller diet yes not only shall paris be fed but the kings

national assembly has much to do a france to regenerate and france is short of so many requisites short even of cash these same finances give trouble enough no choking of the deficit which gapes ever

alsace with necklacecardinal rohan or that it now walked as goblin revenant with bishop talleyrand of autun yet does not the shadow of religion the cant of religion still linger the clergy have means and material means of number organization social weight a material at lowest of public ignorance known to be the mother of devotion nay withal is it incredible that there might in simple hearts latent here and there like gold grains in the mudbeach still dwell some real faith in god of so singular and tenacious a sort that even a maury or a talleyrand could still be the symbol for itenough and clergy has strength the clergy has craft and indignation it is a most fatal business this of the clergy a weltering hydracoil which the national assembly has stirred up about its ears hissing stinging which cannot be appeased alive which cannot be trampled dead fatal from first to last scarcely after fifteen months debating can a civil constitution of the clergy be so much as got to paper and then for getting it into reality alas such civil constitution is but an agreement to disagree it divides france from end to end with a new split infinitely complicating all the other splitscatholicism what of it there is left with the cant of catholicism raging on the one side and sceptic heathenism on the other both by contradiction  waxing fanatic what endless jarring of refractory hated priests and constitutional despised ones of tender consciences like the kings and consciences hotseared like certain of his peoples the whole to end in feasts of reason and a war of la vendee so deepseated is religion in the heart of man and holds of all infinite passions if the dead echo of it still did so much what could not the living voice of it once do  finance and constitution law and gospel this surely were work enough yet this is not all in fact the ministry and necker himself whom a brass inscription fastened by the people over his doorlintel testifies to be the ministre adore are dwindling into clearer and clearer nullity execution or legislation arrangement or detail from their nerveless fingers all drops undone all lights at last on the toiled shoulders of an august representative

mountain deluge and submerge france a singular thing this camp of jales existing mostly on paper for the soldiers at jales being peasants or national guards were in heart sworn sansculottes and all that the royalist captains could do was with false words to keep them or rather keep the report of them drawn up there visible to all imaginations for a terror and a signif peradventure france might

constitutional royalty let lafayette water it as he will languishes too like a cut branch and august senators are perhaps at bottom only perfecting their theory of defective verbshow does the young

whether for terror or for hope some prophetic picture of a new france prophecy which brings nay which almost is its own fulfilment and in all ways consciously and unconsciously works towards that  observe moreover how the aggregative principle let it be but deep enough goes on aggregating and this even in a geometrical progression how when the whole world in such a plastic time is forming

magna charta clipt by sacrilegious tailors universal history is not indifferent to it  these friends of the constitution have met mainly as their name may foreshadow to look after elections when an election comes and procure fit men but likewise to consult generally that the commonweal take no damage one as yet sees not how for indeed let two or three gather together any where if it be not in church where all are bound to the passive state no mortal can say accurately themselves as little as any for what they are gathered how often has the broached barrel proved not to be for joy and heart effusion but for duel and headbreakage and the promised feast become a feast of the lapithae this jacobins club which at first shone resplendent and was thought to be a new celestial sun for enlightening the nations had as things all have to work through its appointed phases it burned unfortunately more and more lurid more sulphurous distractedand swam at last through the astonished heaven like a tartarean portent and luridburning prison of spirits in pain  its style of eloquence rejoice reader that thou knowest it not that thou canst never perfectly know the jacobins published a journal of debates where they that have the heart may examine impassioned fulldroning patrioticeloquence implacable unfertilesave for destruction which was indeed its work most wearisome though most deadly be thankful that oblivion covers so much that all carrion is by and by buried in the green earths bosom and even makes her grow the greener the jacobins are buried but their work is not it continues making the tour of the world as it can it might be seen lately for instance with bared bosom and deathdefiant eye as far on as greek missolonghi and strange enough old slumbering hellas was resuscitated into somnambulism which will become clear wakefulness by a voice from the rue st honore all dies as we often say except the spirit of man of what man does thus has not the very house of the jacobins vanished scarcely lingering in a few old mens memories the st honore market has brushed it away and now where dulldroning eloquence like a trump of doom once shook the world there is pacific chaffering for poultry and greens the sacred national assembly hall itself has become common ground presidents platform permeable to wain and dustcart for the rue de rivoli runs there verily at cockcrow of this cock or the other all apparitions do melt and dissolve in space  the paris jacobins became the mothersociety societemere and had as many as three hundred shrilltongued daughters in direct correspondence with her of indirectly corresponding what we may call granddaughters and minute progeny she counted fortyfour thousandbut for the present we note only two things the first of them a mere anecdote one night a couple of brother jacobins are doorkeepers for the members take this post of duty and honour in rotation and admit none that have not tickets one doorkeeper was the worthy sieur lais a patriotic operasinger stricken in years whose windpipe is long since closed without result the other young and named louis philippe dorleanss firstborn has in this latter time after unheardof destinies become citizenking and struggles to rule for a season allflesh is grass higher reedgrass or creeping herb  the second thing we have to note is historical that the mothersociety even in this its effulgent period cannot content all patriots already it must throw off so to speak two dissatisfied swarms a swarm to the right a swarm to the left one party which thinks the jacobins lukewarm constitutes itself into club of the cordeliers a hotter club it is dantons element with whom goes desmoulins the other party again which thinks the jacobins scaldinghot flies off to the right and becomes club of 1789 friends of the monarchic constitution they are afterwards named feuillans club their place of meeting being the feuillans convent lafayette is or becomes their chiefman supported by the respectable patriot everywhere by the mass of property and intelligencewith the most flourishing prospects they in these june days of 1790 do in the palais royal dine solemnly with open windows to the cheers of the people with toasts with inspiriting songswith one song at least among the feeblest ever sung hist parl vi 334 they shall in due time be hooted forth over the borders into cimmerian night  another expressly monarchic or royalist club club des monarchiens though a club of ample funds and all sitting in damask sofas cannot realise the smallest momentary cheer realises only scoffs and groanstill ere long certain patriots in disorderly sufficient number proceed thither for a night or for nights and groan it out of pain vivacious alone shall the mothersociety and her family be the very cordeliers may as it were return into her bosom which will have grown warm enough  fatallooking are not such societies an incipient new order of society itself the aggregative principle anew at work in a society grown obsolete cracked asunder dissolving into rubbish and primary atoms    chapter 21vi  je le jure  with these signs of the times is it not surprising that the dominant feeling all over france was still continually hope o blessed hope sole boon of man whereby on his strait prison walls are painted beautiful farstretching landscapes and into the night of very death is shed holiest dawn thou art to all an indefeasible possession in this godsworld to the wise a sacred constantinesbanner written on the eternal skies under

becomes cheerfuller becomes possible  in the deathtumults of a sinking society french hope sees only the birthstruggles of a new unspeakably better society and sings with full assurance of faith her brisk melody which some inspired fiddler has in these very days composed for herthe worldfamous caira yes that will go and then there will come all men hope even marat hopesthat patriotism will take muff and dirk king louis is not without hope in the chapter of chances in a flight to some bouille in getting popularized at paris but what a hoping people he had judge by the fact and series of facts now to be noted  poor louis meaning the best with little insight and even less determination of his own has to follow in that dim wayfaring of his such signal as may be given him by backstairs royalism by official or backstairs constitutionalism whichever for the month may have convinced the royal mind if flight to bouille and horrible to think a drawing of the civil sword do hang as theory portentous in the background much nearer is this fact of these twelve hundred kings who sit in the salle de manege kings uncontrollable by him not yet irreverent to him could kind management of these but prosper how much better were it than armed emigrants turinintrigues and the help of austria nay are the two hopes inconsistent rides in the suburbs we have found cost little yet they always brought vivats see bertrandmoleville i 241 c still cheaper is a soft word such as has many times turned away wrath in these rapid days while france is all getting divided into departments clergy about to be remodelled popular societies rising and feudalism and so much ever is ready to be hurled into the meltingpotmight one not try  on the 4th of february accordingly m le president reads to his national assembly a short autograph announcing that his majesty will step over quite in an unceremonious way probably about noon think therefore messieurs what it may mean especially how ye will get the hall decorated a little the secretaries bureau can be shifted down from the platform on the presidents chair be slipped this cover of velvet of a violet colour sprigged with gold fleurdelysfor indeed m le president has had previous notice underhand and taken counsel with doctor guillotin then some fraction of velvet carpet of like texture and colour cannot that be spread in front of the chair where the secretaries usually sit so has judicious guillotin advised and the effect is found satisfactory moreover as it is probable that his majesty in spite of the fleurdelysvelvet will stand and not sit at all the president himself in the interim presides standing and so while some honourable member is discussing say the division of a department ushers announce his majesty in person with small suite enter majesty the honourable member stops short the assembly starts to its feet the twelve hundred kings almost all and the galleries no less do welcome the restorer of french liberty with loyal shouts his majestys speech in diluted conventional phraseology expresses this mainly that he most of all frenchmen rejoices to see france getting regenerated is sure at the same time that they will deal gently with her in the process and not regenerate her roughly such was his majestys speech the feat he performed was coming to speak it and going back again  surely except to a very hoping people there was not much here to build upon yet what did they not build the fact that the king has spoken that he has voluntarily come to speak how inexpressibly encouraging did not the glance of his royal countenance like concentrated sunbeams kindle all hearts in an august assembly nay thereby in an inflammable enthusiastic france to move deputation of thanks can be the happy lot of but one man to go in such deputation the lot of not many the deputed have gone and returned with what highestflown compliment they could whom also the queen met dauphin in hand and still do not our hearts burn with insatiable gratitude and to one other man a still higher blessedness suggests itself to move that we all renew the national oath  happiest honourable member with his word so in season as word seldom was magic fugleman of a whole national assembly which sat there bursting to do somewhat fugleman of a whole onlooking france the president swears declares that every one shall swear in distinct je le jure nay the very gallery sends him down a written slip signed with their oath on it and as the assembly now casts an eye that way the gallery all stands up and swears again and then out of doors consider at the hoteldeville how bailly the great tenniscourt swearer again swears towards nightful with all the municipals and heads of districts assembled there and m danton suggests that the public would like to partake whereupon bailly with escort of twelve steps forth to the great outer staircase sways the ebullient multitude with stretched hand takes their oath with a thunder of rolling drums with shouts that rend the welkin and on all streets the glad people with moisture and fire in their eyes spontaneously formed groups and swore one another newspapers in hist parl iv 445and the whole city was illuminated this was the fourth of february 1790 a day to be marked white in constitutional annals  nor is the illumination for a night only but partially or totally it lasts a series of nights for each district the electors of each district will swear specially and always as the district swears it illuminates itself behold them district after district in some open square where the nonelecting people can all see and join with their uplifted right hands and je le jure with rolling drums with embracings and that infinite hurrah of the enfranchisedwhich any tyrant that there may be can consider faithful to the king to the law to the constitution which the national assembly shall make  fancy for example the professors of universities parading the streets with their young france and swearing in an enthusiastic manner not without tumult by a larger exercise of fancy expand duly this little word the like was repeated in every town and district of france nay one patriot mother in lagnon of brittany assembles her ten children and with her own aged hand swears them all herself the highsouled venerable woman of all which moreover a national assembly must be eloquently apprised such three weeks of swearing saw the sun ever such a swearing people have they been bit by a swearing tarantula no but they are men and frenchmen they have hope and singular to say they have faith were it only in the gospel according to jean jacques o my brothers would to heaven it were even as ye think and have sworn but there are lovers oaths which had they been true as love itself cannot be kept not to speak of dicers oaths also a known sort    chapter 21vii  prodigies  to such length had the contrat social brought it in believing hearts man as is well said lives by faith each generation has its own faith more or less and laughs at the faith of its predecessormost unwisely grant indeed that this faith in the social contract belongs to the stranger sorts that an unborn generation may very wisely if not laugh yet stare at it and piously consider for alas what is contrat if all men were such that a mere spoken or sworn contract would bind them all men were then true men and government a superfluity not what thou and i have promised to each other but what the balance of our forces can make us perform to each other that in so sinful a world as ours is the thing to be counted on but above all a people and a sovereign promising to one another as if a whole people changing from generation to generation nay from hour to hour could ever by any method be made to speak or promise and to speak mere solecisms we be the heavens witness which heavens however do no miracles now we everchanging millions will allow thee changeful unit to force us or govern us the world has perhaps seen few faiths comparable to that  so nevertheless had the world then construed the matter had they not so construed it how different had their hopes been their attempts their

one it had replaced than faith merely in the everlasting nothing and mans digestive power lower than which no faith can go  not that such universally prevalent universally jurant feeling of hope could be a unanimous one far from that the time was ominous social dissolution near and certain social renovation still a problem difficult and distant even though sure but if ominous to some clearest

new evangel of jean jacques old women there looking up for favras heads in the celestial luminary these are preternatural signs prefiguring somewhat  in fact to the patriot children of hope themselves it is undeniable that difficulties exist emigrating seigneurs parlements in sneaking but most malicious mutiny though the rope is round their neck above all the most decided deficiency of grains sorrowful but to a nation that hopes not irremediable to a nation which is in fusion and ardent communion of thought which for example on signal of one fugleman will lift its right hand like a drilled regiment and swear and illuminate till every village from ardennes to the pyrenees has rolled its villagedrum and sent up its little oath and glimmer of tallowillumination some fathoms into the reign of night  if grains are defective the fault is not of nature or national assembly but of art and antinational intriguers such malign individuals of the scoundrel species have power to vex us while the constitution is amaking endure it ye heroic patriots nay rather why not cure it grains do grow they lie extant there in sheaf or sack only that regraters and royalist plotters to provoke the people

your patriotism strike stealthy scoundrelism blind paralytic as with a coup de soleil  under which hat or nightcap of the twentyfive millions this pregnant idea first rose for in some one head it did rise no man can now say a most small idea near at hand for the whole world but a living one fit and which waxed whether into greatness or not into immeasurable size when a nation is in this state that

agitated nation which has faith this business of covenanting is the scotch believing in a righteous heaven above them and also in a gospel far other than the jeanjacques one swore in their extreme need a solemn league and covenantas brothers on the forlornhope and imminence of battle who embrace looking godward and got the whole isle to swear it and even in their tough oldsaxon hebrewpresbyterian way to keep it more or lessfor the thing as such things are was heard in heaven and partially ratified there neither is it yet dead if thou wilt look nor like to die the french too with their gallicethnic excitability and effervescence have as we have seen real faith of a sort they are hard bestead though in the middle of hope a national solemn league and covenant there may be in france too under how different conditions with how different developement and issue  note accordingly the small commencement first spark of a mighty firework for if the particular hat cannot be fixed upon the particular district can on the 29th day of last november were national guards by the thousand seen filing from far and near with military music with municipal officers in tricolor sashes towards and along the rhonestream to the little town of etoile there with ceremonial evolution and manoeuvre with fanfaronading musketrysalvoes and what else the patriot genius could devise they made oath and obtestation to stand faithfully by one another under law and king in particular to have all manner of grains while grains there were freely circulated in spite both of robber and regrater this was the meeting of etoile in the mild end of november 1789  but now if a mere empty review followed by reviewdinner ball and such gesticulation and flirtation as there may be interests the happy countytown and makes it the envy of surrounding countytowns how much more might this in a fortnight larger montelimart half ashamed of itself will do as good and better on the plain of montelimart or what is equally sonorous under the walls of montelimart the thirteenth of december sees new gathering and obtestation six thousand strong and now indeed with these three remarkable improvements as unanimously resolved on there first that the men of montelimart do federate with the already federated men of etoile second that implying not expressing the circulation of grain they swear in the face of god and their country with much more emphasis and comprehensiveness to obey all decrees of the national assembly and see them obeyed till death jusqua la mort third and most important that official record of all this be solemnly delivered in to the national assembly to m de lafayette and to the restorer of french liberty who shall all take what comfort from it they can thus does larger montelimart vindicate its patriot importance and maintain its rank in the municipal scale hist parl vii 4  and so with the newyear the signal is hoisted for is not a national assembly and solemn deliverance there at lowest a national telegraph not only grain shall circulate while there is grain on highways or the rhonewaters over all that southeastern regionwhere also if monseigneur dartois saw good to break in from turin hot welcome might wait him but whatsoever province of france is straitened for grain or vexed with a mutinous parlement unconstitutional plotters monarchic clubs or any other patriot ailmentcan go and do likewise or even do better and now especially when the february swearing has set them all agog from brittany to burgundy on most plains of france under most citywalls it is a blaring of trumpets waving of banners a constitutional manoeuvring under the vernal skies while nature too is putting forth her green hopes under bright sunshine defaced by the stormful east like patriotism victorious though with difficulty over aristocracy and defect of grain there march and constitutionally wheel to the cairaing mood of fife and drum under their tricolor municipals our cleargleaming phalanxes or halt with uplifted righthand and artillerysalvoes that imitate joves thunder and all the country and metaphorically all the universe is looking on wholly in their best apparel brave men and beautifully dizened women most of whom have lovers there swearing by the eternal heavens and this greengrowing allnutritive earth that france is free  sweetest days when astonishing to say mortals have actually met together in communion and fellowship and man were it only once through long despicable centuries is for moments verily the brother of manand then the deputations to the national assembly with highflown descriptive harangue to m de lafayette and the restorer very frequently moreover to the mother of patriotism sitting on her stout benches in that hall of the jacobins the general ear is filled with federation new names of patriots emerge which shall one day become familiar boyerfonfrede eloquent denunciator of a rebellious bourdeaux parlement max isnard eloquent reporter of the federation of draguignan eloquent pair separated by the whole breadth of france who are nevertheless to meet ever wider burns the flame of federation ever wider and also brighter thus the brittany and anjou brethren mention a fraternity of all true frenchmen and go the length of invoking perdition and death on any renegade moreover if in their nationalassembly harangue they glance plaintively at the marc dargent which makes so many citizens passive they over in the mothersociety ask being henceforth themselves neither bretons nor angevins but french why all france has not one federation and universal oath of brotherhood once for all reports c in hist parl ix 122147 a most pertinent suggestion dating from the end of march which pertinent suggestion the whole patriot world cannot but catch and reverberate and agitate till it become loudwhich in that case the townhall municipals had better take up and meditate  some universal federation seems inevitable the where is given clearly paris only the when the how these also productive time will give is already giving for always as the federative work goes on it perfects itself and patriot genius adds contribution after contribution thus at lyons in the end of the may month we behold as many as fifty or some say sixty thousand met to federate and a multitude looking on which it would be difficult to number from dawn to dusk for our lyons guardsmen took rank at five in the bright dewy morning came pouring in brightgleaming to the quai de rhone to march thence to the federationfield amid wavings of hats and ladyhandkerchiefs glad shoutings of some two hundred thousand patriot voices and hearts the beautiful and brave among whom courting no notice and yet the notablest of all what queenlike figure is this with her escort of housefriends and champagneux the patriot editor come abroad with the earliest radiant with enthusiasm are those dark eyes is that

greatness of her crystal clearness genuine the creature of sincerity and nature in an age of artificiality pollution and cant there in her still completeness in her still invincibility she if thou knew it is the noblest of all living frenchwomenand will be seen one day o blessed rather while unseen even of herself for the present she gazes nothing doubting into this grand theatricality and thinks her young dreams are to be fulfilled  from dawn to dusk as we said it lasts and truly a sight like few flourishes of drums and trumpets are something but think of an artificial rock fifty feet high all cut into cragsteps not without the similitude of shrubs the interior cavity for in sooth it is made of dealstands solemn a temple of concord on the outer summit rises a statue of liberty colossal seen for miles with her pike and phrygian cap and civic column at her feet a countrys altar autel de la patrieon all which neither dealtimber nor lath and plaster with paint of various colours have been spared but fancy then the banners all placed on the steps of the rock highmass chaunted and the civic oath of fifty thousand with what volcanic outburst of sound from iron and other throats enough to frighten back the very saone and rhone and how the brightest fireworks and balls and even repasts closed in that night of the gods hist parl xii 274 and so the lyons federation vanishes too swallowed of darknessand yet not wholly for our brave fair roland was there also she though in the deepest privacy writes her narrative of it in champagneuxs courier de lyons a piece which circulates to the extent of sixty thousand which one would like now to read  but on the whole paris we may see will have little to devise will only have to borrow and apply and then as to the day what day of all the calendar is fit if the bastille anniversary be not the particular spot too it is easy to see must be the champdemars where many a julian the apostate has been lifted on bucklers to frances or the worlds sovereignty and iron franks loudclanging have responded to the voice of a charlemagne and from of old mere sublimities have been familiar    chapter 21ix  symbolic  how natural in all decisive circumstances is symbolic representation to all kinds of men nay what is mans whole terrestrial life but a symbolic representation and making visible of the celestial invisible force that is in him by act and world he strives to do it with sincerity if possible failing that with theatricality which latter also may have its meaning an almacks masquerade is not nothing in more genial ages your christmas guisings feasts of the ass abbots of unreason were a considerable something since sport they were as almacks may still be sincere wish for sport but what on the other hand must not sincere earnest have been say a hebrew feast of tabernacles have been a whole nation gathered in the name of the highest under the eye of the highest imagination herself flagging under the reality and all noblest ceremony as yet not grown ceremonial but solemn significant to the outmost fringe neither in modern private life are theatrical scenes of tearful women wetting whole ells of cambric in concert of impassioned bushywhiskered youth threatening suicide and such like to be so entirely detested drop thou a tear over them thyself rather  at any rate one can remark that no nation will throwby its work and deliberately go out to make a scene without meaning something thereby for indeed no scenic individual with knavish hypocritical views will take the trouble to soliloquise a scene and now consider is not a scenic nation placed precisely in that predicament of soliloquising for its own behoof alone to solace its own sensibilities maudlin or otheryet in this respect of readiness for scenes the difference of nations as of men is very great if our saxonpuritanic friends for example swore and signed their national covenant without discharge of gunpowder or the beating of any drum in a dingy covenantclose of the edinburgh highstreet in a mean room where men now drink mean liquor it was consistent with their ways so to swear it our gallicencyclopedic friends again must have a champdemars seen of all the world or universe and such a scenic exhibition to which the coliseum amphitheatre was but a strollers barn as this old globe of ours had never or hardly ever beheld which method also we reckon natural then and there nor perhaps was the respective keeping of these two oaths far out of due proportion to such respective display in taking them inverse proportion namely for the theatricality of a people goes in a compoundratio ratio indeed of their trustfulness sociability fervency but then also of their excitability of their porosity not continent or say of their explosiveness hotflashing but which does not last  how true also once more is it that no man or nation of men conscious of doing a great thing was ever in that thing doing other than a small one o champdemars federation with three hundred drummers twelve hundred windmusicians and artillery planted on height after height to boom the tidings of it all over france in few minutes could no atheistnaigeon contrive to discern eighteen centuries off those thirteen most poor meandressed men at frugal supper in a mean jewish dwelling with no symbol but hearts godinitiated into the divine depth of sorrow and a do this in remembrance of meand so cease that small difficult crowing of his if he were not doomed to it    chapter 21x  mankind  pardonable are human theatricalities nay perhaps touching like the passionate utterance of a tongue which with sincerity stammers of a head which with insincerity babbleshaving gone distracted yet in comparison with unpremeditated outbursts of nature such as an insurrection of women how foisonless unedifying undelightful like small ale palled like an effervescence that has effervesced such scenes coming of forethought were they worldgreat and never so cunningly devised are at bottom mainly pasteboard and paint but the others are original emitted from the great everliving heart of nature herself what figure they will assume is unspeakably significant to us therefore let the french national solemn league and federation be the highest recorded triumph of the thespian art triumphant surely since the whole pit which was of twentyfive millions not only claps hands but does itself spring on the boards and passionately set to playing there and being such be it treated as such with sincere cursory admiration with wonder from afar a whole nation gone mumming deserves so much but deserves not that loving minuteness a menadic insurrection did much more let prior and as it were rehearsal scenes of federation come and go henceforward as they list and on plains and under citywalls innumerable regimental bands blare off into the inane without note from us  one scene however the hastiest reader will momentarily pause on that of anacharsis clootz and the collective sinful posterity of adamfor a patriot municipality has now on the 4th of june got its plan concocted and got it sanctioned by national assembly a patriot king assenting to whom were he even free to dissent federative harangues overflowing with loyalty have doubtless a transient sweetness there shall come deputed national guards so many in the hundred from each of the eightythree departments of france likewise from all naval and military kings forces shall deputed quotas come such federation of national with royal soldier has taking place spontaneously been already seen and sanctioned for the rest it is hoped as many as forty thousand may arrive expenses to be borne by the deputing district of all which let district and department take thought and elect fit menwhom the paris brethren will fly to meet and welcome  now therefore judge if our patriot artists are busy taking deep counsel how to make the scene worthy of a look from the universe as many as fifteen thousand men spademen barrowmen stonebuilders rammers with their engineers are at work on the champdemars hollowing it out into a natural amphitheatre fit for such solemnity for one may hope it will be annual and perennial a feast of pikes fete des piques notablest among the hightides of the year in any case ought not a scenic free nation to have some permanent national amphitheatre the champdemars is getting hollowed out and the daily talk and the nightly dream in most parisian heads is of federation and that only federate deputies are already under way national assembly what with its natural work what with hearing and answering harangues of federates of this federation will have enough to do harangue of american

memorial for some years they will then dine as they come back in the bois de boulogne see deux amis v 122 hist parl ccannot however do it without apprising the world to such things does the august national assembly ever and anon cheerfully listen suspending its regenerative labours and with some touch of impromptu eloquence make friendly replyas indeed the wont has long been for it is a gesticulating sympathetic people and has a heart and wears it on its sleeve  in which circumstances it occurred to the mind of anacharsis clootz that while so much was embodying itself into club or committee and perorating applauded there yet remained a greater and greatest of which if it also took body and perorated what might not the effect be humankind namely le genre humain itself in what rapt creative moment the thought rose in anacharsiss soul all his throes while he went about giving shape and birth to it how he was sneered at by cold worldlings but did sneer again being a man of polished sarcasm and moved to and fro persuasive in coffeehouse and soiree and dived down assiduousobscure in the great deep of paris making his thought a fact of all this the spiritual biographies of that period say nothing enough that on the 19th evening of june 1790 the suns slant rays lighted a spectacle such as our foolish little planet has not often had to show anacharsis clootz entering the

satisfaction to see several things first and chief on the motion of lameth lafayette saintfargeau and other patriot nobles let the others repugn as they will all titles of nobility from duke to esquire or lower are henceforth abolished then in like manner livery servants or rather the livery of servants neither for the future shall any man or woman selfstyled noble be incensedfoolishly

this man which indeed the admiring people treat him with to the last but let extreme patriotism rejoice and chiefly anacharsis and mankind for now it seems to be taken for granted that one adam is father of us all  such was in historical accuracy the famed feat of anacharsis thus did the most extensive of public bodies find a sort of spokesman whereby at least we may judge of one thing what a humour the once sniffing mocking city of paris and baron clootz had got into when such exhibition could appear a propriety next door to a sublimity it is true envy did in after times pervert this success of anacharsis making him from incidental speaker of the foreignnations committee claim to be official permanent speaker orateur of the human species which he only deserved to be and alleging calumniously that his astrological chaldeans and the rest were a mere french tagragandbobtail disguised for the nonce and in short sneering and fleering at him in her cold barren way all which however

while episcopus talleyrand longstoled with mitre and tricolor belt was yet but hitching up the altarsteps to do his miracle the material heaven grew black a northwind moaning cold moisture began to

frontier a certain brave bouille last refuge of royalty in all straits and meditations of flight has for many months hovered occasionally in our eye some name or shadow of a brave bouille let us now for a little look fixedly at him till he become a substance and person for us the man himself is worth a glance his position and procedure there in these days will throw light on many things  for it is with bouille as with all french commanding officers only in a more emphatic degree the grand national federation we already guess was but empty sound or worse a last loudest universal hephephurrah with full bumpers in that national lapithaefeast of constitutionmaking as in loud denial of the palpably existing as if with hurrahings you would shut out notice of the inevitable already knocking at the gates which new national bumper one may say can but deepen the drunkenness and so the louder it swears brotherhood will the sooner and the more surely lead to cannibalism ah under that fraternal shine and clangour what a deep world of irreconcileable discords lie momentarily assuaged damped down for one moment respectable military federates have barely got home to their quarters and the inflammablest dying burnt up with liquors and kindness has not yet got extinct the shine is hardly out of mens eyes and still blazes filling all mens memorieswhen your discords burst forth again very considerably darker than ever let us look at bouille and see how  bouille for the present commands in the garrison of metz and far and wide over the east and north being indeed by a late act of government with sanction of national assembly appointed one of our four supreme generals rochambeau and mailly men and marshals of note in these days though to us of small moment are two of his colleagues tough old babbling luckner also of small moment for us will probably be the third marquis de bouille is a determined loyalist not indeed disinclined to moderate reform but resolute against immoderate a man long suspect to patriotism who has more than once given the august assembly trouble who would not for example take the national oath as he was bound to do but always put it off on this or the other pretext till an autograph of majesty requested him to do it as a favour there in this post if not of honour yet of eminence and danger he waits in a silent concentered manner very dubious of the future alone as he says or almost alone of all the old military notabilities he has not emigrated but thinks always in atrabiliar moments that there will be nothing for him too but to cross the marches he might cross say to treves or coblentz where exiled princes will be one day ranking or say over into luxemburg where old broglie loiters and languishes or is there not the great dim deep of european diplomacy where your calonnes your breteuils are beginning to hover dimly discernible  with immeasurable confused outlooks and purposes with no clear purpose but this of still trying to do his majesty a service bouille waits struggling what he can to keep his district loyal his troops faithful his garrisons furnished he maintains as yet with his cousin lafayette some thin diplomatic correspondence by letter and messenger chivalrous constitutional professions on the one side military gravity and brevity on the other which thin correspondence one can see growing ever the thinner and hollower towards the verge of entire vacuity bouille memoires london 1797 i c 8 a quick choleric sharply discerning stubbornly endeavouring man with suppressedexplosive resolution with valour nay headlong audacity a man who was more in his place lionlike defending those windward isles or as with military tigerspring clutching nevis and montserrat from the englishthan here in this suppressed condition muzzled and fettered by diplomatic packthreads looking out for a civil war which may never arrive few years ago bouille was to have led a french eastindian expedition and reconquered or conquered pondicherri and the kingdoms of the sun but the whole world is suddenly changed and he with it destiny willed it not in that way but in this    chapter 22ii  arrears and aristocrats  indeed as to the general outlook of things bouille himself augurs not well of it the french army ever since those old bastille days and earlier has been universally in the questionablest state and growing daily worse discipline which is at all times a kind of miracle and works by faith broke down then one sees not with that near prospect of recovering itself the gardes francaises played a deadly game but how they won it and wear the prizes of it all men know in that general overturn we saw the hired fighters refuse to fight the very swiss of chateauvieux which indeed is a kind of french swiss from geneva and the pays de vaud are understood to have declined deserters glided over royalallemand itself looked disconsolate though stanch of purpose in a word we there saw military rule in the shape of poor besenval with that convulsive unmanageable camp of his pass two martyr days on the champdemars and then veiling itself so to speak under the cloud of night depart down the left bank of the seine to seek refuge elsewhere this ground having clearly become too hot for it  but what new ground to seek what remedy to try quarters that were uninfected this doubtless with judicious strictness of drilling were the plan alas in all quarters and places from paris onward to the remotest hamlet is infection is seditious contagion inhaled propagated by contact and converse till the dullest soldier catch it there is speech of men in uniform with men not in uniform men in uniform read journals and even write in them see newspapers of july 1789 in hist parl ii 35 c there are public petitions or remonstrances private emissaries and associations there is discontent jealousy uncertainty sullen suspicious humour the whole french army fermenting in dark heat glooms ominous boding good to no one  so that in the general social dissolution and revolt we are to have this deepest and dismallest kind of it a revolting soldiery barren desolate to look upon is this same business of revolt under all its aspects but how infinitely more so when it takes the aspect of military mutiny the very implement of rule and restraint whereby all the rest was managed and held in order has become precisely the frightfullest immeasurable implement of misrule like the element of fire our indispensable allministering servant when it gets the mastery and becomes conflagration discipline we called a kind of miracle in fact is it not miraculous how one man moves hundreds of thousands each unit of whom it may be loves him not and singly fears him not yet has to obey him to go hither or go thither to march and halt to give death and even to receive it as if a fate had spoken and the wordofcommand becomes almost in the literal sense a magicword  which magicword again if it be once forgotten the spell of it once broken the legions of assiduous ministering spirits rise on you now as menacing fiends your free orderly arena becomes a tumultplace of the nether pit and the hapless magician is rent limb from limb military mobs are mobs with muskets in their hands and also with death hanging over their heads for death is the penalty of disobedience and they have disobeyed and now if all mobs are properly frenzies and work frenetically with mad fits of hot and of cold fierce rage alternating so incoherently with panic terror consider what your military mob will be with such a conflict of duties and penalties whirled between remorse and fury and for the hot fit loaded firearms in its hand to the soldier himself revolt is frightful and oftenest perhaps pitiable and yet so dangerous it can only be hated cannot be pitied an anomalous class of mortals these poor hired killers with a frankness which to the moralist in these times seems surprising they have sworn to become machines and nevertheless they are still partly men let no prudent person in authority remind them of this latter fact but always let force let injustice above all stop short clearly on this side of the reboundingpoint soldiers as we often say do revolt were it not so several things which are transient in this world might be perennial  over and above the general quarrel which all sons of adam maintain with their lot here below the grievances of the french soldiery reduce themselves to two first that their officers are aristocrats secondly that they cheat them of their pay two grievances or rather we might say one capable of becoming a hundred for in that single first proposition that the officers are aristocrats what a multitude of corollaries lie ready it is a bottomless everflowing fountain of grievances this what you may call a general rawmaterial of grievance wherefrom individual grievance after grievance will daily body itself forth nay there will even be a kind of comfort in getting it from time to time so embodied peculation of ones pay it is embodied made tangible made denounceable exhalable if only in angry words  for unluckily that grand fountain of grievances does exist aristocrats almost all our officers necessarily are they have it in the blood and bone by the law of the case no man can pretend to be the pitifullest lieutenant of militia till he have first verified to the satisfaction of the lionking a nobility of four generations not nobility only but four generations of it this latter is the improvement hit upon in comparatively late years by a certain warminister much pressed for commissions dampmartin evenemens i 89 an improvement which did relieve the overpressed warminister but which split france still further into yawning contrasts of commonalty and nobility nay of new nobility and old as if already with your new and old and then with your old older and oldest there were not contrasts and discrepancies enoughthe general clash whereof men now see and hear and in the singular whirlpool all contrasts gone together to the bottom gone to the bottom or going with uproar without return going every where save in the military section of things and there it may be asked can they hope to continue always at the top apparently not  it is true in a time of external peace when there is no fighting but only drilling this question how you rise from the ranks may seem theoretical rather but in reference to the rights of man it is continually practical the soldier has sworn to be faithful not to the king only but to the law and the nation do our commanders love the revolution ask all soldiers unhappily no they hate it and love the counterrevolution young epauletted men with qualityblood in them poisoned with qualitypride do sniff openly with indignation struggling to become contempt at our rights of man as at some newfangled cobweb which shall be brushed down again old officers more cautious keep silent with closed uncurled lips but one guesses what is passing within nay who knows how under the plausiblest word of command might lie counterrevolution itself sale to exiled princes and the austrian kaiser treacherous aristocrats hoodwinking the small insight of us common menin such manner works that general rawmaterial of grievance disastrous instead of trust and reverence breeding hate endless suspicion the impossibility of commanding and obeying and now when this second more tangible grievance has articulated itself universally in the mind of the common man peculation of his pay peculation of the despicablest sort does exist and has long existed but unless the newdeclared rights of man and all rights whatsoever be a cobweb it shall no longer exist  the french military system seems dying a sorrowful suicidal death nay more citizen as is natural ranks himself against citizen in this cause the soldier finds audience of numbers and sympathy unlimited among the patriot lowerclasses nor are the higher wanting to the officer the officer still dresses and perfumes himself for such sad unemigrated soiree as there may still be and speaks his woeswhich woes are they not majestys and natures speaks at the same time his gay defiance his firmset resolution citizens still more citizenesses see the right and the wrong not the military system alone will die by suicide but much along with it as was said there is yet possible a deepest overturn than any yet witnessed that deepest upturn of the blackburning sulphurous stratum whereon all rests and grows  but how these things may act on the rude soldiermind with its military pedantries its inexperience of all that lies off the paradeground inexperience as of a child yet fierceness of a man and vehemence of a frenchman it is long that secret communings in messroom and guardroom sour looks thousandfold petty vexations between commander and commanded measure every where the weary military day ask captain dampmartin an authentic ingenious literary officer of horse who loves the reign of liberty after a sort yet has had his heart grieved to the quick many times in the hot southwestern region and elsewhere and has seen riot civil battle by daylight and by torchlight and anarchy hatefuller than death how insubordinate troopers with drink in their heads meet captain dampmartin and another on the ramparts where there is no escape or sidepath and make military salute punctually for we look calm on them yet make it in a snappish almost insulting manner how one morning they leave all their chamois shirts and superfluous buffs which they are tired of laid in piles at the captains doors whereat we laugh as the ass does eating thistles nay how they knot two foragecords together with universal noisy cursing with evident intent to hang the quartermasterall this the worthy captain looking on it through the ruddyandsable of fond regretful memory has flowingly written down dampmartin evenemens i 122146 men growl in vague discontent officers fling up their commissions and emigrate in disgust  or let us ask another literary officer not yet captain sublieutenant only in the artillery regiment la fere a young man of twentyone not unentitled to speak the name of him is napoleon buonaparte to such height of sublieutenancy has he now got promoted from brienne school five years ago being found qualified in mathematics by la place he is lying at auxonne in the west in these months not sumptuously lodgedin the house of a barber to whose wife he did not pay the customary degree of respect or even over at the pavilion in a chamber with bare walls the only furniture an indifferent bed without curtains two chairs and in the recess of a window a table covered with books and papers his brother louis sleeps on a coarse mattrass in an adjoining room however he is doing something great writing his first book or pamphleteloquent vehement letter to m matteo buttafuoco our corsican deputy who is not a patriot but an aristocrat unworthy of deputyship joly of dole is publisher the literary sublieutenant corrects the proofs sets out on foot from auxonne every morning at four oclock for dole after looking over the proofs he partakes of an extremely frugal breakfast with joly and immediately prepares for returning to his garrison where he arrives before noon having thus walked above twenty miles in the course of the morning  this sublieutenant can remark that in drawingrooms on streets on highways at inns every where mens minds are ready to kindle into a flame that a patriot if he appear in the drawingroom or amid a group of officers is liable enough to be discouraged so great is the majority against him but no sooner does he get into the street or among the soldiers than he feels again as if the whole nation were with him that after the famous oath to the king to the nation and law there was a great change that before this if ordered to fire on the people he for one would have done it in the kings name but that after this in the nations name he would not have done it likewise that the patriot officers more numerous too in the artillery and engineers than elsewhere were few in number yet that having the soldiers on their side they ruled the regiment and did often deliver the aristocrat brother officer out of peril and strait one day for example a member of our own mess

struggling always to hope the best not from new organisation but from happy counterrevolution and return to the old for the rest it is clear to him that this same national federation and universal swearing and fraternising of people and soldiers has done incalculable mischief so much that fermented secretly has hereby got vent and become open national guards and soldiers of the line solemnly embracing one another on all paradefields drinking swearing patriotic oaths fall into disorderly streetprocessions constitutional unmilitary exclamations and hurrahings on which account the regiment

at furthest a month of that sublime feast of pikes the whole french army demanding arrears forming reading clubs frequenting popular societies is in a state which bouille can call by no name but that of mutiny bouille knows it as few do and speaks by dire experience take one instance instead of many  it is still an early day of august the precise date now undiscoverable when bouille about to set out for the waters of aix la chapelle is once more suddenly summoned to the barracks of metz the soldiers stand ranked in fighting order muskets loaded the officers all there on compulsion and require with manyvoiced emphasis to have their arrears paid picardie was penitent but we see it has relapsed the wide space bristles and lours with mere mutinous armed men brave bouille advances to the nearest regiment opens his commanding lips to harangue obtains nothing but querulousindignant discordance and the sound of so many thousand livres legally due the moment is trying there are some ten thousand soldiers now in metz and one spirit seems to have spread among them  bouille is firm as the adamant but what shall he do a german regiment named of salm is thought to be of better temper nevertheless salm too may have heard of the precept thou shalt not steal salm too may know that money is money bouille walks trustfully towards the regiment de salm speaks trustful words but here again is answered by the cry of fortyfour thousand livres odd sous a cry waxing more and more vociferous as salms humour mounts which cry as it will produce no cash or promise of cash ends in the wide simultaneous whirr of shouldered muskets and a determined quicktime march on the part of salmtowards its colonels house in the next street there to seize the colours and military chest thus does salm for its part strong in the faith that meum is not tuum that fair speeches are not fortyfour thousand livres odd sous  unrestrainable salm tramps to military time quick consuming the way bouille and the officers drawing sword have to dash into double quick pasdecharge or unmilitary running to get the start to station themselves on the outer staircase and stand there with what of deathdefiance and sharp steel they have salm truculently coiling itself up rank after rank opposite them in such humour as we can fancy which happily has not yet mounted to the murderpitch there will bouille stand certain at least of one mans purpose in grim calmness awaiting the issue what the intrepidest of men and generals can do is done bouille though there is a barricading picket at each end of the street and death under his eyes contrives to send for a dragoon regiment with orders to charge the dragoon officers mount the dragoon men will not hope is none there for him the street as we say barricaded the earth all shut out only the indifferent heavenly vault overhead perhaps here or there a timorous householder peering out of window with prayer for bouille copious rascality on the pavement with prayer for salm there do the two parties standlike chariots locked in a narrow thoroughfare like locked wrestlers at a deadgrip for two hours they stand bouilles sword glittering in his hand adamantine resolution clouding his brows for two hours by the clocks of metz moodysilent stands salm with occasional clangour but does not fire rascality from time to time urges some grenadier to level his musket at the general who looks on it as a bronze general would and always some corporal or other strikes it up  in such remarkable attitude standing on that staircase for two hours does brave bouille long a shadow dawn on us visibly out of the dimness and become a person for the rest since salm has not shot him at the first instant and since in himself there is no variableness the danger will diminish the mayor a man infinitely respectable with his municipals and tricolor sashes finally gains entrance remonstrates perorates promises gets salm persuaded home to its barracks next day our respectable mayor lending the money the officers pay down the half of the demand in ready cash with which liquidation salm pacifies itself and for the present all is hushed up as much as may be bouille i 1405  such scenes as this of metz or preparations and demonstrations towards such are universal over france dampmartin with his knotted foragecords and piled chamois jackets is at strasburg in the southeast in these same days or rather nights royal champagne is shouting vive la nation au diable les aristocrates with some thirty lit candles at hesdin on the far northwest the

national assembly to occupy itself with these objects military france is everywhere full of sour inflammatory humour which exhales itself fuliginously this way or that a whole continent of smoking flax which blown on here or there by any angry wind might so easily start into a blaze into a continent of fire  constitutional patriotism is in deep natural alarm at these things the august assembly sits diligently deliberating dare nowise resolve with mirabeau on an instantaneous disbandment and extinction finds that a course of palliatives is easier but at least and lowest this grievance of the arrears shall be rectified a plan much noised of in those days under the name decree of the sixth of august has been devised for that inspectors shall visit all armies and with certain elected corporals and soldiers able to write verify what arrears and peculations do lie due and make them good well if in this way the smoky heat be cooled down if it be not as we say ventilated overmuch or by sparks and collision somewhere sent up    chapter 22iv  arrears at nanci  we are to remark however that of all districts this of bouilles seems the inflammablest it was always to bouille and metz that royalty would fly austria lies near here more than elsewhere must the disunited people look over the borders into a dim sea of foreign politics and diplomacies with hope or apprehension with mutual exasperation  it was but in these days that certain austrian troops marching peaceably across an angle of this region seemed an invasion realised and there rushed towards stenai with musket on shoulder from all the winds some thirty thousand national guards to inquire what the matter was moniteur seance du 9 aout 1790 a matter of mere diplomacy it proved the austrian kaiser in haste to get to belgium had bargained for this short cut the infinite dim movement of european politics waved a skirt over these spaces passing on its way like the passing shadow of a condor and such a winged flight of thirty thousand with mixed cackling and crowing rose in consequence for in addition to all this people as we said is much divided aristocrats abound patriotism has both aristocrats and austrians to watch it is lorraine this region not so illuminated as old france it remembers ancient feudalisms nay within mans memory it had a court and king of its own or indeed the splendour of a court and king without the burden then contrariwise the mother society which sits in the jacobins church at paris has daughters in the towns here shrilltongued driven acrid consider how the memory of good king stanislaus and ages of imperial feudalism may comport with this new acrid evangel and what a virulence of discord there may be in all which the soldiery officers on one side private men on the other takes part and now indeed principal part a soldiery moreover all the hotter here as it lies the denser the frontier province requiring more of it  so stands lorraine but the capital city more especially so the pleasant city of nanci which faded feudalism loves where king stanislaus personally dwelt and shone has an aristocrat municipality and then also a daughter society it has some forty thousand divided souls of population and three large regiments one of which is swiss chateauvieux dear to patriotism ever since it refused fighting or was thought to refuse in the bastille days here unhappily all evil influences seem to meet concentered here of all places may jealousy and heat evolve itself these many months accordingly man has been set against man washed against unwashed patriot soldier against aristocrat captain ever the more bitterly and a long score of grudges has been running up  nameable grudges and likewise unnameable for there is a punctual nature in wrath and daily were there but glances of the eye tones of the voice and minutest commissions or omissions it will jot down somewhat to account under the head of sundries which always swells the sumtotal for example in april last in those times of preliminary federation when national guards and soldiers were every where swearing brotherhood and all france was locally federating preparing for the grand national feast of pikes it was observed that these nanci officers threw cold water on the whole brotherly business that they first hung back from appearing at the nanci federation then did appear but in mere redingote and undress with scarcely a clean shirt on nay that one of them as the national colours flaunted by in that solemn moment did without visible necessity take occasion to spit deux amis v 217  small sundries as per journal but then incessant ones the aristocrat municipality pretending to be constitutional keeps mostly quiet not so the daughter society the five thousand adult male patriots of the place still less the five thousand female not so the young whiskered or whiskerless fourgeneration noblesse in epaulettes the grim patriot swiss of chateauvieux effervescent infantry of regiment du roi hot troopers of mestredecamp walled nanci which stands so bright and trim with its straight streets spacious squares and stanislaus architecture on the fruitful alluvium of the meurthe so bright amid the yellow cornfields in these reapermonthsis inwardly but a den of discord anxiety inflammability not far from exploding let bouille look to it if that universal military heat which we liken to a vast continent of smoking flax do any where take fire his beard here in lorraine and nanci may the most readily of all get singed by it  bouille for his part is busy enough but only with the general superintendence getting his pacified salm and all other still tolerable regiments marched out of metz to southward towns and villages to rural cantonments as at vic marsal and thereabout by the still waters where is plenty of horseforage sequestered paradeground and the soldiers speculative faculty can be stilled by drilling salm as we said received only half payment of arrears naturally not without grumbling nevertheless that scene of the drawn sword may after all have raised bouille in the mind of salm for men and soldiers love intrepidity and swift inflexible decision even when they suffer by it as indeed is not this fundamentally the quality of qualities for a man a quality which by itself is next to nothing since inferior animals asses dogs even mules have it yet in due combination it is the indispensable basis of all  of nanci and its heats bouille commander of the whole knows nothing special understands generally that the troops in that city are perhaps the worst bouille i c 9 the officers there have it all as they have long had it to themselves and unhappily seem to manage it ill fifty yellow furloughs given out in one batch do surely betoken difficulties but what was patriotism to think of certain lightfencing fusileers set on or supposed to be set on to insult the grenadierclub considerate speculative grenadiers and that readingroom of theirs with shoutings with hootings till the speculative grenadier drew his sidearms too and there ensued battery and duels nay more are not swashbucklers of the same stamp sent out visibly or sent out presumably now in the dress of soldiers to pick quarrels with the citizens now disguised as citizens to pick quarrels with the soldiers for a certain roussiere expert in fence was taken in the very fact four officers presumably of tender years hounding him on who thereupon fled precipitately fencemaster roussiere haled to the guardhouse had sentence of three months imprisonment but his comrades demanded yellow furlough for him of all persons nay thereafter they produced him on parade capped him in paperhelmet inscribed iscariot marched him to the gate of city and there sternly commanded him to vanish for evermore  on all which suspicions accusations and noisy procedure and on enough of the like continually accumulating the officer could not but look with disdainful indignation perhaps disdainfully express the same in words and soon after fly over to the austrians  so that when it here as elsewhere comes to the question of arrears the humour and procedure is of the bitterest regiment mestredecamp getting amid loud clamour some three gold louis amanwhich have as usual to be borrowed from the municipality swiss chateauvieux applying for the like but getting instead instantaneous courrois or catoninetails with subsequent unsufferable hisses from the women and children regiment du roi sick of hope deferred at length seizing its military chest and marching it to quarters but next day marching it back again through streets all struck silentunordered paradings and clamours not without strong liquor objurgation insubordination your military ranked arrangement going all as the typographers say of set types in a similar case rapidly to pie deux amis v c 8 such is nanci in these early days of august the sublime feast of pikes not yet a month old  constitutional patriotism at paris and elsewhere may well quake at the news warminister latour du pin runs breathless to the national assembly with a written message that all is burning tout brule tout presse the national assembly on spur of the instant renders such decret and order to submit and repent as he requires if it will avail any thing on the other hand journalism through all its throats gives hoarse outcry condemnatory elegiacapplausive the fortyeight sections lift up voices sonorous brewer or call him now colonel santerre is not silent in the faubourg saintantoine for meanwhile the nanci soldiers have sent a deputation of ten furnished with documents and proofs who will tell another story than the allisburning one which deputed ten before ever they reach the assembly hall assiduous latour du pin picks up and on warrant of mayor bailly claps in prison most unconstitutionally for they had officers furloughs whereupon saintantoine in indignant uncertainty of the future closes its shops is bouille a traitor then sold to austria in that case these poor private sentinels have revolted mainly out of patriotism  new deputation deputation of national guardsmen now sets forth from nanci to enlighten the assembly it meets the old deputed ten returning quite unexpectedly unhanged and proceeds thereupon with better prospects but effects nothing deputations government messengers orderlies at handgallops alarms thousandvoiced rumours go vibrating continually backwards and forwardsscattering distraction not till the last week of august does m de malseigne selected as inspector get down to the scene of mutiny with authority with cash and decree of the sixth of august he now shall see these arrears liquidated justice done or at least tumult quashed    chapter 22v  inspector malseigne  of inspector malseigne we discern by direct light that he is of herculean stature and infer with probability that he is of truculent moustachioed aspectfor royalist officers now leave the upper lip unshaven that he is of indomitable bullheart and also unfortunately of thick bullhead  on tuesday the 24th of august 1790 he opens session as inspecting commissioner meets those elected corporals and soldiers that can write he finds the accounts of chateauvieux to be complex to require delay and reference he takes to haranguing to reprimanding ends amid audible grumbling next morning he resumes session not at the townhall as prudent municipals counselled but once more at the barracks unfortunately chateauvieux grumbling all night will now hear of no delay or reference from reprimanding on his part it goes to bullyinganswered with continual cries of jugez tout de suite judge it at once whereupon m de malseigne will off in a huff but lo chateau vieux swarming all about the barrackcourt has sentries at every gate m de malseigne demanding egress cannot get it though commandant denoue backs him can get only jugez tout de suite here is a nodus  bullhearted m de malseigne draws his sword and will force egress confused splutter m de malseignes sword breaks he snatches commandant denoues the sentry is wounded m de malseigne whom one is loath to kill does force egressfollowed by chateauvieux all in disarray a spectacle to nanci m de malseigne walks at a sharp pace yet never runs wheeling from time to time with menaces and movements of fence and so reaches denoues house unhurt which house chateauvieux in an agitated manner investshindered as yet from entering by a crowd of officers formed on the staircase m de malseigne retreats by back ways to the townhall flustered though undaunted amid an escort of national guards from the townhall he on the morrow emits fresh orders fresh plans of settlement with chateauvieux to none of which will chateauvieux listen whereupon finally he amid noise enough emits order that chateauvieux shall march on the morrow morning and quarter at sarre louis chateauvieux flatly refuses marching m de malseigne takes act due notarial protest of such refusalif happily that may avail him  this is end of thursday and indeed of m de malseignes inspectorship which has lasted some fifty hours to such length in fifty hours has he unfortunately brought it mestredecamp and regiment du roi hang as it were fluttering chateauvieux is clean gone in what way we see over night an aidedecamp of lafayettes stationed here for such emergency sends swift emissaries far and wide to summon national guards the slumber of the country is broken by clattering hoofs by loud fraternal knockings every where the constitutional patriot must clutch his fightinggear and take the road for nanci  and thus the herculean inspector has sat all thursday among terrorstruck municipals a centre of confused noise all thursday friday and till saturday towards noon chateauvieux in spite of the notarial protest will not march a step as many as four thousand national guards are dropping or pouring in uncertain what is expected of them still more uncertain what will be obtained of them for all is uncertainty commotion and suspicion there goes a word that bouille beginning to bestir himself in the rural cantonments eastward is but a royalist traitor that chateauvieux and patriotism are sold to austria of which latter m de malseigne is probably some agent mestredecamp and roi flutter still more questionably chateauvieux far from marching waves red flags out of two carriages in a passionate manner along the streets and next morning answers its officers pay us then and we will march with you to the worlds end  under which circumstances towards noon on saturday m de malseigne thinks it were good perhaps to inspect the rampartson horseback he mounts accordingly with escort of three troopers at the gate of the city he bids two of them wait for his return and with the third a trooper to be depended upon hegallops off for luneville where lies a certain carabineer regiment not yet in a mutinous state the two left troopers soon get uneasy discover how it is and give the alarm mestredecamp to the number of a hundred saddles in frantic haste as if sold to austria gallops out pellmell in chase of its inspector and so they spur and the inspector spurs careering with noise and jingle up the valley of the river meurthe towards luneville and the midday sun through an astonished country indeed almost their own astonishment  what a hunt actaeonlikewhich actaeon de malseigne happily gains to arms ye carabineers of luneville to chastise mutinous men insulting your general officer insulting your own quartersabove all things fire soon lest there be parleying and ye refuse to fire the carabineers fire soon exploding upon the first stragglers of mestredecamp who shrink at the very flash and fall back hastily on nanci in a state not far from distraction panic and fury sold to austria without an if so much per regiment the very sums can be specified and traitorous malseigne is fled help o heaven help thou earthye unwashed patriots ye too are sold like us  effervescent regiment du roi primes its firelocks mestredecamp saddles wholly commandant denoue is seized is flung in prison with a canvass shirt sarreau de toile about him chateauvieux bursts up the magazines distributes three thousand fusils to a patriot people austria shall have a hot bargain alas the unhappy huntingdogs as we said have hunted away their huntsman and do now run howling and baying on what trail they know not nigh rabid  and so there is tumultuous march of men through the night with halt on the heights of flinval whence luneville can be seen all illuminated then there is parley at four in the morning and reparley finally there is agreement the carabineers give in malseigne is surrendered with apologies on all sides after weary confused hours he is even got under way the lunevillers all turning out in the idle sunday to see such departure homegoing of mutinous mestredecamp with its inspector captive mestredecamp accordingly marches the lunevillers look see at the corner of the first street our inspector bounds off again bullhearted as he is amid the slash of sabres the crackle of musketry and escapes full gallop with only a ball lodged in his buffjerkin the herculean man and yet it is an escape to no purpose for the carabineers to whom after the hardest sundays ride on record he has come circling back stand deliberating by their nocturnal watchfires deliberating of austria of traitors and the rage of mestredecamp so that on the whole the next sight we have is that of m de malseigne on the monday afternoon faring bullhearted through the streets of nanci in open carriage a soldier standing over him with drawn sword amid the furies of the women hedges of national guards and confusion

concentred unhappily still in small force at the village of frouarde within some few miles son of adam with a more dubious task before him is not in the world this tuesday morning a weltering inflammable sea of doubt and peril and bouille sure of simply one thing his own determination which one thing indeed may be worth many he puts a most firm face on the matter submission or unsparing battle and destruction twentyfour hours to make your choice this was the tenor of his proclamation thirty copies of which he sent yesterday to nanciall which we find were intercepted and not posted compare bouille memoires i 153176 deux amis v 251271 hist parl ubi supra  nevertheless at halfpast eleven this morning seemingly by way of answer there does wait on him at frouarde some deputation from the mutinous regiments from the nanci municipals to see what can be done bouille receives this deputation in a large open court adjoining his lodging pacified salm and the rest attend also being invited to do itall happily still in the right humour the mutineers pronounce themselves with a decisiveness which to bouille seems insolence and happily to salm also salm forgetful of the metz staircase and sabre demands that the scoundrels be hanged there and then bouille represses the hanging but answers that mutinous soldiers have one course and not more than one to liberate with heartfelt contrition messieurs denoue and de malseigne to get ready forthwith for marching off whither he shall order and submit and repent as the national assembly has decreed as he yesterday did in thirty printed placards proclaim these are his terms unalterable as the decrees of destiny which terms as they the mutineer deputies seemingly do not accept it were good for them to vanish from this spot and even promptly with him too in few instants the word will be forward the mutineer deputies vanish not unpromptly the municipal ones anxious beyond right for their own individualities prefer abiding with bouille  brave bouille though he puts a most firm face on the matter knows his position full well how at nanci what with rebellious soldiers with uncertain national guards and so many distributed fusils there rage and roar some ten thousand fighting men while with himself is scarcely the third part of that number in national guards also uncertain in mere pacified regimentsfor the present full of rage and clamour to march but whose rage and clamour may next moment take such a fatal new figure on the top of one uncertain billow therewith to calm billows bouille must abandon himself to fortune who is said sometimes to favour the brave at halfpast twelve the mutineer deputies having vanished our drums beat we march for nanci let nanci bethink itself then for bouille has thought and determined  and yet how shall nanci think not a city but a bedlam grim chateauvieux is for defence to the death forces the municipality to order by tap of drum all citizens acquainted with artillery to turn out and assist in managing the cannon on the other hand effervescent regiment du roi is drawn up in its barracks quite disconsolate hearing the humour salm is in and ejaculates dolefully from its thousand throats la loi la loi law law mestredecamp blusters with profane swearing in mixed terror and furor national guards look this way and that not knowing what to do what a bedlamcity as many plans as heads all ordering none obeying quiet noneexcept the dead who sleep underground having done their fighting  and behold bouille proves as good as his word at halfpast two scouts report that he is within half a league of the gates rattling along with cannon and array breathing nothing but destruction a new deputation municipals mutineers officers goes out to meet him with passionate entreaty for yet one other hour bouille grants an hour then at the end thereof no denoue or malseigne appearing as promised he rolls his drums and again takes the road towards four oclock the terrorstruck townsmen may see him face to face his cannons rattle there in their carriages his vanguard is within thirty paces of the gate stanislaus onward like a planet by appointed times by law of nature what next lo flag of truce and chamade conjuration to halt malseigne and denoue are on the street coming hither the soldiers all repentant ready to submit and march adamantine bouilles look alters not yet the word halt is given gladder moment he never saw joy of joys malseigne and denoue do verily issue escorted by national guards from streets all frantic with sale to austria and so forth they salute bouille unscathed bouille steps aside to speak with them and with other heads of the town there having already ordered by what gates and routes the mutineer regiments shall file out  such colloquy with these two general officers and other principal townsmen was natural enough nevertheless one wishes bouille had postponed it and not stepped aside such tumultuous inflammable masses tumbling along making way for each other this of keen nitrous oxide that of sulphurous firedampwere it not well to stand between them keeping them well separate till the space be

by subsequent contradiction civil war indeed is chaos and in all vital chaos there is new order shaping itself free but what a faith this that of all new orders out of chaos and possibility of man and

still force else how could it rot our whole universe is but an infinite complex of forces thousandfold from gravitation up to thought and will mans freedom environed with necessity of nature in all

from all transcendentalism is it not a plain truth of sense which the duller mind can even consider as a truism that human things wholly are in continual movement and action and reaction working continually forward phasis after phasis by unalterable laws towards prescribed issues how often must we say and yet not rightly lay to heart the seed that is sown it will spring given the summers blossoming then there is also given the autumnal withering so is it ordered not with seedfields only but with transactions arrangements philosophies societies french revolutions whatsoever man works with in this lower world the beginning holds in it the end and all that leads thereto as the acorn does the oak and its fortunes solemn enough did we think of itwhich unhappily and also happily we do not very much thou there canst begin the beginning is for thee and there but where and of what sort and for whom will the end be all grows and seeks and endures its destinies consider likewise how much grows as the trees do whether we think of it or not so that when your epimenides your somnolent peter klaus since named rip van winkle awakens again he finds it a changed world in that sevenyears sleep of his so much has changed all that is without us will change while we think not of it much even that is within us the truth that was yesterday a restless problem has today grown a belief burning to be uttered on the morrow contradiction has exasperated it into mad fanaticism obstruction has dulled it into sick inertness it is sinking towards silence of satisfaction or of resignation today is not yesterday for man or for thing yesterday there was the oath of love today has come the curse of hate not willingly ah no but it could not help coming the golden radiance of youth would it willingly have tarnished itself into the dimness of old agefearful how we stand enveloped deepsunk in that mystery of time and are sons of time fashioned and woven out of time and on us and on all that we have or see or do is written rest not continue not forward to thy doom  but in seasons of revolution which indeed distinguish themselves from common seasons by their velocity mainly your miraculous sevensleeper might with miracle enough wake sooner not by the century or seven years need he sleep often not by the seven months fancy for example some new peter klaus sated with the jubilee of that federation day had lain down say directly after the blessing of talleyrand and reckoning it all safe now had fallen composedly asleep under the timberwork of the fatherlands altar to sleep there not twentyone years but as it were year and day the cannonading of nanci so far off does not disturb him nor does the black mortcloth close at hand nor the requiems chanted and minute guns incensepans and concourse right over his head none of these but peter sleeps through them all through one circling year as we say from july 14th of 1790 till july the 17th of 1791 but on that latter day no klaus nor most leaden epimenides only the dead could continue sleeping and so our miraculous peter klaus awakens with what eyes o peter earth and sky have still their joyous july look and the champdemars is multitudinous with men but the jubileehuzzahing has become bedlamshrieking of terror and revenge not blessing of talleyrand or any blessing but cursing imprecation and shrill wail our cannonsalvoes are turned to sharp shot for swinging of incensepans and eightythree departmental banners we have waving of the one sanguinous drapeaurougethou foolish klaus the one lay in the other the one was the other minus time even as hannibals rockrending vinegar lay in the sweet new wine that sweet federation was of last year this sour divulsion is the selfsame substance only older by the appointed days  no miraculous klaus or epimenides sleeps in these times and yet may not many a man if of due opacity and levity act the same miracle in a natural way we mean with his eyes open eyes has he but he sees not except what is under his nose with a sparkling briskness of glance as if he not only saw but saw through such a one goes whisking assiduous in his circle of officialities not dreaming but that it is the whole world as indeed where your vision terminates does not inanity begin there and the worlds end clearly declares itselfto you whereby our brisk sparkling assiduous official person call him for instance lafayette suddenly startled after year and day by huge grapeshot tumult stares not less astonished at it than peter klaus would have done such naturalmiracle lafayette can perform and indeed not he only but most other officials nonofficials and generally the whole french people can perform it and do bounce up ever and anon like amazed sevensleepers awakening awakening amazed at the noise they themselves make so strangely is freedom as we say environed in necessity such a singular somnambulism of conscious and unconscious of voluntary and involuntary is this life of man if any where in the world there was astonishment that the federation oath went into grapeshot surely of all persons the french first swearers and then shooters felt astonished the most  alas offences must come the sublime feast of pikes with its effulgence of brotherly love unknown since the age of gold has changed nothing that prurient heat in twentyfive millions of hearts is not cooled thereby but is still hot nay hotter lift off the pressure of command from so many millions all pressure or binding rule except such melodramatic federation oath as they have bound themselves with for thou shalt was from of old the condition of mans being and his weal and blessedness was in obeying that wo for him when were it on hest of the clearest necessity rebellion disloyal isolation and mere i will becomes his rule but the gospel of jeanjacques has come and the first sacrament of it has been celebrated all things as we say are got into hot and hotter prurience and must go on pruriently fermenting in continual change noted or unnoted  worn out with disgusts captain after captain in royalist moustachioes mounts his warhorse or his rozinante

another lord of land is gone not taking the land with him nay what of captains and emigrating seigneurs there is not an angry word on any of those twentyfive million french tongues and indeed not an angry thought in their hearts but is some fraction of the great battle add many successions of angry words together you have the manual brawl add brawls together with the festering sorrows they leave and they rise to riots and revolts one reverend thing after another ceases to meet reverence in visible material combustion chateau after chateau mounts up in spiritual invisible combustion one

keeps continual hubbub time is around it and eternity and the inane and it does what it can what is given it to do  glancing reluctantly in once more we discern little that is edifying a constitutional theory of defective verbs struggling forward with perseverance amid endless interruptions mirabeau from his tribune with the weight of his name and genius awing down much jacobin violence which in return vents itself the louder over in its jacobins hall and even reads him sharp lectures there camilles journal in hist parl ix 36685 this mans path is mysterious questionable difficult and he walks without companion in it pure patriotism does not now count him among her chosen pure royalism abhors him yet his weight with the world is overwhelming let him travel on companionless unwavering whither he is boundwhile it is yet day with him and the night has not come  but the chosen band of pure patriot brothers is small counting only some thirty seated now on the extreme tip of the left separate from the world a virtuous petion an incorruptible robespierre most consistent incorruptible of thin acrid men triumvirs barnave duport lameth great in speech thought action each according to his kind a lean old goupil de prefeln on these and what will follow them has pure patriotism to depend  there too conspicuous among the thirty if seldom audible philippe dorleans may be seen sitting in dim fuliginous bewilderment having one might say arrived at chaos gleams there are at once of a lieutenancy and regency debates in the assembly itself of succession to the throne in case the present branch should fail and philippe they say walked anxiously in silence through the corridors till such high argument were done but it came all to nothing mirabeau glaring into the man and through him had to ejaculate in strong untranslatable language ce jfne vaut pas la peine quon se donne pour lui it came all to nothing and in the meanwhile philippes money they say is gone could he refuse a little cash to the gifted patriot in want only of that he himself in want of all but that not a pamphlet can be printed without cash or indeed written without food purchasable by cash without cash your hopefullest projector cannot stir from the spot individual patriotic or other projects require cash how much more do widespread intrigues which live and exist by cash lying widespread with dragonappetite for cash fit to swallow princedoms and so prince philippe amid his sillerys lacloses and confused sons of night has rolled along the centre of the strangest cloudy coil out of which has visibly come as we often say an epic preternatural machinery of suspicion and within which there has dwelt and workedwhat specialties of treason stratagem aimed or aimless endeavour towards mischief no party living if it be not the presiding genius of it prince of the power of the air has now any chance to know camilles conjecture is the likeliest that poor philippe did mount up a little way in treasonable speculation as he mounted formerly in one of the earliest balloons but frightened at the new position he was getting into had soon turned the cock again and come down more fool than he rose to create preternatural suspicion this was his function in the revolutionary epos but now if he have lost his cornucopia of readymoney what else had he to lose in thick darkness inward and outward he must welter and flounder on in that piteous deathelement the hapless man once or even twice we shall still behold him emerged struggling out of the thick deathelement in vain for one moment it is the last moment he starts aloft or is flung aloft even into clearness and a kind of memorabilityto sink then for evermore  the cote droit persists no less nay with more animation than ever though hope has now well nigh fled tough abbe maury when the obscure country royalist grasps his hand with transport of thanks answers rolling his indomitable brazen head helas monsieur all that i do here is as good as simply nothing gallant faussigny visible this one time in history advances frantic into the middle of the hall exclaiming there is but one way of dealing with it and that is to fall sword in hand on those gentry there sabre a la main sur ces gaillards la moniteur seance du 21 aout 1790 franticly indicating our chosen thirty on the extreme tip of the left whereupon is clangour and clamour debate repentanceevaporation things ripen towards downright incompatibility and what is called scission that fierce theoretic onslaught of faussignys was in august 1790 next august will not have come till a famed two hundred and ninetytwo the chosen of royalism make solemn final scission from an assembly given up to faction and depart shaking the dust off their feet  connected with this matter of sword in hand there is yet another thing to be noted of duels we have sometimes spoken how in all parts of france innumerable duels were fought and argumentative men and messmates flinging down the winecup and weapons of reason and repartee met in the measured field to part bleeding or perhaps not to part but to fall mutually skewered through with iron their wrath and life alike endingand die as fools die long has this lasted and still lasts but now it would seem as if in an august assembly itself traitorous royalism in its despair had taken to a new course that of cutting off patriotism by systematic duel bullyswordsmen spadassins of that party go swaggering or indeed they can be had for a trifle of money twelve spadassins were seen by the yellow eye of journalism arriving recently out of switzerland also a considerable number of assassins nombre considerable dassassins exercising in fencingschools and at pistoltargets any patriot deputy of mark can be called out let him escape one time or ten times a time there necessarily is when he must fall and france mourn how many cartels has mirabeau had especially while he was the peoples champion cartels by the hundred which he since the constitution must be made first and his time is precious answers now always with a kind of stereotype formula monsieur you are put upon my list but i warn you that it is long and i grant no preferences  then in autumn had we not the duel of cazales and barnave the two chief masters of tongueshot meeting now to exchange pistolshot for cazales chief of the royalists

fine brow from more than temporary injury but how easily might the lot have fallen the other way and barnaves hat not been so good patriotism raises its loud denunciation of duelling in general

was received at the jacobins with embraces yet with rebukes  mindful of which and also that his repetition in america was that of headlong foolhardiness rather and want of brain not of heart charles lameth does on the eleventh day of november with little emotion decline attending some hot young gentleman from artois come expressly to challenge him nay indeed he first coldly engages to attend then coldly permits two friends to attend instead of him and shame the young gentleman out of it which they successfully do a cold procedure satisfactory to the two friends to lameth and the hot young gentleman whereby one might have fancied the whole matter was cooled down  not so however lameth proceeding to his senatorial duties in the decline of the day is met in those assembly corridors by nothing but royalist brocards sniffs huffs and open insults human patience has its limits monsieur said lameth breaking silence to one lautrec a man with hunchback or natural deformity but sharp of tongue and a black of the deepest tint monsieur if you were a man to be fought withi am one cries the young duke de castries fast as fireflash lameth replies tout a lheure on the instant then and so as the shades of dusk thicken in that boisdeboulogne we behold two men with lionlook with alert attitude side foremost right foot advanced flourishing and thrusting stoccado and passado in tierce and quart intent to skewer one another see with most skewering purpose headlong lameth with his whole weight makes a furious lunge but deft castries whisks aside lameth skewers only the airand slits deep

considerable number of assassins exercising at the pistoltarget so meditates and ejaculates hurt patriotism with everdeepening everwidening fervour for the space of six and thirty hours  the thirtysix hours past on saturday the 13th one beholds a new spectacle the rue de varennes and neighbouring boulevard des invalides covered with a mixed flowing multitude the castries hotel gone distracted devilridden belching from every window beds with clothes and curtains plate of silver and gold with filigree mirrors pictures images commodes chiffoniers and endless crockery and jingle amid steady popular cheers absolutely without theft for there goes a cry he shall be hanged that steals a nail it is a plebiscitum or informal iconoclastic decree of the common people in the course of being

unable to decide whether the iconoclastic plebs amount to forty thousand or to two hundred thousand  deputations swift messengers for it is at a distance over the river come and go lafayette and national guardes though without drapeau rouge get under way apparently in no hot haste nay arrived on the scene lafayette salutes with doffed hat before ordering to fix bayonets what avails it the plebeian court of cassation as camille might punningly name it has done its work steps forth with unbuttoned vest with pockets turned inside out sack and just ravage not plunder with inexhaustible patience the hero of two worlds remonstrates persuasively with a kind of sweet constraint though also with fixed bayonets dissipates hushes down on the morrow it is once more all as usual  considering which things however duke castries may justly write to the president justly transport himself across the marches to raise a corps or do what else is in him royalism totally abandons that bobadilian method of contest and the twelve spadassins return to switzerlandor even to dreamland through the horngate whichsoever their home is nay editor prudhomme is authorised to publish a curious thing we

asserted that the king in his tuileries is not free this the poor king may contradict with the official mouth but in his heart feels often to be undeniable civil constitution of the clergy decree of ejectment against dissidents from it not even to this latter though almost his conscience rebels can he say nay but after two months hesitating signs this also it was on january 21st of this 1790 that he signed it to the sorrow of his poor heart yet on another twentyfirst of january whereby come dissident ejected priests unconquerable martyrs according to some incurable chicaning traitors according

meanwhile amid this vague dim whirl of fanfaronades windprojects poniards made to order there does disclose itself one punctumsaliens of life and feasibility the finger of mirabeau mirabeau and the queen of france have met have parted with mutual trust it is strange secret as the mysteries but it is indubitable mirabeau took horse one evening and rode westward unattendedto see friend claviere in that country house of his before getting to clavieres the muchmusing horseman struck aside to a back gate of the garden of saintcloud some duke daremberg or the like was there to introduce him the queen was not far on a round knoll rond point the highest of the garden of saintcloud he beheld the queens face spake with her alone under the void canopy of night what an interview fateful secret for us after all searching like the colloquies of the gods campan ii c 17 she called him a mirabeau elsewhere we read that she was charmed with him the wild submitted titan as indeed it is among the honourable tokens of this high illfated heart that no mind of any endowment no mirabeau nay no barnave no dumouriez ever came face to face with her but in spite of all prepossessions she was forced to recognise it to draw nigh to it with trust high imperial heart with the instinctive attraction towards all that had any height you know not the queen said mirabeau once in confidence her force of mind is prodigious she is a man for courage dumont p 211and so under the void night on the crown of that knoll she has spoken with a mirabeau he has kissed loyally the queenly hand and said with enthusiasm

the fortyeight sections wakeful night and day  patriotism is patient of much not patient of all the cafe de procope has sent visibly along the streets a deputation of patriots to expostulate with bad editors by trustful word of mouth singular to see and hear the bad editors promise to amend but do not deputations for change of ministry were many mayor bailly joining even with cordelier danton in such and they have prevailed with what profit of quacks willing or constrained to be quacks the race is everlasting ministers duportail and dutertre will have to manage much as ministers latourdupin and cice did so welters the confused world  but now beaten on for ever by such inextricable contradictory influences and evidences what is the indigent french patriot in these unhappy days to believe and walk by uncertainty all except that he is wretched indigent that a glorious revolution the wonder of the universe has hitherto brought neither bread nor peace being marred by traitors difficult to discover traitors that dwell in the dark invisible thereor seen for moments in pallid dubious twilight stealthily vanishing thither preternatural suspicion once more rules the minds of men  nobody here writes carra of the annales patriotiques so early as the first of february can entertain a doubt of the constant obstinate project these people have on foot to get the king away or of the perpetual succession of manoeuvres they employ for that nobody the watchful mother of patriotism deputed two members to her daughter at versailles to examine how the matter looked there well and there patriotic carra continues the report of these two deputies we all heard with our own ears last saturday they went with others of versailles to inspect the kings stables also the stables of the whilom gardes du corps they found there from seven to eight hundred horses standing always saddled and bridled ready for the road at a moments notice the same deputies moreover saw with their own two eyes several royal carriages which men were even then busy loading with large wellstuffed luggagebags leather cows as we call them vaches de cuir the royal arms on the panels almost entirely effaced momentous enough also on the same day the whole marechaussee or cavalry police did assemble with arms horses and baggageand disperse again they want the king over the marches that so emperor leopold and the german princes whose troops are ready may have a pretext for beginning this adds carra is the word of the riddle this is the reason why our fugitive aristocrats are now making levies of men on the frontiers expecting that one of these mornings the executive chief magistrate will be brought over to them and the civil war commence carras newspaper 1st feb 1791 in hist parl ix 39  if indeed the executive chief magistrate bagged say in one of these leather cows were once brought safe over to them but the strangest thing of all is that patriotism whether barking at a venture or guided by some instinct of preternatural sagacity is actually barking aright this time at something not at nothing bouilles secret correspondence since made public testifies as much  nay it is undeniable visible to all that mesdames the kings aunts are taking steps for departure asking passports of the ministry safeconducts of the municipality which marat warns all men to beware of they will carry gold with them these old beguines nay they will carry the little dauphin having nursed a changeling for some time to leave in his stead besides they are as some light substance flung up to shew how the wind sits a kind of proofkite you fly off to ascertain whether the grand paperkite evasion of the king may mount  in these alarming circumstances patriotism is not wanting to itself municipality deputes to the king sections depute to the municipality a national assembly will soon stir meanwhile behold on the 19th of february 1791 mesdames quitting bellevue and versailles with all privacy are off towards rome seemingly or one knows not whither they are not without kings passports countersigned and what is more to the purpose a serviceable escort the patriotic mayor or mayorlet of the village of moret tried to detain them but brisk louis de narbonne of the escort dashed off at handgallop returned soon with thirty dragoons and victoriously cut them out and so the poor ancient women go their way to the terror of france and paris whose nervous excitability is become extreme who else would hinder poor loque and graille now grown so old and fallen into such unexpected circumstances when gossip itself turning only on terrors and horrors is no longer pleasant to the mind and you cannot get so much as an orthodox confessor in peacefrom going what way soever the hope of any solacement might lead them  they go poor ancient dameswhom the heart were hard that does not pity they go with palpitations with unmelodious suppressed screechings all france screeching and cackling in loud unsuppressed terror behind and on both hands of them such mutual suspicion is among men at arnay le duc above halfway to the frontiers a patriotic municipality and populace again takes courage to stop them louis narbonne must now back to paris must consult the national assembly national assembly answers not without an effort that mesdames may go whereupon paris rises worse than ever screeching halfdistracted tuileries and precincts are filled with women and men while the national assembly debates this question of questions lafayette is needed at night for dispersing them and the streets are to be illuminated commandant berthier a berthier before whom are great things unknown lies for the present under blockade at bellevue in versailles by no tactics could he get mesdames luggage stirred from the courts there frantic versaillese women came screaming about him his very troops cut the waggontraces he retired to the interior waiting better times campan ii 132  nay in these same hours while mesdames hardly cut out from moret by the sabres edge are driving rapidly to foreign parts and not yet stopped at arnay their august nephew poor monsieur at paris has dived deep into his cellars of the luxembourg for shelter and according to montgaillard can hardly be persuaded up again screeching multitudes environ that luxembourg of his drawn thither by report of his departure but at sight and sound of monsieur they become crowing multitudes and escort madame and him to the tuileries with vivats montgaillard ii 282 deux amis vi c 1 it is a state of nervous excitability such as few nations know    chapter 23v  the day of poniards  or again what means this visible reparation of the castle of vincennes other jails being all crowded with prisoners new space is wanted here that is the municipal account for in such changing of judicatures parlements being abolished and new courts but just set up prisoners have accumulated not to say that in these times of discord and clublaw offences and committals are at any rate more numerous which municipal account does it not sufficiently explain the phenomenon surely to repair the castle of vincennes was of all enterprises that an enlightened municipality could undertake the most innocent  not so however does neighbouring saintantoine look on it saintantoine to whom these peaked turrets and grim donjons alltoo near her own dark dwelling are of themselves an offence was not vincennes a kind of minor bastille great diderot and philosophes have lain in durance here great mirabeau in disastrous eclipse for fortytwo months and now when the old bastille has become a dancingground had any one the mirth to dance and its stones are getting built into the pont louisseize does this minor comparative insignificance of a bastille flank itself with freshhewn mullions spread out tyrannous wings menacing patriotism new space for prisoners and what prisoners a dorleans with the chief patriots on the tip of the left it is said there runs a subterranean passage all the way from the tuileries hither who knows paris mined with quarries and catacombs does hang wondrous over the abyss paris was once to

morning and with cannon of long range foudroyer bethunder a patriotic saintantoine into smoulder and ruin  so meditates the benighted soul of saintantoine as it sees the aproned workmen in early spring busy on these towers an officialspeaking municipality a sieur motier with his legions of mouchards deserve no trust at all were patriot santerre indeed commander but the sonorous brewer commands only our own battalion of such secrets he can explain nothing knows nothing perhaps suspects much and so the work goes on and afflicted benighted saintantoine hears rattle of hammers sees stones suspended in air montgaillard ii 285  saintantoine prostrated the first great bastille will it falter over this comparative insignificance of a bastille friends what if we took pikes firelocks sledgehammers and helped ourselvesspeedier is no remedy nor so certain on the 28th day of february saintantoine turns out as it has now often done and apparently with little superfluous tumult moves eastward to that eyesorrow of vincennes with grave voice of authority no need of bullying and shouting saintantoine signifies to parties concerned there that its purpose is to have this suspicious stronghold razed level with the general soil of the country remonstrance may be proffered with zeal but it avails not the outer gate goes up drawbridges tumble iron windowstanchions smitten out with sledgehammers become ironcrowbars it rains furniture stonemasses slates with chaotic clatter and rattle demolition clatters down and now hasty expresses rush through the agitated streets to warn

remaining institution of the country is coming down deux amis vi 1115 newspapers in hist parl ix 11117  quick then let lafayette roll his drums and fly eastward for to all constitutional patriots this

these the jeerings provocative gambollings of that patriot suburb which is all out on the streets now are hard to endure unwashed patriots jeering in sulky sport one unwashed patriot seizing the general by the boot to unhorse him santerre ordered to fire makes answer obliquely these are the men that took the bastille and not a trigger stirs neither dare the vincennes magistracy give warrant of arrestment or the smallest countenance wherefore the general will take it on himself to arrest by promptitude by cheerful adroitness patience and brisk valour without limits the riot may be again bloodlessly appeased  meanwhile the rest of paris with more or less unconcern may mind the rest of its business for what is this but an effervescence of which there are now so many the national assembly in one of its stormiest moods is debating a law against emigration mirabeau declaring aloud i swear beforehand that i will not obey it mirabeau is often at the tribune this day with endless impediments from without with the old unabated energy from within what can murmurs and clamours from left or from right do to this man like teneriffe or atlas unremoved with clear thought with strong bassvoice though at first low uncertain he claims audience sways the storm of men anon the sound of him waxes softens he rises into farsounding melody of strength triumphant which subdues all hearts his rudeseamed face desolate firescathed becomes firelit and radiates once again men feel in these beggarly ages what is the potency and omnipotency of mans word on the souls of men i will triumph or be torn in fragments he was once heard to say silence he cries now in strong word of command in imperial consciousness of strength silence the thirty voices silence aux trente voixand robespierre and the thirty voices die into mutterings and the law is once more as mirabeau would have it  how different at the same instant is general lafayettes street eloquence wrangling with sonorous brewers with an ungrammatical saintantoine most different again from both is the cafedevalois eloquence and suppressed fanfaronade of this multitude of men with tickets of entry who are now inundating the corridors of the tuileries such things can go on simultaneously in one city how much more in one country in one planet with its discrepancies every day a mere crackling infinitude of discrepancieswhich nevertheless do yield some coherent netproduct though an infinitesimally small one  be this as it may lafayette has saved vincennes and is marching homewards with some dozen of arrested demolitionists royalty is not yet savednor indeed specially endangered but to the kings constitutional guard to these old gardes francaises or centre grenadiers as it chanced to be this

convicted of poniards made to order convicted chevaliers of the poniard within is as the burning ship without is as the deep sea within is no help his majesty looking forth one moment from his interior sanctuaries coldly bids all visitors give up their weapons and shuts the door again the weapons given up form a heap the convicted chevaliers of the poniard keep descending pellmell with

torn coatskirts and heavy hearts to their respective dwellinghouses riot twofold is quelled and little blood shed if it be not insignificant blood from the nose vincennes stands undemolished reparable and the hereditary representative has not been stolen nor the queen smuggled into prison a day long remembered commented on with loud hahas and deep grumblings with bitter scornfulness of triumph bitter rancour of defeat royalism as usual imputes it to dorleans and the anarchists intent on insulting majesty patriotism as usual to royalists and even constitutionalists intent on stealing majesty to metz we also as usual to preternatural suspicion and phoebus apollo having made himself like the night  thus however has the reader seen in an unexpected arena on this last day of february 1791 the three longcontending elements of french society dashed forth into singular comicotragical collision acting and reacting openly to the eye constitutionalism at once quelling sansculottic riot at vincennes and royalist treachery from the tuileries is great this day and prevails as for poor royalism tossed to and fro in that manner its daggers all left in a heap what can one think of it every dog the adage says has its day has it has had it or will have it for the present the day is lafayettes and the constitutions nevertheless hunger and jacobinism fast growing fanatical still work

poseidon lafayette and his constitution out of space and in the titanic melee sea were mixed with sky    chapter 23vi  mirabeau  the spirit of france waxes ever more acrid feversick towards the final outburst of dissolution and delirium suspicion rules all minds contending parties cannot now commingle stand separated sheer asunder eying one another in most aguish mood of cold terror or hot rage counterrevolution days of poniards castries duels flight of mesdames of monsieur and royalty journalism shrills ever louder its cry of alarm the sleepless dionysiuss ear of the fortyeight sections how feverishly quick has it grown convulsing with strange pangs the whole sick body as in such sleeplessness and sickness the ear will do  since royalists get poniards made to order and a sieur motier is no better than he should be shall not patriotism too even of the indigent sort have pikes secondhand firelocks in readiness for the worst the anvils ring during this march month with hammering of pikes a constitutional municipality promulgated its placard that no citizen except the active or cashcitizen was entitled to have arms but there rose instantly responsive such a tempest of astonishment from club and section that the constitutional placard almost next morning had to cover itself up and die away into inanity in a second improved edition ordonnance du 17 mars 1791 hist parl ix 257 so the hammering continues as all that it betokens does  mark again how the extreme tip of the left is mounting in favour if not in its own national hall yet with the nation especially with paris for in such universal panic of doubt the opinion that is sure of itself as the meagrest opinion may the soonest be is the one to which all men will rally great is belief were it never so meagre and leads captive the doubting heart incorruptible robespierre has been elected public accuser in our new courts of judicature virtuous petion it is thought may rise to be mayor cordelier danton called also by triumphant majorities sits at the departmental counciltable colleague there of mirabeau of incorruptible robespierre it was long ago predicted that he might go far mean meagre mortal though he was for doubt dwelt not in him  under which circumstances ought not royalty likewise to cease doubting and begin deciding and acting royalty has always that sure trumpcard in its hand flight out of paris which sure trumpcard royalty as we see keeps ever and anon clutching at grasping and swashes it forth tentatively yet never tables it still puts it back again play it o royalty if there be a chance left this seems it and verily the last chance and now every hour is rendering this a doubtfuller alas one would so fain both fly and not fly play ones card and have it to play royalty in all human likelihood will not play its trumpcard till the honours one after one be mainly lost and such trumping of it prove to be the sudden finish of the game  here accordingly a question always arises of the prophetic sort which cannot now be answered suppose mirabeau with whom royalty takes deep counsel as with a prime minister that cannot yet legally avow himself as such had got his arrangements completed arrangements he has farstretching plans that dawn fitfully on us by fragments in the confused darkness thirty departments ready to sign loyal addresses of prescribed tenor king carried out of paris but only to compiegne and rouen hardly to metz since once for all no emigrant rabble shall take the lead in it national assembly consenting by dint of loyal addresses by management by force of bouille to hear reason and follow thither see fils adoptif vii 1 6 dumont c 11 12 14 was it so on these terms that jacobinism and mirabeau were then to grapple in their herculesandtyphon duel death inevitable for the one or the other the duel itself is determined on and sure but on what terms much more with what issue we in vain guess it is vague darkness all unknown what is to be unknown even what has already been the giant mirabeau walks in darkness as we said companionless on wild ways what his thoughts during these months were no record of biographer not vague fils adoptif will now ever disclose  to us endeavouring to cast his horoscope it of course remains doubly vague there is one herculean man in internecine duel with him there is monster after monster emigrant noblesse return sword on thigh vaunting of their loyalty never sullied descending from the air like harpyswarms with ferocity with obscene greed earthward there is the typhon of anarchy political religious sprawling hundredheaded say with twentyfive million heads wide as the area of france fierce as frenzy strong in very hunger with these shall the serpentqueller do battle continually and expect no rest  as for the king he as usual will go wavering chameleonlike changing colour and purpose with the colour of his environmentgood for no kingly use on one royal person on the queen only can mirabeau perhaps place dependance it is possible the greatness of this man not unskilled too in blandishments courtiership and graceful adroitness might with most legitimate sorcery fascinate the volatile queen and fix her to him she has courage for all noble daring an eye and a heart the soul of theresas daughter faut ildonc is it fated then she passionately writes to her brother that i with the blood i am come of with the sentiments i have must live and die among such mortals fils adoptif ubi supra alas poor princess yes she is the only man as mirabeau observes whom his majesty has about him of one other man mirabeau is still surer of himself there lies his resources sufficient or insufficient  dim and great to the eye of prophecy looks the future a perpetual lifeanddeath battle confusion from above and from belowmere confused darkness for us with here and there some streak of faint lurid light we see king perhaps laid aside not tonsured tonsuring is out of fashion now but say sent away any whither with handsome annual allowance and stock of smithtools we see a queen and dauphin regent and minor a queen mounted on horseback in the din of battles with moriamur pro rege nostro such a day mirabeau writes may come  din of battles wars more than civil confusion from above and from below in such environment the eye of prophecy sees comte de mirabeau like some cardinal de retz stormfully maintain himself with head alldevising heart alldaring if not victorious yet unvanquished while life is left him the specialties and issues of it no eye of prophecy can guess at it is clouds we repeat and tempestuous night and in the middle of it now visible far darting now labouring in eclipse is mirabeau indomitably struggling to be cloudcompellerone can say that had mirabeau lived the history of france and of the world had been different further that the man would have needed as few men ever did the whole compass of that same art of daring art doser which he so prized and likewise that he above all men then living would have practised and manifested it finally that some substantiality and no empty simulacrum of a formula would have been the result realised by him a result you could have loved a result you could have hated by no likelihood a result you could only have rejected with closed lips and swept into quick forgetfulness for ever had mirabeau lived one other year    chapter 23vii  death of mirabeau  but mirabeau could not live another year any more than he could live another thousand years mens years are numbered and the tale of mirabeaus was now complete important or unimportant to be mentioned in worldhistory for some centuries or not to be mentioned there beyond a day or twoit matters not to peremptory fate from amid the press of ruddy busy life the pale messenger beckons silently widespreading interests projects salvation of french monarchies what thing soever man has on hand he must suddenly quit it all and go wert thou saving french monarchies wert thou blacking shoes on the pont neuf the most important of men cannot stay did the worlds history depend on an hour that hour is not to be given whereby indeed it comes that these same wouldhavebeens are mostly a vanity and the worlds history could never in the least be what it would or might or should by any manner of potentiality but simply and altogether what it is  the fierce wear and tear of such an existence has wasted out the giant oaken strength of mirabeau a fret and fever that keeps heart and brain on fire excess of effort of excitement excess of all kinds labour incessant almost beyond credibility if i had not lived with him says dumont i should never have known what a man can make of one day what things may be placed within the interval of twelve hours a day for this man was more than a week or a month is for others the mass of things he guided on together was prodigious from the scheming to the executing not a moment lost monsieur le comte said his secretary to him once what you require is impossibleimpossible answered he starting from his chair ne me dites jamais ce bete de mot never name to me that blockhead of a word dumont p 311 and then the social repasts the dinner which he gives as commandant of national guards which costs five hundred pounds alas and the sirens of the opera and all the ginger that is hot in the mouthdown what a course is this man hurled cannot mirabeau stop cannot he fly and save himself alive no there is a nessus shirt on this hercules he must storm and burn there without rest till he be consumed human strength never so herculean has its measure herald shadows flit pale across the firebrain of mirabeau heralds of the pale repose while he tosses and storms straining every nerve in that sea of ambition and confusion there comes sombre and still a monition that for him the issue of it will be swift death  in january last you might see him as president of the assembly his neck wrapt in linen cloths at the evening session there was sick heat of the blood alternate darkening and flashing in the eyesight he had to apply leeches after the morning labour and preside bandaged at parting he embraced me says dumont with an emotion i had never seen in him i am dying my friend dying as by slow fire we shall perhaps not meet again when i am gone they will know what the value of me was the miseries i have held back will burst from all sides on france dumont p 267 sickness gives louder warning but cannot be listened to on the 27th day of march proceeding towards the assembly he had to seek rest and help in friend de lamarcks by the road and lay there for an hour halffainted stretched on a sofa to the assembly nevertheless he went as if in spite of destiny itself spoke loud and eager five several times then quitted the tribunefor ever he steps out utterly exhausted into the tuileries gardens many people press round him as usual with applications memorials he says to the friend who was with him take me out of this  and so on the last day of march 1791 endless anxious multitudes beset the rue de la chaussee dantin incessantly inquiring within doors there in that house numbered in our time 42 the over wearied giant has fallen down to die fils adoptif viii 42079 crowds of all parties and kinds of all ranks from the king to the meanest man the king sends publicly twice aday to inquire privately besides from the world at large there is no end of inquiring a written bulletin is handed out every three hours is copied and circulated in the end it is printed the people spontaneously keep silence no carriage shall enter with its noise there is crowding pressure but the sister of mirabeau is reverently recognised and has free way made for her the people stand mute heartstricken to all it seems as if a great calamity were nigh as if the last man of france who could have swayed these coming troubles lay there at handgrips with the unearthly power  the silence of a whole people the wakeful toil of cabanis friend and physician skills not on saturday the second day of april mirabeau feels that the last of the days has risen for him that on this day he has to depart and be no more his death is titanic as his life has been lit up for the last time in the glare of coming dissolution the mind of the man is all glowing and burning utters itself in

along the streets le bon roi louis pere du peuple est mort the good king louis father of the people is dead henault abrege chronologique p 429 king mirabeau is now the lost king and one may say with little exaggeration all the people mourns for him  for three days there is low wide moan weeping in the national assembly itself the streets are all mournful orators mounted on the bournes with large silent audience preaching the funeral sermon of the dead let no coachman whip fast distractively with his rolling wheels or almost at all through these groups his traces may be cut himself and his fare as incurable aristocrats hurled sulkily into the kennels the bournestone orators speak as it is given them the sansculottic people with its rude soul listens eageras men will to any sermon or

inarticulately as it can that a sovereign man is snatched away in the national assembly when difficult questions are astir all eyes will turn mechanically to the place where mirabeau satand mirabeau is absent now  on the third evening of the lamentation the fourth of april there is solemn public funeral such as deceased mortal seldom had procession of a league in length of mourners reckoned loosely at a hundred thousand all roofs are thronged with onlookers all windows lampirons branches of trees sadness is painted on every countenance many persons weep there is double hedge of national guards there is national assembly in a body jacobin society and societies kings ministers municipals and all notabilities patriot or aristocrat bouille is noticeable there with his hat on say hat drawn over his brow hiding many thoughts slowwending in religious silence the procession of a league in length under the level sunrays for it is five oclock moves and marches with its sable plumes itself in a religious silence but by fits with the muffled roll of drums by fits with some longdrawn wail of music and strange new clangour of trombones and metallic dirgevoice amid the infinite hum of men in the church of sainteustache there is funeral oration by cerutti and discharge of firearms which brings down pieces of the plaster thence forward again to the church of saintegenevieve which has been consecrated by supreme decree on the spur of this time into a pantheon for the great men of the fatherland aux grands hommes la patrie reconnaissante hardly at midnight is the business done and mirabeau left in his dark dwelling first tenant of that fatherlands pantheon  tenant alas with inhabits but at will and shall be cast out for in these days of convulsion and disjection not even the dust of the dead is permitted to rest voltaires bones are by and by to be carried from their stolen grave in the abbey of scellieres to an eager stealing grave in paris his birthcity all mortals

the churchyard saintecatherine in the suburb saintmarceau to be disturbed no further  so blazes out farseen a mans life and becomes ashes and a caput mortuum in this worldpyre which we name french revolution not the first that consumed itself there nor by thousands and many millions the last a man who had swallowed all formulas who in these strange times and circumstances felt called to live titanically and also to die so as he for his part had swallowed all formulas what formula is there never so comprehensive that will express truly the plus and the minus give us the accurate netresult of him there is hitherto none such moralities not a few must shriek condemnatory over this mirabeau the morality by which he could be judged has not yet got uttered in the speech of men we shall say this of him again that he is a reality and no simulacrum a living son of nature our general mother not a hollow artfice and mechanism of conventionalities son of nothing brother to nothing in which little word let the earnest man walking sorrowful in a world mostly of stuffed clothessuits that chatter and grin meaningless on him quite ghastly to the earnest soulthink what significance there is  of men who in such sense are alive and see with eyes the number is now not great it may be well if in this huge french revolution itself with its alldeveloping fury we find some three mortals driven rabid we find sputtering the acridest logic baring their breast to the battlehail their neck to the guillotine of whom it is so painful to say that they too are still in good part manufactured formalities not facts but hearsays  honour to the strong man in these ages who has shaken himself loose of shams and is something for in the way of being worthy the first condition surely is that one be let cant cease at all risks and at all costs till cant cease nothing else can begin of human criminals in these centuries writes the moralist i find but one unforgivable the quack hateful to god as divine dante sings and to the enemies of god  a dio spiacente ed a nemici sui  but whoever will with sympathy which is the first essential towards insight look at this questionable mirabeau may find that there lay verily in him as the basis of all a sincerity a great free earnestness nay call it honesty for the man did before all things see with that clear flashing vision into what was into what existed as fact and did with his wild heart follow that and no other whereby on what ways soever he travels and struggles often enough falling he is still a brother man hate him not thou canst not hate him shining through such soil and tarnish and now victorious effulgent and oftenest struggling eclipsed the light of genius itself is in this man which was never yet base and hateful but at worst was lamentable loveable with pity they say that he was ambitious that he wanted to be minister it is most true and was he not simply the one man in france who could have done any good as minister not vanity alone not pride alone far from that wild burstings of affection were in this great heart of fierce lightning and soft dew of pity so sunk bemired in wretchedest defacements it may be said of him like the magdalen of old that he loved much his father the harshest of old crabbed men he loved with warmth with veneration  be it that his falls and follies are manifoldas himself often lamented even with tears dumont p 287 alas is not the life of every such man already a poetic tragedy made up of fate and of ones own deservings of schicksal und eigene schuld full of the elements of pity and fear this brother man if not epic for us is tragic if not great is large large in his qualities worldlarge in his destinies whom other men recognising him as such may through long times remember and draw nigh to examine and consider these in their several dialects will say of him and sing of himtill the right thing be said and so the formula that can judge him be no longer an undiscovered one  here then the wild gabriel honore drops from the tissue of our history not without a tragic farewell he is gone the flower of the wild riquetti or arrighetti kindred which seems as if in him with one last effort it had done its best and then expired or sunk down to the undistinguished level crabbed old marquis mirabeau the friend of men sleeps sound the bailli mirabeau worthy uncle will soon die forlorn alone barrelmirabeau already gone across the rhine his regiment of emigrants will drive nigh desperate barrelmirabeau says a biographer of his went indignantly across the rhine and drilled emigrant regiments but as he sat one morning in his tent sour of stomach doubtless and of heart meditating in tartarean humour on the turn things took a certain captain or subaltern demanded

tumbles out on this canaille of an intruderalas on the canaille of an intruders swords point who had drawn with swift dexterity and dies and the newspapers name it apoplexy and alarming accident so die the mirabeaus  new mirabeaus one hears not of the wild kindred as we said is gone out with this its greatest as families and kindreds sometimes do producing after long ages of unnoted notability some living quintescence of all the qualities they had to flame forth as a man worldnoted after whom they rest as if exhausted the sceptre passing to others the chosen last of the mirabeaus is gone the chosen man of france is gone it was he who shook old france from its basis and as if with his single hand has held it toppling there still unfallen what things depended on that one man he is as a ship suddenly shivered on sunk rocks much swims on the waste waters far from help     book 2iv  varennes   chapter 24i  easter at saintcloud  the french monarchy may now therefore be considered as in all human probability lost as struggling henceforth in blindness as well as weakness the last light of reasonable guidance having gone out what remains of resources their poor majesties will waste still further in uncertain loitering and wavering mirabeau himself had to complain that they only gave him half confidence and always had some plan within his plan had they fled frankly with him to rouen or anywhither long ago they may fly now with chance immeasurably lessened which will go on lessening towards absolute zero decide o queen poor louis can decide nothing execute this flightproject or at least abandon it correspondence with bouille there has been enough what profits consulting and hypothesis while all around is in fierce activity of practice the rustic sits waiting till the river run dry alas with you it is not a common river but a nile inundation snow melting in the unseen mountains till all and you where you sit be submerged  many things invite to flight the voice journals invites royalist journals proudly hinting it as a threat patriot journals rabidly denouncing it as a terror mother society waxing more and more emphatic invitesso emphatic that as was prophesied lafayette and your limited patriots have ere long to branch off from her and form themselves into feuillans with infinite public controversy the victory in which doubtful though it look will remain with the unlimited mother moreover ever since the day of poniards we have seen unlimited patriotism openly equipping itself with arms citizens denied activity which is facetiously made to signify a certain weight of purse cannot buy blue uniforms and be guardsmen but man is greater than blue cloth man can fight if need be in multiform cloth or even almost without clothas sansculotte so pikes continued to be hammered whether those dirks of improved structure with barbs be meant for the westindia market or not meant men beat the wrong way their ploughshares into swords is there not what we may call an austrian committee comite autrichein sitting daily and nightly in the tuileries patriotism by vision and suspicion knows it too well if the king fly will there not be aristocrataustrian invasion butchery replacement of feudalism wars more than civil the hearts of men are saddened and maddened  dissident priests likewise give trouble enough expelled from their parish churches where constitutional priests elected by the public have replaced them these unhappy persons resort to convents of nuns or other such receptacles and there on sabbath collecting assemblages of anticonstitutional individuals who have grown devout all on a sudden toulongeon i 262 they worship or pretend to worship in their straitlaced contumacious manner to the scandal of patriotism dissident priests passing along with their sacred wafer for the dying seem wishful to be massacred in the streets wherein patriotism will not gratify them slighter palm of martyrdom however shall not be denied martyrdom not of massacre yet of fustigation at the refractory places of worship patriot men appear patriot women with strong hazel wands which they apply shut thy eyes o reader see not this misery peculiar to these later timesof martyrdom without sincerity with only cant and contumacy a dead catholic church is not allowed to lie dead no it is galvanised into the detestablest deathlife whereat humanity we say shuts its eyes for the patriot women take their hazel wands and fustigate amid laughter of bystanders with alacrity broad bottom of priests alas nuns too reversed and cotillons retrousses the national guard does what it can municipality invokes the principles of toleration grants dissident worshippers the church of the theatins promising protection but it is to no purpose at the door of that theatins church appears a placard and suspended atop like plebeian consular fascesa bundle of rods the principles of toleration must do the best they may but no dissident man shall worship contumaciously there is a plebiscitum to that effect which though unspoken is like the laws of the medes and persians dissident contumacious priests ought not to be harboured even in private by any man the club of the cordeliers openly denounces majesty himself as doing it newspapers of april and june 1791 in hist parl ix 449 x 217  many things invite to flight but probably this thing above all others that it has become impossible on the 15th of april notice is given that his majesty who has suffered much from catarrh lately will enjoy the spring weather for a few days at saintcloud out at saintcloud wishing to celebrate his easter his paques or pasch there with refractory anticonstitutional dissidentswishing rather to make off for compiegne and thence to the frontiers as were in good sooth perhaps feasible or would once have been nothing but some two chasseurs attending you chasseurs easily corrupted it is a pleasant possibility execute it or not men say there are thirty thousand chevaliers of the poniard lurking in the woods there lurking in the woods and thirty thousandfor the human imagination is not fettered but now how easily might these dashing out on lafayette snatch off the hereditary representative and roll away with him after the manner of a whirlblast whither they listedenough it were well the king did not go lafayette is forewarned and forearmed but indeed is the risk his only or his and all frances  monday the eighteenth of april is come the easter journey to saintcloud shall take effect national guard has got its orders a first division as advanced guard has even marched and probably arrived his majestys maisonbouche they say is all busy stewing and frying at saintcloud the kings dinner not far from ready there about one oclock the royal carriage with its eight royal blacks shoots stately into the place du carrousel draws up to receive its royal burden but hark from the neighbouring church of saintroch the tocsin begins dingdonging is the king stolen then he is going gone multitudes of persons crowd the carrousel the royal carriage still stands thereand by heavens strength shall stand  lafayette comes up with aidedecamps and oratory pervading the groups taisez vous answer the groups the king shall not go monsieur appears at an upper window ten thousand voices bray and shriek nous ne voulons pas que le roi parte their majesties have mounted crack go the whips but twenty patriot arms have seized each of the eight bridles there is rearing rocking vociferation not the smallest headway in vain does lafayette fret indignant and perorate and strive patriots in the passion of terror bellow round the royal carriage it is one bellowing sea of patriot terror run frantic will royalty fly off towards austria like a lit rocket towards endless conflagration of civil war stop it ye patriots in the name of heaven rude voices passionately apostrophise royalty itself usher campan and other the like official persons pressing forward with help or advice are clutched by the sashes and hurled and whirled in a confused perilous manner so that her majesty has to plead passionately from the

disobedient words threatening the mounted guards with sharp shot if they hurt the people lafayette mounts and dismounts runs haranguing panting on the verge of despair for an hour and threequarters seven quarters of an hour by the tuileries clock desperate lafayette will open a passage were it by the cannons mouth if his majesty will order their majesties counselled to it by royalist friends by

unheardof entreaty national guards kneeling to him and declaring that it is not sycophancy that they are free men kneeling here to the statue of liberty for the rest those centre grenadiers of the observatoire are disbandedyet indeed are reinlisted all but fourteen under a new name and with new quarters the king must keep his easter in paris meditating much on this singular posture of things but as good as determined now to fly from it desire being whetted by difficulty    chapter 24ii  easter at paris  for above a year ever since march 1790 it would seem there has hovered a project of flight before the royal mind and ever and anon has been condensing itself into something like a purpose but this or the other difficulty always vaporised it again it seems so full of risks perhaps of civil war itself above all it cannot be done without effort somnolent laziness will not serve to fly if not in a leather vache one must verily stir himself better to adopt that constitution of theirs execute it so as to shew all men that it is inexecutable better or not so good surely it is easier to all difficulties you need only say there is a lion in the path behold your constitution will not act for a somnolent person it requires no effort to counterfeit deathas dame de stael and friends of liberty can see the kings government long doing faisant le mort  nay now when desire whetted by difficulty has brought the matter to a head and the royal mind no longer halts between two what can come of it grant that poor louis were safe with bouille what on the whole could he look for there exasperated tickets of entry answer much all but cold reason answers little almost nothing is not loyalty a law of nature ask the tickets of entry is not love of your king and even death for him the glory of all frenchmenexcept these few democrats let democrat constitutionbuilders see what they will do without their keystone and france rend its hair having lost the hereditary representative  thus will king louis fly one sees not reasonably towards what as a maltreated boy shall we say who having a stepmother rushes sulky into the wide world and will wring the paternal heartpoor louis escapes from known unsupportable evils to an unknown mixture of good and evil coloured by hope he goes as rabelais did when dying to seek a great maybe je vais chercher un grand peutetre as not only the sulky boy but the wise grown man is obliged to do so often in emergencies  for the rest there is still no lack of stimulants and stepdame maltreatments to keep ones resolution at the due pitch factious disturbance ceases not as indeed how can they unless authoritatively conjured in a revolt which is by nature bottomless if the ceasing of faction be the price of the kings somnolence he may awake when he will and take wing  remark in any case what somersets and contortions a dead catholicism is makingskilfully galvanised hideous and even piteous to behold jurant and dissident with their shaved crowns argue frothing everywhere or are ceasing to argue and stripping for battle in paris was scourging while need continued contrariwise in the morbihan of brittany without scourging armed peasants are up roused by pulpitdrum they know not why general dumouriez who has got missioned thitherward finds all in sour heat of darkness finds also that explanation and conciliation will still do much deux amis v 41021 dumouriez ii c 5  but again consider this that his holiness pius sixth has seen good to excommunicate bishop talleyrand surely we will say then considering it there is no living or dead church in the earth that has not the indubitablest right to excommunicate talleyrand pope pius has right and might in his way but truly so likewise has father adam cidevant marquis sainthuruge in his way behold therefore on the fourth of may in the palaisroyal a mixed loudsounding multitude in the middle of whom father adam bullvoiced sainthuruge in white hat towers visible and audible with him it is said walks journalist gorsas walk many others of the washed sort for no authority will interfere pius sixth with his plush and tiara and power of the keys they bear aloft of natural sizemade of lath and combustible gum royou the kings friend is borne too in effigy with a pile of newspaper kingsfriends condemned numbers of the amiduroi fit fuel of the sacrifice speeches are spoken a judgment is held a doom proclaimed audible in bullvoice towards the four winds and thus amid great shouting the holocaust is consummated under the summer sky and our lathandgum holiness with the attendant victims mounts up in flame and sinks down in ashes a decomposed pope and right or might among all the parties has better or worse accomplished itself as it could hist parl x 99102 but on the whole reckoning from martin luther in the marketplace of wittenberg to marquis sainthuruge in this palaisroyal of paris what a journey have we gone into what strange territories has it carried us no authority can now interfere nay religion herself mourning for such things may after all ask what have i to do with them  in such extraordinary manner does dead catholicism somerset and caper skilfully galvanised for does the reader inquire into the subjectmatter of controversy in this case what the difference between orthodoxy or mydoxy and heterodoxy or thydoxy might here be mydoxy is that an august national assembly can equalize the extent of bishopricks that an equalized bishop his creed and formularies being left quite as they were can swear fidelity to king law and nation and so become a constitutional bishop thydoxy if thou be dissident is that he cannot but that he must become an accursed thing human illnature needs but some homoiousian iota or even the pretence of one and will flow copiously through the eye of a needle thus always must mortals go jargoning and fuming        and like the ancient stoics in their porches      with fierce dispute maintain their churches  this autodafe of sainthuruges was on the fourth of may 1791 royalty sees it but says nothing    chapter 24iii  count fersen  royalty in fact should by this time be far on with its preparations unhappily much preparation is needful could a hereditary representative be carried in leather vache how easy were it but it is not so  new clothes are needed as usual in all epic transactions were it in the grimmest iron ages consider queen chrimhilde with her sixty semstresses in that iron nibelungen song no queen can stir without new clothes therefore now dame campan whisks assiduous to this mantuamaker and to that and there is clipping of frocks and gowns upper clothes and under great and small such a clipping and sewing as might have been dispensed with moreover her majesty cannot go a step anywhither without her necessaire dear necessaire of inlaid ivory and rosewood cunningly devised which holds perfumes toiletimplements infinite small queenlike furnitures necessary to terrestrial life not without a cost of some five hundred louis of much precious time and difficult hoodwinking which does not blind can this same necessary of life be forwarded by the flanders carriersnever to get to hand campan ii c 18 all which you would say augurs ill for the prospering of the enterprise but the whims of women and queens must be humoured  bouille on his side is making a fortified camp at montmedi gathering royalallemand and all manner of other german and true french troops thither to watch the austrians his majesty will not cross the frontiers unless on compulsion neither shall the emigrants be much employed hateful as they are to all people bouille memoires ii c 10 nor shall old wargod broglie have any hand in the business but solely our brave bouille to whom on the day of meeting a marshals baton shall be delivered by a rescued king amid the shouting of all the troops in the meanwhile paris being so suspicious were it not perhaps good to write your foreign ambassadors an ostensible constitutional letter desiring all kings and men to take heed that king louis loves the constitution that he has voluntarily sworn and does again swear to maintain the same and will reckon those his enemies who affect to say otherwise such a constitutional circular is despatched by couriers is communicated confidentially to the assembly and printed in all newspapers with the finest effect moniteur seance du 23 avril 1791 simulation and dissimulation mingle extensively in human affairs  we observe however that count fersen is often using his ticket of entry which surely he has clear right to do a gallant soldier and swede devoted to this fair queenas indeed the highest swede now is has not king gustav famed fiery chevalier du nord sworn himself by the old laws of chivalry her knight he will descend on firewings of swedish musketry and deliver her from these foul dragonsif alas the assassins pistol intervene not  but in fact count fersen does seem a likely young soldier of alert decisive ways he circulates widely seen unseen and has business on hand also colonel the duke de choiseul nephew of choiseul the great of choiseul the now deceased he and engineer goguelat are passing and repassing between metz and the tuileries and letters go in cipherone of them a most important one hard to decipher fersen having ciphered it in haste choiseul relation du depart de louis xvi paris 1822 p 39 as for duke de villequier he is gone ever since the day of poniards but his apartment is useful for her majesty  on the other side poor commandment gouvion watching at the tuileries second in national command sees several things hard to interpret it is the same gouvion who sat long months ago at the townhall gazing helpless into that insurrection of women motionless as the brave stabled steed when conflagration rises till usher maillard snatched his drum sincerer patriot there is not but many a shiftier he if dame campan gossip credibly is paying some similitude of lovecourt to a certain false chambermaid of the palace who betrays much to him the necessaire the clothes the packing of the jewels campan ii 141could he understand it when betrayed helpless gouvion gazes with sincere glassy eyes into it stirs up his sentries to vigilence walks restless to and fro and hopes the best  but on the whole one finds that in the second week of june colonel de choiseul is privately in paris having come to see his children also that fersen has got a stupendous new coach built of the kind named berline done by the first artists according to a model they bring it home to him in choiseuls presence the two friends take a proofdrive in it along the streets in meditative mood then send it up to madame sullivans in the rue de clichy far north to wait there till wanted apparently a certain russian baroness de korff with waitingwoman valet and two children will travel homewards with some state in whom these young military gentlemen take interest a passport has been procured for her and much assistance shewn with coachbuilders and such likeso helpful polite are young military men fersen has likewise purchased a chaise fit for two at least for two waitingmaids further certain necessary horses one would say he is himself quitting france not without outlay we observe finally that their majesties heaven willing will assist at corpuschristi day this blessed summer solstice in assumption church here at paris to the joy of all the world for which same day moreover brave bouille at metz as we find has invited a party of friends to dinner but indeed is gone from home in the interim over to montmedi  these are of the phenomena or visual appearances of this wideworking terrestrial world which truly is all phenomenal what they call spectral and never rests at any moment one never at any moment can know why  on monday night the twentieth of june 1791 about eleven oclock there is many a hackneycoach and glasscoach carrosse de remise still rumbling or at rest on the streets of paris but of all glasscoaches we recommend this to thee o reader which stands drawn up in the rue de lechelle hard by the carrousel and outgate of the tuileries in the rue de lechelle that then was opposite ronsin the saddlers door as if waiting for a fare there not long does it wait a hooded dame with two hooded children has issued from villequiers door where no sentry walks into the tuileries courtofprinces into the carrousel into the rue de lechelle where the glasscoachman readily admits them and again waits not long another dame likewise hooded or shrouded leaning on a servant issues in the same manner by the glasscoachman cheerfully admitted whither go so many dames tis his majestys couchee majesty just gone to bed and all the palaceworld is retiring home but the glasscoachman still waits his fare seemingly incomplete  by and by we note a thickset individual in round hat and peruke armandarm with some servant seemingly of the runner or courier sort he also issues through villequiers door starts a shoebuckle as he passes one of the sentries stoops down to clasp it again is however by the glasscoachman still more cheerfully admitted and now is his fare complete not yet the glasscoachman still waitsalas and the false chambermaid has warned gouvion that she thinks the royal family will fly this very night and gouvion distrusting his own glazed eyes has sent express for lafayette and lafayettes carriage flaring with lights rolls this moment through the inner arch of the carrouselwhere a lady shaded in broad gypsyhat and leaning on the arm of a servant also of the runner or courier sort stands aside to let it pass and has even the whim to touch a spoke of it with her badinelight little magic rod which she calls badine such as the beautiful then wore the flare of lafayettes carriage rolls past all is found quiet in the courtofprinces sentries at their post majesties apartments closed in smooth rest your false chambermaid must have been mistaken watch thou gouvion with argus vigilance for of a truth treachery is within these walls  but where is the lady that stood aside in gypsy hat and touched the wheelspoke with her badine o reader that lady that touched the wheelspoke was the queen of france she has issued safe through that inner arch into the carrousel itself but not into the rue de lechelle flurried by the rattle and rencounter she took the right hand not the left neither she nor her courier knows paris he indeed is no courier but a loyal stupid cidevant bodyguard disguised as one they are off quite wrong over the pont royal and river roaming disconsolate in the rue du bac far from the glasscoachman who still waits waits with flutter of heart with thoughtswhich he must button close up under his jarvie surtout  midnight clangs from all the citysteeples one precious hour has been spent so most mortals are asleep the glasscoachman waits and what mood a brother jarvie drives up enters into conversation is answered cheerfully in jarvie dialect the brothers of the whip exchange a pinch of snuff weber ii 3402 choiseul p 4456 decline drinking together and part with good night be the heavens blest here at length is the queenlady in gypsyhat safe after perils who has had to inquire her way she too is admitted her courier jumps aloft as the other who is also a disguised bodyguard has done and now o glasscoachman of a thousandcount fersen for the reader sees it is thoudrive  dust shall not stick to the hoofs of fersen crack crack the glasscoach rattles and every soul breathes lighter but is fersen on the right road northeastward to the barrier of saintmartin and metz highway thither were we bound and lo he drives right northward the royal individual in round hat and peruke sits astonished but right or wrong there is no remedy crack crack we go incessant through the slumbering city seldom since paris rose out of mud or the longhaired kings went in bullockcarts was there such a drive mortals on each hand of you close by stretched out horizontal dormant and we alive and quaking crack crack through the rue de grammont across the boulevard up the rue de la chaussee dantinthese windows all silent of number 42 were mirabeaus towards the barrier not of saintmartin but of clichy on the utmost north patience ye royal individuals fersen understands what he is about passing up the rue de clichy he alights for one moment at madame sullivans did count fersens coachman get the baroness de korffs new berlinegone with it an hourandhalf ago grumbles responsive the drowsy portercest bien yes it is wellthough had not such hourand half been lost it were still better forth therefore o fersen fast by the barrier de clichy then eastward along the outward boulevard what horses and whipcord can do  thus fersen drives through the ambrosial night sleeping paris is now all on the right hand of him silent except for some snoring hum and now he is eastward as far as the barrier de saintmartin looking earnestly for baroness de korffs berline this heavens berline he at length does descry drawn up with its six horses his own german coachman

unacquainted with all things stoppages occur and breakages to be repaired at etoges king louis too will dismount will walk up hills and enjoy the blessed sunshinewith eleven horses and double drink money and all furtherances of nature and art it will be found that royalty flying for life accomplishes sixtynine miles in twentytwo incessant hours slow royalty and yet not a minute of these hours but is precious on minutes hang the destinies of royalty now  readers therefore can judge in what humour duke de choiseul might stand waiting in the village of pontdesommevelle some leagues beyond chalons hour after hour now when the day bends visibly westward choiseul drove out of paris in all privity ten hours before their majesties fixed time his hussars led by engineer goguelat are here duly come to escort a treasure that is expected but hour after hour is no baroness de korffs berline indeed over all that northeast region on the skirts of champagne and of lorraine where the great road runs the agitation is considerable for all along from this pontdesommevelle northeastward as far as montmedi at postvillages and towns escorts of hussars and dragoons do lounge waiting a train or chain of military escorts at the montmedi end of it our brave bouille an electric thunderchain which the invisible bouille like a father jove holds in his handfor wise purposes brave bouille has done what man could has spread out his electric thunderchain of military escorts onwards to the threshold of chalons it waits but for the new korff berline to receive it escort it and if need be bear it off in whirlwind of military fire they lie and lounge there we say these fierce troopers from montmedi and stenai through clermont saintemenehould to utmost pontdesommevelle in all postvillages for the route shall avoid verdun and great towns they loiter impatient till the treasure arrive  judge what a day this is for brave bouille perhaps the first day of a new glorious life surely the last day of the old also and indeed still more what a day beautiful and terrible for your young fullblooded captains your dandoins comte de damas duke de choiseul engineer goguelat and the like entrusted with the secretalas the day bends ever more westward and no korff berline comes to sight it is four hours beyond the time and still no berline in all villagestreets royalist captains go lounging looking often parisward with face of unconcern with heart full of black care rigorous quartermasters can hardly keep the private dragoons from cafes and dramshops declaration du sieur la gache du regiment royaldragoons in choiseul pp 12539 dawn on our bewilderment thou new berline dawn on us thou sunchariot of a new berline with the destinies of france  it was of his majestys ordering this military array of escorts a thing solacing the royal imagination with a look of security and rescue yet in reality creating only alarm and where there was otherwise no danger danger without end for each patriot in these postvillages asks naturally this clatter of cavalry and marching and lounging of troops what means it to escort a treasure why escort when no patriot will steal from the nation or where is your treasurethere has been such marching and countermarching for it is another fatality that certain of these military escorts came out so early as yesterday the nineteenth not the twentieth of the month being the day first appointed which her majesty for some necessity or other saw good to alter and now consider the suspicious nature of patriotism suspicious above all of bouille the aristocrat and how the sour doubting humour has had leave to accumulate and exacerbate for fourandtwenty hours  at pontdesommevelle these forty foreign hussars of goguelat and duke choiseul are becoming an unspeakable mystery to all men they lounged long enough already at saintemenehould lounged and loitered till our national volunteers there all risen into hot wrath of doubt demanded three hundred fusils of their townhall and got them at which same moment too as it chanced our captain dandoins was just coming in from clermont with his troop at the other end of the village a fresh troop alarming enough though happily they are only dragoons and french so that goguelat with his hussars had to ride and even to do it fast till here at pontdesommevelle where choiseul lay waiting he found restingplace restingplace as on burning marle for the rumour of him flies abroad and men run to and fro in fright and anger chalons sends forth exploratory pickets coming from saintemenehould on that what is it ye whiskered hussars men of foreign guttural speech in the name of heaven what is it that brings you a treasureexploratory pickets shake their heads the hungry peasants however know too well what treasure it is military seizure for rents feudalities which no bailiff could make us pay this they knowand set to jingling their parishbell by way of tocsin with rapid effect choiseul and goguelat if the whole country is not to take fire must needs be there berline be there no berline saddle and ride  they mount and this parish tocsin happily ceases they ride slowly eastward towards saintemenehould still hoping the sunchariot of a berline may overtake them ah me no berline and near now is that saintemenehould which expelled us in the morning with its three hundred national fusils which looks belike not too lovingly on captain dandoins and his fresh dragoons though only frenchwhich in a word one dare not enter the second time under pain of explosion with rather heavy heart our hussar party strikes off to the left through byways through pathless hills and woods they avoiding saintemenehould and all places which have seen them heretofore will make direct for the distant village of varennes it is probable they will have a rough eveningride  this first military post therefore in the long thunderchain has gone off with no effect or with worse and your chain threatens to entangle itselfthe great road however is got hushed again into a kind of quietude though one of the wakefullest indolent dragoons cannot by any quartermaster be kept altogether from the dramshop where patriots drink and will even treat eager enough for news captains in a state near distraction beat the dusky highway with a face of indifference and no sunchariot appears why lingers it incredible that with eleven horses and such yellow couriers and furtherances its rate should be under the weightiest drayrate some three miles an hour alas one knows not whether it ever even got out of parisand

acrid choleric man rather dangerouslooking still in the prime of life though he has served in his time as a conde dragoon this day from an early hour drouet got his choler stirred and has been kept fretting hussar goguelat in the morning saw good by way of thrift to bargain with his own innkeeper not with drouet regular maitre de poste about some gighorse for the sending back of his gig which thing drouet perceiving came over in red ire menacing the innkeeper and would not be appeased wholly an unsatisfactory day for drouet is an acrid patriot too was at the paris feast of pikes and what do these bouille soldiers mean hussars with their gig and a vengeance to ithave hardly been thrust out when dandoins and his fresh dragoons arrive from clermont and stroll for what purpose choleric

fine are the yellow liveries bring hand to helmet and a lady in gipsyhat responds with a grace peculiar to her declaration de la gache in choiseul ubi supra dandoins stands with folded arms and what

like them with his eye he bespeaks the yellow courier be quick be quick thickheaded yellow cannot understand the eye comes up mumbling to ask in words seen of the village  nor is postmaster drouet unobservant all this while but steps out and steps in with his longflowing nightgown in the level sunlight prying into several things when a mans faculties at the right time are sharpened by choler it may lead to much that lady in slouched gypsyhat though sitting back in the carriage does she not resemble some one we have seen some timeat the feast of pikes or elsewhere and this grossetete in round

its terrors verily to some purpose how many royalist plots and projects one after another cunninglydevised that were to explode like powdermines and thunderclaps not one solitary plot of which has issued otherwise powdermine of a seance royale on the twentythird of june 1789 which exploded as we then said through the touchhole which next your wargod broglie having reloaded it brought a bastille

seems a cause doomed forsaken of earth and heaven  on the sixth of october gone a year king louis escorted by demoiselle theroigne and some two hundred thousand made a royal progress and entrance into paris such as man had never witnessed we prophesied him two more such and accordingly another of them after this flight to metz is now coming to pass theroigne will not escort here neither does

fleeting time shears down the great and the little and in two years alters many things  but at all events here we say is a second ignominious royal procession though much altered to be witnessed also by its hundreds of thousands patience ye paris patriots the royal berline is returning not till saturday for the royal berline travels by slow stages amid such loudvoiced confluent sea of national guards sixty thousand as they count amid such tumult of all people three nationalassembly commissioners famed barnave famed petion generallyrespectable latourmaubourg have gone to meet it of whom the two former ride in the berline itself beside majesty day after day latour as a mere respectability and man of whom all men speak well can ride in the rear with dame tourzel and the soubrettes  so on saturday evening about seven oclock paris by hundreds of thousands is again drawn up not now dancing the tricolor joydance of hope nor as yet dancing in furydance of hate and revenge but in silence with vague look of conjecture and curiosity mostly scientific a sainteantoine placard has given notice this morning that whosoever insults louis shall be caned whosoever applauds him shall be hanged behold then at last that wonderful new berline encircled by blue national sea with fixed bayonets which flows slowly floating it on through the silent assembled hundreds of thousands three yellow couriers sit atop bound with ropes petion barnave their majesties with sister elizabeth and the children of france are within  smile of embarrassment or cloud of dull sourness is on the broad phlegmatic face of his majesty who keeps declaring to the successive officialpersons what is evident eh bien me voila well here you have me and what is not evident i do assure you i did not mean to pass the frontiers and so forth speeches natural for that poor royal man which decency would veil silent is her majesty with a look of grief and scorn natural for that royal woman thus lumbers and creeps the ignominious royal procession through many streets amid a silentgazing people comparable mercier thinks nouveau paris iii 22 to some procession de roi de bazoche or say procession of king

most miserably real miserablest flebile ludibrium of a pickleherring tragedy it sweeps along there in most ungorgeous pall through many streets in the dusty summer evening gets itself at length

but our august assembly which is sitting at this great moment sends out deputation of rescue and the whole is got huddled up barnave all dusty is already there in the national hall making brief discreet address and report as indeed through the whole journey this barnave has been most discreet sympathetic and has gained the queens trust whose noble instinct teaches her always who is to be trusted very different from heavy petion who if campan speak truth ate his luncheon comfortably filled his wineglass in the royal berline flung out his chickenbones past the nose of royalty itself and on the kings saying france cannot be a republic answered no it is not ripe yet barnave is henceforth a queens adviser if advice could profit and her majesty astonishes dame campan by signifying almost a regard for barnave and that in a day of retribution and royal triumph barnave shall not be executed campan ii c 18  on monday night royalty went on saturday evening it returns so much within one

not by the clearest logic be made good with the sacrifice of all their hardearned popularity this notable triumvirate says toulongeon set the throne up again which they had so toiled to overturn as one might set up an overturned pyramid on its vertex to stand so long as it is held  unhappy france unhappy in king queen and constitution one knows not in which unhappiest was the meaning of our so glorious french revolution this and no other that when shams and delusions long soulkilling had become bodykilling and got the length of bankruptcy and inanition a great people rose and with one voice said in the name of the highest shams shall be no more so many sorrows and bloody horrors endured and to be yet endured through dismal coming centuries were they not the heavy price paid and payable for this same total destruction of shams from among men and now o barnave triumvirate is it in such doubledistilled delusion and sham even of a sham that an effort of this kind will rest acquiescent messieurs of the popular triumvirate never but after all what can poor popular triumvirates and fallible august senators do they can when the truth is all toohorrible stick their heads ostrichlike into what sheltering fallacy is nearest and wait there a posteriori  readers who saw the clermontais and threebishopricks gallop in the night of spurs diligences ruffling up all france into one

spouting municipal placards flaming on the walls and proclamations published by sound of trumpet invite to repose with small effect and so on sunday the 17th there shall be a thing seen worthy of remembering scroll of a petition drawn up by brissots dantons by cordeliers jacobins for the thing was infinitely shaken and manipulated and many had a hand in it such scroll lies now visible on the wooden framework of the fatherlands altar for signature unworking paris male and female is crowding thither all day to sign or to see our fair roland herself the eye of history can discern there in the morning madame roland ii 74 not without interest in few weeks the fair patriot will quit paris yet perhaps only to return  but what with sorrow of baulked patriotism what with closed theatres and proclamations still publishing themselves by sound of trumpet the fervour of mens minds this day is great nay over and above there has fallen out an incident of the nature of farcetragedy and riddle enough to stimulate all creatures early in the day a patriot or some say it was a patriotess and indeed truth is undiscoverable while standing on the firm dealboard of fatherlands altar feels suddenly with indescribable torpedoshock of amazement his bootsole pricked through from below he clutches up suddenly this electrified bootsole and foot discerns next instantthe point of a gimlet or bradawl playing up through the firm dealboard and now hastily drawing itself back mystery perhaps treason the wooden framework is impetuously broken up and behold verily a mystery never explicable fully to the end of the world two human individuals of mean aspect one of them with a wooden leg lie ensconced there gimlet in hand they must have come in overnight they have a supply of provisionsno barrel of gunpowder that one can see they affect to be asleep look blank enough and give the lamest account of themselves mere curiosity they were boring up to get an eyehole to see perhaps with lubricity whatsoever from that new point of vision could be seenlittle that was edifying one would think but indeed what stupidest thing may not human dulness pruriency lubricity chance and the devil choosing two out of halfamillion idle human heads tempt them to hist parl xi 1047  sure enough the two human individuals with their gimlet are there illstarred pair of individuals for the result of it all is that patriotism fretting itself in this state of nervous excitability with hypotheses suspicions and reports keeps questioning these two distracted human individuals and again questioning them claps them into the nearest guardhouse clutches them out again one hypothetic group snatching them from another till finally in such extreme state of nervous excitability patriotism hangs them as spies of sieur motier and the life and secret is choked out of them forevermore forevermore alas or is a day to be looked for when these two evidently mean individuals who are human nevertheless will become historical riddles and like him of the iron mask also a human individual and evidently nothing morehave their dissertations to us this only is certain that they had a gimlet provisions and a wooden leg and have died there on the lanterne as the unluckiest fools might die  and so the signature goes on in a still more excited manner and chaumette for antiquarians possess the very paper to this hour ibid xi 113 chas signed himself in a flowing saucy hand slightly leaned and hebert detestable pere duchene as if an inked spider had dropped on the paper usher maillard also has signed and many crosses which cannot write and paris through its thousand avenues is welling to the champdemars and from it in the utmost excitability of humour central fatherlands altar quite heaped with signing patriots and patriotesses the thirtybenches and whole internal space crowded with onlookers with comers and goers one regurgitating whirlpool of men and women in their sunday clothes all which a constitutional sieur motier sees and bailly looking into it with his long visage made still longer auguring no good perhaps decheance and deposition after all stop it ye constitutional patriots fire itself is quenchable yet only quenchable at first  stop it truly but how stop it have not the first free people of the universe a right to petitionhappily if also unhappily here is one proof of riot these two human individuals hanged at the lanterne proof o treacherous sieur motier were they not two human individuals sent thither by thee to be hanged to be a pretext for thy bloody drapeau rouge this question shall many a patriot one day ask and answer affirmatively strong in preternatural suspicion  enough towards half past seven in the evening the mere natural eye can behold this thing sieur motier with municipals in scarf with blue national patrollotism rank after rank to the clang of drums wending resolutely to the champdemars mayor bailly with elongated visage bearing as in sad duty bound the drapeau rouge howl of angry derision rises in treble and bass from a hundred thousand throats at the sight of martial law which nevertheless waving its red sanguinary flag advances

champs elysees illuminated why is paris dancing and flinging fireworks they are galanights these last of september paris may well dance and the universe the edifice of the constitution is completed completed nay revised to see that there was nothing insufficient in it solemnly proferred to his majesty solemnly accepted by him to the sound of cannonsalvoes on the fourteenth of the month and now by such illumination jubilee dancing and fireworking do we joyously handsel the new social edifice and first raise heat and reek there in the name of hope  the revision especially with a throne standing on its vertex has been a work of difficulty of delicacy in the way of propping and buttressing so indispensable now something could be done and yet as is feared not enough a repentant barnave triumvirate our rabauts duports thourets and indeed all constitutional deputies did strain every nerve but the extreme left was so noisy the people were so suspicious clamorous to have the work ended and then the loyal right side sat feeble petulant all the while and as it were pouting and petting unable to help had they even been willing the two hundred and ninety had solemnly made scission before that and departed shaking the dust off their feet to such transcendency of fret and desperate hope that worsening of the bad might the sooner end it and bring back the good had our unfortunate loyal right side now come toulongeon ii 56 59  however one finds that this and the other little prop has been added where possibility allowed civillist and privypurse were from of old well cared for kings constitutional guard eighteen hundred loyal men from the eightythree departments under a loyal duke de brissac this with trustworthy swiss besides is of itself something the old loyal bodyguards are indeed dissolved in name as well as in fact and gone mostly towards coblentz but now also those sansculottic violent gardes francaises or centre grenadiers shall have their mittimus they do ere

argonauts what leonidas spartans had done such a work think of their destiny since that may morning some three years ago when they unparticipating trundled off despremenil to the calypso isles since that july evening some two years ago when they participating and sacreing with knit brows poured a volley into besenvals prince de lambesc history waves them her mute adieu  so that the sovereign power these sansculottic watchdogs more like wolves being leashed and led away from his tuileries breathes freer the sovereign power is guarded henceforth by a loyal eighteen hundredwhom contrivance under various pretexts may gradually swell to six thousand who will hinder no journey to saintcloud the sad varennes business has been soldered up cemented even in the blood of the champdemars these two months and more and indeed ever since as formerly majesty has had its privileges its choice of residence though for good reasons the royal mind prefers continuing in paris poor royal mind poor paris that have to go mumming enveloped in speciosities in falsehood which knows itself false and to enact mutually your sorrowful farcetragedy being bound to it and on the whole to hope always in spite of hope  nay now that his majesty has accepted the constitution to the sound of cannonsalvoes who would not hope our good king was misguided but he meant well lafayette has moved for an amnesty for universal forgiving and forgetting of revolutionary faults and now surely the glorious revolution cleared of its rubbish is complete strange enough and touching in several ways the old cry of vive le roi once more rises round king louis the hereditary representative their majesties went to the opera gave money to the poor the queen herself now when the constitution is accepted hears voice of cheering bygone shall be bygone the new era shall begin to and fro amid those lampgalaxies of the elysian fields the royal carriage slowly wends and rolls every where with vivats from a multitude

not with a sanguine gaelic temper hope that he will get in motion better or worse that what is wanting to him will gradually be gained and added  for the rest as we must repeat in this building of the constitutional fabric especially in this revision of it nothing that one could think of to give it new strength especially to steady it to give it permanence and even eternity has been forgotten

still more active this with privileges of parliament shall meet selfauthorized if need be and selfdissolved shall grant moneysupplies and talk watch over the administration and authorities discharge for ever the functions of a constitutional great council collective wisdom and national palaveras the heavens will enable our first biennial parliament which indeed has been achoosing since early in august is now as good as chosen nay it has mostly got to paris it arrived graduallynot without pathetic greeting to its venerable parent the now moribund constituent and sat there in the galleries reverently listening ready to begin the instant the ground were clear  then as to changes in the constitution itself this impossible for any legislative or common biennial parliament and possible solely for some resuscitated constituent or national conventionis evidently one of the most ticklish points the august moribund assembly debated it for four entire days some thought a change or at least reviewal and new approval might be admissible in thirty years some even went lower down to twenty nay to fifteen the august assembly had once decided for thirty years but it revoked that on better thoughts and did not fix any date of time but merely some vague outline of a posture of circumstances and on the whole left the matter hanging choix de rapports c paris 1825 vi 239317 doubtless a national convention can be assembled even within the thirty years yet one may hope not but that legislatives biennial parliaments of the common kind with their limited faculty and perhaps quiet successive additions thereto may suffice for generations or indeed while computed time runs  furthermore be it noted that no member of this constituent has been or could be elected to the new legislative so nobleminded were these lawmakers cry some and solonlike would banish themselves so splenetic cry more each grudging the other none daring to be outdone in selfdenial by the other so unwise in either case answer all practical men but consider this other selfdenying ordinance that none of us can be kings minister or accept the smallest court appointment for the space of four or at lowest and on long debate and revision for the space of two years so moves the incorruptible seagreen robespierre with cheap magnanimity he and none dare be outdone by him it was such a law not so superfluous then that sent mirabeau to the gardens of saintcloud under cloak of darkness to that colloquy of the gods and thwarted many things happily and unhappily there is no mirabeau now to thwart  welcomer meanwhile welcome surely to all right hearts is lafayettes chivalrous amnesty welcome too is that hardwrung union of avignon which has cost us first and last thirty sessions of debate and so

first national assembly vanished dissolving as they well say into blank time and is no more national assembly is gone its work remaining as all bodies of men go and as man himself goes it had its beginning and must likewise have its end a phantasmreality born of time as the rest of us are flitting ever backwards now on the tide of time to be long remembered of men very strange assemblages sanhedrims amphictyonics trades unions ecumenic councils parliaments and congresses have met together on this planet and dispersed again but a stranger assemblage than this august constituent or with a stranger mission perhaps never met there seen from the distance this also will be a miracle twelve hundred human individuals with the gospel of jeanjacques rousseau in their pocket congregating in the name of twentyfive millions with full assurance of faith to make the constitution such sight the acme and main product of the eighteenth century our world can witness once only for time is rich in wonders in monstrosities most rich and is observed never to repeat himself or any of his gospelssurely least of all this gospel according to jeanjacques once it was right and indispensable since such

downrushing of a bastille and old feudal france they have suffered somewhat royal session with rain and oath of the tenniscourt nights of pentecost insurrections of women also have they not done

rejoices to feel himself now verily emperor of this great babylon which he has builded and is a nondescript bipedquadruped on the eve of a sevenyears course of grazing these seven hundred and fortyfive elected individuals doubt not but they are the first biennial parliament come to govern france by parliamentary eloquence and they are what and they have come to do what things foolish and not wise  it is much lamented by many that this first biennial had no members of the old constituent in it with their experience of parties and parliamentary tactics that such was their foolish selfdenying law most surely old members of the constituent had been welcome to us here but on the other hand what old or what new members of any constituent under the sun could have effectually profited there are first biennial parliaments so postured as to be in a sense beyond wisdom where wisdom and folly differ only in degree and wreckage and dissolution are the appointed issue for both  oldconstituents your barnaves lameths and the like for whom a special gallery has been set apart where they may sit in honour and listen are in the habit of sneering at these new legislators dumouriez ii 150 c but let not us the poor seven hundred and fortyfive sent together by the active citizens of france are what they could be do what is fated them that they are of patriot temper we can well understand aristocrat noblesse had fled over the marches or sat brooding silent in their unburnt chateaus small prospect had they in primary electoral assemblies what with flights to varennes what with days of poniards with plot after plot the people are left to themselves the people must needs choose defenders of the people such as can be had choosing as they also will ever do if not the ablest man yet the man ablest to be chosen fervour of character decided patriotconstitutional feeling these are qualities but free utterance mastership in tonguefence this is the quality of qualities accordingly one finds with little astonishment in this first biennial that as many as four hundred members are of the advocate or attorney species men who can speak if there be aught to speak nay here are men also who can think and even act candour will say of this illfated first french parliament that it wanted not its modicum of talent its modicum of honesty that it neither in the one respect nor in the other sank below the average of parliaments but rose above the average let average parliaments whom the world does not guillotine and cast forth to long infamy be thankful not to themselves but

of all men do now in the end of october bend themselves a tragical combustion long smoking and smouldering unluminous has now burst into flame there  hot is that southern provencal blood alas collisions as was once said must occur in a career of freedom different directions will produce such nay different velocities in the same direction will to much that went on there history busied elsewhere would not specially give heed to troubles of uzez troubles of nismes protestant and catholic patriot and aristocrat to troubles of marseilles montpelier arles to aristocrat camp of jales that wondrous realimaginary entity now fading paledim then always again glowing forth deephued in the imagination mainlyominous magical an aristocrat picture of war done naturally all this was a tragical deadly combustion with plot and riot tumult by night and by day but a dark combustion not luminous not noticed which now however one cannot help noticing  above all places the unluminous combustion in avignon and the comtat venaissin was fierce papal avignon with its castle rising sheer over the rhonestream beautifullest town with its purple vines and goldorange groves why must foolish old rhyming rene the last sovereign of provence bequeath it to the pope and gold tiara not rather to louis eleventh with the leaden virgin in his hatband for good and for evil popes antipopes with their pomp have dwelt in that castle of avignon rising sheer over the rhonestream there laura de sade went to hear mass her petrarch twanging and singing by the fountain of vaucluse hard by surely in a most melancholy manner this was in the old days  and now in these new days such issues do come from a squirt of the pen by some foolish rhyming rene after centuries this is what we have jourdan coupetete leading to siege and warfare an army from three to fifteen thousand strong called the brigands of avignon which title they themselves accept with the addition of an epithet the brave brigands of avignon it is even so jourdan the headsman fled hither from that chatelet inquest from that insurrection of women and began dealing in madder but the scene was rife in other than dyestuffs so jourdan shut his madder shop and has risen for he was the man to do it the tilebeard of jourdan is shaven off his fat visage has got coppered and studded with black carbuncles the silenus trunk is swollen with drink and high living he wears blue national uniform with epaulettes an enormous sabre two horsepistols crossed in his belt and other two smaller sticking from his pockets styles himself general and is the tyrant of men dampmartin evenemens i 267 consider this one fact o reader and what sort of facts must have preceded it must accompany it such things come of old rene and of the question which has risen whether avignon cannot now cease wholly to be papal and become french and free  for some twentyfive months the confusion has lasted say three months of arguing then seven of raging then finally some fifteen months now of fighting and even of hanging for already in february 1790 the papal aristocrats had set up four gibbets for a sign but the people rose in june in retributive frenzy and forcing the public hangman to act hanged four aristocrats on each papal gibbet a papal haman then were avignon emigrations papal aristocrats emigrating over the rhone river demission of papal consul flight victory reentrance of papal legate truce and new onslaught and the various turns of war petitions there were to national assembly congresses of townships threescore and odd townships voting for french reunion and the blessings of liberty while some twelve of the smaller manipulated by aristocrats gave vote the other way with shrieks and discord township against township town against town carpentras long jealous of avignon is now turned out in open war with itand jourdan coupetete your first general being killed in mutiny closes his dyeshop and does there visibly with siegeartillery above all with bluster and tumult with the brave brigands of avignon beleaguer the rival town for two months in the face of the world  feats were done doubt it not farfamed in parish history but to universal history unknown gibbets we see rise on the one side and on the other and wretched carcasses swinging there a dozen in the row wretched mayor of vaison buried before dead barbaroux memoires p 26 the fruitful seedfield lie unreaped the vineyards trampled down there is red cruelty madness of universal choler and gall havoc and anarchy everywhere a combustion most fierce but unlucent not to be noticed herefinally as we saw on the 14th of september last the national constituent assembly having sent commissioners and heard them lescene desmaisons compte rendu a lassemblee nationale 10 septembre 1791 choix des rapports vii 27393 having heard petitions held debates month after month ever since august 1789 and on the whole spent thirty sittings on this matter did solemnly decree that avignon and the comtat were incorporated with france and his holiness the pope should have what indemnity was reasonable  and so hereby all is amnestied and finished alas when madness of choler has gone through the blood of men and gibbets have swung on this side and on that what will a parchment decree and lafayette amnesty do oblivious lethe flows not above ground papal aristocrats and patriot brigands are still an eyesorrow to each other suspected suspicious in what they do and forbear the august constituent assembly is gone but a fortnight when on sunday the sixteenth morning of october 1791 the unquenched combustion suddenly becomes luminous for anticonstitutional placards are up and the statue of the virgin is said to have shed tears and grown red procesverbal de la commune davignon c in hist parl xii 41923 wherefore on that morning patriot lescuyer one of our six leading patriots having taken counsel with his brethren and general jourdan determines on going to church in company with a friend or two not to hear mass which he values little but to meet all the papalists there in a body nay to meet that same weeping virgin for it is the cordeliers church and give them a word of admonition adventurous errand which has the fatallest issue what lescuyers word of admonition might be no history records but the answer to it was a shrieking howl from the aristocrat papal worshippers many of them women a thousandvoiced shriek and menace which as lescuyer did not fly became a thousandhanded hustle and jostle a thousandfooted kick with tumblings and tramplings with the pricking of semstresses stilettos scissors and female pointed instruments horrible to behold the ancient dead and petrarchan laura sleeping round it there ugo foscolo

brief on the next day and the next let municipality consent or not a brigand courtmartial establishes itself in the subterranean stories of the castle of avignon brigand executioners with naked sabre

the brigands supreme now over municipals over all authorities patriot or papal reign in avignon waited on by terror and silence  the result of all which is that on the 15th of november 1791 we behold friend dampmartin and subalterns beneath him and general choisi above him with infantry and cavalry and proper cannoncarriages rattling in front with spread banners to the sound of fife and drum wend in a deliberate formidable manner towards that sheer castle rock towards those broad gates of avignon three new nationalassembly commissioners following at safe distance in the rear dampmartin i 25194

himself shew copperface with sabre and four pistols affecting to talk high engaging meanwhile to surrender the castle that instant so the choisi grenadiers enter with him there they start and stop passing that glaciere snuffing its horrible breath with wild yell with cries of cut the butcher downand jourdan has to whisk himself through secret passages and instantaneously vanish  be the mystery of iniquity laid bare then a hundred and thirty corpses of men nay of women and even children for the trembling mother hastily seized could not leave her infant lie heaped in that glaciere putrid under putridities the horror of the world for three days there is mournful lifting out and recognition amid the cries and movements of a passionate southern people now kneeling in prayer now storming in wild pity and rage lastly there is solemn sepulture with muffled drums religious requiem and all the peoples wail and tears their massacred rest now in holy ground buried in one grave  and jourdan coupetete him also we behold again after a day or two in flight through the most romantic petrarchan hillcountry vehemently spurring his nag young ligonnet a brisk youth of avignon with choisi dragoons close in his rear with such swollen mass of a rider no nag can run to advantage the tired nag spurdriven does take the river sorgue but sticks in the middle of it firm on that chiaro fondo di

and odd decrees reader these happily concern not thee nor me mere occasional decrees foolish and not foolish sufficient for that day was its own evil of the whole two thousand there are not now half a score and these mostly blighted in the bud by royal veto that will profit or disprofit us on the 17th of january the legislative for one thing got its high court its haute cour set up at orleans the theory had been given by the constituent in may last but this is the reality a court for the trial of political offences a court which cannot want work to this it was decreed that there needed no royal acceptance therefore that there could be no veto also priests can now be married ever since last october a patriotic adventurous priest had made bold to marry himself then and not thinking this enough came to the bar with his new spouse that the whole world might hold honeymoon with him and a law be obtained  less joyful are the laws against refractory priests and yet no less needful decrees on priests and decrees on emigrants these are the two brief series of decrees worked out with endless debate and then cancelled by veto which mainly concern us here for an august national assembly

waykings veto steps in with magical paralysis and your thumbscrew hardly squeezing much less crushing does not act  truly a melancholy set of decrees a pair of sets paralysed by veto first under date the 28th of october 1791 we have legislative proclamation issued by herald and billsticker inviting monsieur the kings brother to return within two months under penalties to which invitation monsieur replies nothing or indeed replies by newspaper parody inviting the august legislative to return to common sense within two months under penalties whereupon the legislative must take stronger measures so on the 9th of november we declare all emigrants to be suspect of conspiracy and in brief to be outlawed if they have not returned at newyearsdaywill the king say veto that triple impost shall be levied on these mens properties or even their properties be put in sequestration one can understand but further on newyearsday itself not an individual having returned we declare and with fresh emphasis some fortnight later again declare that monsieur is dechu forfeited of his eventual heirship to the crown nay more that conde calonne and a considerable list of others are accused of high treason and shall be judged by our high court of orleans vetothen again as to nonjurant priests it was decreed in november last that they should forfeit what pensions they had be put under inspection under surveillance and if need were be banished veto a still sharper turn is coming but to this also the answer will be veto  veto after veto your thumbscrew paralysed gods and men may see that the

her own hired garret of the ursulines convent she who has quietly shelled frenchbeans for her dinner being led to that as a young maiden by quiet insight and computation and knowing what that was and what she was such a one will also look quietly on ormoulu and veneering not ignorant of these either calonne did the veneering he gave dinners here old besenval diplomatically whispering to him and

patriot legislative and proposes on the 24th of may its decree for the banishment of priests collect also some nucleus of determined internal friends adds warminister servan and proposes on the 7th of june his camp of twentythousand twentythousand national volunteers five out of each canton picked patriots for roland has charge of the interior they shall assemble here in paris and be for a defence cunningly devised against foreign austrians and domestic austrian committee alike so much can a patriot ministry and legislative do  reasonable and cunningly devised as such camp may to servan and patriotism appear it appears not so to feuillantism to that feuillantaristocrat staff of the paris guard a staff one would say again which will need to be dissolved these men see in this proposed camp of servans an offence and even as they pretend to say an insult petitions there come in consequence from blue feuillants in epaulettes ill received nay in the end there comes one petition called of the eight thousand national guards so many names are on it including women and children which famed petition of the eight thousand is indeed received and the petitioners all under arms are admitted to the honours of the sittingif honours or even if sitting there be for the instant their bayonets appear at the one door the assembly adjourns and begins to flow out at the other moniteur seance du 10 juin 1792  also in these same days it is lamentable to see how national guards escorting fete dieu or corpuschristi ceremonial do collar and smite down any patriot that does not uncover as the hostie passes they clap their bayonets to the breast of cattlebutcher legendre a known patriot ever since the bastille days and threaten to butcher him though he sat quite respectfully he says in his gig at

gone in this corps for indeed are not their officers creatures of the chief feuillant lafayette the court too has very naturally been tampering with them caressing them ever since that dissolution of

bankers stockbrokers and other fullpurses of the rue vivienne our worthy old friend weber queens fosterbrother weber carries a musket in that battalionone may judge with what degree of patriotic intention  heedless of all which or rather heedful of all which the legislative backed by patriot france and the feeling of necessity decrees this camp of twenty thousand decisive though conditional banishment of malign priests it has already decreed  it will now be seen therefore whether the hereditary representative is for us or against us whether or not to all our other woes this intolerablest one is to be added which renders us not a menaced nation in extreme jeopardy and need but a paralytic solecism of a nation sitting wrapped as in dead cerements of a constitutionalvesture that were no other than a windingsheet our right hand glued to our left to wait there writhing and wriggling unable to stir from the spot till in prussian rope we mount to the gallows let the hereditary representative consider it well the decree of priests the camp of twenty thousandby heaven he answers veto vetostrict roland hands in his letter to the king or rather it was madames letter who wrote it all at a sitting one of the plainestspoken letters ever handed in to any king this plainspoken letter king louis has the benefit of reading overnight he reads inwardly digests and next morning the whole patriot ministry finds itself turned out it is the 13th of june 1792 madame roland ii 115  dumouriez the manycounselled he with one duranthon called minister of justice does indeed linger for a day or two in rather suspicious circumstances speaks with the queen almost weeps with her but in the end he too sets off for the army leaving what unpatriot or semipatriot ministry and ministries can now accept the helm to accept it name them not new quickchanging phantasms which shift like magiclantern figures more spectral than ever  unhappy queen unhappy louis the two vetos were so natural are not the priests martyrs also friends this camp of twenty thousand could it be other than of stormfullest sansculottes natural and yet to france unendurable priests that cooperate with coblentz must go

young barbaroux have spread out the map of france before them barbaroux says with tears they consider what rivers what mountain ranges are in it they will retire behind this loirestream defend these auvergne stonelabyrinths save some little sacred territory of the free die at least in their last ditch lafayette indites his emphatic letter to the legislative against jacobinism moniteur seance du

send out deputation after deputation to the salle de manege to petition and denounce great is their ire against tyrannous veto austrian committee and the combined cimmerian kings what boots it legislative listens to the tocsin in our hearts grants us honours of the sitting sees us defile with jingle and fanfaronade but the camp of twenty thousand the priestdecree bevetoed by majesty are become impossible for legislative fiery isnard says we will have equality should we descend for it to the tomb vergniaud utters hypothetically his stern ezekielvisions of the fate of antinational kings but the question is will hypothetic prophecies will jingle and fanfaronade demolish the veto or will the veto secure in its tuileries chateau remain undemolishable by these barbaroux dashing away his tears writes to the marseilles municipality that they must send him six hundred men who know how to die qui savent mourir barbaroux p 40 no weteyed message this but a fireeyed onewhich will be obeyed  meanwhile the twentieth of june is nigh anniversary of that worldfamous oath of the tenniscourt on which day it is said certain citizens have in view to plant a mai or tree of liberty in the tuileries terrace of the feuillants perhaps also to petition the legislative and hereditary representative about these vetoswith such demonstration jingle and evolution as may seem profitable and practicable sections have gone singly and jingled and evolved but if they all went or great part of them and there planting their mai in these alarming circumstances sounded the tocsin in their hearts  among kings friends there can be but one opinion as to such a step among nations friends there may be two on the one hand might it not by possibility scare away these unblessed vetos private patriots and even legislative deputies may have each his own opinion or own noopinion but the hardest task falls evidently on mayor petion and the municipals at once patriots and guardians of the public tranquillity hushing the matter down with the one hand tickling it up with the other mayor petion and municipality may lean this way departmentdirectory with procureursyndic roederer having a feuillant tendency may lean that on the whole each man must act according to his one opinion or to his two opinions and all manner of influences official representations cross one another in the foolishest way perhaps after all the project desirable and yet not desirable will dissipate itself being run athwart by so many complexities and coming to nothing  not so on the twentieth morning of

still presses on rearward knows little what pressure is in the front one would wish at all events were it possible to have a word with his majesty first  the shadows fall longer eastward it is four oclock will his majesty not come out hardly he in that case commandant santerre cattlebutcher legendre patriot huguenin with the tocsin in his heart they and others of authority will enter in petition and request to wearied uncertain national guard louder and louder petition backed by the rattle of our two cannons the reluctant grate opens endless sansculottic multitudes flood the stairs knock at the wooden guardian of your privacy knocks in such case grow strokes grow smashings the wooden guardian flies in shivers and now ensues a scene over which the world has long wailed and not unjustly for a sorrier spectacle of incongruity fronting incongruity and as it were recognising themselves incongruous and staring stupidly in each others face the world seldom saw  king louis his door being beaten on opens it stands with free bosom asking what do you want the sansculottic flood recoils awestruck returns however the rear pressing on the front with cries of veto patriot ministers remove vetowhich things louis valiantly answers this is not the time to do nor this the way to ask him to do honour what virtue is in a man louis does not want courage he has even the higher kind called moralcourage though only the passive half of that his few national grenadiers shuffle back with him into the embrasure of a window there he stands with unimpeachable passivity amid the shouldering and the braying a spectacle to men they hand him a red cap of liberty he sets it quietly on his head forgets it there he complains of thirst halfdrunk rascality offers him a bottle he drinks of it sire do not fear says one of his grenadiers fear answers louis feel then putting the mans hand on his heart so stands majesty in red woollen cap black sansculottism weltering round him far and wide aimless with inarticulate dissonance with cries of veto patriot ministers  for the space of three hours or more the national assembly is adjourned tricolor municipals avail almost nothing mayor petion tarries absent authority is none the queen with her children and sister elizabeth in tears and terror not for themselves only are sitting behind barricaded tables and grenadiers in an inner room the men in black have all wisely disappeared blind lake of sansculottism welters stagnant through the kings chateau for the space of three hours  nevertheless all things do end vergniaud arrives with legislative deputation the evening session having now opened mayor petion has arrived is haranguing lifted on the shoulders of two grenadiers in this uneasy attitude and in others at various places without and within mayor petion harangues many men harangue finally commandant santerre defiles passes out with his sansculottism by the opposite side of the chateau passing through the room where the queen with an air of dignity and sorrowful resignation sat among the tables and grenadiers a woman offers her too a red cap she holds it in her hand even puts it on the little prince royal madame said santerre this people loves you more than you think toulongeon ii 173 campan ii c 20about eight oclock the royal family fall into each others arms amid torrents of tears unhappy family who would not weep for it were there not a whole world to be wept for  thus has the age of chivalry gone and that of hunger come thus does allneeding sansculottism look in the face of its roi regulator king or ableman and find that he has nothing to give it thus do the two parties brought face to face after long centuries stare stupidly at one another this am i but good heaven is that thouand depart not knowing what to make of it and yet incongruities having recognised themselves to be incongruous something must be made of it the fates know what  this is the worldfamous twentieth of june more worthy to be called the procession of the black breeches with which what we had to say of this first french biennial parliament and its products and activities may perhaps fitly enough terminate     book 2vi  the marseillese   chapter 26i  executive that does not act  how could your paralytic national executive be put in action in any measure by such a twentieth of june as this quite contrariwise a large sympathy for majesty so insulted arises every where expresses itself in addresses petitions petition of the twenty thousand inhabitants of paris and such like among all constitutional persons a decided rallying round the throne  of which rallying it was thought king louis might have made something however he does make nothing of it or attempt to make for indeed his views are lifted beyond domestic sympathy and rallying over to coblentz mainly neither in itself is the same sympathy worth much it is sympathy of men who believe still that the constitution can march wherefore the old discord and ferment of feuillant sympathy for royalty and jacobin sympathy for fatherland acting against each other from within with terror of coblentz and brunswick acting from withoutthis discord and ferment must hold on its course till a catastrophe do ripen and come one would think especially as brunswick is near marching such catastrophe cannot now be distant busy ye twentyfive french millions ye foreign potentates minatory emigrants german drillserjeants each do what his hand findeth thou o reader at such safe distance wilt see what they make of it among them  consider therefore this pitiable twentieth of june as a futility no catastrophe rather a catastasis or heightening do not its black breeches wave there in the historical imagination like a melancholy flag of distress soliciting help which no mortal can give soliciting pity which thou wert hardhearted not to give freely to one and all other such flags or what are called occurrences and black or bright symbolic phenomena will flit through the historical imagination these one after one let us note with extreme brevity  the first phenomenon is that of lafayette at the bar of the assembly after a week and day promptly on hearing of this scandalous twentieth of june lafayette has quitted his command on the north frontier in better or worse order and got hither on the 28th to repress the jacobins not by letter now but by oral petition and weight of character face to face the august assembly finds the step questionable invites him meanwhile to the honours of the sitting moniteur seance du 28 juin 1792 other honour or advantage there

line hurrahing and capering round it they make a pause opposite sieur ressons door wag their plumes at him nay shake their fists bellowing a bas les jacobins but happily pass on without onslaught they pass on to plant a mai before the generals door and bully considerably all which the sieur resson cannot but report with sorrow that night in the mother society debats des jacobins hist parl xv 235 but what no sieur resson nor mother society can do more than guess is this that a council of rank feuillants your unabolished staff of the guard and who else has status and weight is in these very moments privily deliberating at the generals can we not put down the jacobins by force next day a review shall be held in the tuileries garden of such as will turn out and try alas says toulongeon hardly a hundred turned out put it off till tomorrow then to give better warning on the morrow which is saturday there turn out some thirty and depart shrugging their shoulders toulongeon ii 180 see also dampmartin ii 161 lafayette promptly takes carriage again returns musing on my things  the dust of paris is hardly off his wheels the summer sunday is still young when cordeliers in deputation pluck up that mai of his before sunset patriots have burnt him in effigy louder doubt and louder rises in section in national assembly as to the legality of such unbidden antijacobin visit on the part of a general doubt swelling and spreading all over france for six weeks or so with endless talk about usurping soldiers about english monk nay about cromwell o thou paris grandisoncromwellwhat boots it king louis himself looked coldly on the enterprize colossal hero of two worlds having weighed himself in the balance finds that he is become a gossamer colossus only some thirty turning out  in a like sense and with a like issue works our departmentdirectory here at paris who on the 6th of july take upon them to suspend mayor petion and procureur manuel from all civic functions for their conduct replete as is alleged with omissions and commissions on that delicate twentieth of june virtuous petion sees himself a kind of martyr or pseudomartyr threatened with several things drawls out due heroical lamentation to which patriot paris and patriot legislative duly respond king louis and mayor petion have already had an interview on that business of the twentieth an interview and dialogue distinguished by frankness on both sides ending on king louiss side with the words taisezvous hold your peace  for the rest this of suspending our mayor does seem a mistimed measure by ill chance it came out precisely on the day of that famous baiser de lamourette or miraculous reconciliatory delilahkiss which we spoke of long ago which delilahkiss was thereby quite hindered of effect for now his majesty has to write almost that same night asking a reconciled assembly for advice the reconciled assembly will not advise will not interfere the king confirms the suspension then perhaps but not till then will the assembly interfere the noise of patriot paris getting loud whereby your delilahkiss such was the destiny of parliament first becomes a philistine battle  nay there goes a word that as many as thirty of our chief patriot senators are to be clapped in prison by mittimus and indictment of feuillant justices juges de paix who here in paris were well capable of such a thing it was but in may last that juge de paix lariviere on complaint of bertrandmoleville touching that austrian committee made bold to launch his mittimus against three heads of the mountain deputies bazire chabot merlin the cordelier trio summoning them to appear before him and shew where that austrian committee was or else suffer the consequences which mittimus the trio on their side made bold to fling in the fire and valiantly pleaded privilege of parliament so that for his zeal without knowledge poor justice lariviere now sits in the prison of orleans waiting trial from the haute cour there whose example may it not deter other rash justices and so this word of the thirty arrestments continue a word merely  but on the whole though lafayette weighed so light and has had his mai plucked up official feuillantism falters not a whit but carries its head high strong in the letter of the law feuillants all of these men a feuillant directory founding on high character and such like with duke de la rochefoucault for presidenta thing which may prove dangerous for him dim now is the once bright anglomania of these admired noblemen duke de liancourt offers out of normandy where he is lordlieutenant not only to receive his majesty thinking of flight thither but to lend him money to enormous amounts sire it is not a revolt it is a revolution and truly no rosewater one worthier noblemen were not in france nor in europe than those two but the time is crooked quickshifting perverse what straightest course will lead to any goal in it  another phasis which we note in these early july days is that of certain thin streaks of federate national volunteers wending from various points towards paris to hold a new federationfestival or feast of pikes on the fourteenth there so has the national assembly wished it so has the nation willed it in this way perhaps may we still have our patriot camp in spite of veto for cannot these federes having celebrated their feast of pikes march on to soissons and there being drilled and regimented rush to the frontiers or whither we like thus were the one veto cunningly eluded  as indeed the other veto about priests is also like to be eluded and without much cunning for provincial assemblies in calvados as one instance are proceeding on their own strength to judge and banish antinational priests or still worse without provincial assembly a desperate people as at bourdeaux can hang two of them on the lanterne on the way towards judgment hist parl xvi 259 pity for the spoken veto when it cannot become an acted one  it is true some ghost of a warminister or homeminister for the time being ghost whom we do not name does write to municipalities and kings commanders that they shall by all conceivable methods obstruct this federation and even turn back the federes by force of arms a message which scatters mere doubt paralysis and confusion irritates the poor legislature reduces the federes as we see to thin streaks but being questioned this ghost and the other ghosts what it is then that they propose to do for saving the countrythey answer that they cannot tell that indeed they for their part have this morning resigned in a body and do now merely respectfully take leave of the helm altogether with which words they rapidly walk out of the hall sortent brusquement de la salle the galleries cheering loudly the poor legislature sitting for a good while in silence moniteur seance du juillet 1792 thus do cabinetministers themselves in extreme cases strike work one of the strangest omens other complete cabinetministry there will not be only fragments and these changeful which never get completed spectral apparitions that cannot so much as appear king louis writes that he now views this federation feast with approval and will himself have the pleasure to take part in the same  and so these thin streaks of federes wend parisward through a paralytic france thin grim streaks not thick joyful ranks as of old to the first feast of pikes no these poor federates march now towards austria and austrian committee towards jeopardy and forlorn hope men of hard fortune and temper not rich in the worlds goods municipalities paralyzed by warministers are shy of affording cash it may be your poor federates cannot arm themselves cannot march till the daughtersociety of the place open her pocket and subscribe there will not have arrived at the set day three thousand of them in all and yet thin and feeble as these streaks of federates seem they are the only thing one discerns moving with any clearness of aim in this strange scene angry buz and simmer uneasy tossing and moaning of a huge france all enchanted spellbound by unmarching constitution into frightful conscious and unconscious magneticsleep which frightful magneticsleep must now issue soon in one of two things death or madness the federes carry mostly in their pocket some earnest cry and petition to have the national executive put in action or as a step towards that to have the kings decheance kings forfeiture or at least his suspension pronounced they shall be welcome to the legislative to the mother of patriotism and paris will provide for their lodging  decheance indeed and what next a france spellfree a revolution saved and any thing and all things next so answer grimly danton and the unlimited patriots down deep in their subterranean region of plot whither they have now dived decheance answers brissot with the limited and if next the little prince royal were crowned and some regency of girondins and recalled patriot ministry set over him alas poor brissot looking as indeed poor man does always on the nearest morrow as his peaceable promised land deciding what must reach to the worlds end yet with an insight that reaches not beyond his own nose wiser are the unlimited subterranean patriots who with light for the hour itself leave the rest to the gods  or were it not as we now stand the probablest issue of all that brunswick in coblentz just gathering his huge limbs towards him to rise might arrive first and stop both decheance and theorizing on it brunswick is on the eve of marching with eighty thousand they say fell prussians hessians feller emigrants a general of the great frederick with such an army and our armies and our generals as for lafayette on whose late visit a committee is sitting and all france is jarring and censuring he seems readier to fight us than fight brunswick luckner and lafayette pretend to be interchanging corps and are making movements which patriotism cannot understand this only is very clear that their corps go marching and shuttling in the interior of the country much nearer paris than formerly luckner has ordered dumouriez down to him down from maulde and the fortified camp there which order the manycounselled dumouriez with the austrians hanging close on him he busy meanwhile training a few thousands to stand fire and be soldiers declares that come of it what will he cannot obey dumouriez ii 1 5 will a poor legislative therefore sanction dumouriez who applies to it not knowing whether there is any warministry or sanction luckner and these lafayette movements  the poor legislative knows not what to do it decrees however that the staff of the paris guard and indeed all such staffs for they are feuillants mostly shall be broken and replaced it decrees earnestly in what manner one can declare that the country is in danger and finally on the 11th of july the morrow of that day when the ministry struck work it decrees that the country be with all despatch declared in danger whereupon let the king sanction let the municipality take measures if such declaration will do service it need not fail  in danger truly if ever country was arise o country or be trodden down to ignominious ruin nay are not the chances a hundred to one that no rising of the country will save it brunswick the emigrants and feudal europe drawing nigh    chapter 26ii  let us march  but to our minds the notablest of all these moving phenomena is that of barbarouxs six hundred marseillese who know how to die  prompt to the request of barbaroux the marseilles municipality has got these men together on the fifth morning of july the townhall says marchez abatez le tyran march strike down the tyrant dampmartin ii 183 and they with grim appropriate marchons are marching long journey doubtful errand enfans de la patrie may a good genius guide you their own wild heart and what faith it has will guide them and is not that the monition of some genius better or worse five hundred and seventeen able men with captains of fifties and tens well armed all musket on shoulder sabre on thigh nay they drive three pieces of cannon for who knows what obstacles may occur municipalities there are paralyzed by warminister commandants with orders to stop even federation volunteers good when sound arguments will not open a towngate if you have a petard to shiver it they have left their sunny phocean city and seahaven with its bustle and its bloom the thronging course with highfrondent avenues pitchy dockyards almond and olive groves orange trees on housetops and white glittering bastides that crown the hills are all behind them they wend on their wild way from the extremity of french land through unknown cities toward an unknown destiny with a purpose that they know  much wondering at this phenomenon and how in a peaceable trading city so many householders or hearthholders do severally fling down their crafts and industrial tools gird themselves with weapons of war and set out on a journey of six hundred miles to strike down the tyrantyou search in all historical books pamphlets and newspapers for some light on it unhappily without effect rumour and terror precede this march which still echo on you the march itself an unknown thing weber in the backstairs of the tuileries has understood that they were forcats galleyslaves and mere scoundrels these marseillese that as they marched through lyons the people shut their shopsalso that the number of them was some four thousand equally vague is blanc gilli who likewise murmurs about forcats and danger of plunder see barbaroux memoires note in p 40 41 forcats they were not neither was there plunder or danger of it men of regular life or of the bestfilled purse they could hardly be the one thing needful in them was that they knew how to die friend dampmartin saw them with his own eyes march gradually through his quarters at villefranche in the beaujolais but saw in the vaguest manner being indeed preoccupied and himself minded for matching just thenacross the rhine deep was his astonishment to think of such a march without appointment or arrangement station or ration for the rest it was the same men he had seen formerly in the troubles of the south perfectly civil though his soldiers could not be kept from talking a little with them dampmartin ubi supra  so vague are all these moniteur histoire parlementaire are as good as silent garrulous history as is too usual will say nothing where you most wish her to speak if enlightened curiosity ever get sight of the marseilles councilbooks will it not perhaps explore this strangest of municipal procedures and feel called to fish up what of the biographies creditable or discreditable of these five hundred and seventeen the stream of time has not yet irrevocably swallowed  as it is these marseillese remain inarticulate undistinguishable in feature a blackbrowed mass full of grim fire who wend there in the hot sultry weather very singular to contemplate they wend amid the infinitude of doubt and dim peril they not doubtful fate and feudal europe having decided come girdling in from without they having also decided do march within dusty of face with frugal refreshment they plod onwards unweariable not to be turned aside such march will become famous the thought which works voiceless in this blackbrowed mass an inspired tyrtaean colonel rouget de lille whom the earth still holds ad 1836 has translated into grim melody and rhythm into his hymn or march of the marseillese luckiest musicalcomposition ever promulgated the sound of which will make the blood tingle in mens veins and whole armies and assemblages will sing it with eyes weeping and burning with hearts defiant of death despot and devil  one sees well these marseillese will be too late for the federation feast in fact it is not champdemars oaths that they have in view they have quite another feat to do a paralytic national executive to set in action they must strike down whatsoever tyrant or martyrfaineant there may be who paralyzes it strike and be struck and on the whole prosper and know how to die    chapter 26iii  some consolation to mankind  of the federation feast itself we shall say almost nothing there are tents pitched in the champdemars tent for national assembly tent for hereditary representativewho indeed is there too early and has to wait long in it there are eightythree symbolical departmental treesofliberty trees and mais enough beautifullest of all these is one huge mai hung round with effete scutcheons emblazonries and genealogybooks nay better still with lawyersbags sacs de procedure which shall be burnt the thirty seatrows of that famed slope are again full we have a bright sun and all is marching streamering and blaring but what avails it virtuous mayor petion whom feuillantism had suspended was reinstated only last night by decree of the assembly mens humour is of the sourest mens hats have on them written in chalk vive petion and even petion or death petion ou la mort  poor louis who has waited till five oclock before the assembly would arrive swears the national oath this time with a quilted cuirass under his waistcoat which will turn pistolbullets campan ii c 20 de stael ii c 7 madame de stael from that royal tent stretches out the neck in a kind of agony lest the waving multitudes which receive him may not render him back alive no cry of vive le roi salutes the ear cries only of vive petion petion ou la mort the national solemnity is as it were huddled by each cowering off almost before the evolutions are gone through the very mai with its scutcheons and lawyersbags is forgotten stands unburnt till certain patriot deputies called by the people set a torch to it by way of voluntary afterpiece sadder feast of pikes no man ever saw  mayor petion named on hats is at his zenith in this federation lafayette again is close upon his nadir why does the stormbell of saintroch speak out next saturday why do the citizens shut their shops moniteur seance du 21 juillet 1792 it is sections defiling it is fear of effervescence legislative committee long deliberating on lafayette and that antijacobin visit of his reports this day that there is not ground for accusation peace ye patriots nevertheless and let that tocsin cease the debate is not finished nor the report accepted but brissot isnard and the mountain will sift it and resift it perhaps for some three weeks longer  so many bells stormbells and noises do ringscarcely audible one drowning the other for example in this same lafayette tocsin of saturday was there not withal some faint bobminor and deputation of legislative ringing the chevalier paul jones to his long rest tocsin or dirge now all one to him not ten days hence patriot brissot beshouted this day by the patriot galleries shall find himself begroaned by them on account of his limited patriotism nay pelted at while perorating and hit with two prunes hist parl xvi 185 it is a distracted emptysounding world of bobminors and bobmajors of triumph and terror of rise and fall  the more touching is this other solemnity which happens on the morrow of the lafayette tocsin proclamation that the country is in danger not till the present sunday could such solemnity be the legislative decreed it almost a fortnight ago but royalty and the ghost of a ministry held back as they could now however on this sunday 22nd day of july 1792 it will hold back no longer and the solemnity in very deed is touching to behold municipality and mayor have on their scarfs cannonsalvo booms alarm from the pontneuf and singlegun at intervals all day guards are mounted scarfed notabilities halberdiers and a cavalcade with streamers emblematic flags especially with one huge flag flapping mournfully citoyens la patrie est en danger they roll through the streets with sternsounding music and slow rattle of hoofs pausing at set stations and with doleful blast of trumpet singing out through heralds throat what the flag says to the eye citizens the country is in danger  is there a mans heart that hears it without a thrill the manyvoiced responsive hum or bellow of these multitudes is not of triumph and yet it is a sound deeper than triumph but when the long cavalcade and proclamation ended and our huge flag was fixed on the pont neuf another like it on the hoteldeville to wave there till better days and each municipal sat in the centre of his section in a tent raised in some open square tent surmounted with flags of patrie en danger and topmost of all a pike and bonnet rouge and on two drums in front of him there lay a planktable and on this an open book and a clerk sat like recordingangel ready to write the lists or as we say to enlist o then it seems the very gods might have looked down on it young patriotism culottic and sansculottic rushes forward emulous that is my name name blood and life is all my countrys why have i nothing more youths of short stature weep that they are below size old men come forward a son in each hand mothers themselves will grant the son of their travail send him though with tears and the multitude bellows vive la patrie far reverberating and fire flashes in the eyes of menand at eventide your municipal returns to the townhall followed by his long train of volunteer valour hands in his list says proudly looking round this is my days harvest tableau de la revolution para patrie en danger they will march on the morrow to soissons small bundle holding all their chattels  so with vive la patrie vive la liberte stone paris reverberates like ocean in his caves day after day municipals enlisting in tricolor tent the flag flapping on pont neuf and townhall citoyens la patrie est en danger some ten thousand fighters without discipline but full of heart are on march in few days the like is doing in every town of franceconsider therefore whether the country will want defenders had we but a national executive let the sections and primary assemblies at any rate become permanent and sit continually in paris and over france by legislative decree dated wednesday the 25th moniteur seance du 25 juillet 1792  mark contrariwise how in these very hours dated the 25th brunswick shakes himself sebranle in coblentz and takes the road shakes himself indeed one spoken word becomes such a shaking successive simultaneous dirl of thirty thousand muskets shouldered prance and jingle of tenthousand horsemen fanfaronading emigrants in the van drum kettledrum noise of weeping swearing and the immeasurable lumbering clank of baggagewaggons and campkettles that groan into motion all this is brunswick shaking himself not without all this does the one man march covering a space of forty miles still less without his manifesto dated as we say the 25th a statepaper worthy of attention  by this document it would seem great things are in store for france the universal french people shall now have permission to rally round brunswick and his emigrant seigneurs tyranny of a jacobin faction shall oppress them no more but they shall return and find favour with their own good king who by royal declaration three years ago of the twentythird of june said that he would himself make them happy as for national assembly and other bodies of men invested with some temporary shadow of authority they are charged to maintain the kings cities and strong places intact till brunswick arrive to take delivery of them indeed quick submission may extenuate many things but to this end it must be quick any national guard or other unmilitary person found resisting in arms shall be treated as a traitor that is to say hanged with promptitude for the rest if paris before brunswick gets thither offer any insult to the king or for example suffer a faction to carry the king away elsewhither in that case paris shall be blasted asunder with cannonshot and military execution likewise all other cities which may witness and not resist to the uttermost such forcedmarch of his majesty shall be blasted asunder and paris and every city of them startingplace course and goal of said sacrilegious forcedmarch shall as rubbish and smoking ruin lie there for a sign such vengeance were indeed signal an insigne

milkcows hardliving cadgersasses and poor little canarybirds die  nor is royal and imperial prussianaustrian declaration wanting setting forth in the amplest manner their sanssoucischonbrunn version

protocolling and manifestoing and consoling mankind how were it if for once in the thousand years your parchments formularies and reasons of state were blown to the four winds and reality

insurrection is to be but when this only we can discern that such federes as are not yet gone to soissons as indeed are not inclined to go yet for reasons says the jacobin president which it may be interesting not to state have got a central committee sitting close by under the roof of the mother society herself also what in such ferment and danger of effervescence is surely proper the fortyeight sections have got their central committee intended for prompt communication to which central committee the municipality anxious to have it at hand could not refuse an apartment in the

national assembly grumbled something about terrace of the feuillants how said terrace lay contiguous to the back entrance to their salle and was partly national property and so now national justice has stretched a tricolor riband athwart by way of boundaryline respected with splenetic strictness by all patriots it hangs there that tricolor boundaryline carries satirical inscriptions on cards

retired nightly to their small upper rooms the luxembourg and safeguard of the nation could not be got ready nay it seems the luxembourg has too many cellars and issues no municipality can undertake to watch it the compact prison of the temple not so elegant indeed were much safer to the temple therefore on monday 13th day of august 1792 in mayor petions carriage louis and his sad suspended household fare thither all paris out to look at them as they pass through the place vendome louis fourteenths statue lies broken on the ground petion is afraid the queens looks may be thought scornful and produce provocation she casts down her eyes and does not look at all the press is prodigious but quiet here and there it shouts vive la nation but for most part gazes in silence french royalty vanishes within the gates of the temple these old peaked towers like peaked extinguisher or bonsoir do cover it upfrom which same towers poor jacques molay and his templars were burnt out by french royalty five centuries since such are the turns of fate below foreign ambassadors english lord gower have all demanded passports are driving indignantly towards their respective homes  so then the constitution is over for ever and a day gone is that wonder of the universe first biennial parliament waterlogged waits only till the convention come and will then sink to endless depths  one can guess the silent rage of oldconstituents constitutionbuilders extinct feuillants men who thought the constitution would march lafayette rises to the altitude of the situation at the head of his army legislative commissioners are posting towards him and it on the northern frontier to congratulate and perorate he orders the municipality of sedan to arrest these commissioners and keep them strictly in ward as rebels till he say further the sedan municipals obey  the sedan municipals obey but the soldiers of the lafayette army the soldiers of the lafayette army have as all soldiers have a kind of dim feeling that they themselves are sansculottes in buff belts that the victory of the tenth of august is also a victory for them they will not rise and follow lafayette to paris they will rise and send him thither on the 18th which is but next saturday lafayette with some two or three indignant staffofficers one of whom is oldconstituent alexandre de lameth having first put his lines in what order he couldrides swiftly over the marches towards holland rides alas swiftly into the claws of austrians he longwavering trembling on the verge of the horizon has set in olmutz dungeons this history knows him no more adieu thou hero of two worlds thinnest but compact honourworthy man through long rough night of captivity through other tumults triumphs and changes thou wilt swing well fastanchored to the washington formula and be the hero and perfectcharacter were it only of one idea the sedan municipals repent and protest the soldiers shout vive la nation dumouriez polymetis from his camp at maulde sees himself made commander in chief  and o brunswick what sort of military execution will paris merit now forward ye welldrilled exterminatory men with your artillerywaggons and camp kettles jingling forward tall chivalrous king of prussia fanfaronading emigrants and wargod broglie for some consolation to mankind which verily is not without need of some    end of the second volume     volume iii  the guillotine   book 3i  september   chapter 31i  the improvised commune  ye have roused her then ye emigrants and despots of the world france is roused long have ye been lecturing and tutoring this poor nation like cruel uncalledfor pedagogues shaking over her your ferulas of fire and steel it is long that ye have pricked and fillipped and affrighted her there as she sat helpless in her dead cerements of a constitution you gathering in on her from all lands with your armaments and plots your invadings and truculent bullyingsand lo now ye have pricked her to the quick and she is up and her blood is up the dead cerements are rent into cobwebs and she fronts you in that terrible strength of nature which no man has measured which goes down to madness and tophet see now how ye will deal with her  this month of september 1792 which has become one of the memorable months of history presents itself under two most diverse aspects all of black on the one side all of bright on the other whatsoever is cruel in the panic frenzy of twentyfive million men whatsoever is great in the simultaneous deathdefiance of twentyfive million men stand here in abrupt contrast near by one another as indeed is usual when a man how much more when a nation of men is hurled suddenly beyond the limits for nature as green as she looks rests everywhere on dread foundations were we farther down and pan to whose music the nymphs dance has a cry in him that can drive all men distracted  very frightful it is when a nation rending asunder its constitutions and regulations which were grown dead cerements for it becomes transcendental and must now seek its wild way through the new chaoticwhere force is not yet distinguished into bidden and forbidden but crime and virtue welter unseparatedin that domain of what is called the passions of what we call the miracles and the portents it is thus that for some three years to come we are to contemplate france in this final third volume of our history sansculottism reigning in all its grandeur and in all its hideousness the gospel gods message of mans rights mans mights or strengths once more preached irrefragably abroad along with this and still louder for the time and fearfullest devilsmessage of mans weaknesses and sinsand all on such a scale and under such aspect cloudy deathbirth of a world huge smokecloud streaked with rays as of heaven on one side girt on the other as with hellfire history tells us many things but for the last thousand years and more what thing has she told us of a sort like this which therefore let us two o reader dwell on willingly for a little and from its endless significance endeavour to extract what may in present circumstances be adapted for us  it is unfortunate though very natural that the history of this period has so generally been written in hysterics exaggeration abounds execration wailing and on the whole darkness but thus too when foul old rome had to be swept from the earth and those northmen and other horrid sons of nature came in swallowing formulas as the french now do foul old rome screamed execratively her loudest so that the true shape of many things is lost for us attilas huns had arms of such length that they could lift a stone without stooping into the body of the poor tatars execrative roman history intercalated an alphabetic letter and so they continue tartars of fell tartarean nature to this day here in like manner search as we will in these multiform innumerable french records darkness too frequently covers or sheer distraction bewilders one finds it difficult to imagine that the sun shone in this september month as he does in others nevertheless it is an indisputable fact that the sun did shine and there was weather and worknay as to that very bad weather for harvest work an unlucky editor may do his utmost and after all require allowances  he had been a wise frenchman who looking close at hand on this waste aspect of a france all stirring and whirling in ways new untried had been able to discern where the cardinal movement lay which tendency it was that had the rule and primary direction of it then but at fortyfour years distance it is different to all men now two cardinal movements or grand tendencies in the september whirl have become discernible enough that stormful effluence towards the frontiers that frantic crowding towards townhouses and councilhalls in the interior wild france dashes in desperate deathdefiance towards the frontiers to defend itself from foreign despots crowds towards townhalls and election committeerooms to defend itself from domestic aristocrats let the reader conceive well these two cardinal movements and what sidecurrents and endless vortexes might depend on these he shall judge too whether in such sudden wreckage of all old authorities such a pair of cardinal movements halffrantic in themselves could be of soft nature as in dry sahara when the winds waken and lift and winnow the immensity of sand the air itself travellers say is a dim sandair and dim looming through it the wonderfullest uncertain colonnades of sandpillars rush whirling from this side and from that like so many mad spinningdervishes of a hundred feet in stature and dance their huge desertwaltz there  nevertheless in all human movements were they but a day old there is order or the beginning of order consider two things in this saharawaltz of the french twentyfive millions or rather one thing and one hope of a thing the commune municipality of paris which is already here the national convention which shall in few weeks be here the insurrectionary commune which improvising itself on the eve of the tenth of august worked this evermemorable deliverance by explosion must needs rule over ittill the convention meet this commune which they may well call a spontaneous or improvised commune is for the present sovereign of france the legislative deriving its authority from the old how can it now have authority when the old is exploded by insurrection as a floating piece of wreck certain things persons and interests may still cleave to it volunteer defenders riflemen or pikemen in green uniform or red nightcap of bonnet rouge defile before it daily just on the wing towards brunswick with the brandishing of arms always with some touch of leonidaseloquence often with a fire of daring that threatens to outherod herodthe galleries especially the ladies never done with applauding moores journal i 85 addresses of this or the like sort can be received and answered in the hearing of all france the salle de manege is still useful as a place of proclamation for which use indeed it now chiefly serves vergniaud delivers spiritstirring orations but always with a prophetic sense only looking towards the coming convention let our memory perish cries vergniaud but let france be freewhereupon they all start to their feet shouting responsive yes yes perisse notre memoire pourvu que la france soit libre hist parl xvii 467 disfrocked chabot abjures heaven that at least we may have done with kings and fast as powder under spark we all blaze up once more and with waved hats shout and swear yes nous le jurons plus de roi ibid xvii 437 all which as a method of proclamation is very convenient  for the rest that our busy brissots rigorous rolands men who once had authority and now have less and less men who love law and will have even an explosion explode itself as far as possible according to rule do find this state of matters most unofficial unsatisfactoryis not to be denied complaints are made attempts are made but without effect the attempts even recoil and must be desisted from for fear of worse the sceptre is departed from this legislative once and always a poor legislative so hard was fate had let itself be handgyved nailed to the rock like an andromeda and could only wail there to the earth and heavens miraculously a winged perseus or improvised commune has dawned out of the void blue and cut her loose but whether now is it she with her softness and musical speech or is it he with his hardness and sharp falchion and aegis that shall have casting vote melodious agreement of vote this were the rule but if otherwise and votes diverge then surely andromedas part is to weepif possible tears of gratitude alone  be content o france with this improvised commune such as it is it has the implements and has the hands the time is not long on sunday the twentysixth of august our primary assemblies shall meet begin electing of electors on sunday the second of september may the day prove lucky the electors shall begin electing deputies and so an allhealing national convention will come together no marc dargent or distinction of active and passive now insults the french patriot but there is universal suffrage unlimited liberty to choose oldconstituents presentlegislators all france is eligible nay it may be said the flower

is getting ready the salles des cent suisses as preliminary rendezvous for them in that void palace of the tuileries now void and national and not a palace but a caravansera  as for the spontaneous commune one may say that there never was on earth a stranger towncouncil administration not of a great city but of a great kingdom in a state of revolt and frenzy this is the task that has fallen to it enrolling provisioning judging devising deciding doing endeavouring to do one wonders the human brain did not give way under all this and reel but happily human brains have such a talent of taking up simply what they can carry and ignoring all the rest leaving all the rest as if it were not there whereby somewhat is verily shifted for and much shifts for itself this improvised commune walks along nothing doubting promptly making front without fear or flurry at what moment soever to the wants of the moment were the world on fire one improvised tricolor municipal has but one life to lose

electors elected and in spite of brunswicks and longwis teeth were hoping still to have a national convention if it pleased heaven but indeed otherwise this wednesday is to be regarded as one of the notablest paris had yet seen gloomy tidings come successively like jobs messengers are met by gloomy answers of sardinia rising to invade the southeast and spain threatening the south we do not speak

without a dramatic emotion that one reads in the parliamentary debates of this wednesday evening past seven oclock the scene with the military fugitives from longwi wayworn dusty disheartened these poor men enter the legislative about sunset or after give the most pathetic detail of the frightful pass they were inprussians billowing round by the myriad volcanically spouting fire for fifteen

longwi or rebuking poor dusty soldiers or soldiers wives danton had come over last night and demanded a decree to search for arms since they were not yielded voluntarily let domiciliary visits with rigour of authority be made to this end to search for arms for horsesaristocratism rolls in its carriage while patriotism cannot trail its cannon to search generally for munitions of war in the houses of persons suspectand even if it seem proper to seize and imprison the suspect persons themselves in the prisons their plots will be harmless in the prisons they will be as hostages for us and not without use this decree the energetic minister of justice demanded last night and got and this same night it is to be executed it is being executed at the moment when these dusty soldiers get saluted with mourir two thousand stand of arms as they count are foraged in this way and some four hundred head of new prisoners and on the whole such a terror and damp is struck through the aristocrat heart as all but patriotism and even patriotism were it out of this agony might pity yes messieurs if brunswick blast paris to ashes he probably will blast the prisons of paris too pale terror if we have got it we will also give it and the depth of horrors that lie in it the same leaky bottom in these wild waters bears us all  one can judge what stir there was now among the thirty thousand royalists how the plotters or the accused of plotting shrank each closer into his lurkingplacelike bertrand moleville looking eager towards longwi hoping the weather would keep fair or how they dressed

sabres a turnkey with a torch lighted them he pointed to the bed of the unfortunate swiss reding reding spoke with a dying voice one of them paused but the other cried allons donc lifted the unfortunate man carried him out on his back to the street he was massacred there  we all looked at one another in silence we clasped each others hands motionless with fixed eyes we gazed on the pavement of our prison on which lay the moonlight checkered with the triple stancheons of our windows  three in the morning they were breakingin one of the prisondoors we at first thought they were coming to kill us in our room but heard by voices on the staircase that it was a room where some prisoners had barricaded themselves they were all butchered there as we shortly gathered  ten oclock the abbe lenfant and the abbe de chaptrastignac appeared in the pulpit of the chapel which was our prison they had entered by a door from the stairs they said to us that our end was at hand that we must compose ourselves and receive their last blessing an electric movement not to be defined threw us all on our knees and we received it these two whitehaired old men blessing us from their place above death hovering over our heads on all hands environing us the moment is never to be forgotten half an hour after they were both massacred and we heard their cries jourgniac saintmeard mon agonie

witnessing this resurrection by him is greatly the best the least theatrical of these pamphlets and stands testing by documents  towards seven oclock on sunday night prisoners were called frequently and they did not reappear each of us reasoned in his own way on this singularity but our ideas became calm as we persuaded ourselves that the memorial i had drawn up for the national assembly was producing effect  at one in the morning the grate which led to our quarter opened anew four men in uniform each with a drawn sabre and blazing torch came up to our corridor preceded by a turnkey and entered an apartment close to ours to investigate a box there which we heard them break up this done they stept into the gallery and questioned the man cuissa to know where lamotte necklaces widower was lamotte they said had some months ago under pretext of a treasure he knew of swindled a sum of threehundred livres from one of them inviting him to dinner for that purpose the wretched cuissa now in their hands who indeed lost his life this night answered trembling that he remembered the fact well but could not tell what was become of lamotte determined to find lamotte and confront him with cuissa they rummaged along with this latter through various other apartments but without effect for we heard them say come search among the corpses then for nom de dieu we must find where he is  at this time i heard louis bardy the abbe bardys name called he was brought out and directly massacred as i learnt he had been accused along with his concubine five or six years before of having murdered and cut in pieces his own brother auditor of the chambre des comptes at montpelier but had by his subtlety his dexterity nay his eloquence outwitted the judges and escaped  one may fancy what terror these words come search among the corpses then had thrown me into i saw nothing for it now but resigning myself to die i wrote my lastwill concluding it by a petition and adjuration that the paper should be sent to its address scarcely had i quitted the pen when there came two other men in uniform one of them whose arm and sleeve up to the very shoulder as well as the sabre were covered with blood said he was as weary as a hodman that had been beating plaster  baudin de la chenaye was called sixty years of virtues could not save him they said a labbaye he passed the fatal outergate gave a cry of terror at sight of the heaped corpses covered his eyes with his hands and died of innumerable wounds at every new opening of the grate i thought i should hear my own name called and see rossignol enter  i flung off my nightgown and cap i put on a coarse unwashed shirt a worn frock without waistcoat an old round hat these things i had sent for some days ago in the fear of what might happen  the rooms of this corridor had been all emptied but ours we were four together whom they seemed to have forgotten we addressed our prayers in common to the eternal to be delivered from this peril  baptiste the turnkey came up by himself to see us i took him by the hands i conjured him to save us promised him a hundred louis if he would conduct me home a noise coming from the grates made him hastily withdraw  it was the noise of some dozen or fifteen men armed to the teeth as we lying flat to escape being seen could see from our windows up stairs said they let not one remain i took out my penknife i considered where i should strike myselfbut reflected that the blade was too short and also on religion  finally however between seven and eight oclock in the morning enter four men with bludgeons and sabresto one of whom gerard my comrade whispered earnestly apart during their colloquy i searched every where for shoes that i might lay off the advocate pumps pantoufles de palais i had on but could find noneconstant called le sauvage gerard and a third whose name escapes me they let clear off as for me four sabres were crossed over my breast and they led me down i was brought to their bar to the personage with the scarf who sat as judge there he was a lame man of tall lank stature he recognised me on the streets and spoke to me seven months after i have been assured that

had no key there were three of us in this violon my companions thought they perceived a kind of loft overhead but it was very high only one of us could reach it by mounting on the shoulders of both the others one of them said to me that my life was usefuller than theirs i resisted they insisted no denial i fling myself on the neck of these two deliverers never was scene more touching i mount on

the night had become day and the day has again become night jourgniac worn down with uttermost agitation has fallen asleep and had a cheering dream he has also contrived to make acquaintance with one of the volunteer bailiffs and spoken in native provencal with him on tuesday about one in the morning his agony is reaching its crisis  by the glare of two torches i now descried the terrible tribunal where lay my life or my death the president in grey coats with a sabre at his side stood leaning with his hands against a table on which were papers an inkstand tobaccopipes and bottles some ten persons were around seated or standing two of whom had jackets and aprons others were sleeping stretched on benches two men in bloody shirts guarded the door of the place an old turnkey had his hand on the lock in front of the president three men held a prisoner who might be about sixty or seventy he was old marshal maille of the tuileries and august tenth they stationed me in a corner my guards crossed their sabres on my breast i looked on all sides for my provencal two national guards one of them drunk presented some appeal from the section of croix rouge in favour of the prisoner the man in grey answered they are useless these appeals for traitors then the prisoner exclaimed it is frightful your judgment is a murder the president answered my hands are washed of it take m maille away they drove him into the street where through the opening of the door i saw him massacred  the president sat down to write registering i suppose the name of this one whom they had finished then i heard him say another a un autre  behold me then haled before this swift and bloody judgmentbar where the best protection was to have no protection and all resources of ingenuity became null if they were not founded on truth two of my guards held me each by a hand the third by the collar of my coat your name your profession said the president the smallest lie ruins you added one of the judgesmy name is jourgniac saintmeard i have served as an officer twenty years and i appear at your tribunal with the assurance of an innocent man who therefore will not liewe shall see that said the president do you know why you are arrestedyes monsieur le president i am accused of editing the journal de la cour et de la ville but i hope to prove the falsity  but no jourgniacs proof of the falsity and defence generally though of excellent result as a defence is not interesting to read it is longwinded there is a loose theatricality in the reporting of it which does not amount to unveracity yet which tends that way we shall suppose him successful beyond hope in proving and disproving and skip largelyto the catastrophe almost at two steps  but after all said one of the judges there is no smoke without kindling tell us why they accuse you of thati was about to do sojourgniac does so with more and more success  nay continued i they accuse me even of recruiting for the emigrants at these words there arose a general murmur o messieurs messieurs i exclaimed raising my voice it is my turn to speak i beg m le president to have the kindness to maintain it for me i never needed it moretrue enough true enough said almost all the judges with a laugh silence  while they were examining the testimonials i had produced a new prisoner was brought in and placed before the president it was one priest more they said whom they had ferreted out of the chapelle after very few questions a la force he flung his breviary on the table was hurled forth and massacred i reappeared before the tribunal  you tell us always cried one of the judges with a tone of impatience that you are not this that you are not that what are you theni was an open royalistthere arose a general murmur which was miraculously appeased by another of the men who had seemed to take an interest in me we are not here to judge opinions said he but to judge the results of them could rousseau and voltaire both in one pleading for me have said betteryes messieurs cried i always till the tenth of august i was an open royalist ever since the tenth of august that cause has been finished i am a frenchman true to my country i was always a man of honour  my soldiers never distrusted me nay two days before that business of nanci when their suspicion of their officers was at its height they chose me for commander to lead them to luneville to get back the prisoners of the regiment mestredecamp and seize general malseigne which fact there is most luckily an individual present who by a certain token can confirm  the president this crossquestioning being over took off his hat and said i see nothing to suspect in this man i am for granting him his liberty is that your vote to which all the judges answered oui oui it is just  and there arose vivats within doors and without escort of three amid shoutings and embracings thus jourgniac escaped from jurytrial and the jaws of death mon agonie ut supra hist parl xviii 128 maton and

described by dumouriez himself and more interesting to us than hoyles or philidors best game of chess let us nevertheless o reader entirely omitand hasten to remark two things the first a minute private the second a large public thing our minute private thing is the presence in the prussian host in that wargame of the argonne of a certain man belonging to the sort called immortal who in days since then is becoming visible more and more in that character as the transitory more and more vanishes for from of old it was remarked that when the gods appear among men it is seldom in recognisable shape thus admetus neatherds give apollo a draught of their goatskin wheybottle well if they do not give him strokes with their oxrungs not dreaming that he is the sungod this mans name is johann

get a very uncommon sensation which can only be described by similitude it seems as if you were in some place extremely hot and at the same time were completely penetrated by the heat of it so that you feel as if you and this element you are in were perfectly on a par the eyesight loses nothing of its strength or distinctness and yet it is as if all things had got a kind of brownred colour which makes the situation and the objects still more impressive on you goethe campagne in frankreich werke xxx 73  this is the cannonfever as a worldpoet feels ita man entirely irrecognisable in whose irrecognisable head meanwhile there verily is the spiritual counterpart and call it complement of this same huge deathbirth of the world which now effectuates itself outwardly in the argonne in such cannonthunder inwardly in the irrecognisable head quite otherwise than by thunder mark that man o reader as the memorablest of all the memorable in this argonne campaign what we say of him is not dream nor flourish of rhetoric but scientific historic fact as many men now at this distance see or begin to see  but the large public thing we had to remark is this that the twentieth of september 1792 was a raw morning covered with mist that from three in the morning saintemenehould and those villages and homesteads we know of old were stirred by the rumble of artillerywagons by the clatter of hoofs and many footed tramp of men all manner of military patriot and prussian taking up positions on the heights of la lune and other heights shifting and shovingseemingly in some dread chessgame which may the heavens turn to good the miller of valmy has fled dusty under ground his mill were it never so windy will have rest today at seven in the morning the mist clears off see kellermann dumouriez second in command with eighteen pieces of cannon and deepserried ranks drawn up round that same silent windmill on his knoll of strength brunswick also with serried ranks and cannon glooming over to him from the height of la lune only the little brook and its little dell now parting them  so that the muchlongedfor has come at last instead of hunger and dysentery we shall have sharp shot and thendumouriez with force and firm front looks on from a neighbouring height can help only with his wishes in silence lo the eighteen pieces do bluster and bark responsive to the bluster of la lune and thunderclouds mount into the air and echoes roar through all dells far into the depths of argonne wood deserted now and limbs and lives of men fly dissipated this way and that can brunswick make an impression on them the dullbright seigneurs stand biting their thumbs these sansculottes seem not to fly like poultry towards noontide a cannonshot blows kellermanns horse from under him there bursts a powdercart high into the air with knell heard over all some swagging and swaying observablebrunswick will try camarades cries kellermann vive la patria allons vaincre pour elle let us conquer live the fatherland rings responsive to the welkin like rollingfire from side to side our ranks are as firm as rocks and brunswick may recross the dell ineffectual regain his old position on la lune not unbattered by the way and so for the length of a september daywith bluster and bark with bellow far echoing the cannonade lasts till sunset and no impression made till an hour after sunset the few remaining clocks of the district striking seven at this late time of day brunswick tries again with not a whit better fortune he is met by rockranks by shouts of vive la patrie and driven back not unbattered whereupon he ceases retires to the tavern of la lune and sets to raising a redoute lest he be attacked  verily so ye dulledbright seigneurs make of it what ye may ah and france does not rise round us in mass and the peasants do not join us but assassinate us neither hanging nor any persuasion will induce them they have lost their old distinguishing love of king and kingscloaki fear

out of verdun which he had entered southwards some five weeks ago in quite other order discerned the following phenomenon and formed part of it  towards three in the morning without having had any sleep we were about mounting our carriage drawn up at the door when an insuperable obstacle disclosed itself for there rolled on already between the pavementstones which were crushed up into a ridge on each side an uninterrupted column of sickwagons through the town and all was trodden as into a morass while we stood waiting what could be made of it our landlord the knight of saintlouis pressed past us without salutation he had been a calonnes notable in 1787 an emigrant since had returned to his home jubilant with the prussians but must now forth again into the wide world followed by a servant carrying a little bundle on his stick  the activity of our alert lisieux shone eminent and on this occasion too brought us on for he struck into a small gap of the wagonrow and held the advancing team back till we with our six and our four horses got intercalated after which in my light little coachlet i could breathe freer we were now under way at a funeral pace but still under way the day broke we found ourselves at the outlet of the town in a tumult and turmoil without measure all sorts of vehicles few horsemen innumerable footpeople were crossing each other on the great esplanade before the gate we turned to the right with our column towards estain on a limited highway with ditches at each side selfpreservation in so monstrous a press knew now no pity no respect of aught not far before us there fell down a horse of an ammunitionwagon they cut the traces and let it lie and now as the three others could not bring their load along they cut them also loose tumbled the heavypacked vehicle into the ditch and with the smallest retardation we had to drive on right over the horse which was just about to rise and i saw too clearly how its legs under the wheels went crashing and quivering  horse and foot endeavoured to escape from the narrow laborious highway into the meadows but these too were rained to ruin overflowed by full ditches the connexion of the footpaths every where interrupted four gentlemanlike handsome welldressed french soldiers waded for a time beside our carriage wonderfully clean and neat and had such art of picking their steps that their footgear testified no higher than the ancle to the muddy pilgrimage these good people found themselves engaged in  that under such circumstances one saw in ditches in meadows in fields and crofts dead horses enough was natural to the case by and by however you found them also flayed the fleshy parts even cut away sad token of the universal distress  thus we fared on every moment in danger at the smallest stoppage on our own part of being ourselves tumbled overboard under which circumstances truly the careful dexterity of our lisieux could not be sufficiently praised the same talent shewed itself at estain where we arrived towards noon and descried over the beautiful wellbuilt little town through streets and on squares around and beside us one senseconfusing tumult the mass rolled this way and that and all struggling forward each hindered the other unexpectedly our carriage drew up before a stately house in the marketplace master and mistress of the mansion saluted us in reverent distance dexterous lisieux though we knew it not had said we were the king of prussias brother  but now from the groundfloor windows looking over the whole marketplace we had the endless tumult lying as it were palpable all sorts of walkers soldiers in uniform marauders stout but sorrowing citizens and peasants women and children crushed and jostled each other amid vehicles of all forms ammunitionwagons baggagewagons carriages single double and multiplex such hundredfold miscellany of teams requisitioned or lawfully owned making way hitting together hindering each other

gilt and silvered evidently by the best builders caught your eye see hermann and dorothea also by goethe buch kalliope  the crisis of the strait however arose further on a little where the crowded marketplace had to introduce itself into a streetstraight indeed and good but proportionably far too narrow i have in my life seen nothing like it the aspect of it might perhaps be compared to that of a swoln river which has been raging over meadows and fields and is now again obliged to press itself through a narrow bridge and flow on in its bounded channel down the long street all visible from our windows there swelled continually the strangest tide a high doubleseated travellingcoach towered visible over the flood of things we thought of the fair frenchwomen we had seen in the morning it

things very completely she has hurled back her cimmerian invaders far over the marches and likewise she has shattered her own internal social constitution even to the minutest fibre of it into wreck and dissolution utterly it is all altered from king down to parish constable all authorities magistrates judges persons that bore rule have had on the sudden to alter themselves so far as needful or else on the sudden and not without violence to be altered a patriot executive council of ministers with a patriot danton in it and then a whole nation and national convention have taken care of that not a parish constable in the furthest hamlet who has said de par le roi and shewn loyalty but must retire making way for a new improved parish constable who can say de par la republique  it is a change such as history must beg her readers to imagine undescribed an instantaneous change of the whole bodypolitic the soulpolitic being all changed such a change as few bodies politic or other can experience in this world say perhaps such as poor nymph semeles body did experience when she would needs with womans humour see her olympian jove as very joveand so stood poor nymph this moment semele next moment not semele but flame and a statue of redhot ashes france has looked upon democracy seen it face to facethe cimmerian invaders will rally in humbler temper with better or worse luck the wreck and dissolution must reshape itself into a social arrangement as it can and may but as for this national convention which is to settle every thing if it do as deputy paine and france generally expects get all finished in a few months we shall call it a most deft convention  in truth it is very singular to see how this mercurial french people plunges suddenly from vive le roi to vive la republique and goes simmering and dancing shaking off daily so to speak and trampling into the dust its old social garnitures ways of thinking rules of existing and cheerfully dances towards the ruleless unknown with such hope in its heart and nothing but freedom equality and brotherhood in its mouth is it two centuries or is it only two years since all france roared simultaneously to the welkin bursting forth into sound and smoke at its feast of pikes live the restorer of french liberty three short years ago there was still versailles and an oeildeboeuf now there is that watched circuit of the temple girt with dragoneyed municipals where as in its final limbo royalty lies extinct in the year 1789 constituent deputy barrere wept in his breakofday newspaper at sight of a reconciled king louis and now in 1792 convention deputy barrere perfectly tearless may be considering whether the reconciled king louis shall be guillotined or not  old garnitures and social vestures drop off we say so fast being indeed quite decayed and are trodden under the national dance and the new vestures where are they the new modes and rules liberty equality fraternity not vestures but the wish for vestures the nation is for the present figuratively speaking naked it has no rule or vesture but is nakeda sansculottic nation  so far therefore in such manner have our patriot brissots guadets triumphed vergniauds ezekielvisions of the fall of thrones and crowns which he spake hypothetically and prophetically in the spring of the year have suddenly come to fulfilment in the autumn our eloquent patriots of the legislative like strong conjurors by the word of their mouth have swept royalism with its old modes and formulas to the winds and shall now govern a france free of formulas free of formulas and yet man lives not except with formulas with customs ways of doing and living no text truer than this which will hold true from the teatable and tailors shopboard up to the high senatehouses solemn temples nay through all provinces of mind and imagination onwards to the outmost confines of articulate beingubi homines sunt modi sunt there are modes wherever there are men it is the deepest law of mans nature whereby man is a craftsman and toolusing animal not the slave of impulse chance and brute nature but in some measure their lord twentyfive millions of men suddenly stript bare of their modi and dancing them down in that manner are a terrible thing to govern  eloquent patriots of the legislative meanwhile have precisely this problem to solve under the name and nickname of statesmen hommes detat of moderatemen moderantins of brissotins rolandins finally of girondins they shall become worldfamous in solving it for the twentyfive millions are gallic effervescent toofilled both with hope of the unutterable of universal fraternity and golden age and with terror of the unutterable cimmerian europe all rallying on us it is a problem like few truly if man as the philosophers brag did to any extent look before and after what one may ask in many cases would become of him what in this case would become of these seven hundred and fortynine men the convention seeing clearly before and after were a paralysed convention seeing clearly to the length of its own nose it is not paralysed  to the convention itself neither the work nor the method of doing it is doubtful to make the constitution to defend the republic till that be made speedily enough accordingly there has been a committee of the constitution got together sieyes oldconstituent

broken limbs yet with whole hearts and build we say in the name of heaventill either the work do stand or else mankind abandon it and the constitutionbuilders be paid off with laughter and tears one good time in the course of eternity it was appointed that this of social contract too should try itself out and so the committee of constitution shall toil with hope and faithwith no disturbance from any reader of these pages  to make the constitution then and return home joyfully in a few months this is the prophecy our national convention gives of itself by this scientific program shall its operations and events go on but from the best scientific program in such a case to the actual fulfilment what a difference every reunion of men is it not as we often say a reunion of incalculable influences every unit of it a microcosm of influencesof which how shall science calculate or prophesy science which cannot with all its calculuses differential integral and of variations calculate the problem of three gravitating bodies ought to hold her peace here and say only in this national convention there are seven hundred and fortynine very singular bodies that gravitate and do much elsewho probably in an amazing manner will work the appointment of heaven  of national assemblages parliaments congresses which have long sat which are of saturnine temperament above all which are not dreadfully in earnest something may be computed or conjectured yet even these are a kind of mystery in progresswhereby we see the journalist reporter find livelihood even these jolt madly out of the ruts from time to time how much more a poor national convention of french vehemence urged on at such velocity without routine without rut track or landmark and dreadfully in earnest every man of them it is a parliament literally such as there was never elsewhere in the world themselves are new unarranged they are the heart and presiding centre of a france fallen wholly into maddest disarrangement from all cities hamlets from the utmost ends of this france with its twentyfive million vehement souls thickstreaming influences storm in on that same heart in the salle de manege and storm out again such fiery venousarterial circulation is the function of that heart seven hundred and fortynine human individuals we say never sat together on earth under more original circumstances common individuals most of them or not far from common yet in virtue of the position they occupied so notable how in this wild piping of the whirlwind of human passions with death victory terror valour and all height and all depth pealing and piping these men left to their own guidance will speak and act  readers know well that this french national convention quite contrary to its own program became the astonishment and horror of mankind a kind of apocalyptic convention or black dream become real concerning which history seldom speaks except in the way of interjection how it covered france with woe delusion and delirium and from its bosom there went forth death on the pale horse to hate this poor national convention is easy to praise and love it has not been found impossible it is as we say a parliament in the most original circumstances to us in these pages be it as a fuliginous fiery mystery where upper has met nether and in such alternate glare and blackness of darkness poor bedazzled mortals know not which is upper which is nether but rage and plunge distractedly as mortals in that case will do a convention which has to consume itself suicidally and become dead asheswith its world behoves us not to enter exploratively its dim embroiled deeps yet to stand with unwavering eyes looking how it welters what notable phases and occurrences it will successively throw up  one general superficial circumstance we remark with praise the force of politeness to such depth has the sense of civilisation penetrated mans life no drouet no legendre in the maddest tug of war can altogether shake it off debates of senates dreadfully in earnest are seldom given frankly to the world else perhaps they would surprise it did not the grand monarque himself once chase his louvois with a pair of brandished tongs but reading long volumes of these convention debates all in a foam with furious earnestness earnest many times to the extent of life and death one is struck rather with the degree of continence they manifest in speech and how in such wild ebullition there is still a kind of polite rule struggling for mastery and the forms of social life never altogether disappear these men though they menace with clenched righthands do not clench one another by the collar they draw no daggers except for oratorical purposes and this not often profane swearing is almost unknown though the reports are frank enough we find only one or two oaths oaths by marat reported in all  for the rest that there is effervescence who doubts effervescence enough decrees passed by acclamation today repealed by vociferation tomorrow temper fitful most rotatory changeful always headlong the voice of the orator is covered with rumours a hundred honourable members rush with menaces towards the left side of the hall president has broken three bells in successionclaps on his hat as signal that the country is near ruined a fiercely effervescent oldgallic assemblageah how the loud sick sounds of debate and of life which is a debate sink silent one after another so loud now and in a little while so low brennus and those antique gael captains in their way to rome to galatia and such places whither they were in the habit of marching in the most fiery manner had debates as effervescent doubt it not though no moniteur has reported them they scolded in celtic welsh those brennuses neither were they sansculotte nay rather breeches braccae say of felt or roughleather were the only thing they had being as livy testifies naked down to the haunchesand see it is the same sort of work and of men still now when they have got coats and speak nasally a kind of broken latin but on the whole does not time envelop this present national convention as it did those brennuses and ancient august senates in felt breeches time surely and also eternity dim dusk of timeor noon which will be dusk and then there is night and silence and time with all its sick noises is swallowed in the still sea pity thy brother o son of adam the angriest frothy jargon that he utters is it not properly the whimpering of an infant which cannot speak what ails it but is in distress clearly in the inwards of it and so must squall and whimper continually till its mother take it and it getto sleep  this convention is not four days old and the melodious meliboean stanzas that shook down royalty are still fresh in our ear when there bursts out a new diapasonunhappily of discord this time for speech has been made of a thing difficult to speak of well the september massacres how deal with these september massacres with the paris commune that presided over them a paris commune hatefulterrible before which the poor effete legislative had to quail and sit quiet and now if a young omnipotent convention will not so quail and sit what steps shall it take have a departmental guard in its pay answer the girondins and friends of order a guard of national volunteers missioned from all the eightythree or eightyfive departments for that express end these will keep septemberers tumultuous communes in a due state of submissiveness the convention in a due state of sovereignty so have the friends of order answered sitting in committee and reporting and even a decree has been passed of the required tenour nay certain departments as the var or marseilles in mere expectation and assurance of a decree have their contingent of volunteers already on march brave marseillese foremost on the tenth of august will not be hindmost here fathers gave their sons a musket and twentyfive louis says barbaroux and bade them march  can any thing be properer a republic that will found itself on justice must needs investigate september massacres a convention calling itself national ought it not to be guarded by a national forcealas reader it seems so to the eye and yet there is much to be said and argued thou beholdest here the small beginning of a controversy which mere logic will not settle two small wellsprings september departmental guard or rather at bottom they are but one and the same small wellspring which will swell and widen into waters of bitterness all manner of subsidiary streams and brooks of bitterness flowing in from this side and that till it become a wide river of bitterness of rage and separationwhich can subside only into the catacombs this departmental guard decreed by overwhelming majorities and then repealed for peaces sake and not to insult paris is again decreed more than once nay it is partially executed and the very men that are to be of it are seen visibly parading the paris streetsshouting once being overtaken with liquor a bas marat down with marat hist parl xx 184 nevertheless decreed never so often it is repealed just as often and continues for some seven months an angry noisy hypothesis only a fair possibility struggling to become a reality but which shall never be one which after endless struggling shall in february next sink into sad restdragging much along with it so singular are the ways of men and honourable members  but on this fourth day of the conventions existence as we said which is the 25th of september 1792 there comes committee report on that decree of the departmental guard and speech of repealing it there come denunciations of anarchy of a dictatorshipwhich let the incorruptible robespierre consider there come denunciations of a certain journal de la republique once called ami du peuple and so thereupon there comes visibly stepping up visibly standing aloft on the tribune ready to speak the bodily spectrum of peoplesfriend marat shriek ye seven hundred and fortynine it is verily marat he and not another marat is no phantasm of the brain or mere lying impress of printers types but a thing material of joint and sinew and a certain small stature ye behold him there in his blackness in his dingy squalor a living fraction of chaos and old night visibly incarnate desirous to speak it appears says marat to the shrieking assembly that a great many persons here are enemies of mine all all shriek hundreds of voices enough to drown any peoplesfriend but marat will not drown he speaks and croaks explanation croaks with such reasonableness air of sincerity that repentant pity smothers anger and the shrieks subside or even become applauses for this convention is unfortunately the crankest of machines it shall be pointing eastward with stiff violence this moment and then do but touch some spring dexterously the whole machine clattering and jerking sevenhundredfold will whirl with huge crash and next moment is pointing westward thus marat absolved and applauded victorious in this turn of fence is as the debate goes on prickt at again by some dexterous girondin and then and shrieks rise anew and decree of accusation is on the point of passing till the dingy peoplesfriend bobs aloft once more croaks once more persuasive stillness and the decree of accusation sinks whereupon he draws fortha pistol and setting it to his head the seat of such thought and prophecy says if they had passed their accusation decree he the peoplesfriend would have blown his brains out a peoples friend has that faculty in him for the rest as to this of the two hundred and sixty thousand aristocrat heads marat candidly says cest la mon avis such is my opinion also it is not indisputable no power on earth can prevent me from seeing into traitors and unmasking themby my superior originality of mind moniteur newspaper nos 271 280 294 annee premiere moores journal ii 21 157 c which however may perhaps as in similar cases be only a copy of the newspaper an honourable member like this friend of the people few terrestrial parliaments have had  we observe however that this first onslaught by the friends of order as sharp and prompt as it was has failed for neither can robespierre summoned out by talk of dictatorship and greeted with the like rumour on shewing himself be thrown into prison into accusationnot though barbarous openly bear testimony against him and sign it on paper with such sanctified meekness does the incorruptible lift his seagreen cheek to the smiter lift his thin voice and with jesuitic dexterity plead and prosper asking at last in a prosperous manner but what witnesses has the citoyen barbaroux to support his testimony moi cries hot rebecqui standing up striking his breast with both hands and answering me moniteur ut supra seance du 25 septembre nevertheless the seagreen pleads again and makes it good the long hurlyburly personal merely while so much

tread down    chapter 32ii  the executive  may we not conjecture therefore that round this grand enterprise of making the constitution there will as heretofore very strange embroilments gather and questions and interests complicate themselves so that after a few or even several months the convention will not have settled every thing alas a whole tide of questions comes rolling boiling growing ever wider without end among which apart from this question of september and anarchy let us notice those which emerge oftener than the others and promise to become leading questions of the armies of

wearied irresolute has at least no need of resolving now his daily meals lessons to his son daily walk in the garden daily game at ombre or drafts fill up the day the morrow will provide for itself  the morrow indeed and yet how louis asks how france with perhaps still more solicitude asks how a king dethroned by insurrection is verily not easy to dispose of keep him prisoner he is a secret centre for the disaffected for endless plots attempts and hopes of theirs banish him he is an open centre for them his royal warstandard with what of divinity it has unrolls itself summoning the world put him to death a cruel questionable extremity that too and yet the likeliest in these extreme circumstances of insurrectionary men whose own life and death lies staked accordingly it is said from the last step of the throne to the first of the scaffold there is short distance  but on the whole we will remark here that this business of louis looks altogether different now as seen over seas and

louisbeleaguer and embroil this convention which would so gladly make the constitution rather all which questions too as we often urge of such things are in growth they grow in every french head and can be seen growing also very curiously in this mighty welter of parliamentary debate of public business which the convention has to do a question emerges so small at first is put off submerged but always reemerges bigger than before it is a curious indeed an indescribable sort of growth which such things have  we perceive however both by its frequent reemergence and by its rapid enlargement of bulk that this question of king louis will take the lead of all the rest and truly in that case it will take the lead in a much deeper sense for as aarons rod swallowed all the other serpents so will the foremost question whichever may get foremost absorb all other questions and interests and from it and the decision of it will they all so to speak be born or newborn and have shape physiognomy and destiny corresponding it was appointed of fate that in this wideweltering strangely growing monstrous stupendous imbroglio of convention business the grand firstparent of all the questions controversies measures and enterprises which were to be evolved there to the worlds astonishment should be this question of king louis    chapter 32iv  the loser pays  the sixth of november 1792 was a great day for the republic outwardly over the frontiers inwardly in the salle de manege  outwardly for dumouriez overrunning the netherlands did on that day come in contact with saxeteschen and the austrians dumouriez widewinged they widewinged at and around the village of jemappes near mons and firehail is whistling far and wide there the great guns playing and the small so many green heights getting fringed and maned with red fire and dumouriez is swept back on this wing and swept back on that and is like to be swept back utterly when he rushes up in person the prompt polymetis speaks a prompt word or two and then with clear tenorpipe uplifts the hymn of the marseillese entonna la marseillaise dumouriez memoires iii 174 ten thousand tenor or bass pipes joining or say some forty

dilapidate abroad within the walls there is sinning and without the walls there is sinning  but in the hall of the convention at the same hour with this victory of jemappes there went another thing forward report of great length from the proper appointed committee on the crimes of louis the galleries listen breathless take comfort ye galleries deputy valaze reporter on this occasion thinks louis very criminal and that if convenient he should be triedpoor girondin valaze who may be tried himself one day comfortable so far nay here comes a second committeereporter deputy mailhe with a legal argument very prosy to read now very refreshing to hear then that by the law of the country louis capet was only called inviolable by a figure of rhetoric but at bottom was perfectly violable triable that he can and even should be tried this question of louis emerging so often as an angry confused possibility and submerging again has emerged now in an articulate shape  patriotism growls indignant joy the socalled reign of equality is not to be a mere name then but a thing try louis capet scornfully ejaculates patriotism mean criminals go to the gallows for a purse cut and this chief criminal guilty of a france cut of a france slashed asunder with clothoscissors and civil war with his victims twelve hundred on the tenth of august alone lying low in the catacombs fattening the passes of argonne wood of valmy and far fields he such chief criminal shall not even come to the barfor alas o patriotism add we it was from of old said the loser pays it is he who has to pay all scores run up by whomsoever on him must all breakages and charges fall and the twelve hundred on the tenth of august are not rebel traitors but victims and martyrs such is the law of quarrel  patriotism nothing doubting watches over this question of the trial now happily emerged in an articulate shape and will see it to maturity if the gods permit with a keen solicitude patriotism watches getting ever keener at every new difficulty as girondins and false brothers interpose delays till it get a keenness as of fixedidea and will have this trial and no earthly thing instead of itif equality be not a name love of equality then scepticism of terror rage of victory sublime spectacle of the universe all these things are strong  but indeed this question of the trial is it not to all persons a most grave one filling with dubiety many a legislative head regicide asks the gironde respectability to kill a king and become the horror of respectable nations and persons but then also to save a king to lose ones footing with the decided patriot and undecided patriot though never so respectable being mere hypothetic froth and no footingthe dilemma presses sore and between the horns of it you wriggle round and round decision is nowhere save in the mother society and her sons these have decided and go forward the others wriggle round uneasily within their dilemmahorns and make way nowhither    chapter 32v  stretching of formulas  but how this question of the trial grew laboriously through the weeks of gestation now that it has been articulated or conceived were superfluous to trace here it emerged and submerged among the infinite of questions and embroilments the veto of scoundrels writes plaintive letters as to anarchy concealed royalists aided by hunger produce riots about grain alas it is but a week ago these girondins made a new fierce onslaught on the september massacres  for one day among the last of october robespierre being summoned to the tribune by some new hint of that old calumny of the dictatorship was speaking and pleading there with more and more comfort to himself till rising high in heart he cried out valiantly is there any man here that dare specifically accuse me moi exclaimed one pause of deep silence a lean angry little figure with broad bald brow strode swiftly towards the tribune taking papers from its pocket i accuse thee robespierrei jean baptiste louvet the seagreen became tallowgreen shrinking to a corner of the tribune danton cried speak robespierre there are many good citizens that listen but the tongue refused its office and so louvet with a shrill tone read and recited crime after crime dictatorial temper exclusive popularity bullying at elections mobretinue september massacrestill all the convention shrieked again and had almost indicted the incorruptible there on the spot never did the incorruptible run such a risk louvet to his dying day will regret that the gironde did not take a bolder attitude and extinguish him there and then  not so however the incorruptible about to be indicted in this sudden manner could not be refused a week of delay that week he is not idle nor is the mother society idlefiercetremulous for her chosen son he is ready at the day with his written speech smooth as a jesuit doctors and convinces some and now why now lazy vergniaud does not rise with demosthenic thunder poor louvet unprepared can do little or nothing barrere proposes that these comparatively despicable personalities be dismissed by order of the day order of the day it accordingly is barbaroux cannot even get a hearing not though he rush down to the bar and demand to be heard there as a petitioner louvet memoires paris 1823 p 52 moniteur seances du 29 octobre 5 novembre 1792 moore ii 178 c the convention eager for public business with that first articulate emergence of the trial just coming on dismisses these comparative miseres and despicabilities splenetic louvet must digest his spleen regretfully for ever robespierre dear to patriotism is dearer for the dangers he has run  this is the second grand attempt by our girondin friends of order to extinguish that blackspot in their domain and we see they have made it far blacker and wider than before anarchy september massacre it is a thing that lies hideous in the general imagination very detestable to the undecided patriot of respectability a thing to be harped on as often as need is harp on it denounce it trample it ye girondin patriotsand yet behold the blackspot will not trample down it will only as we say trample blacker and wider fools it is no blackspot of the surface but a wellspring of the deep consider rightly it is the apex of the everlasting abyss this blackspot looking up as water through thin icesay as the region of nether darkness through your thin film of gironde regulation and respectability trample it not lest the film break and then  the truth is if our gironde friends had an understanding of it where were french patriotism with all its eloquence at this moment had not that same great nether deep of bedlam fanaticism and popular wrath and madness risen unfathomable on the tenth of august french patriotism were an eloquent reminiscence swinging on prussian gibbets nay where in few months were it still should the same great nether deep subsidenay as readers of newspapers pretend to recollect this hatefulness of the september massacre is itself partly an afterthought readers of newspapers can quote gorsas and various brissotins approving of the september massacre at the time it happened and calling it a salutary vengeance see hist parl xvii 401 newspapers by gorsas and others cited ibid 428 so that the real grief after all were not so much righteous horror as grief that ones own power was departing unhappy girondins  in the jacobin society therefore the decided patriot complains that here are men who with their private ambitions and animosities will ruin liberty equality and brotherhood all three they check the spirit of patriotism throw stumblingblocks in its way and instead of pushing on all shoulders at the wheel will stand idle there spitefully clamouring what foul ruts there are what rude jolts we give to which the jacobin society answers with angry roarwith angry shriek for there are citoyennes too thick crowded in the galleries here citoyennes who bring their seam with them or their knittingneedles and shriek or knit as the case needs famed tricoteuses patriot knittersmere duchesse or the like deborah and mother of the faubourgs giving the keynote it is a changed jacobin society and a still changing where mother duchess now sits authentic duchesses have sat highrouged dames went once in jewels and spangles now instead of jewels you may take the knittingneedles and leave the rouge the rouge will gradually give place to natural brown clean washed or even unwashed and demoiselle theroigne herself get scandalously fustigated strange enough it is the same tribune raised in midair where a high mirabeau a high barnave and aristocrat lameths once thundered whom gradually your brissots guadets vergniauds a hotter style of patriots in bonnet rouge did displace red

is burning not red but blueprovincial daughtersocieties loudly disapprove these things loudly demand the swift reinstatement of such eloquent girondins the swift erasure of marat radiation de marat the mother society so far as natural reason can predict seems ruining herself nevertheless she has at all crises seemed so she has a preternatural life in her and will not ruin  but in a fortnight more this great question of the trial while the fit committee is assiduously but silently working on it receives an unexpected stimulus our readers remember poor louiss turn for smithwork how in old happier days a certain sieur gamain of versailles was wont to come over and instruct him in lockmakingoften scolding him they say for his numbness by whom nevertheless the royal apprentice had learned something of that craft hapless apprentice perfidious mastersmith for now on this 20th of november 1792 dingy smith gamain comes over to the paris municipality over to minister roland with hints that he smith gamain knows a thing that in may last when traitorous correspondence was so brisk he and the royal apprentice fabricated an iron press armoire de fer cunningly inserting the same in a wall of the royal chamber in the tuileries invisible under the wainscot where doubtless it still sticks perfidious gamain attended by the proper authorities finds the wainscot panel which none else can find wrenches it up discloses the iron pressfull of letters and papers roland clutches them out conveys them over in towels to the fit assiduous committee which sits hard by in towels we say and without notarial inventory an oversight on the part of roland  here however are letters enough which disclose to a demonstration the correspondence of a traitorous selfpreserving court and this not with traitors only but even with patriots socalled barnaves treason of correspondence with the queen and friendly advice to her ever since that varennes business is hereby manifest how happy that we have him this barnave lying safe in the prison of grenoble since september last for he had long been suspect talleyrands treason many a mans treason if not manifest hereby is next to it mirabeaus treason wherefore his bust in the hall of the convention is veiled with gauze till we ascertain alas it is too ascertainable his bust in the hall of the jacobins denounced by robespierre from the tribune in midair is not veiled it is instantly broken to sherds a patriot mounting swiftly with a ladder and shivering it down on the floorit and others amid shouts journal des debats des jacobins in hist parl xxii 296 such is their recompense and amount of wages at this date on the principle of supply and demand smith gamain inadequately recompensed for the present comes some fifteen months after with a humble petition setting forth that no sooner was that important iron press finished off by him than as he now bethinks himself louis gave him a large glass of wine which large glass of wine did produce in the stomach of sieur gamain the terriblest effects evidently tending towards death and was then brought up by an emetic but has notwithstanding entirely ruined the constitution of sieur gamain so that he cannot work for his family as he now bethinks himself the recompense of which is pension of twelve hundred francs and honourable mention so different is the ratio of demand and supply at different times  thus amid obstructions and stimulating furtherances has the question of the trial to grow emerging and submerging fostered by solicitous patriotism of the orations that were spoken on it of the painfully devised forms of process for managing it the law arguments to prove it lawful and all the infinite floods of juridical and other ingenuity and oratory be no syllable reported in this history lawyer ingenuity is good but what can it profit here if the truth must be spoken o august senators the only law in this case is vae victis the loser pays seldom did robespierre say a wiser word than the hint he gave to that effect in his oration that it was needless to speak of law that here if never elsewhere our right was might an oration admired almost to ecstasy by the jacobin patriot who shall say that robespierre is not a thoroughgoing man bold in logic at least to the like effect or still more plainly spake young saintjust the blackhaired mildtoned youth danton is on mission in the netherlands during this preliminary work the rest far as one reads welter amid law of nations social contract juristics syllogistics to us barren as the east wind in fact what can be more unprofitable than the sight of seven hundred and fortynine ingenious men struggling with their whole force and industry for a long course of weeks to do at bottom this to stretch out the old formula and law phraseology so that it may cover the new contradictory entirely uncoverable thing whereby the poor formula does but crack and ones honesty along with it the thing that is palpably hot burning wilt thou prove it by syllogism to be a freezingmixture this of stretching out formulas till they crack is especially in times of swift change one of the sorrowfullest tasks poor humanity has    chapter 32vi  at the bar  meanwhile in a space of some five weeks we have got to another emerging of the trial and a more practical one than ever  on tuesday eleventh of december the kings trial has emerged very decidedly into the streets of paris in the shape of that green carriage of mayor chambon within which sits the king himself with attendants on his way to the convention hall attended in that green carriage by mayors chambon procureurs chaumette and outside of it by commandants santerre with cannon cavalry and double row of infantry all sections under arms strong patrols scouring all streets so fares he slowly through the dull drizzling weather and about two oclock we behold him in walnutcoloured greatcoat redingote noisette descending through the place vendome towards that salle de manege to be indicted and judicially interrogated the mysterious temple circuit has given up its secret which now in this walnutcoloured coat men behold with eyes the same bodily louis who was once louis the desired fares there hapless king he is getting now towards port his deplorable farings and voyagings draw to a close what duty remains to him henceforth that of placidly enduring he is fit to do  the singular procession fares on in silence says prudhomme or amid growlings of the marseillese hymn in silence ushers itself into the hall of the convention santerre holding louiss arm with his hand louis looks round him with composed air to see what kind of convention and parliament it is much changed indeedsince february gone two years when our constituent then busy spread fleurdelys velvet for us and we came over to say a kind word here and they all started up swearing fidelity and all france started up swearing and made it a feast of pikes which has ended in this barrere who once wept looking up from his editorsdesk looks down now from his presidentschair with a list of fiftyseven questions and says dryeyed louis you may sit down louis sits down it is the very seat they say same timber and stuffing from which he accepted the constitution amid dancing and illumination autumn gone a year so much woodwork remains identical so much else is not identical louis sits and listens with a composed look and mind  of the fiftyseven questions we shall not give so much as one they are questions captiously embracing all the main documents seized on the tenth of august or found lately in the iron press embracing all the main incidents of the revolution history and they ask in substance this louis who wert king art thou not guilty to a certain extent by act and written document of trying to continue king neither in the answers is there much notable mere quiet negations for most part an accused man standing on the simple basis of no i do not recognise that document i did not do that act or did it according to the law that then was whereupon the fiftyseven questions and documents to the number of a hundred and sixtytwo being exhausted in this manner barrere finishes after some three hours with his louis i invite you to withdraw  louis withdraws under municipal escort into a neighbouring committeeroom having first in leaving the bar demanded to have legal counsel he declines refreshment in this committeeroom then seeing chaumette busy with a small loaf which a grenadier had divided with him says he will take a bit of bread it is five oclock and he had breakfasted but slightly in a morning of such drumming and alarm chaumette breaks his halfloaf the king eats of the crust mounts the green carriage eating asks now what he shall do with the crumb chaumettes clerk takes it from him flings it out into the street louis says it is pity to fling out bread in a time of dearth my grandmother remarks chaumette used to say to me little boy never waste a crumb of bread you cannot make one monsieur chaumette answers louis your grandmother seems to have been a sensible woman prudhommes newspaper in hist parl xxi 314 poor innocent mortal so quietly he waits the drawing of the lotfit to do this at least well passivity alone without activity sufficing for it he talks once of travelling over france by and by to have a geographical and topographical view of it being from of old fond of geographythe temple circuit again receives him closes on him gazing paris may retire to its hearths and coffeehouses to its clubs and theatres the damp darkness has sunk and with it the drumming and patrolling of this strange day  louis is now separated from his queen and family given up to his simple reflections and resources dull lie these stone walls round him of his loved ones none with him in this state of uncertainty providing for the worst he writes his will a paper which can still be read full of placidity simplicity pious sweetness the convention after debate has granted him legal counsel of his own choosing advocate target feels himself too old being turned of fiftyfour and declines he had gained great honour once defending rohan the necklacecardinal but will gain none here advocate tronchet some ten years older does not decline nay behold good old malesherbes steps forward voluntarily to the last of his fields the good old hero he is grey with seventy years he says i was twice called to the council of him who was my master when all the world coveted that honour and i owe him the same service now when it has become one which many reckon dangerous these two with a younger deseze whom they will select for pleading are busy over that fiftyandsevenfold indictment over the hundred and sixtytwo documents louis aiding them as he can  a great thing is now therefore in open progress all men in all lands watching it by what forms and methods shall the convention acquit itself in such manner that there rest not on it even the suspicion of blame difficult that will be the convention really much at a loss discusses and deliberates all day from morning to night day after day the tribune drones with oratory on this matter one must stretch the old formula to cover the new thing the patriots of the mountain whetted ever keener clamour for despatch above all the only good form will be a swift one nevertheless the convention deliberates the tribune dronesdrowned indeed in tenor and even in treble from time to time the whole hall shrilling up round it into pretty frequent wrath and provocation it has droned and shrilled wellnigh a fortnight before we can decide this shrillness getting ever shriller that on wednesday 26th of december louis shall appear and plead his advocates complain that it is fatally soon which they well might as advocates but without remedy to patriotism it seems endlessly late  on wednesday therefore at the cold dark hour of eight in the morning all senators are at their post indeed they warm the cold hour as we find by a violent effervescence such as is too common now some louvet or buzot attacking some tallien chabot and so the whole mountain effervescing against the whole gironde scarcely is this done at nine when louis and his three advocates escorted by the clang of arms and santerres national force enter the hall  deseze unfolds his papers honourably fulfilling his perilous office pleads for the space of three hours an honourable pleading composed almost overnight courageous yet discreet not without ingenuity and soft pathetic eloquence louis fell on his neck when they had withdrawn and said with tears mon pauvre deseze louis himself before withdrawing had added a few words perhaps the last he would utter to them how it pained his heart above all things to be held guilty of that bloodshed on the tenth of august or of ever shedding or wishing to shed french blood so saying he withdrew from that hallhaving indeed finished his work there many are the strange errands he has had thither but this strange one is the last  and now why will the convention loiter here is the indictment and evidence here is the pleading does not the rest follow of itself the mountain and patriotism in general clamours still louder for despatch for permanentsession till the task be done nevertheless a doubting apprehensive convention decides that it will still deliberate first that all members who desire it shall have leave to speakto your desks therefore ye eloquent members down with your thoughts your echoes and hearsays of thoughts now is the time to shew oneself france and the universe listens members are not wanting oration spoken pamphlet follows spoken pamphlet with what eloquence it can presidents list swells ever higher with names claiming to speak from day to day all days and all hours the constant tribune dronesshrill galleries supplying very variably the tenor and treble it were a dull tune otherwise  the patriots in mountain and galleries or taking counsel nightly in sectionhouse in mother society amid their shrill tricoteuses have to watch lynxeyed to give voice when needful occasionally very loud deputy thuriot he who was advocate thuriot who was elector thuriot and from the top of the bastille saw saintantoine rising like the ocean this thuriot can stretch a formula as heartily as most men cruel billaud is not silent if you incite him nor is cruel jeanbon silent a kind of jesuit he toowrite him not as the dictionaries too often do jambon which signifies mere ham  but on the whole let no man conceive it possible that louis is not guilty the only question for a reasonable man is or was can the convention judge louis or must it be the whole people in primary assembly and with delay always delay ye girondins false hommes detat so bellows patriotism its patience almost failingbut indeed if we consider it what shall these poor girondins do speak their convictions that louis is a prisoner of war and cannot be put to death without injustice solecism peril speak such conviction and lose utterly your footing with the decided patriot nay properly it is not even a conviction but a conjecture and dim puzzle how many poor girondins are sure of but one thing that a man and girondin ought to have footing somewhere and to stand firmly on it keeping well with the respectable classes this is what conviction and assurance of faith they have they must wriggle painfully between their dilemmahorns see extracts from their newspapers in hist parl xxi 138 c  nor is france idle nor europe it is a heart this convention as we said which sends out influences and receives them a kings execution call it martyrdom call it punishment were an influence two notable influences this convention has already sent forth over all nations much to its own detriment on the 19th of november it emitted a decree and has since confirmed and unfolded the details of it that any nation which might see good to shake off the fetters of despotism was thereby so to speak the sister of france and should have help and countenance a decree much noised of by diplomatists editors international lawyers such a decree as no living fetter of despotism nor person in authority anywhere can approve of it was deputy chambon the girondin who propounded this decreeat bottom perhaps as a flourish of rhetoric  the second influence we speak of had a still poorer origin in the restless loudrattling slightlyfurnished head of one jacob dupont from the loire country the convention is speculating on a plan of national education deputy dupont in his speech says i am free to avow m le president that i for my part am an atheist moniteur seance du 14 decembre 1792thinking the world might like to know that the french world received it without commentary or with no audible commentary so loud was france otherwise the foreign world received it with confutation with horror and astonishment mrs hannah more letter to jacob dupont london 1793 c c a most miserable influence this and now if to these two were added a third influence and sent pulsing abroad over all the earth that

mother duchesse varlet apostle of liberty with pike and red cap flies hastily carrying his oratorical foldingstool justice on the traitor cries all the patriot world consider also this other cry heard loud on the streets give us bread or else kill us bread and equality justice on the traitor that we may have bread  the limited or undecided patriot is set against the decided mayor chambon heard of dreadful rioting at the theatre de la nation it had come to rioting and even to fistwork between the decided and the undecided touching a new drama called ami des lois friend of the laws one of the poorest dramas ever written but which had didactic applications in it wherefore powdered wigs of friends of order and black hair of jacobin heads are flying there and mayor chambon hastens with santerre in hopes to quell it far from quelling it our poor mayor gets so squeezed says the report and likewise so blamed and bullied say wethat he with regret quits the brief mayoralty altogether his

note of the whirlwind paris will bring cannon from saintdenis there is talk of shutting the barriersto rolands horror  whereupon behold the convention tribune suddenly ceases droning we cut short be on the list who likes and make end on tuesday next the fifteenth of january 1793 it shall go to the vote name by name and one way or other this great game play itself out    chapter 32vii  the three votings  is louis capet guilty of conspiring against liberty shall our sentence be itself final or need ratifying by appeal to the people if guilty what punishment this is the form agreed to after uproar and several hours of tumultuous indecision these are the three successive questions whereon the convention shall now pronounce paris floods round their hall multitudinous many sounding europe and all nations listen for their answer deputy after deputy shall answer to his name guilty or not guilty  as to the guilt there is as above hinted no doubt in the mind of patriot man overwhelming majority pronounces guilt the unanimous convention votes for guilt only some feeble twentyeight voting not innocence but refusing to vote at all neither does the second question prove doubtful whatever the girondins might calculate would not appeal to the people be another name for civil war majority of two to one answers that there shall be no appeal this also is settled loud patriotism now at ten oclock may hush itself for the night and retire to its bed not without hope tuesday has gone well on the morrow comes what punishment on the morrow is the tug of war  consider therefore if on this wednesday morning there is an affluence of patriotism if paris stands atiptoe and all deputies are at their post seven hundred and fortynine honourable deputies only some twenty absent on mission duchatel and some seven others absent by sickness meanwhile expectant patriotism and paris standing atiptoe have need of patience for this wednesday again passes in debate and effervescence girondins proposing that a majority of threefourths shall be required patriots fiercely resisting them danton who has just got back from mission in the netherlands does obtain order of the day on this girondin proposal nay he obtains further that we decide sans desemparer in permanentsession till we have done  and so finally at eight in the evening this third stupendous voting by rollcall or appel nominal does begin what punishment girondins undecided patriots decided men afraid of royalty men afraid of anarchy must answer here and now infinite patriotism dusky in the lamplight floods all corridors crowds all galleries sternly waiting to hear shrillsounding ushers summon you by name and department you must rise to the tribune and say  eyewitnesses have represented this scene of the third voting and of the votings that grew out of it a scene protracted like to be endless lasting with few brief intervals from wednesday till sunday morningas one of the strangest seen in the

devise of explanation of enforcement of faint recommendation to mercy many too say banishment something short of death the balance trembles none can yet guess whitherward whereat anxious patriotism bellows irrepressible by ushers  the poor girondins many of them under such fierce bellowing of patriotism say death justifying motivant that most miserable word of theirs by some brief casuistry and jesuitry vergniaud himself says death justifying by jesuitry rich lepelletier saintfargeau had been of the noblesse and then of the patriot left side in the constituent and had argued and reported there and elsewhere not a little against capital punishment nevertheless he now says death a word which may cost him dear manuel did surely rank with the decided in august last but he has been sinking

convention that the punishment it pronounces on louis capet is that of death death by a small majority of fiftythree nay if we deduct from the one side and add to the other a certain twentysix who

this conclusion then hast thou come o hapless louis the son of sixty kings is to die on the scaffold by form of law under sixty kings this same form of law form of society has been fashioning itself together these thousand years and has become one way and other a most strange machine surely if needful it is also frightful this machine dead blind not what it should be which with swift stroke or by cold slow torture has wasted the lives and souls of innumerable men and behold now a king himself or say rather kinghood in his person is to expire here in cruel tortureslike a phalaris shut in the belly of his own redheated brazen bull it is ever so and thou shouldst know it o haughty tyrannous man injustice breeds injustice curses and falsehoods do verily return always home wide as they may wander innocent louis bears the sins of many generations he too experiences that mans tribunal is not in this earth that if he had no higher one it were not well with him  a king dying by such

parting with our loved ones kind hearts environed in the same grim peril with us to be left here let the reader look with the eyes of valet clery through these glassdoors where also the municipality watches and see the cruellest of scenes  at halfpast eight the door of the anteroom opened the queen appeared first leading her son by the hand then madame royale and madame elizabeth they all flung themselves into the arms of the king silence reigned for some minutes interrupted only by sobs the queen made a movement to lead his majesty towards the inner room where m edgeworth was waiting unknown to them no said the king let us go into the diningroom it is there only that i can see you they entered there i shut the door of it which was of glass the king sat down the queen on his left hand madame elizabeth on his right madame royale almost in front the young prince remained standing between his fathers legs they all leaned towards him and often held him embraced this scene of woe lasted an hour and threequarters during which we could hear nothing we could see only that always when the king spoke the sobbings of the princesses redoubled continued for some minutes and that then the king began again to speak clerys narrative london 1798 cited in weber iii 312and so our meetings and our partings do now end the sorrows we gave each other the poor joys we faithfully shared and all our lovings and our sufferings and confused toilings under the earthly sun are over thou good soul i shall never never through all ages of time see thee any morenever o reader knowest thou that

through her tears vous etes tous des scelerats  king louis slept sound till five in the morning when clery as he had been ordered awoke him clery dressed his hair while this went forward louis took a ring from his watch and kept trying it on his finger it was his weddingring which he is now to return to the queen as a mute farewell at halfpast six he took the sacrament and continued in devotion and conference with abbe edgeworth he will not see his family it were too hard to bear  at eight the municipals enter the king gives them his will and messages and effects which they at first brutally refuse to take charge of he gives them a roll of gold pieces a hundred and twentyfive louis these are to be returned to malesherbes who had lent them at nine santerre says the hour is come the king

alltoo gigantic figures the coalised kings threaten us we hurl at their feet as gage of battle the head of a king     book 3iii  the girondins   chapter 33i  cause and effect  this huge insurrectionary movement which we liken to a breaking out of tophet and the abyss has swept away royalty aristocracy and a kings life the question is what will it next do how will it henceforth shape itself settle down into a reign of law and liberty according as the habits persuasions and endeavours of the educated monied respectable class prescribe that is to say the volcanic lavaflood bursting up in the manner described will explode and flow according to girondin formula and preestablished rule of philosophy if so for our girondin friends it will be well  meanwhile were not the prophecy rather that as no external force royal or other now remains which could control this movement the movement will follow a course of its own probably a very original one further that whatsoever man or men can best interpret the inward tendencies it has and give them voice and activity will obtain the lead of it for the rest that as a thing without order a thing proceeding from beyond and beneath the region of order it must work and welter not as a regularity but as a chaos destructive and selfdestructive always till something that has order arise strong enough to bind it into subjection again which something we may further conjecture will not be a formula with philosophical propositions and forensic eloquence but a reality probably with a sword in its hand  as for the girondin formula of a respectable republic for the middle classes all manner of aristocracies being now sufficiently demolished there seems little reason to expect that the business will stop there liberty equality fraternity these are the words enunciative and prophetic republic for the respectable washed middle classes how can that be the fulfilment thereof hunger and nakedness and nightmare oppression lying heavy on twentyfive million hearts this not the wounded vanities or contradicted philosophies of philosophical advocates rich shopkeepers rural noblesse was the prime mover in the french revolution as the like will be in all such revolutions in all countries feudal fleurdelys had become an insupportably bad marching banner and needed to be torn and trampled but moneybag of mammon for that in these times is what the respectable republic for the middle classes will signify is a still worse while it lasts properly indeed it is the worst and basest of all banners and symbols of dominion among men and indeed is possible only in a time of general atheism and unbelief in any thing save in brute force and sensualism pride of birth pride of office any known kind of pride being a degree better than pursepride freedom equality brotherhood not in the moneybag but far elsewhere will sansculottism seek these things  we say therefore that an insurrectionary france loose of control from without destitute of supreme order from within will form one of the most tumultuous activities ever seen on this earth such as no girondin formula can regulate an immeasurable force made up of forces manifold heterogeneous compatible and incompatible in plainer words this france must needs split into parties each of which seeking to make itself good contradiction exasperation will arise and parties on parties find that they cannot work together cannot exist together  as for the number of parties there will strictly counting be as many parties as there are opinions according to which rule in this national convention itself to say nothing of france generally the number of parties ought to be seven hundred and fortynine for every unit entertains his opinion but now as every unit has at once an individual nature or necessity to follow his own road and a gregarious nature or necessity to see himself travelling by the side of otherswhat can there be but dissolutions precipitations endless turbulence of attracting and repelling till once the masterelement get evolved and this wild alchemy arrange itself again  to the length of seven hundred and fortynine parties however no nation was ever yet seen to go nor indeed much beyond the length of two parties two at a timeso invincible is mans tendency to unite with all the invincible divisiveness he has two parties we say are the usual number at one time let these two fight it out all minor shades of party rallying under the shade likest them when the one has fought down the other then it in its turn may divide selfdestructive and so the process continue as far as needful this is the way of revolutions which spring up as the french one has done when the socalled bonds of society snap asunder and all laws that are not laws of nature become naught and formulas merely  but quitting these somewhat abstract considerations let history note this concrete reality which the streets of paris exhibit on monday the 25th of february 1793 long before daylight that morning these streets are noisy and angry petitioning enough there has been a convention often solicited it was but yesterday there came a deputation of washerwomen with petition complaining that not so much as soap could be had to say nothing of bread and condiments of bread the cry of women round the salle de manege was heard plaintive du pain et du savon bread and soap moniteur c hist parl xxiv 332348  and now from six oclock this monday morning one perceives the bakers queues unusually expanded angrily agitating themselves not the baker alone but two section commissioners to help him manage with difficulty the daily distribution of loaves softspoken assiduous in the early candlelight are baker and commissioners and yet the pale chill february sunrise discloses an unpromising scene indignant female patriots partly supplied with bread rush now to the shops declaring that they will have groceries groceries enough sugarbarrels rolled forth into the street patriot citoyennes weighing it out at a just rate of elevenpence a pound likewise coffeechests soapchests nay cinnamon and cloveschests with aquavitae and other forms of alcoholat a just rate which some do not pay the palefaced grocer silently wringing his hands what help the distributive citoyennes are of violent speech and gesture their long eumenides hair hanging out of curl nay in their girdles pistols are seen sticking some it is even said have beardsmale patriots in petticoats and mobcap thus in the streets of lombards in the street of fivediamonds street of pullies in most streets of paris does it effervesce the livelong day no municipality no mayor pache though he was warminister lately sends military against it or aught against it but persuasiveeloquence till seven at night or later  on monday gone five weeks which was the twentyfirst of january we saw paris beheading its king stand silent like a petrified city of enchantment and now on this monday it is so noisy selling sugar cities especially cities in revolution are subject to these alternations the secret courses of civic business and existence effervescing and efflorescing in this manner as a concrete phenomenon to the eye of which phenomenon when secret existence becoming public effloresces on the street the philosophical causeandeffect is not so easy to find what for example may be the accurate philosophical meaning and meanings of this sale of sugar these things that have become visible in the street of pullies and over paris whence are they we say and whither  that pitt has a hand in it the gold of pitt so much to all reasonable patriot men may seem clear but then through what agents of pitt varlet apostle of liberty was discerned again of late with his pike and his red nightcap deputy marat published in his journal this very day complaining of the bitter scarcity and sufferings of the people till he seemed to get wroth if your rights of man were anything but a piece of written paper the plunder of a few shops and a forestaller or two hung up at the doorlintels would put an end to such things hist parl xxiv 353356 are not these say the girondins pregnant indications pitt has bribed the anarchists marat is the agent of pitt hence this sale of sugar to the mother society again it is clear that the scarcity is factitious is the work of girondins and such like a set of men sold partly to pitt sold wholly to their own ambitions and hardhearted pedantries who will not fix the grainprices but prate pedantically of freetrade wishing to starve paris into violence and embroil it with the departments hence this sale of sugar  and alas if to these two notabilities of a phenomenon and such theories of a phenomenon we add this third notability that the french nation has believed for several years now in the possibility nay certainty and near advent of a universal millennium or reign of freedom equality fraternity wherein man should be the brother of man and sorrow and sin flee away not bread to eat nor soap to wish with and the reign of perfect felicity ready to arrive due always since the bastille fell how did our hearts burn within us at that feast of pikes when brother flung himself on brothers bosom and in sunny jubilee twentyfive millions burst forth into sound and cannonsmoke bright was our hope then as sunlight redangry is our hope grown now as consuming fire but o heavens what enchantment is it or devilish legerdemain of such effect that perfect felicity always within arms length could never be laid hold of but only in her stead controversy and scarcity this set of traitors after that set tremble ye traitors dread a people which calls itself patient longsuffering but which cannot always submit to have its pocket picked in this wayof a millennium  yes reader here is a miracle out of that putrescent rubbish of scepticism sensualism sentimentalism hollow machiavelism such a faith has verily risen flaming in the heart of a people a whole people awakening as it were to consciousness in deep misery believes that it is within reach of a fraternal heavenonearth with longing arms it struggles to embrace the unspeakable cannot embrace it owing to certain causesseldom do we find that a whole people can be said to have any faith at all except in things which it can eat and handle whensoever it gets any faith its history becomes spiritstirring noteworthy but since the time when steel europe shook itself simultaneously at the word of hermit peter and rushed towards the sepulchre where god had lain there was no universal impulse of faith that one could note since protestantism went silent no luthers voice no ziscas drum any longer proclaiming that gods truth was not the devils lie and the last of the cameronians renwick was the name of him honour to the name of the brave sank shot on the castle hill of edinburgh there was no partial impulse of faith among nations till now behold once more this french nation believes herein we say in that astonishing faith of theirs lies the miracle it is a faith undoubtedly of the more prodigious sort even among faiths and will embody itself in prodigies it is the soul of that worldprodigy named french revolution whereat the world still gazes and shudders  but for the rest let no man ask history to explain by causeandeffect how the business proceeded henceforth this battle of mountain and gironde and what follows is the battle of fanaticisms and miracles unsuitable for causeandeffect the sound of it to the mind is as a hubbub of voices in distraction little of articulate is to be gathered by long listening and studying only battletumult shouts of triumph shrieks of despair the mountain has left no memoirs the girondins have left memoirs which are too often little other than longdrawn interjections of woe is me and cursed be ye so soon as history can philosophically delineate the conflagration of a kindled fireship she may try this other task here lay the bitumenstratum there the brimstone one so ran the vein of gunpowder of nitre terebinth and foul grease this were she inquisitive enough history might partly know but how they acted and reacted below decks one firestratum playing into the other by its nature and the art of man now when all hands ran raging and the flames lashed high over shrouds and topmast this let not history attempt  the fireship is old france the old french form of life her creed a generation of men wild are their cries and their ragings there like spirits tormented in that flame but on the whole are they not gone o reader their fireship and they frightening the world have sailed away its flames and its thunders quite away into the deep of time one thing therefore history will do pity them all for it went hard with them all not even the seagreen incorruptible but shall have some pity some human love though it takes an effort and now so much once thoroughly attained the rest will become easier to the eye of equal brotherly pity innumerable perversions dissipate themselves exaggerations and execrations fall off of their own accord standing wistfully on the safe shore we will look and see what is of interest to us what is adapted to us    chapter 33ii  culottic and sansculottic  gironde and mountain are now in full quarrel their mutual rage says toulongeon is growing a pale rage curious lamentable all these men have the word republic on their lips in the heart of every one of them is a passionate wish for something which he calls republic yet see their deathquarrel so however are men made creatures who live in confusion who once thrown together can readily fall into that confusion of confusions which quarrel is simply because their confusions differ from one another still more because they seem to differ mens words are a poor exponent of their thought nay their thought itself is a poor exponent of the inward unnamed mystery wherefrom both thought and action have their birth no man can explain himself can get himself explained men see not one another but distorted phantasms which they call one another which they hate and go to battle with for all battle is well said to be misunderstanding  but indeed that similitude of the fireship of our poor french brethren so fiery themselves working also in an element of fire was not insignificant consider it well there is a shade of the truth in it for a man once committed headlong to republican or any other transcendentalism and fighting and fanaticising amid a nation of his like becomes as it were enveloped in an ambient atmosphere of transcendentalism and delirium his individual self is lost in something that is not himself but foreign though inseparable from him strange to think of the mans cloak still seems to hold the same man and yet the man is not there his volition is not there nor the source of what he will do and devise instead of the man and his volition there is a piece of fanaticism and fatalism incarnated in the shape of him he the hapless incarnated fanaticism goes his road no man can help him he himself least of all it is a wonderful tragical predicamentsuch as human language unused to deal with these things being contrived for the uses of common life struggles to shadow out in figures the ambient element of material fire is not wilder than this of fanaticism nor though visible to the eye is it more real volition bursts forth involuntary rapt along the movement of free human minds becomes a raging tornado of fatalism blind as the winds and mountain and gironde when they recover themselves are alike astounded to see where it has flung and dropt them to such height of miracle can men work on men the conscious and the unconscious blended inscrutably in this our inscrutable life endless necessity environing freewill  the weapons of the girondins are political philosophy respectability and eloquence eloquence or call it rhetoric really of a superior order vergniaud for instance turns a period as sweetly as any man of that generation the weapons of the mountain are those of mere nature audacity and impetuosity which may become ferocity as of men complete in their determination in their conviction nay of men in some cases who as septemberers must either prevail or perish the ground to be fought for is popularity further you may either seek popularity with the friends of freedom and order or with the friends of freedom simple to seek it with both has unhappily become impossible with the former sort and generally with the authorities of the departments and such as read parliamentary debates and are of respectability and of a peaceloving monied nature the girondins carry it with the extreme patriot again with the indigent millions especially with the population of paris who do not read so much as hear and see the girondins altogether lose it and the mountain carries it  egoism nor meanness of mind is not wanting on either side surely not on the girondin side where in fact the instinct of selfpreservation too prominently unfolded by circumstances cuts almost a sorry figure where also a certain finesse to the length even of shuffling and shamming now and then shews itself they are men skilful in advocatefence they have been called the jesuits of the revolution dumouriez memoires iii 314 but that is too hard a name it must be owned likewise that this rude blustering mountain has a sense in it of what the revolution means which these eloquent girondins are totally void of was the revolution made and fought for against the world these four weary years that a formula might be substantiated that society might become methodic demonstrable by logic and the old noblesse with their pretensions vanish or ought it not withal to bring some glimmering of light and alleviation to the twentyfive millions who sat in darkness heavyladen till they rose with pikes in their hands at least and lowest one would think it should bring them a proportion of bread to live on there is in the mountain here and there in marat peoplesfriend in the incorruptible seagreen himself though otherwise so lean and formularly a heartfelt knowledge of this latter factwithout which knowledge all other knowledge here is naught and the choicest forensic eloquence is as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal most cold on the other hand most patronising unsubstantial is the tone of the girondins towards our poorer brethrenthose brethren whom one often hears of under the collective name of the masses as if they were not persons at all but mounds of combustible explosive material for blowing down bastilles with in very truth a revolutionist of this kind is he not a solecism disowned by nature and art deserving only to be erased and disappear surely to our poorer brethren of paris all this girondin patronage sounds deadening and killing if finespoken and incontrovertible in logic then all the falser all the hatefuller in fact  nay doubtless pleading for popularity here among our poorer brethren of paris the girondin has a hard game to play if he gain the ear of the respectable at a distance it is by insisting on september and such like it is at the expense of this paris where he dwells and perorates hard to perorate in such an auditory wherefore the question arises could we not get ourselves out of this paris twice or oftener such an attempt is made if not we ourselves thinks guadet then at least our suppleans might do it for every deputy has his suppleant or substitute who will take his place if need be might not these assemble say at bourges which is a quiet episcopal town in quiet berri forty good leagues off in that case what profit were it for the paris sansculottery to insult us our suppleans sitting quiet in bourges to whom we could run nay even the primary electoral assemblies thinks guadet might be reconvoked and a new convention got with new orders from the sovereign people and right glad were lyons were bourdeaux rouen marseilles as yet provincial towns to welcome us in their turn and become a sort of capital towns and teach these parisians reason  fond schemes which all misgo if decreed in heat of eloquent logic today they are repealed by clamour and passionate wider considerations on the morrow moniteur 1793 no 140 c will you o girondins parcel us into separate republics then like the swiss like your americans so that there be no metropolis or indivisible french nation any more your departmental guard seemed to point that way federal republic federalist men and knittingwomen repeat federaliste with or without much dictionarymeaning but go on repeating it as is usual in such cases till the meaning of it becomes almost magical fit to designate all mystery of iniquity and federaliste has grown a word of exorcism and apagesatanas but furthermore consider what poisoning of public opinion in the departments by these brissot gorsas caritatcondorcet newspapers and then also what counterpoisoning still feller in quality by a pere duchesne of hebert brutallest newspaper yet published on earth by a rougiff of guffroy by the incendiary leaves of marat more than once on complaint given and effervescence rising it is decreed that a man cannot both be legislator and editor that he shall choose between the one function and the other hist parl xxv 25 c but this too which indeed could help little is revoked or eluded remains a pious wish mainly  meanwhile as the sad fruit of such strife behold o ye national representatives how between the friends of law and the friends of freedom everywhere mere heats and jealousies have arisen fevering the whole republic department provincial town is set against metropolis rich against poor culottic against sansculottic man against man from the southern cities come addresses of an almost inculpatory character for paris has long suffered newspaper calumny bourdeaux demands a reign of law and respectability meaning girondism with emphasis with emphasis marseilles demands the like nay from marseilles there come two addresses one girondin one jacobin sansculottic hot rebecqui sick of this conventionwork has given place to his substitute and gone home where also with such jarrings there is work to be sick of  lyons a place of capitalists and aristocrats is in still worse state almost in revolt chalier the jacobin towncouncillor has got too literally to daggersdrawn with nievrechol the moderantin mayor one of your moderate perhaps aristocrat royalist or federalist mayors chalier who pilgrimed to paris to behold marat and the mountain has verily kindled himself at their sacred urn for on the 6th of february last history or rumour has seen him haranguing his lyons jacobins in a quite transcendental manner with a drawn dagger in his hand recommending they say sheer septembermethods patience being worn out and that the jacobin brethren should impromptu work the guillotine themselves one sees him still in engravings mounted on a table foot advanced body contorted a bald rude slopebrowed infuriated visage of the canine species the eyes starting from their sockets in his puissant righthand the brandished dagger or horsepistol as some give it other dogvisages kindling under hima man not likely to end well however the guillotine was not got together impromptu that day on the pont saintclair or elsewhere but indeed continued lying rusty in its loft hist parl xxiv 38593 xxvi 229 c nievrechol with military went about rumbling cannon in the most confused manner and the nine hundred prisoners received no hurt so distracted is lyons grown with its cannon rumbling convention commissioners must be sent thither forthwith if even they can appease it and keep the guillotine in its loft  consider finally if on all these mad jarrings of the southern cities and of france generally a traitorous cryptoroyalist class is not looking and watching ready to strike in at the right season neither is there bread neither is there soap see the patriot women selling out sugar at a just rate of twentytwo sous per pound citizen representatives it were verily well that your quarrels finished and the reign of perfect felicity began    chapter 33iii  growing shrill  on the whole one cannot say that the girondins are wanting to themselves so far as goodwill might go they prick assiduously into the soreplaces of the mountain from principle and also from jesuitism  besides september of which there is now little to be made except effervescence we discern two soreplaces where the mountain often suffers marat and orleans egalite squalid marat for his own sake and for the mountains is assaulted ever

shall they either own him or disown him as for marat personally he with his fixedidea remains invulnerable to such things nay the peoplesfriend is very evidently rising in importance as his befriended people rises no shrieks now when he goes to speak occasional applauses rather furtherance which breeds confidence the day when the girondins proposed to decree him accused decreter daccusation as they

unsenatorial ejaculations les cochons les imbecilles pigs idiots oftentimes he croaks harsh sarcasm having really a rough rasping tongue and a very deep fund of contempt for fine outsides and once or twice he even laughs nay explodes into laughter rit aux eclats at the gentilities and superfine airs of these girondin men of statesmanship with their pedantries plausibilities pusillanimities these two years says he you have been whining about attacks and plots and danger from paris and you have not a scratch to shew for yourselves moniteur seance du 20 mai 1793danton gruffly rebukes him from time to time a maximum of patriotism whom one can neither own nor disown  but the second soreplace of the mountain is this anomalous monseigneur equality prince dorleans behold these men says the gironde with a whilom bourbon prince among them they are creatures of the dorleans faction they will have philippe made king one king no sooner guillotined than another made in his stead girondins have moved buzot moved long ago from principle and also from jesuitism that the whole race of bourbons should be marched forth from the soil of france this prince egalite to bring up the rear motions which might produce some effect on the publicwhich the mountain ill at ease knows not what to do with  and poor orleans egalite himself for one begins to pity even him what does he do with them the disowned of all parties the rejected and foolishly bedrifted hither and hither to what corner of nature can he now drift with advantage feasible hope remains not for him unfeasible hope in pallid doubtful glimmers there may still come bewildering not cheering or illuminatingfrom the dumouriez quarter and how if not the timewasted orleans egalite then perhaps the young unworn chartres egalite might rise to be a kind of king sheltered if shelter it be in the clefts of the mountain poor egalite will wait one refuge in jacobinism one in dumouriez and counterrevolution are there not two chances however the look of him dame genlis says is grown gloomy sad to see sillery also the genliss husband who hovers about the mountain not on it is in a bad way dame genlis has come to raincy out of england and bury st edmunds in these days being summoned by egalite with her young charge mademoiselle egalite that so mademoiselle might not be counted among emigrants and hardly dealt with but it proves a ravelled business genlis and charge find that they must retire to the netherlands must wait on the frontiers for a week or two till monseigneur by jacobin help get it wound up next morning

world a little band of brothers broad danton is loved by all the mountain but they think him too easytempered deficient in suspicion he has stood between dumouriez and much censure anxious not to exasperate our only general in the shrill tumult dantons strong voice reverberates for union and pacification meetings there are dinings with the girondins it is so pressingly essential that there be union but the girondins are haughty and respectable this titan danton is not a man of formulas and there rests on him a shadow of september your girondins have no confidence in me this is the answer a conciliatory meillan gets from him to all the arguments and pleadings this conciliatory meillan can bring the repeated answer is ils nont point de confiance memoires de meillan representant du peuple

parliamentary way on one condition that france had been at least able to exist all the while but this sovereign people has a digestive faculty and cannot do without bread also we are at war and must have victory at war with europe with fate and famine and behold in the spring of the year all victory deserts us  dumouriez had his outposts stretched as far as aixlachapelle and the beautifullest plan for pouncing on holland by stratagem flatbottomed boats and rapid intrepidity wherein too he had prospered so far but unhappily could prosper no further aixlachapelle is lost maestricht will not

neither cartridges nor clothing shoes we have deceptively soled with wood and pasteboard nothing in short is right danton and lacroix when it was they that were commissioners would needs join belgium to franceof which dumouriez might have made the prettiest little duchy for his own secret behoof with all these things the general is wroth and writes to us in a sharp tone who knows what this hot

the hysterics finds these days of march especially this sunday the tenth of march play a great part plots plots a plot for murdering the girondin deputies anarchists and secretroyalists plotting in hellish concert for that end the far greater part of which is hysterics what we do find indisputable is that louvet and certain girondins were apprehensive they might be murdered on saturday and did not go to the evening sitting but held council with one another each inciting his fellow to do something resolute and end these anarchists to which however petion opening the window and finding the

their fatal shortness of vision nay fatal poorness of character for that is the root of it they are as strangers to the people they would govern to the thing they have come to work in formulas philosophies respectabilities what has been written in books and admitted by the cultivated classes this inadequate scheme of natures working is all that nature let her work as she will can reveal to these men so they perorate and speculate and call on the friends of law when the question is not law or nolaw but life or nolife pedants of the revolution if not jesuits of it their formalism is great great also is their egoism france rising to fight austria has been raised only by plot of the tenth of march to kill twentytwo of them this revolution prodigy unfolding itself into terrific stature

virtues on what we call the decencies and respectabilities this they will have and nothing but this whatsoever other republic nature and reality send shall be considered as not sent as a kind of nightmare vision and thing nonextant disowned by the laws of nature and of formula alas dim for the best eyes is this reality and as for these men they will not look at it with eyes at all but only through facetted spectacles of pedantry wounded vanity which yield the most portentous fallacious spectrum carping and complaining forever of plots and anarchy they will do one thing prove to demonstration that the reality will not translate into their formula that they and their formula are incompatible with the reality and in its dark wrath the reality will extinguish it and them what a man kens he cans but the beginning of a mans doom is that vision be withdrawn from him that he see not the reality but a false spectrum of the reality and following that step darkly with more or less velocity downwards to the utter dark to ruin which is the great sea of darkness whither all falsehoods winding or direct continually flow  this tenth of march we may mark as an epoch in the girondin destinies the rage so exasperated itself the misconception so darkened itself many desert the sittings many come to them armed meillan memoires pp 85 24 an honourable deputy setting out after

on the rear of us dumouriez never off horseback night or day engagement every three hours our whole discomfited host rolling rapidly inwards full of rage suspicion and sauvequipeut and then dumouriez

france flowing in blind terror shutting townbarriers boiling pitch for brigands happier this march that it is a seeing terror that a creative mountain exists which can say fiat recruitment proceeds with fierce celerity nevertheless our volunteers hesitate to set out till treason be punished at home they do not fly to the frontiers but only fly hither and thither demanding and denouncing the

inmates legibly printed on it at a height not exceeding five feet from the ground every citizen must produce his certificatory carte de civisme signed by sectionpresident every man be ready to give account of the faith that is in him persons suspect had as well depart this soil of liberty and yet departure too is bad all emigrants are declared traitors their property become national they are dead in lawsave indeed that for our behoof they shall live yet fifty years in law and what heritages may fall to them in that time become national too a mad vitality of jacobinism with fortyfour thousand centres of activity circulates through all fibres of france  very notable also is the tribunal extraordinaire moniteur no 70 du 11 mars no 76 c decreed by the mountain some girondins

revolution government continues hitherto in a very anarchic state executive council of ministers six in number there is but they especially since rolands retreat have hardly known whether they were ministers or not convention committees sit supreme over them but then each committee as supreme as the others committee of twentyone of defence of general surety simultaneous or successive for specific purposes the convention alone is allpowerfulespecially if the commune go with it but is too numerous for an administrative body wherefore in this perilous quickwhirling condition of the republic before the end of march we obtain our small comite de salut public moniteur no 83 du 24 mars 1793 nos 86 98 99 100 as it were for miscellaneous accidental purposes requiring despatchas it proves for a sort of universal supervision and universal subjection they are to report weekly these new committeemen but to deliberate in secret their number is nine firm patriots all danton one of them renewable every monthyet why not reelect them if they turn out well the flower of the matter is that they are but nine that they sit in secret an insignificantlooking thing at first this committee but with a principle of growth in it forwarded by fortune by internal jacobin energy it will reduce all committees and the convention itself to mute obedience the six ministers to six assiduous clerks and work its will on the earth and under heaven for a season a committee of public salvation whereat the world still shrieks and shudders  if we call that revolutionary tribunal a sword which sansculottism has provided for itself then let us call the law of the maximum a provenderscrip or haversack wherein better or worse some ration of bread may be found it is true political economy girondin freetrade and all law of supply and demand are hereby hurled topsyturvy but what help patriotism must live the cupidity of farmers seems to have no bowels wherefore this law of the maximum fixing the highest price of grains is with infinite effort got passed moniteur du 20 avril c to 20 mai 1793 and shall gradually extend itself into a maximum for all manner of comestibles and commodities with such scrambling and topsyturvying as may be fancied for now if for example the farmer will not sell the farmer shall be forced to sell an accurate account of what grain he has shall be delivered in to the constituted authorities let him see that he say not too much for in that case his rents taxes and contributions will rise proportionally let him see that he say not too little for on or before a set day we shall suppose in april less than onethird of this declared quantity must remain in his barns more than twothirds of it must have been thrashed and sold one can denounce him and raise penalties  by such inextricable overturning of all commercial relation will sansculottism keep life in since not otherwise on the whole as camille desmoulins says once while the sansculottes fight the monsieurs must pay so there come impots progressifs ascending taxes which consume with fastincreasing voracity and superfluousrevenue of men beyond fiftypounds ayear you are not exempt rising into the hundreds you bleed freely into the thousands and tens of thousands you bleed gushing also there come requisitions there comes forcedloan of a milliard some fiftymillions sterling which of course they that have must lend unexampled enough it has grown to be no country for the rich this but a country for the poor and then if one fly what steads it dead in law nay kept alive fifty years yet for their accursed behoof in this manner therefore it goes topsyturvying cairaingand withal there is endless sale of emigrant nationalproperty there is cambon with endless cornucopia of assignats the trade and finance of sansculottism and how with maximum and bakersqueues with cupidity hunger denunciation and papermoney it led its galvaniclife and began and endedremains

representatives warminister at their head are posting hitherward from valenciennes are close at handwith what intents one may guess while the couriers are yet speaking warminister and national representatives old camus the archivist for chief speaker of them arrive hardly has mon general had time to order out the huzzar regiment de berchigny that it take rank and wait near by in case of accident and so enter warminister beurnonville with an embrace of friendship for he is an old friend enter archivist camus and the other three following him  they produce papers invite the general to the bar of the convention merely to give an explanation or two the general finds it unsuitable not to say impossible and that the service will suffer then comes reasoning the voice of the old archivist getting loud vain to reason loud with this dumouriez he answers mere angry irreverences and so amid plumed staffofficers very gloomylooking in jeopardy and uncertainty these poor national messengers debate and consult retire and reenter for the space of some two hours without effect whereupon archivist camus getting quite loud proclaims in the name of the national convention for he has the power to do it that general dumouriez is arrested will you obey the national mandate general pas dans ce momentci not at this particular moment answers the general also aloud then glancing the

discern dumouriez with small escort with chartres egalite and a few staffofficers ambling along the conde highway perhaps they are for conde and trying to persuade the garrison there at all events they are for an interview with cobourg who waits in the woods by appointment in that quarter nigh the village of doumet three national battalions a set of men always full of jacobinism sweep past us

lasources probabilities are gone but dantons pledge of battle remains lying  a third epoch or scene in the girondin drama or rather it is but the completion of this second epoch we reckon from the day when the patience of virtuous petion finally boiled over and the girondins so to speak took up this battlepledge of dantons and decreed marat accused it was the eleventh of the same month of april on some effervescence rising such as often rose and president had covered himself mere bedlam now ruling and mountain and gironde were rushing on one another with clenched righthands and even with pistols in them when behold the girondin duperret drew a sword shriek of horror rose instantly quenching all other effervescence at sight of the clear murderous steel whereupon duperret returned it to the leather againconfessing that he did indeed draw it being instigated by a kind of sacred madness sainte fureur and pistols held at him but that if he parricidally had chanced to scratch the outmost skin of national representation with it he too carried pistols and would have blown his brains out on the spot hist parl xv 397  but now in such posture of affairs virtuous petion rose next morning to lament these effervescences this endless anarchy invading the legislative sanctuary itself and here being growled at and howled at by the mountain his patience long tried did as we say boil over and he spake vehemently in high key with foam on his lips whence says marat i concluded he had got la rage the rabidity or dogmadness rabidity smites others rabid so there rises new foamlipped demand to have anarchists extinguished and specially to have marat put under accusation send a representative to the revolutionary tribunal violate the inviolability of a representative have a care o friends

the wealthier kind come denouncing such demand nay the same section will demand today and denounce the demand tomorrow according as the wealthier sit or the poorer wherefore indeed the girondins decree that all sections shall close at ten in the evening before the working people come which decree remains without effect and nightly the mother of patriotism wails doleful doleful but her eye kindling and fournier lamericain is busy and the two banker freys and varlet apostle of liberty the bullvoice of marquis sainthuruge is heard and shrill women vociferate from all galleries the convention ones and downwards nay a central committee of all the fortyeight sections looms forth huge and dubious sitting dim in the archeveche sending resolutions receiving them a centre of the sections in dread deliberation as to a new tenth of august  one thing we will specify to throw light on many the aspect under which seen through the eyes of these girondin twelve or even seen through ones own eyes the patriotism of the softer sex presents itself there are female patriots whom the girondins call megaeras and count to the extent of eight thousand with serpenthair all out of curl who have changed the distaff for the dagger they are of the society called brotherly fraternelle say sisterly which meets under the roof of the jacobins two thousand daggers or so have been

groceries safe in the shops and little or no hope of a millennium ever comingbut indeed as to the temper there was in men and women does not this one fact say enough the height suspicion had risen to preternatural we often called it seemingly in the language of exaggeration but listen to the cold deposition of witnesses not a musical patriot can blow himself a snatch of melody from the french horn

human suspicion is perhaps this of camille desmoulins camilles head one of the clearest in france has got itself so saturated through every fibre with preternaturalism of suspicion that looking back on that twelfth of july 1789 when the thousands rose round him yelling responsive at his word in the palais royal garden and took cockades he finds it explicable only on this hypothesis that they were all hired to do it and set on by the foreign and other plotters it was not for nothing says camille with insight that this multitude burst up round me when i spoke no not for nothing behind around before it is one huge preternatural puppetplay of plots pitt pulling the wires see histoire des brissotins par camille desmoulins a pamphlet of camilles paris 1793 almost i conjecture that i camille myself am a plot and wooden with wiresthe force of insight could no further go  be this as it will history remarks that the commission of twelve now clear enough as to the plots and luckily having got the threads of them all by the end as they sayare launching mandates of arrest rapidly in these may days and carrying matters with a high hand resolute that the sea of troubles shall be restrained

ominous old question made new can you save the republic or must we do it to whom president max isnard makes fiery answer if by fatal chance in any of those tumults which since the tenth of march are ever returning paris were to lift a sacrilegious finger against the national representation france would rise as one man in neverimagined vengeance and shortly the traveller would ask on which side of the seine paris had stood moniteur seance du 25 mai 1793 whereat the mountain bellows only louder and every gallery patriot paris boiling round  and girondin valaze has nightly conclaves at his house

roaring sections is broken then on the morrow in a convention of rallied girondins is reinstated dim chaos or the sea of troubles is struggling through all its elements writhing and chafing towards some creation     chapter 33ix  extinct  accordingly on friday the thirtyfirst of may 1793 there comes forth into the summer sunlight one of the strangest scenes mayor pache with municipality arrives at the tuileries hall of convention sent for paris being in visible ferment and gives the strangest news  how in the grey of this morning while we sat permanent in townhall watchful for the commonweal there entered precisely as on a tenth of august some ninetysix extraneous persons who declared themselves to be in a state of insurrection to be plenipotentiary commissioners from the fortyeight sections sections or members of the sovereign people all in a state of insurrection and further that we in the name of said sovereign in insurrection were dismissed from office how we thereupon laid off our sashes and withdrew into the adjacent saloon of liberty how in a moment or two we were called back and reinstated the sovereign pleasing to think us still worthy of confidence whereby having taken new oath of office we on a sudden find ourselves insurrectionary magistrates with extraneous committee of ninetysix sitting by us and a citoyen henriot one whom some accuse of septemberism is made generalissimo of the national guard and since six oclock the tocsins ring and the drums beatunder which peculiar circumstances what would an august national convention please to direct us to do compare debats de la convention paris 1828 iv 187223 moniteur nos 152 3 4 an 1er  yes there is the question break the insurrectionary authorities answers some with vehemence vergniaud at least will have the national representatives all die at their post this is sworn to with ready loud acclaim but as to breaking the insurrectionary authoritiesalas while we yet debate what sound is that sound of the alarmcannon on the pont neuf which it is death by the law to fire without order from us  it does boom off there nevertheless sending a sound through all hearts and the tocsins discourse stern music and henriot with his armed force has enveloped us and section succeeds section the livelong day demanding with cambysesoratory with the rattle of muskets that traitors twentytwo or more be punished that the commission of twelve be irrecoverably broken the heart of the gironde dies within it distant are the seventytwo respectable departments this fiery municipality is near barrere is for a middle course granting something the commission of twelve declares that not waiting to be broken it hereby breaks itself and is no more fain would reporter rabaut speak his and its lastwords but he is bellowed off too happy that the twentytwo are still left unviolatedvergniaud carrying the laws of refinement to a great length moves to the amazement of some that the sections of paris have deserved well of their country whereupon at a late hour of the evening the deserving sections retire to their respective places of abode barrere shall report on it with busy quill and brain he sits secluded for him no sleep tonight friday the last of may has ended in this manner  the sections have deserved well but ought they not to deserve better faction and girondism is struck down for the moment and consents to be a nullity but will it not at another favourabler moment rise still feller and the republic have to be saved in spite of it so reasons patriotism still permanent so reasons the figure of marat visible in the dim sectionworld on the morrow to the conviction of menand so at eventide of saturday when barrere had just got it all varnished in the course of the day and his report was setting off in the evening mailbags tocsin peals out again generale is beating armed men taking station in the place vendome and elsewhere for the night supplied with provisions and liquor there under the summer stars will they wait this night what is to be seen and to be done henriot and townhall giving due signal  the convention at sound of generale hastens back to its hall but to the number only of a hundred and does little business puts off business till the morrow the girondins do not stir out thither the girondins are abroad seeking beds poor rabaut on the morrow morning returning to his post with louvet and some others through streets all in ferment wrings his hands ejaculating illa suprema dies louvet memoires p 89 it has become sunday the second day of june year 1793 by the old style by the new style year one of liberty equality fraternity we have got to the last scene of all that ends this history of the girondin senatorship  it seems doubtful whether any terrestrial convention had ever met in such circumstances as this national one now does tocsin is pealing barriers shut all paris is on the gaze or under arms as many as a hundred thousand under arms they count national force and the armed volunteers who should have flown to the frontiers and la vendee but would not treason being unpunished and only flew hither and thither so many steady under arms environ the national tuileries and garden there are horse foot artillery sappers with beards the artillery one can see with their campfurnaces in this national garden heating bullets red and their match is lighted henriot in plumes rides amid a plumed staff all posts and issues are safe reserves lie out as far as the wood of boulogne the choicest patriots nearest the scene one other circumstance we will note that a careful municipality liberal of campfurnaces has not forgotten provisioncarts no member of the sovereign need now go home to dinner but can keep rankplentiful victual circulating unsought does not this people understand insurrection ye not uninventive gualches  therefore let a national representation mandatories of the sovereign take thought of it expulsion of your twentytwo and your commission of twelve we stand here till it be done deputation after deputation in ever stronger language comes with that message barrere proposes a middle coursewill not perhaps the inculpated deputies consent to withdraw voluntarily to make a generous demission and selfsacrifice for the sake of ones country isnard repentant of that search on which riverbank paris stood declares himself ready to demit ready also is tedeum fauchet old dusaulx of the bastille vieux radoteur old dotard as marat calls him is still readier on the contrary lanjuinais the breton declares that there is one man who never will demit voluntarily but will protest to the uttermost while a voice is left him and he accordingly goes on protesting amid rage and clangor legendre crying at last lanjuinais come down from the tribune or i will fling thee down ou je te jette en bas for matters are come to extremity nay they do clutch hold of lanjuinais certain zealous mountainmen but cannot fling him down for he cramps himself on the railing and his clothes get torn brave senator worthy of pity neither will barbaroux demit he has sworn to die at his post and will keep that oath whereupon the galleries all rise with explosion brandishing weapons some of them and rush out saying allons then we must save our country such a session is this of sunday the second of june  churches fill over christian europe and then empty themselves but this convention empties not the while a day of shrieking contention of agony humiliation and tearing of coatskirts illa suprema dies round stand henriot and his hundred thousand copiously refreshed from tray and basket nay he is distributing five francs apiece we girondins saw it with our eyes five francs to keep them in heart and distraction of armed riot encumbers our borders jangles at our bar we are prisoners in our own hall bishop gregoire could not get out for a besoin actuel without four gendarmes to wait on him what is the character of a national representative become and now the sunlight falls yellower on western windows and the chimneytops are flinging longer shadows the refreshed hundred thousand nor their shadows stir not what to resolve on motion rises superfluous one would think that the convention go forth in a body ascertain with its own eyes whether it is free or not lo therefore from the eastern gate of the tuileries a distressed convention issuing handsome herault sechelles at their head he with hat on in sign of public calamity the rest bareheadedtowards the gate of the carrousel wondrous to see towards henriot

were pedants and had not better parts not condemnable but most unfortunate they wanted a republic of the virtues wherein themselves should be head and they could only get a republic of the strengths

leafy months of june and july several french departments germinate a set of rebellious paperleaves named proclamations resolutions journals or diurnals of the union for resistance to oppression in particular the town of caen in calvados sees its paperleaf of bulletin de caen suddenly bud suddenly establish itself as newspaper there under the editorship of girondin national representatives  for among the proscribed girondins are certain of a more desperate humour some as vergniaud valaze gensonne arrested in their own houses will await with stoical resignation what the issue may be some as brissot rabaut will take to flight to concealment which as the paris barriers are opened again in a day or two is not yet difficult but others there are who will rush with buzot to calvados or far over france to lyons toulon nantes and elsewhither and then rendezvous at caen to awaken as with wartrumpet the respectable departments and strike down an anarchic mountain faction at least not yield without a stroke at it of this latter temper we count some score or more of the arrested and of the notyetarrested a buzot a barbaroux louvet guadet petion who have escaped from arrestment in their own homes a salles a pythagorean valady a duchatel the duchatel that came in blanket and nightcap to vote for the life of louis who have escaped from danger and likelihood of arrestment these to the number at one time of twentyseven do accordingly lodge here at the intendance or departmental mansion of the town of caen welcomed by persons in authority welcomed and defrayed having no money of their own and the bulletin de caen comes forth with the most animating paragraphs how the bourdeaux department the lyons department this department after the other is declaring itself sixty or say sixtynine or seventytwo meillan p 72 73 louvet p 129 respectable departments either declaring or ready to declare nay marseilles it seems will march on paris by itself if need be so has marseilles town said that she will march but on the other hand that montelimart town has said no thoroughfare and means even to bury herself under her own stone and mortar firstof this be no mention in bulletin of caen  such animating paragraphs we read in this newspaper and fervours and eloquent sarcasm tirades against the mountain frame pen of deputy salles which resemble say friends pascals provincials what is more to the purpose these girondins have got a general in chief one wimpfen formerly under dumouriez also a secondary questionable general puisaye and others and are doing their best to raise a force for war national volunteers whosoever is of right heart gather in ye national volunteers friends of liberty from our calvados townships from the eure from brittany from far and near forward to paris and extinguish anarchy thus at caen in the early july days there is a drumming and parading a perorating and consulting staff and army council club of carabots antijacobin friends of freedom to denounce atrocious marat with all which and the editing of bulletins a national representative has his hands full  at caen it is most animated and as one hopes more or less animated in the seventytwo

deathscene and such other apotheosis take place as the human genius in these circumstances can devise but marat returns no more to the light of this sun one sole circumstance we have read with clear sympathy in the old moniteur newspaper how marats brother comes from neuchatel to ask of the convention that the deceased jeanpaul marats musket be given him seance du 16 septembre 1793 for marat too had a brother and natural affections and was wrapt once in swaddlingclothes and slept safe in a cradle like the rest of us ye children of mena sister of his they say lives still to this day in paris

desirable  this then is the fruit your antianarchic girondins have got from that levying of war in calvados this fruit we may say and no other whatsoever for indeed before either charlottes or chaliers head had fallen the calvados war itself had as it were vanished dreamlike in a shriek with seventytwo departments on ones side one might have hoped better things but it turns out that respectabilities though they will vote will not fight possession is always nine points in law but in lawsuits of this kind one may say it is ninetyandnine points men do what they were wont to do and

entirely unknown to louvet greatly suspected by him  few wars accordingly were ever levied of a more insufficient character than this of calvados he that is curious in such things may read the details of it in the memoirs of that same cidevant puisaye the muchenduring man and royalist how our girondin national forces marching off with plenty of windmusic were drawn out about the old chateau of brecourt in the woodcountry near vernon to meet the mountain national forces advancing from paris how on the fifteenth afternoon of july they did meetand as it were shrieked mutually and took mutually

coalition for a year lovers of the picturesque and goethe standing on the chaussee of mentz saw with due interest the procession issuing forth in all solemnity  escorted by prussian horse came first the french garrison nothing could look stranger than this latter a column of marseillese slight swarthy partycoloured in patched clothes came tripping onas if king edwin had opened the dwarf hill and sent out his nimble host of dwarfs next followed regular troops serious sullen not as if downcast or ashamed but the remarkablest appearance which struck every one was that of the chasers chasseurs coming out mounted they had advanced quite silent to where we stood when their band struck up the marseillaise this revolutionary tedeum has in itself something mournful and bodeful however briskly played but at present they gave it in altogether slow time proportionate to the creeping step they rode at it was piercing and fearful and a most seriouslooking thing as these cavaliers long lean men of a certain age with mien suitable to the music came pacing on singly you might have likened them to don quixote in mass they were highly dignified  but now a single troop became notable that of the commissioners or representans merlin of thionville in hussar uniform distinguishing himself by wild beard and look had another person in similar costume on his left the crowd shouted out with rage at sight of this latter the name of a jacobin townsman and clubbist and shook itself to seize him merlin drew bridle referred to his dignity as french representative to the vengeance that should follow any injury done he would advise every one to compose himself for this was not the last time they would see him here belagerung von maintz goethes werke xxx 315 thus rode merlin threatening in defeat

it from submerging the very heart of the country  furthermore precisely in the same days valenciennes siege is finished in the northwestfallen under the red hail of york conde fell some fortnight since cimmerian coalition presses on what seems very notable too on all these captured french towns there flies not the royalist fleurdelys in the name of a new louis the pretender but the austrian flag flies as if austria meant to keep them for herself perhaps general custines still in paris can give some explanation of the fall of these strongplaces mother society from tribune and gallery growls loud that he ought to do itremarks however in a splenetic manner that the monsieurs of the palais royal are calling longlife to this general  the mother society purged now by successive

constitutions ever put together made some say in eight days by herault sechelles and others probably a workmanlike roadworthy constitution enoughon which point however we are for some reasons little called to form a judgment workmanlike or not the fortyfour thousand communes of france by overwhelming majorities did hasten to accept it glad of any constitution whatsoever nay departmental deputies have come the venerablest republicans of each department with solemn message of acceptance and now what remains but that our new final constitution be proclaimed and sworn to in feast of pikes the departmental deputies we say are come some time agochaumette very anxious about them lest girondin monsieurs agiojobbers or were it even filles de joie of a girondin temper corrupt their morals deux

patriot not suspect will be behind another there stand printed these words republic one and indivisible liberty equality fraternity or death  as to the new calendar we may say here rather than elsewhere that speculative men have long been struck with the inequalities and incongruities of the old calendar that a new one has long been as good as determined on marechal the atheist almost ten years ago proposed a new calendar free at least from superstition this the paris municipality would now adopt in defect of a better at all events let us have either this of marechals or a betterthe new era being come petitions more than once have been sent to that effect and indeed for a year past all public bodies journalists and patriots in general have dated first year of the republic it is a subject not without difficulties but the convention has taken it up and romme as we say has been meditating it not marechals new calendar but a better new one of rommes and our own romme aided by a monge a lagrange and others furnishes mathematics fabre deglantine furnishes poetic nomenclature and so on the 5th of october 1793 after trouble enough they bring forth this new republican calendar of theirs in a complete state and by law get it put in action  four equal seasons twelve equal months of thirty days each this makes three hundred and sixty days and five odd days remain to be disposed of the five odd days we will make festivals and name the five sansculottides or days without breeches festival of genius festival of labour of actions of rewards of opinion these are the five sansculottides whereby the great circle or year is made complete solely every fourth year whilom called leapyear we introduce a sixth sansculottide and name it festival of the revolution now as to the day of commencement which offers difficulties is it not one of the luckiest coincidences that the republic herself commenced on the 21st of september close on the vernal equinox vernal equinox at midnight for the meridian of paris in the year whilom christian 1792 from that moment shall the new era reckon itself to begin vendemiaire brumaire frimaire or as one might say in mixed english

meadowal are our spring season messidor thermidor fructidor that is to say dor being greek for gift reapidor heatidor fruitidor are republican summer these twelve in a singular manner divide the republican year then as to minuter subdivisions let us venture at once on a bold stroke adopt your decimal subdivision and instead of worldold week or seennight make it a tennight or decadenot without results there are three decades then in each of the months which is very regular and the decadi or tenthday shall always be the day of rest and the christian sabbath in that case shall shift for itself  this in brief in this new calendar of romme and the convention calculated for the meridian of paris and gospel of jeanjacques not one of the least afflicting occurrences for the actual british reader of french historyconfusing the soul with messidors meadowals till at last in selfdefence one is forced to construct some groundscheme or rule of commutation from newstyle to oldstyle and have

harvest of long centuries was ripening and whitening so rapidly of late and now it is grown white and is reaped rapidly as it were in one day reaped in this reign of terror and carried home to hades and the pitunhappy sons of adam it is ever so and never do they know it nor will they know it with cheerfully smoothed countenances day after day and generation after generation they calling cheerfully to one another wellspeedye are at work sowing the wind and yet as god lives they shall reap the whirlwind no other thing we say is possiblesince god is a truth and his world is a truth  history however in dealing with this reign of terror has had her own difficulties while the phenomenon continued in its primary state as mere horrors of the french revolution there was abundance to be said and shrieked with and also without profit heaven knows there were terrors and horrors enough yet that was not all the phenomenon nay more properly that was not the phenomenon at all but rather was the shadow of it the negative part of it and now in a new stage of the business when history ceasing to shriek would try rather to include under her old forms of speech or speculation this new amazing thing that so some accredited scientific law of nature might suffice for the unexpected product of nature and history might get to speak of it articulately and draw inferences and profit from it in this new stage history we must say babbles and flounders perhaps in a still painfuller manner take for example the latest form of speech we have seen propounded on the subject as adequate to it almost in these months by our worthy m roux in his histoire parlementaire the latest and the strangest that the french revolution was a deadlift effort after eighteen hundred years of preparation to realisethe christian religion hist parl introd i 1 et seqq unity indivisibility brotherhood or death did indeed stand printed on all houses of the living also on cemeteries or houses of the dead stood printed by order of procureur chaumette here is eternal sleep deux amis xii 78 but a christian religion realised by the guillotine and deatheternal is suspect to me as robespierre was wont to say mest suspecte  alas no m roux a gospel of brotherhood not according to any of the four old evangelists and calling on men to repent and amend each his own wicked existence that they might be saved but a gospel rather as we often hint according to a new fifth evangelist jeanjacques calling on men to amend each the whole worlds wicked existence and be saved by making the constitution a thing different and distant toto coelo as they say the whole breadth of the sky and further if possibleit is thus however that history and indeed all human speech and reason does yet what father adam began life by doing strive to name the new things it sees of natures producingoften helplessly enough  but what if history were to admit for once that all the names and theorems yet known to her fall short that this grand product of nature was even grand and new in that it came not to range itself under old recorded lawsofnature at all but to disclose new ones in that case history renouncing the pretention to name it at present will look honestly at it and name what she can of it any approximation to the right name has value were the right name itself once here the thing is known thenceforth the thing is then ours and can be dealt with  now surely not realization of christianity or of aught earthly do we discern in this reign of terror in this french revolution of which it is the consummating destruction rather we discernof all that was destructible it is as if twentyfive millions risen at length into the pythian mood had stood up simultaneously to say with a sound which goes through far lands and times that this untruth of an existence had become insupportable o ye hypocrisies and speciosities royal mantles cardinal plushcloaks ye credos formulas respectabilities fairpainted sepulchres full of dead mens bonesbehold ye appear to us to be altogether a lie yet our life is not a lie yet our hunger and misery is not a lie behold we lift up one and all our twentyfive million righthands and take the heavens and the earth and also the pit of tophet to witness that either ye shall be abolished or else we shall be abolished  no inconsiderable oath truly forming as has been often said the most remarkable transaction in these last thousand years wherefrom likewise there follow and will follow results the fulfilment of this oath that is to say the black desperate battle of men against their whole condition and environmenta battle alas withal against the sin and darkness that was in themselves as in others this is the reign of terror transcendental despair was the purport of it though not consciously so false hopes of fraternity political millennium and what not we have always seen but the unseen heart of the whole the transcendental despair was not false neither has it been of no effect despair pushed far enough completes the circle so to speak and becomes a kind of genuine productive hope again  doctrine of fraternity out of old catholicism does it is true very strangely in the vehicle of a jeanjacques evangel suddenly plump down out of its cloudfirmament and from a theorem determine to make itself a practice but just so do all creeds intentions customs knowledges thoughts and things which the french have suddenly plump down catholicism classicism sentimentalism cannibalism all isms that make up man in france are rushing and roaring in that gulf and the theorem has become a practice and whatsoever cannot swim sinks not evangelist jeanjacques alone there is not a village schoolmaster but has contributed his quota do we not thou one another according to the free peoples of antiquity the french patriot in red phrygian nightcap of liberty christens his poor little red infant catocensor or else of utica gracchus has become baboeuf and edits newspapers mutius scaevola cordwainer of that ilk presides in the section mutiusscaevola and in brief there is a world wholly jumbling itself to try what will swim  wherefore we will at all events call this reign of terror a very strange one dominant sansculottism makes as it were free arena one of the strangest temporary states humanity was ever seen in a nation of men full of wants and void of habits the old habits are gone to wreck because they were old men driven forward by necessity and fierce pythian madness have on the spur of the instant to devise for the want the way of satisfying it the wonted tumbles down by imitation by invention the unwonted hastily builds itself up what the french national head has in it comes out if not a great result surely one of the strangest  neither shall the reader fancy that it was all blank this reign of terror far from it how many hammermen and squaremen bakers and brewers washers and wringers over this france must ply

transient glimpse of things that is to be noted the last transit to his long home of philippe dorleans egalite philippe was decreed accused along with the girondins much to his and their surprise but not tried along with them they are doomed and dead some three days when philippe after his long halfyear of durance at marseilles arrives in paris it is as we calculate the third of november 1793  on which same day two notable female prisoners are also put in ward there dame dubarry and josephine beauharnais dame whilom countess dubarry unfortunatefemale had returned from london they snatched her not only as exharlot of a whilom majesty and therefore suspect but as having furnished the emigrants with money contemporaneously with whom there comes the wife of beauharnais soon to be the widow she that is josephine tascher beauharnais that shall be josephine empress buonaparte for a black divineress of the tropics prophesied long since that she should be a queen and more likewise in the same hours poor adam lux nigh turned in the head who according to foster has taken no food these three weeks marches to the guillotine for his pamphlet on charlotte corday he sprang to the scaffold said he died for her with great joy amid such fellowtravellers does philippe arrive for be the month named brumaire year 2 of liberty or november year 1793 of slavery the guillotine goes always guillotine va toujours  enough philippes indictment is soon drawn his jury soon convinced he finds himself made guilty of royalism conspiracy and much else nay it is a guilt in him that he voted louiss death though he answers i voted in my soul and conscience the doom he finds is death forthwith this present sixth dim day of november is the last day that philippe is to see philippe says montgaillard thereupon called for breakfast sufficiency of oysters two cutlets best part of an excellent bottle of claret and consumed the same with apparent relish a revolutionary judge or some official convention emissary then arrived to signify that he might still do the state some service by revealing the truth about a plot or two philippe answered that on him in the pass things had come to the state had he thought small claim that nevertheless in the interest of liberty he having still some leisure on his hands was willing were a reasonable question asked him to give reasonable answer and so says montgaillard he lent his elbow on the mantelpiece and conversed in an undertone with great seeming composure till the leisure was done or the emissary went his ways  at the door of the conciergerie philippes attitude was erect and easy almost commanding it is five years all but a few days since philippe within these same stone walls stood up with an air of graciosity and asked king louis whether it was a royal session then or a bed of justice o heaventhree poor blackguards were to ride and die with him some say they objected to such company and had to be flung in neck and heels foster ii 628

on the scaffold samson was for drawing of his boots tush said philippe they will come better off after let us have done depechonsnous  so philippe was not without virtue then god forbid that there should be any living man without it he had the virtue to keep living for fiveandforty yearsother virtues perhaps more than we know of probably no mortal ever had such things recorded of him such facts and also such lies for he was a jacobin prince of the blood consider what a combination also unlike any nero any borgia he lived in the age of pamphlets enough for us chaos has reabsorbed him may it

eyes of hers full of expression and sweetness she spoke to me often at the grate we were all attentive round her in a sort of admiration and astonishment she expressed herself with a purity with a harmony and prosody that made her language like music of which the ear could never have enough her conversation was serious not cold coming from the mouth of a beautiful woman it was frank and courageous as that of a great men and yet her maid said before you she collects her strength but in her own room she will sit three hours sometimes leaning on the window and weeping she had been in

regions over which history can cast only glances from aloft she will alight for a moment and look fixedly at one point the siege of toulon much battering and bombarding heating of balls in furnaces or farmhouses serving of artillery well and ill attacking of ollioules passes forts malbosquet there has been as yet to small purpose we have had general cartaux here a whilom painter elevated in the troubles of marseilles general doppet a whilom medical man elevated in the troubles of piemont who under crance took lyons but cannot take toulon finally we have general dugommier a pupil of washington convention representans also we have had barrases salicettis robespierres the youngeralso an artillery chef de brigade of extreme diligence who often takes his nap of sleep among the guns a short taciturn olivecomplexioned young man not unknown to us by name buonaparte one of the best artilleryofficers yet met with and still toulon is not taken it is the fourth month now december in slavestyle frostarious or frimaire in newstyle and still their cursed redblue flag flies there they are provisioned from the sea they have seized all heights felling wood and fortifying themselves like the coney they have built their nest in the rocks  meanwhile frostarious is not yet become snowous or nivose when a council of war is called instructions have just arrived from government and salut public carnot in salut public has sent us a plan of siege on which plan general dugommier has this criticism to make commissioner salicetti has that and criticisms and plans are very various when that young artillery officer ventures to speak the same whom we saw snatching sleep among the guns who has emerged several times in this historythe name of him napoleon buonaparte it is his humble opinion for he has been gliding about with spyglasses with thoughts that a certain fort leguillette can be clutched as with lionspring on the sudden wherefrom were it once ours the very heart of toulon might be battered the english lines were so to speak turned inside out and hood and our natural enemies must next day either put to sea or be burnt to ashes commissioners arch their eyebrows with negatory sniff who is this young gentleman with more wit than we all brave veteran dugommier however thinks the idea worth a word questions the young gentleman becomes convinced and there is for issue try it  on the taciturn bronzecountenance therefore things being now all ready there sits a grimmer gravity than ever compressing a hotter centralfire than ever yonder thou seest is fort leguillette a desperate lionspring yet a possible one this day to be triedtried it is and found good by stratagem and valour stealing through ravines plunging fiery through the firetempest fort leguillette is clutched at is carried the smoke having cleared wiser the tricolor fly on it the bronzecomplexioned young man was right next morning hood finding the interior of his lines exposed his defences turned inside out makes for his shipping taking such royalists as wished it on board with him he weighs anchor on this 19th of december 1793 toulon is once more the republics  cannonading has ceased at toulon and now the guillotining and fusillading may begin civil horrors truly but at least that infamy of an english domination is purged away let there be civic feast universally over france so reports barrere or painter david and the convention assist in a body moniteur 1793 nos 101 31 decembre 95 96 98 c nay it is said these infamous english with an attention rather to their own interests than to ours set fire to our storehouses arsenals warships in toulon harbour before weighing some score of brave warships the only ones we now had however it did not prosper though the flame spread far and high some two ships were burnt not more the very galleyslaves ran with buckets to quench these same proud ships ships lorient and the rest have to carry this same young man to egypt first not yet can they be changed to ashes or to seanymphs not yet to skyrockets o ship lorient nor became the prey of englandbefore their time  and so over france universally there is civic feast and hightide and toulon sees fusillading grapeshotting in mass as lyons saw and death is poured out in great floods vomie a grands flots and twelve thousand masons are requisitioned from the neighbouring country to raze toulon from the face of the earth for it is to be razed so reports barrere all but the national shipping establishments and to be called henceforth not toulon but port of the mountain

seemingly of a cabiric or even paphian character we heave under the veil which appropriately stretches itself along the pillars of the aislesnot to be lifted aside by the hand of history  but there is one thing we should like almost better to understand than any other what reason herself thought of it all the while what articulate words poor mrs momoro for example uttered when she had become ungoddessed again and the bibliopolist and she sat quiet at home at supper for he was an earnest man bookseller momoro and had notions of agrarian law mrs momoro it is admitted made one of the best goddesses of reason though her teeth were a little defective and now if the reader will represent to himself that such visible adoration of reason went on all over the republic through these november and december weeks till the church woodwork was burnt out and the business otherwise completed he will feel sufficiently what an adoring republic it was and without reluctance quit this part of the subject  such gifts of churchspoil are chiefly the work of the armee revolutionnaire raised as we said some time ago it is an army with portable guillotine commanded by playwright ronsin in terrible moustachioes and even by some uncertain shadow of usher maillard the old bastille hero leader of the menads september man in grey clerk vincent of the waroffice one of paches old clerks with a head heated by the ancient orators had a main hand in the appointments at least in the staffappointments  but of the marchings and retreatings of these six thousand no xenophon exists nothing but an inarticulate hum of cursing and sooty frenzy surviving dubious in the memory of ages they scour the country round paris seeking prisoners raising requisitions seeing that edicts are executed that the farmers have thrashed sufficiently lowering churchbells or metallic virgins detachments shoot forth dim towards remote parts of france nay new provincial revolutionary armies rise dim here and there

revolutionary and some men are a la hauteur on a level with the circumstances and others are not a la hauteurso much the worse for them but the anarchy we may say has organised itself society is literally overset its old forces working with mad activity but in the inverse order destructive and selfdestructive  curious to see how all still refers itself to some head and fountain not even an anarchy but must have a centre to revolve round it is now some six months since the committee of salut public came into existence some three months since danton proposed that all power should be given it and a sum of fifty millions and the government be declared revolutionary he himself since that day would take no hand in it though again and again solicited but sits private in his place on the

ramifications which however barrere holds the threads of such churchburning and scandalous masquerades of atheism fit to make the revolution odious where indeed could they originate but in the gold of

duchene worship skyblue reason in red nightcap rob all altarsand bring the spoil to us  still more indubitable visible to the mere bodily sight is this that the cordeliers club sits pale with anger and terror and has veiled the rights of manwithout effect likewise that the jacobins are in considerable confusion busy purging themselves sepurant as in times of plot and public calamity they have repeatedly had to do not even camille desmoulins but has given offence nay there have risen murmurs against danton himself though he bellowed them down and robespierre finished the matter by embracing him in the tribune  whom shall the republic and a jealous mother society trust in these times of temptation of preternatural insight for there are factions of the stranger de letranger factions of moderates of enraged all manner of factions we walk in a world of plots strings universally spread of deadly gins and falltraps baited by the gold of pitt clootz speaker of mankind socalled with his evidences of mahometan religion and babble of universal republic him an incorruptible robespierre has purged away baron clootz and paine rebellious needleman lie these two months in the luxembourg

be  but strangest of all camille desmoulins is purged out couthon gave as a test in regard to jacobin purgation the question what hast thou done to be hanged if counterrevolution should arrive yet camille who could so well answer this question is purged out the truth is camille early in december last began publishing a new journal or series of pamphlets entitled the vieux cordelier old cordelier camille not afraid at one time to embrace liberty on a heap of dead bodies begins to ask now whether among so many arresting and punishing committees there ought not to be a committee of mercy saintjust he observes is an extremely solemn young republican who carries his head as if it were a saintsacrement adorable hostie or divine realpresence sharply enough this old cordelier danton

wrenched up harmless and anew there is joy over a plot discovered the revolution then is verily devouring its own children all anarchy by the nature of it is not only destructive but selfdestructive    chapter 36ii  danton no weakness  danton meanwhile has been pressingly sent for from arcis he must return instantly cried camille cried phelippeaux and friends who scented danger in the wind danger

the deep mutual incompatibility that divided these two with what terror of feminine hatred the poor seagreen formula looked at the monstrous colossal reality and grew greener to behold himthe reality again struggling to think no ill of a chiefproduct of the revolution yet feeling at bottom that such chiefproduct was little other than a chief windbag blown large by popular air not a man with the

as the eastwind two such chiefproducts are too much for one revolution  friends trembling at the results of a quarrel on their part brought them to meet it is right said danton swallowing much indignation to repress the royalists but we should not strike except where it is useful to the republic we should not confound the innocent and the guiltyand who told you replied robespierre with a poisonous look that one innocent person had perishedquoi said danton turning round to friend paris selfnamed fabricius juryman in the revolutionary tribunal quoi not one innocent what sayest thou of it fabricius biographie de ministres para dantonfriends westermann this paris and others urged him to shew himself to ascend the tribune and act the man danton was not prone to shew himself to act or uproar for his own safety a man of careless large hoping nature a large nature that could rest he would sit whole hours they say hearing camille talk and liked nothing so well friends urged him to fly his wife urged him whither fly answered he if freed france cast me out there are only dungeons for me elsewhere one carries not his country with him at the sole of his shoe the man danton sat still

of the salut committee had told him dantons warrant was made out he is to be arrested this very night entreaties there are and trepidation of poor wife of paris and friends danton sat silent for a while then answered ils noseraient they dare not and would take no measures murmuring they dare not he goes to sleep as usual  and yet on the morrow morning strange rumour spreads over paris city

below to worldly righthonourableness the highest fact so devout novalis calls it in the rights of man camilles real age it would seem is thirtyfour danton is one year older  some five months ago the trial of the twentytwo girondins was the greatest that fouquier had then done but here is a still greater to do a thing which tasks the whole faculty of fouquier which makes the very heart of him waver for it is the voice of danton that reverberates now from these domes in passionate words piercing with their wild sincerity winged with wrath your best witnesses he shivers into ruin at one stroke he demands that the committeemen themselves come as witnesses as accusers he will cover them with ignominy he raises his huge stature he shakes his huge black head fire flashes from the eyes of himpiercing to all republican hearts so that the very galleries though we filled them by ticket murmur sympathy and are like to burst down and raise the people and deliver him he complains loudly that he is classed with chabots with swindling stockjobbers that his indictment is a list of platitudes and horrors danton hidden on the tenth of august reverberates he with the roar of a lion in the toils where are the men that had to press danton to shew himself that day where are these highgifted souls of whom he borrowed energy let them appear these accusers of mine i have all the clearness of my selfpossession when i demand them i will unmask the three shallow scoundrels les trois plats coquins saintjust couthon lebas who fawn on robespierre and lead him towards his destruction let them produce themselves here i will plunge them into nothingness out of which they ought never to have risen the agitated president agitates his bell enjoins calmness in a vehement manner what is it to thee how i defend myself cries the other the right of dooming me is thine always the voice of a man speaking for his honour and his life may well drown the jingling of thy bell thus danton higher and higher till the lion voice of him dies away in his throat speech will not utter what is in that man the galleries murmur ominously the first days session is over  o tinville president herman what will ye do they have two days more of it by strictest revolutionary law the galleries already murmur if this danton were to burst your meshworkvery curious indeed to consider it turns on a hair and what a hoitytoity were there justice and culprit changing places and the whole history of france running changed for in france there is this danton only that could still try to govern france he only the wild

better but worse and worse fouquier and herman distraction in their aspect rush over to salut public what is to be done salut public rapidly concocts a new decree whereby if men insult justice they

robespierre  thus then we perceive this confusedly electric erebuscloud of revolutionary government has altered its shape somewhat two masses or wings belonging to it an overelectric mass of cordelier rabids and an underelectric of dantonist moderates and clemencymenthese two masses shooting bolts at one another so to speak have annihilated one another for the erebuscloud as we often remark is of suicidal nature and in jagged irregularity darts its lightning withal into itself but now these two discrepant masses being mutually annihilated it is as if the erebuscloud had got to internal composure and did only pour its hellfire lightning on the world that lay under it in plain words terror of the guillotine was never terrible till now systole diastole swift and ever swifter goes the

immortality of the soul these consolatory principles the basis of rational republican religion are getting decreed and here on this blessed decadi by help of heaven and painter david is to be our first act of worship  see accordingly how after decree passed and what has been called the scraggiest prophetic discourse ever uttered by manmahomet robespierre in skyblue coat and black breeches frizzled and powdered to perfection bearing in his hand a bouquet of flowers and wheatears issues proudly from the convention hall convention following him yet as is remarked with an interval amphitheatre has been raised or at least monticule or elevation hideous statues of atheism anarchy and such like thanks to heaven and painter david strike abhorrence into the heart unluckily however our monticule is too small on the top of it not half of us can stand wherefore there arises indecent shoving nay treasonous irreverent growling peace thou bourdon de loise peace or it may be worse for

conspicuous man this robespierre he has his volunteer bodyguard of tappedurs let us say strikesharps fierce patriots with feruled sticks and jacobins kissing the hem of his garment he enjoys the admiration of many the worship of some and is well worth the wonder of one and all  the grand question and hope however is will not this feast of the tuileries mumbojumbo be a sign perhaps that the guillotine is to abate far enough from that precisely on the second day after it couthon one of the three shallow scoundrels gets himself lifted into the tribune produces a bundle of papers couthon proposes that as plots still abound the law of the suspect shall have extension and arrestment new vigour and facility further that as in such case business is like to be heavy our revolutionary tribunal too shall have extension be divided say into four tribunals each with its president each with its fouquier or substitute of fouquier all labouring at once and any remnant of shackle or dilatory formality be struck off in this way it may perhaps still overtake the work such is couthons decree of the twentysecond prairial famed in those times at hearing of which decree the very mountain gasped awestruck and one ruamps ventured to say that if it passed without adjournment and discussion he as one representative would blow his brains out vain saying the incorruptible knit his brows spoke a prophetic fateful word or two the law of prairial is law ruamps glad to leave his rash brains where they are death then and always death even so fouquier is enlarging his borders making

and the sublime continued harangues on it which billaud feared would become a bore to him robespierre has gone little to committee but held himself apart as if in a kind of pet nay they have made a report on that old catherine theot and her regenerative man spoken of by the prophets not in the best spirit this theot mystery they affect to regard as a plot but have evidently introduced a vein of satire of irreverent banter not against the spinster alone but obliquely against her regenerative man barreres light pen was perhaps at the bottom of it read through the solemn snuffling organs of old

tallien is home by recall long since from bourdeaux and in the most alarming position vain that he sounded louder even than ever the note of jacobinism to hide past shortcomings the jacobins purged him out two times has robespierre growled at him words of omen from the convention tribune and now his fair cabarus hit by denunciation lies arrested suspect in spite of all he could doshut in horrid

saintantoine towards their barrier du trone saintantoines tough bowels melt saintantoine surrounds the tumbrils says it shall not be o heavens why should it henriot and gendarmes scouring the streets that way bellow with waved sabres that it must quit hope ye poor doomed the tumbrils move on  but in this set of tumbrils there are two other things notable one notable person and one want of a notable person the notable person is lieutenantgeneral loiserolles a nobleman by birth and by nature laying down his life here for his son in the prison of saintlazare the night before last hurrying to the grate to hear the deathlist read he caught the name of his son the son was asleep at the moment i am loiserolles cried the old man at tinvilles bar an error in the christian name is little small objection was made the want of the notable person again is that of deputy paine paine has sat in the luxembourg since january and seemed forgotten but fouquier had pricked him at last the turnkey list in hand is marking with chalk the outer doors of tomorrows fournee paines outer door happened to be open turned back on the wall the turnkey marked it on the side next him and hurried on another turnkey came and shut it no chalkmark now visible the fournee went without paine paines life lay not there  our fifthact of this natural greek drama with its natural unities can only be painted in gross somewhat as that antique painter driven desperate did the foam for through this blessed july night there is clangour confusion very great of marching troops of sections going this way sections going that of missionary representatives reading proclamations by torchlight missionary legendre who has raised force somewhere emptying out the jacobins and flinging their key on the convention table i have locked their door it shall be virtue that reopens it paris we say is set against itself rushing confused as oceancurrents do a huge mahlstrom sounding there under cloud of night convention sits permanent on this hand municipality most permanent on that the poor prisoners hear tocsin and rumour strive to bethink them of the signals apparently of hope meek continual twilight streaming up which will be dawn and a tomorrow silvers the northern hem of night it wends and wends there that meek brightness like a silent prophecy along the great ringdial of the heaven so still eternal and on earth all is confused shadow and conflict dissidence tumultuous gloom and glare and destiny as yet shakes her doubtful urn  about three in the morning the dissident armedforces have met henriots armed force stood ranked in the place de greve and now barrass which he has recruited arrives there and they front each other cannon bristling against cannon citoyens cries the voice of discretion loudly enough before coming to bloodshed to endless civilwar hear the convention decree read robespierre and all rebels out of lawout of law there is terror in the sound unarmed citoyens disperse rapidly home municipal cannoneers range themselves on the convention side with shouting at which shout henriot descends from his upper room far gone in drink as some say finds his place de greve empty the cannons mouth turned towards him and on the wholethat it is now the catastrophe  stumbling in again the wretched drunksobered henriot announces all is lost miserable it is thou that

over the ankles he spake no word more in this world  and so at six in the morning a victorious convention adjourns report flies over paris as on golden wings penetrates the prisons irradiates the faces of those that were ready to perish turnkeys and moutons fallen from their high estate look mute and blue it is the 28th day of july called 10th of thermidor year 1794  fouquier had but to identify his prisoners being already out of law at four in the afternoon never before were the streets of paris seen so crowded from the palais de justice to the place de la revolution for thither again go the tumbrils this time it is one dense stirring mass all windows crammed the very roofs and ridgetiles budding forth human curiosity in strange gladness the deathtumbrils with their motley batch of outlaws some twentythree or so from maximilien to mayor fleuriot and simon the cordwainer roll on all eyes are on robespierres tumbril where he his jaw bound in dirty linen with his halfdead brother and halfdead henriot lie shattered their seventeen hours of agony about to end the gendarmes point their swords at him to shew the people which is he a woman springs on the tumbril clutching the side of it with one hand waving the other sibyllike and exclaims the death of thee gladdens my very heart menivre de joie robespierre opened his eyes scelerat go down to hell with the curses of all wives and mothersat the foot of the scaffold they stretched him on the ground till his turn came lifted aloft his eyes again opened caught the bloody axe samson wrenched the coat off him wrenched the dirty linen from his jaw the jaw fell powerless there burst from him a cryhideous to hear and see samson thou canst not be too quick  samsons work done there burst forth shout on shout of applause shout which prolongs itself not only over paris but over france but over europe and down to this generation deservedly and also undeservedly o unhappiest advocate of arras wert thou worse than other

may god be merciful to him and to us  this is end of the reign of terror new glorious revolution named of thermidor of thermidor 9th year 2 which being interpreted into old slavestyle means 27th of july 1794 terror is ended and death in the place de la revolution were the tail of robespierre once executed which service fouquier in large batches is swiftly managing     book 3vii  vendemiaire   chapter 37i  decadent  how little did any one suppose that here was the end not of robespierre only but of the revolution system itself least of all did the mutinying committeemen suppose it who had mutinied with no view whatever except to continue the national regeneration with their own heads on their shoulders and yet so it verily was the insignificant stone they had struck out so insignificant anywhere else proved to be the keystone the whole archwork and edifice of sansculottism began to loosen to crack to yawn and tumbled piecemeal with considerable rapidity plunge after plunge till the abyss had swallowed it all and in this upper world sansculottism was no more  for despicable as robespierre himself might be the death of robespierre was a signal at which great multitudes of men struck dumb with terror heretofore rose out of their hiding places and as it were saw one another how multitudinous they were and began speaking and complaining they are countable by the thousand and the million who have suffered cruel wrong ever louder rises the plaint of such a multitude into a universal sound into a universal continuous peal of what they call public opinion camille had demanded a committee of mercy and could not get it but now the whole nation resolves itself into a committee of mercy the nation has tried sansculottism and is weary of it force of public opinion what king or convention can withstand it you in vain struggle the thing that is rejected as calumnious today must pass as veracious with triumph another day gods and men have declared that sansculottism cannot be sansculottism on that ninth night of thermidor suicidally fractured its under jaw and lies writhing never to rise more  through the next fifteenth months it is what we may call the deathagony of sansculottism sansculottism anarchy of the jeanjacques evangel having now got deep enough is to perish in a new singular system of culottism and arrangement for arrangement is indispensable to man arrangement were it grounded only on that old primary evangel of force with sceptre in the shape of hammer be there method be there order cry all men were it that of the drillserjeant more tolerable is the drilled bayonetrank than that undrilled guillotine incalculable as the windhow sansculottism writhing in deaththroes strove some twice or even three times to get on its feet again but fell always and was flung resupine the next instant and finally breathed out the life of it and stirred no more this we are now from a due distance with due brevity to glance at and theno readercourage i see land  two of the first acts of the convention very natural for it after this thermidor are to be specified here the first is renewal of the governing committees both surete generale and salut public thinned by the guillotine need filling up we naturally fill them up with talliens frerons victorious thermidorian men still more to the purpose we appoint that they shall as law directs not in name only but in deed be renewed and changed from period to period a fourth part of them going out monthly the convention will no more lie under bondage of committees under terror of death but be a free convention free to follow its own judgment and the force of public opinion not less natural is it to enact that prisoners and persons under accusation shall have right to demand some writ of accusation and see clearly what they are accused of very natural acts the harbingers of hundreds not less so  for now fouquiers trade shackled by writ of accusation and legal proof is as good as gone effectual only against robespierres tail the prisons give up their suspects emit them faster and faster the committees see themselves besieged with prisoners friends complain that they are hindered in their work it is as with men rushing out of a crowded place and obstructing one another turned are the tables prisoners pouring out in floods jailors moutons and the tail of robespierre going now whither they were wont to sendthe hundred and thirtytwo nantese republicans whom we saw marching in irons have arrived shrunk to ninetyfour the fifth man of them choked by the road they arrive and suddenly find themselves not pleaders for life but denouncers to death their trial is for acquittal and more as the voice of a trumpet their testimony sounds far and wide mere atrocities of a reign of terror for a space of nineteen days with all solemnity and publicity representative carrier company of marat noyadings loire marriages things done in darkness come forth into light clear is the voice of these poor resuscitated nantese and journals and speech and universal committee of mercy reverberate it loud enough into all ears and hearts deputation arrives from arras denouncing the atrocities of representative lebon a tamed convention loves its own life yet what help representative lebon representative carrier must wend towards the revolutionary tribunal struggle and delay as we will the cry of a nation pursues them louder and louder them also tinville must abolishif indeed tinville himself be not abolished  we must note moreover the decrepit condition into which a once omnipotent mother society has fallen legendre flung her keys on the convention table that thermidor night her president was guillotined with robespierre the once mighty mother came some time after with a subdued countenance begging back her keys the keys were restored her but the strength could not be restored her the strength had departed forever alas ones day is done vain that the tribune in mid air sounds as of old to the general ear it has become a horror and even a weariness by and by affiliation is prohibited the mighty mother sees herself suddenly childless mourns as so hoarse a rachel may  the revolutionary committees without suspects to prey upon perish fast as it were of famine in paris the whole fortyeight of them are reduced to twelve their forty sous are abolished yet a little while and revolutionary committees are no more maximum will be abolished let sansculottism find food where it can 24th december 1794 moniteur no 97 neither is there now any

convention and out of it the compressed mountain shrinks silent more and more moderatism rises louder and louder not as a tempest with threatenings say rather as the rushing of a mighty organblast and melodious deafening force of public opinion from the twentyfive million windpipes of a nation all in committee of mercy which how shall any detached body of individuals withstand    chapter 37ii  la cabarus  how above all shall a poor national convention withstand it in this poor national convention broken bewildered by long terror perturbations and guillotinement there is no pilot there is not now even a danton who could undertake to steer you anywhither in such press of weather the utmost a bewildered convention can do is to veer and trim and try to keep itself steady and rush undrowned before the wind needless to struggle to fling helm alee and make bout ship a bewildered convention sails not in the teeth of the wind but is rapidly blown round again so strong is the wind we say and so changed blowing fresher and fresher as from the sweet southwest your devastating northeasters and wild tornadogusts of terror blown utterly out all sansculottic things are passing away all things are becoming culottic  do but look at the cut of clothes that light visible result significant of a thousand things which are not so visible in winter 1793 men went in red nightcaps municipals themselves in sabots the very citoyennes had to petition against such headgear but now in this winter 1794 where is the red nightcap with the thing beyond the flood your monied citoyen ponders in what elegantest style he shall dress himself whether he shall not even dress himself as the free peoples of antiquity the more adventurous citoyenne has already done it behold her that beautiful adventurous citoyenne in costume of the ancient greeks such greek as painter david could teach her sweeping tresses snooded by glittering antique fillet brighteyed tunic of the greek women her little

junior but does not barras know him will not barras speak a word for him yesif at any time it will serve barras so to do somewhat forlorn of fortune for the present stands that artilleryofficer looks

nevertheless it would seem at the kind glance of josephine beauharnais and for the rest with severe countenance with open eyes and closed lips waits what will betide  that the balls therefore have a new figure this winter we can see not carmagnoles rude whirlblasts of rags as mercier called them precursors of storm and destruction no soft ionic motions fit for the light sandal and antique grecian tunic efflorescence of luxury has come out for men have wealth nay newgot wealth and under the terror you durst not dance except in rags among the innumerable kinds of balls let the hasty reader mark only this single one the kind they call victim balls bals a victime the dancers in choice costume have all crape round the left arm to be admitted it needs that you be a victime that you have lost a relative under the terror peace to the dead let us dance to their memory for in all ways one must dance  it is very remarkable according to mercier under what varieties of figure this great business of dancing goes on the women says he are nymphs sultanas sometimes minervas junos even dianas in lightunerring gyrations they swim there with such earnestness of purpose with perfect silence so absorbed are they what is singular continues he the onlookers are as it were mingled with the dancers form as it were a circumambient element round the different contredances yet without deranging them it is rare in fact that a sultana in such circumstances experience the smallest collision her pretty foot darts down an inch from mine she is off again she is as a flash of light but soon the

sat under the moon had such a series of destinies as this national convention of france it came together to make the constitution and instead of that it has had to make nothing but destruction and confusion to burn up catholicisms aristocratisms to worship reason and dig saltpetre to fight titanically with itself and with the whole world a convention decimated by the guillotine above the tenth man has bowed his neck to the axe which has seen carmagnoles danced before it and patriotic strophes sung amid churchspoils the wounded of the tenth of august defile in handbarrows and in the

not heard the chimes at midnight it has deliberated beset by a hundred thousand armed men with artilleryfurnaces and provisioncarts it has been betocsined bestormed overflooded by black deluges of sansculottism and has heard the shrill cry bread and soap for as we say its the nucleus of chaos it sat as the centre of sansculottism and had spread its pavilion on the waste deep where is neither path nor landmark neither bottom nor shore in intrinsic valour ingenuity fidelity and general force and manhood it has perhaps not far surpassed the average of parliaments but in frankness of purpose in singularity of position it seeks its fellow one other sansculottic submersion or at most two and this wearied vessel of a convention reaches land  revolt of germinal twelfth ended as a vain cry

itself into a pyrrhic into a dance of cabarus balls sansculottism is dead extinguished by new isms of that kind which were its own natural progeny and is buried we may say with such deafening jubilation and disharmony of funeralknell on their part that only after some half century or so does one begin to learn clearly why it ever was alive  and yet a meaning lay in it sansculottism verily was alive a newbirth of time nay it still lives and is not dead but changed the soul of it still lives still works far and wide through one bodily shape into another less amorphous as is the way of cunning time with his newbirthstill in some perfected shape it embrace the whole circuit of the world for the wise man may now everywhere discern that he must found on his manhood not on the garnitures of his manhood he who in these epochs of our europe founds on garnitures formulas culottisms of what sort soever is founding on old cloth and sheepskin and cannot endure but as for the body of sansculottism that is dead and buriedand one hopes need not reappear in primary amorphous shape for another thousand years  it was the frightfullest thing ever borne of time one of the

this for a creature with a soul in it some assuagement or the cruellest wretchedness of all  such things were such things are and they go on in silence peaceably and sansculottisms follow them history looking back over this france through long times back to turgots time for instance when dumb drudgery staggered up to its kings palace and in wide expanse of sallow faces squalor and winged raggedness presented hieroglyphically its petition of grievances and for answer got hanged on a new gallows forty feet highconfesses mournfully that there is no period to be met with in which the general twentyfive millions of france suffered less than in this period which they name reign of terror but it was not the dumb millions that suffered here it was the speaking thousands and hundreds and units who shrieked and published and made the world ring with their wail as they could and should that is the grand peculiarity the frightfullest births of time are never the loudspeaking ones for these soon die they are the silent ones which can live from century to century anarchy hateful as death is abhorrent to the whole nature of man and must itself soon die  wherefore let all men know what of depth and of height is still revealed in man and with fear and wonder with just sympathy and just antipathy with clear eye and open heart contemplate it and appropriate it and draw innumerable inferences from it this inference for example among the first that if the gods of this lower world will sit on their glittering thrones indolent as epicurus gods with the living chaos of ignorance and hunger weltering uncared for at their feet and smooth parasites preaching peace peace when there is no peace then the dark chaos it would seem will rise has risen and o heavens has it not tanned their

and now by a natural course we arrive at aristocracy of the moneybag it is the course through which all european societies are at this hour travelling apparently a still baser sort of aristocracy an infinitely baser the basest yet known  in which however there is this advantage that like anarchy itself it cannot continue hast thou considered how thought is stronger than artilleryparks and were it

having come for this france what can anarchy do more let there be order were it under the soldiers sword let there be peace that the bounty of the heavens be not spilt that what of wisdom they do send us bring fruit in its seasonit remains to be seen how the quellers of sansculottism were themselves quelled and sacred right of insurrection was blown away by gunpowder wherewith this singular eventful history called french revolution ends  the convention driven such a course by wild wind wild tide and steerage and nonsteerage these three years has become weary of its own existence sees all men weary of it and wishes heartily to finish to the last it has to strive with contradictions it is now getting fast ready with a constitution yet knows no peace sieyes we say is making the

chambers council of ancients as well as council of five hundred to that conclusion have we come in a like spirit eschewing that fatal selfdenying ordinance of your old constituents we enact not only that actual convention members are reeligible but that twothirds of them must be reelected the active citizen electors shall for this time have free choice of only onethird of their national assembly such enactment of twothirds to be reelected we append to our constitution we submit our constitution to the townships of france and say accept both or reject both unsavoury as this appendix may be the townships by overwhelming majority accept and ratify with directory of five with two good chambers doublemajority of them nominated by ourselves one hopes this constitution may prove final march it will for the legs of it the reelected twothirds are already there able to march sieyes looks at his paper fabric with just pride  but now see how the contumacious sections lepelletier foremost kick

yourselvesfor the truth is victory over saintantoine and long right of insurrection has spoiled these men nay spoiled all men consider too how each man was free to hope what he liked and now there is

in resistance to oppression deux amis xiii 375406 the sections join it nearly all strong with their forty thousand fighting men the convention therefore may look to itself lepelletier on this 12th day of vendemiaire 4th of october 1795 is sitting in open contravention in its convent of filles saintthomas rue vivienne with guns primed the convention has some five thousand regular troops at hand generals in abundance and a fifteen hundred of miscellaneous persecuted ultrajacobins whom in this crisis it has hastily got together and armed under the title patriots of eightynine strong in law it sends its general menou to disarm lepelletier  general menou marches accordingly with due summons and demonstration with no result general menou about eight in the evening finds that he is standing ranked in the rue vivienne emitting vain summonses with primed guns pointed out of every window at him and that he cannot disarm lepelletier he has to return with whole skin but without success and be thrown into arrest as a traitor whereupon the whole forty thousand join this lepelletier which cannot be vanquished to what hand shall a quaking convention now turn our poor convention after such voyaging just entering harbour so to speak has struck on the barand labours there frightfully with breakers roaring round it forty thousand of them like to wash it and its sieyes cargo and the whole
