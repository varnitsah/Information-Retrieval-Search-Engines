31560342	the evolution of theology an anthropological study  essay 8 from science and hebrew tradition   by thomas henry huxley    i conceive that the origin the growth the decline and the fall of those speculations respecting the existence the powers and the dispositions of beings analogous to men but more or less devoid of corporeal qualities which may be broadly included under the head of theology are phenomena the study of which legitimately falls within the province of the anthropologist and it is purely as a question of anthropology a department of biology to which at various times i have given a good deal of attention that i propose to treat of the evolution of theology in the following pages  with theology as a code of dogmas which are to be believed or at any rate repeated under penalty of present or future punishment or as a storehouse of anaesthetics for those who find the pains of life too hard to bear i have nothing to do and so far as it may be possible i shall avoid the expression of any opinion as to the objective truth or falsehood of the systems of theological speculation of which i may find occasion to speak from my present point of view theology is regarded as a natural product of the operations of the human mind under the conditions of its existence just as any other branch of science or the arts of architecture or music or painting are such products like them theology has a history like them also it is to be met with in certain simple and rudimentary forms and these can be connected by a multitude of gradations which exist or have existed among people of various ages and races with the most highly developed theologies of past and present times it is not my object to interfere even in the slightest degree with beliefs which anybody holds sacred or to alter the conviction of any one who is of opinion that in dealing with theology we ought to be guided by considerations different from those which would be thought appropriate if the problem lay in the province of chemistry or of mineralogy and if people of these ways of thinking choose to read beyond the present paragraph the responsibility for meeting with anything they may dislike rests with them and not with me  we are all likely to be more familiar with the theological history of the israelites than with that of any other nation we may therefore fitly make it the first object of our studies and it will be convenient to commence with that period which lies between the invasion of canaan and the early days of the monarchy and answers to the eleventh and twelfth centuries bc or thereabouts the evidence on which any conclusion as to the nature of israelitic theology in those days must be based is wholly contained in the hebrew scripturesan agglomeration of documents which certainly belong to very different ages but of the exact dates and authorship of any one of which except perhaps a few of the prophetical writings there is no evidence either internal or external so far as i can discover of such a nature as to justify more than a confession of ignorance or at most an approximate conclusion in this venerable record of ancient life miscalled a book when it is really a library comparable to a selection of works from english literature between the times of beda and those of milton we have the stratified deposits often confused and even with their natural order inverted left by the stream of the intellectual and moral life of israel during many centuries and embedded in these strata there are numerous remains of forms of thought which once lived and which though often unfortunately mere fragments are of priceless value to the anthropologist our task is to rescue these from their relatively unimportant surroundings and by careful comparison with existing forms of theology to make the dead world which they record live again in other words our problem is palaeontological and the method pursued must be the same as that employed in dealing with other fossil remains  among the richest of the fossiliferous strata to which i have alluded are the books of judges and samuel 1 it has often been observed that these writings stand out in marked relief from those which precede and follow them in virtue of a certain archaic freshness and of a greater freedom from traces of late interpolation and editorial trimming jephthah gideon and samson are men of old heroic stamp who would look as much in place in a norse saga as where they are and if the varnishbrush of later respectability has passed over these memoirs of the mighty men of a wild age here and there it has not succeeded in effacing or even in seriously obscuring the essential characteristics of the theology traditionally ascribed to their epoch  there is nothing that i have met with in the results of biblical criticism inconsistent with the conviction that these books give us a fairly trustworthy account of israelitic life and thought in the times which they cover and as such apart from the great literary merit of many of their episodes they possess the interest of being perhaps the oldest genuine history as apart from mere chronicles on the one hand and mere legends on the other at present accessible to us  but it is often said with exultation by writers of one party and often admitted more or less unwillingly by their opponents that these books are untrustworthy by reason of being full of obviously unhistoric tales and as a notable example the narrative of sauls visit to the socalled witch of endor is often cited as i have already intimated i have nothing to do with theological partisanship either heterodox or orthodox nor for my present purpose does it matter very much whether the story is historically true or whether it merely shows what the writer believed but looking at the matter solely from the point of view of an anthropologist i beg leave to express the opinion that the account of sauls necromantic expedition is quite consistent with probability that is to say i see no reason whatever to doubt firstly that saul made such a visit and secondly that he and all who were present including the wise woman of endor herself would have given with entire sincerity very much the same account of the business as that which we now read in the twentyeighth chapter of the first book of samuel and i am further of opinion that this story is one of the most important of those fossils to which i have referred in the material which it offers for the reconstruction of the theology of the time let us therefore study it attentivelynot merely as a narrative which in the dramatic force of its gruesome simplicity is not surpassed if it is equalled by the witch scenes in macbethbut as a piece of evidence bearing on an important anthropological problem  we are told 1 sam xxviii that saul encamped at gilboa became alarmed by the strength of the philistine army gathered at shunem he therefore inquired of jahveh but jahveh answered him not neither by dreams nor by urim nor by prophets 2 thus deserted by jahveh saul in his extremity bethought him of those that had familiar spirits and the wizards whom he is said at some previous time to have put out of the land but who seem nevertheless to have been very imperfectly banished since sauls servants in answer to his command to seek him a woman that hath a familiar spirit reply without a sign of hesitation or of fear behold there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at endor just as in some parts of england a countryman might tell any one who did not look like a magistrate or a policeman where a wise woman was to be met with saul goes to this woman who after being assured of immunity asks whom shall i bring up to thee whereupon saul says bring me up samuel the woman immediately sees an apparition but to saul nothing is visible for he asks what seest thou and the woman replies i see elohim coming up out of the earth still the spectre remains invisible to saul for he asks what form is he of and she replies an old man cometh up and he is covered with a robe so far therefore the wise woman unquestionably plays the part of a medium and saul is dependent upon her version of what happens  the account continues     and saul perceived that it was samuel and he bowed with    his face to the ground and did obeisance and samuel said to    saul why hast thou disquieted me to bring me up and saul    answered i am sore distressed for the philistines make war    against me and elohim is departed from me and answereth me no    more neither by prophets nor by dreams therefore i have called    thee that thou mayest make known unto me what i shall do    and samuel said wherefore then dost thou ask of me seeing that    jahveh is departed from thee and is become thine adversary    and jahveh hath wrought for himself as he spake by me and    jahveh hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand and given it to    thy neighbour even to david because thou obeyedst not the    voice of jahveh and didst not execute his fierce wrath upon    amalek therefore hath jahveh done this thing unto thee this    day moreover jahveh will deliver israel also with thee into    the hands of the philistines and tomorrow shalt thou and thy    sons be with me jahveh shall deliver the host of israel also    into the hand of the philistines then saul fell straightway his    full length upon the earth and was sore afraid because of the    words of samuel v 1420  the statement that saul perceived that it was samuel is not to be taken to imply that even now saul actually saw the shade of the prophet but only that the womans allusion to the prophetic mantle and to the aged appearance of the spectre convinced him that it was samuel reuss 3 in fact translates the passage alors saul reconnut que cetait samuel nor does the dialogue between saul and samuel necessarily or probably signify that samuel spoke otherwise than by the voice of the wise woman the septuagint does not hesitate to call her greek that is to say a ventriloquist implying that it was she who spokeand this view of the matter is in harmony with the fact that the exact sense of the hebrew words which are translated as a woman that hath a familiar spirit is a woman mistress of ob ob means primitively a leather bottle such as a wine skin and is applied alike to the necromancer and to the spirit evoked its use in these senses appears to have been suggested by the likeness of the hollow sound emitted by a halfempty skin when struck to the sepulchral tones in which the oracles of the evoked spirits were uttered by the medium it is most probable that in accordance with the general theory of spiritual influences which obtained among the old israelites the spirit of samuel was conceived to pass into the body of the wise woman and to use her vocal organs to speak in his own namefor i cannot discover that they drew any clear distinction between possession and inspiration 4  if the story of sauls consultation of the occult powers is to be regarded as an authentic narrative or at any rate as a statement which is perfectly veracious so far as the intention of the narrator goesand as i have said i see no reason for refusing it this characterit will be found on further consideration to throw a flood of light both directly and indirectly on the theology of sauls countrymenthat is to say upon their beliefs respecting the nature and ways of spiritual beings  even without the confirmation of other abundant evidences to the same effect it leaves no doubt as to the existence among them of the fundamental doctrine that man consists of a body and of a spirit which last after the death of the body continues to exist as a ghost at the time of sauls visit to endor samuel was dead and buried but that his spirit would be believed to continue to exist in sheol may be concluded from the wellknown passage in the song attributed to hannah his mother       jahveh killeth and maketh alive      he bringeth down to sheol and bringeth up                                   1 sam ii 6  and it is obvious that this sheol was thought to be a place underground in which samuels spirit had been disturbed by the necromancers summons and in which after his return thither he would be joined by the spirits of saul and his sons when they had met with their bodily death on the hill of gilboa it is further to be observed that the spirit or ghost of the dead man presents itself as the image of the man himselfit is the man not merely in his ordinary corporeal presentment even down to the prophets mantle but in his moral and intellectual characteristics samuel who had begun as sauls friend and ended as his bitter enemy gives it to be understood that he is annoyed at sauls presumption in disturbing him and that in sheol he is as much the devoted servant of jahveh and as much empowered to speak in jahvehs name as he was during his sojourn in the upper air  it appears now to be universally admitted that before the exile the israelites had no belief in rewards and punishments after death nor in anything similar to the christian heaven and hell but our story proves that it would be an error to suppose that they did not believe in the continuance of individual existence after death by a ghostly simulacrum of life nay i think it would be very hard to produce conclusive evidence that they disbelieved in immortality for i am not aware that there is anything to show that they thought the existence of the souls of the dead in sheol ever came to an end but they do not seem to have conceived that the condition of the souls in sheol was in any way affected by their conduct in life if there was immortality there was no state of retribution in their theology samuel expects saul and his sons to come to him in sheol  the next circumstance to be remarked is that the name of elohim is applied to the spirit which the woman sees coming up out of the earth that is to say from sheol the authorised version translates this in its literal sense gods the revised version gives god with gods in the margin reuss renders the word by spectre remarking in a note that it is not quite exact but that the word elohim expresses something divine that is to say superhuman commanding respect and terror histoire des israelites p 321 tuch in his commentary on genesis and thenius in his commentary on samuel express substantially the same opinion dr alexander in kittos cyclopaedia s v god has the following instructive remarks     elohim is sometimes used vaguely to describe unseen    powers or superhuman beings that are not properly thought of as    divine thus the witch of endor saw elohim ascending out of the    earth 1 sam xxviii 13 meaning thereby some beings of an    unearthly superhuman character so also in zechariah xii 8 it    is said the house of david shall be as elohim as the angel of    the lord where as the transition from elohim to the angel of    the lord is a minori ad majus we must regard the former as a    vague designation of supernatural powers  dr alexander speaks here of beings but there is no reason to suppose that the wise woman of endor referred to anything but a solitary spectre and it is quite clear that saul understood her in this sense for he asks what form is he of  this fact that the name of elohim is applied to a ghost or disembodied soul conceived as the image of the body in which it once dwelt is of no little importance for it is well known that the same term was employed to denote the gods of the heathen who were thought to have definite quasicorporeal forms and to be as much real entities as any other elohim 5 the difference which was supposed to exist between the different elohim was one of degree not one of kind elohim was in logical terminology the genus of which ghosts chemosh dagon baal and jahveh were species the israelite believed jahveh to be immeasurably superior to all other kinds of elohim the inscription on the moabite stone shows that king mesa held chemosh to be as unquestionably the superior of jahveh but if jahveh was thus supposed to differ only in degree from the undoubtedly zoomorphic or anthropomorphic gods of the nations why is it to be assumed that he also was not thought of as having a human shape it is possible for those who forget that the time of the great prophetic writers is at least as remote from that of saul as our day is from that of queen elizabeth to insist upon interpreting the gross notions current in the earlier age and among the mass of the people by the refined conceptions promulgated by a few select spirits centuries later but if we take the language constantly used concerning the deity in the books of genesis exodus joshua judges samuel or kings in its natural sense and i am aware of no valid reason which can be given for taking it in any other sense there cannot to my mind be a doubt that jahveh was conceived by those from whom the substance of these books is mainly derived to possess the appearance and the intellectual and moral attributes of a man and indeed of a man of just that type with which the israelites were familiar in their stronger and intellectually abler rulers and leaders in a wellknown passage in genesis i 27 elohim is said to have created man in his own image in the image of elohim created he him it is man who is here said to be the image of elohimnot mans soul alone still less his reason but the whole man it is obvious that for those who call a manlike ghost elohim there could be no difficulty in conceiving any other elohim under the same aspect and if there could be any doubt on this subject surely it cannot stand in the face of what we find in the fifth chapter where immediately after a repetition of the statement that elohim created man in the likeness of elohim made he him it is said that adam begat seth in his own likeness after his image does this mean that seth resembled adam only in a spiritual and figurative sense and if that interpretation of the third verse of the fifth chapter of genesis is absurd why does it become reasonable in the first verse of the same chapter  but let us go further is not the jahveh who walks in the garden in the cool of the day from whom one may hope to hide oneself among the trees of whom it is expressly said that moses and aaron nadab and abihu and seventy of the elders of israel saw the elohim of israel exod xxiv 911 and that although the seeing jahveh was understood to be a high crime and misdemeanour worthy of death under ordinary circumstances yet for this once he laid not his hand on the nobles of israel that they beheld elohim and did eat and drink and that afterwards moses saw his back exod xxxiii 23is not this deity conceived as manlike in form again is not the jahveh who eats with abraham under the oaks at mamre who is pleased with the sweet savour of noahs sacrifice to whom sacrifices are said to be food 6is not this deity depicted as possessed of human appetites if this were not the current israelitish idea of jahveh even in the eighth century bc where is the point of isaiahs scathing admonitions to his countrymen to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me saith jahveh i am full of the burntofferings of rams and the fat of fed beasts and i delight not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of hegoats isa i 11 or of micahs inquiry will jahveh be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of oil vi 7 and in the innumerable passages in which jahveh is said to be jealous of other gods to be angry to be appeased and to repent in which he is represented as casting off saul because the king does not quite literally execute a command of the most ruthless severity or as smiting uzzah to death because the unfortunate man thoughtlessly but naturally enough put out his hand to stay the ark from fallingcan any one deny that the old israelites conceived jahveh not only in the image of a man but in that of a changeable irritable and occasionally violent man there appears to me then to be no reason to doubt that the notion of likeness to man which was indubitably held of the ghost elohim was carried out consistently throughout the whole series of elohim and that jahvehelohim was thought of as a being of the same substantially human nature as the rest only immeasurably more powerful for good and for evil  the absence of any real distinction between the elohim of different ranks is further clearly illustrated by the corresponding absence of any sharp delimitation between the various kinds of people who serve as the media of communication between them and men the agents through whom the lower elohim are consulted are called necromancers wizards and diviners and are looked down upon by the prophets and priests of the higher elohim but the seer 7 connects the two and they are all alike in their essential characters of media the wise woman of endor was believed by others and i have little doubt believed herself to be able to bring up whom she would from sheol and to be inspired whether in virtue of actual possession by the evoked elohim or otherwise with a knowledge of hidden things i am unable to see that sauls servant took any really different view of samuels powers though he may have believed that he obtained them by the grace of the higher elohim for when saul fails to find his fathers asses his servant says to him     behold there is in this city a man of elohim and he is a man    that is held in honour all that he saith cometh surely to pass    now let us go thither peradventure he can tell us concerning    our journey whereon we go then said saul to his servant but    behold if we go what shall we bring the man for the bread is    spent in our vessels and there is not a present to bring to the    man of elohim what have we and the servant answered saul again    and said behold i have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel    of silver that will i give to the man of elohim to tell us our    way beforetime in israel when a man went to inquire of elohim    then he said come and let us go to the seer for he that is now    called a prophet was beforetime called a seer 8    1 sam ix 610  in fact when shortly afterwards saul accidentally meets samuel he says tell me i pray thee where the seers house is samuel answers i am the seer immediately afterwards samuel informs saul that the asses are found though how he obtained his knowledge of the fact is not stated it will be observed that samuel is not spoken of here as in any special sense a seer or prophet of jahveh but as a man of elohimthat is to say a seer having access to the spiritual powers just as the wise woman of endor might have been said to be a woman of elohimand the narrators or editors explanatory note seems to indicate that prophet is merely a name introduced later than the time of samuel for a superior kind of seer or man of elohim 9  another very instructive passage shows that samuel was not only considered to be diviner seer and prophet in one but that he was also to all intents and purposes priest of jahvehthough according to his biographer he was not a member of the tribe of levi at the outset of their acquaintance samuel says to saul go up before me into the high place where as the young maidens of the city had just before told saul the seer was going for the people will not eat till he come because he doth bless the sacrifice 1 sam x 12 the use of the word bless hereas if samuel were not going to sacrifice but only to offer a blessing or thanksgivingis curious but that samuel really acted as priest seems plain from what follows for he not only asks saul to share in the customary sacrificial feast but he disposes in sauls favour of that portion of the victim which the levitical legislation doubtless embodying old customs recognises as the priests special property 10  although particular persons adopted the profession of media between men and elohim there was no limitation of the power in the view of ancient israel to any special class of the population saul inquires of jahveh and builds him altars on his own account and in the very remarkable story told in the fourteenth chapter of the first book of samuel v 3746 saul appears to conduct the whole process of divination although he has a priest at his elbow david seems to do the same  moreover elohim constantly appear in dreamswhich in old israel did not mean that as we should say the subject of the appearance dreamed he saw the spirit but that he veritably saw the elohim which as a soul visited his soul while his body was asleep and in the course of the history of israel jahveh himself thus appears to all sorts of persons nonisraelites as well as israelites again the elohim possess or inspire people against their will as in the case of saul and sauls messengers and then these people prophesythat is to say raveand exhibit the ungoverned gestures attributed by a later age to possession by malignant spirits apart from other evidence to be adduced by and by the history of ancient demonology and of modern revivalism does not permit me to doubt that the accounts of these phenomena given in the history of saul may be perfectly historical  in the ritual practices of which evidence is to be found in the books of judges and samuel the chief part is played by sacrifices usually burnt offerings whenever the aid of the elohim of israel is sought or thanks are considered due to him an altar is built and oxen sheep and goats are slaughtered and offered up sometimes the entire victim is burnt as a holocaust more frequently only certain parts notably the fat about the kidneys are burnt on the altar the rest is properly cooked and after the reservation of a part for the priest is made the foundation of a joyous banquet in which the sacrificer his family and such guests as he thinks fit to invite participate 11 elohim was supposed to share in the feast and it has been already shown that that which was set apart on the altar or consumed by fire was spoken of as the food of elohim who was thought to be influenced by the costliness or by the pleasant smell of the sacrifice in favour of the sacrificer  all this bears out the view that in the mind of the old israelite there was no difference save one of degree between one elohim and another it is true that there is but little direct evidence to show that the old israelites shared the widespread belief of their own and indeed of all times that the spirits of the dead not only continue to exist but are capable of a ghostly kind of feeding and are grateful for such aliment as can be assimilated by their attenuated substance and even for clothes ornaments and weapons 12 that they were familiar with this doctrine in the time of the captivity is suggested by the wellknown reference of ezekiel xxxii 27 to the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised which are gone down to sheol hell with their weapons of war and have laid their swords under their heads perhaps there is a still earlier allusion in the giving of food for the dead spoken of in deuteronomy xxvi 14 13  it must be remembered that the literature of the old israelites as it lies before us has been subjected to the revisal of strictly monotheistic editors violently opposed to all kinds of idolatry who are not likely to have selected from the materials at their disposal any obvious evidence either of the practice under discussion or of that ancestorworship which is so closely related to it for preservation in the permanent records of their people  the mysterious objects known as teraphim which are occasionally mentioned in judges samuel and elsewhere however can hardly be interpreted otherwise than as indications of the existence both of ancestorworship and of imageworship in old israel the teraphim were certainly images of family gods and as such in all probability represented deceased ancestors laban indignantly demands of his soninlaw wherefore hast thou stolen my elohim which rachel who must be assumed to have worshipped jacobs god jahveh had carried off obviously because she like her father believed in their divinity it is not suggested that jacob was in any way scandalised by the idolatrous practices of his favourite wife whatever he may have thought of her honesty when the truth came to light for the teraphim seem to have remained in his camp at least until he hid his strange gods under the oak that was by shechem gen xxxv 4 and indeed it is open to question if he got rid of them then for the subsequent history of israel renders it more than doubtful whether the teraphim were regarded as strange gods even as late as the eighth century bc  the writer of the books of samuel takes it quite as a matter of course that michal daughter of one royal jahveh worshipper and wife of the servant of jahveh par excellence the pious david should have her teraphim handy in her and davids chamber when she dresses them up in their bed into a simulation of her husband for the purpose of deceiving her fathers messengers even one of the early prophets hosea when he threatens that the children of israel shall abide many days without ephod or teraphim iii 4 appears to regard both as equally proper appurtenances of the suspended worship of jahveh and equally certain to be restored when that is resumed when we further take into consideration that only in the reign of hezekiah was the brazen serpent preserved in the temple and believed to be the work of moses destroyed and the practice of offering incense to it that is worshipping it abolishedthat jeroboam could set up calves of gold for israel to worship with apparently none but a political object and certainly with no notion of creating a schism among the worshippers of jahveh or of repelling the men of judah from his standardit seems obvious either that the israelites of the tenth and eleventh centuries bc knew not the second commandment or that they construed it merely as part of the prohibition to worship any supreme god other than jahveh which precedes it  in seeking for information about the teraphim i lighted upon the following passage in the valuable article on that subject by archdeacon farrar in rittos cyclopaedia of biblical literature which is so much to the purpose of my argument that i venture to quote it in full     the main and certain results of this review are that the    teraphim were rude human images that the use of them was an    antique aramaic custom that there is reason to suppose them to    have been images of deceased ancestors that they were consulted    oracularly that they were not confined to jews that their use    continued down to the latest period of jewish history    and lastly that although the enlightened prophets and strictest    later kings regarded them as idolatrous the priests were much    less averse to such images and their cult was not considered in    any way repugnant to the pious worship of elohim nay even to    the worship of him under the awful title of jehovah in fact    they involved a monotheistic idolatry very different indeed    from polytheism and the tolerance of them by priests as    compared with the denunciation of them by the prophets offers a    close analogy to the views of the roman catholics respecting    pictures and images as compared with the views of protestants    it was against this use of idolatrous symbols and emblems in a    monotheistic worship that the second commandment was    directed whereas the first is aimed against the graver sin of    direct polytheism but the whole history of israel shows how    utterly and how early the law must have fallen into desuetude    the worship of the golden calf and of the calves at dan and    bethel against which so far as we know neither elijah nor    elisha said a single word the tolerance of high places    teraphim and betylia the offering of incense for centuries to    the brazen serpent destroyed by hezekiah the occasional    glimpses of the most startling irregularities sanctioned    apparently even in the temple worship itself prove most    decisively that a pure monotheism and an independence of symbols    was the result of a slow and painful course of gods disciplinal    dealings among the noblest thinkers of a single nation and not    as is so constantly and erroneously urged the instinct of the    whole semitic race in other words one single branch of the    semites was under gods providence educated into pure    monotheism only by centuries of misfortune and series of    inspired men vol iii p 986  it appears to me that the researches of the anthropologist lead him to conclusions identical in substance if not in terms with those here enunciated as the result of a careful study of the same subject from a totally different point of view  there is abundant evidence in the books of samuel and elsewhere that an article of dress termed an ephod was supposed to have a peculiar efficacy in enabling the wearer to exercise divination by means of jahvehelohim great and long continued have been the disputes as to the exact nature of the ephodwhether it always means something to wear or whether it sometimes means an image but the probabilities are that it usually signifies a kind of waistcoat or broad zone with shoulderstraps which the person who inquired of jahveh put on in 1 samuel xxiii 2 david appears to have inquired without an ephod for abiathar the priest is said to have come down with an ephod in his hand only subsequently and then david asks for it before inquiring of jahveh whether the men of keilah would betray him or not davids action is obviously divination pure and simple and it is curious that he seems to have worn the ephod himself and not to have employed abiathar as a medium how the answer was given is not clear though the probability is that it was obtained by casting lots the urim and thummim seem to have been two such lots of a peculiarly sacred character which were carried in the pocket of the high priests breastplate this last was worn along with the ephod  with the exception of one passage 1 sam xiv 18 the ark is ignored in the history of saul but in this place the septuagint reads ephod for ark while in 1 chronicles xiii 3 david says that we sought not unto it the ark in the days of saul nor does samuel seem to have paid any regard to the ark after its return from philistia though in his childhood he is said to have slept in the temple of jahveh where the ark of elohim was 1 sam iii 3 at shiloh and there to have been the seer of the earliest apparitions vouchsafed to him by jahveh the space between the cherubim or winged images on the canopy or cover kapporeth of this holy chest was held to be the special seat of jahvehthe place selected for a temporary residence of the supreme elohim who had after aaron and phineas eli and his sons for priests and seers and when the ark was carried to the camp at ebenezer there can be no doubt that the israelites no less than the philistines held that elohim is come into the camp iv 7 and that the one as much as the other conceived that the israelites had summoned to their aid a powerful ally in these or this mighty elohimelsewhere called jahvesabaoth the jahveh of hosts if the temple at shiloh was the pentateuchal tabernacle as is suggested by the name of tent of meeting given to it in 1 samuel ii 22 it was essentially a large tent though constituted of very expensive and ornate materials if on the other hand it was a different edifice there can be little doubt that this house of jahveh was built on the model of an ordinary house of the time but there is not the slightest evidence that during the reign of saul any greater importance attached to this seat of the cult of jahveh than to others sanctuaries and high places for sacrifice were scattered all over the country from dan to beersheba and as samuel is said to have gone up to one of these high places to bless the sacrifice it may be taken for tolerably certain that he knew nothing of the levitical laws which severely condemn the high places and those who sacrifice away from the sanctuary hallowed by the presence of the ark  there is no evidence that during the time of the judges and of samuel any one occupied the position of the high priest of later days and persons who were neither priests nor levites sacrificed and divined or inquired of jahveh when they pleased and where they pleased without the least indication that they or any one else in israel at that time knew they were doing wrong there is no allusion to any special observance of the sabbath and the references to circumcision are indirect  such are the chief articles of the theological creed of the old israelites which are made known to us by the direct evidence of the ancient record to which we have had recourse and they are as remarkable for that which they contain as for that which is absent from them they reveal a firm conviction that when death takes place a something termed a soul or spirit leaves the body and continues to exist in sheol for a period of indefinite duration even though there is no proof of any belief in absolute immortality that such spirits can return to earth to possess and inspire the living that they are in appearance and in disposition likenesses of the men to whom they belonged but that as spirits they have larger powers and are freer from physical limitations that they thus form a group among a number of kinds of spiritual existences known as elohim of whom jahveh the national god of israel is one that consistently with this view jahveh was conceived as a sort of spirit human in aspect and in senses and with many human passions but with immensely greater intelligence and power than any other elohim whether human or divine further the evidence proves that this belief was the basis of the jahvehworship to which samuel and his followers were devoted that there is strong reason for believing and none for doubting that idolatry in the shape of the worship of the family gods or teraphim was practised by sincere and devout jahvehworshippers that the ark with its protective tent or tabernacle was regarded as a specially but by no means exclusively favoured sanctuary of jahveh that the ephod appears to have had a particular value for those who desired to divine by the help of jahveh and that divination by lots was practised before jahveh on the other hand there is not the slightest evidence of any belief in retribution after death but the contrary ritual obligations have at least as strong sanction as moral there are clear indications that some of the most stringent of the levitical laws were unknown even to samuel priests often appear to be superseded by laymen even in the performance of sacrifices and divination and no line of demarcation can be drawn between necromancer wizard seer prophet and priest each of whom is regarded like all the rest as a medium of communication between the world of elohim and that of living men  the theological system thus defined offers to the anthropologist no feature which is devoid of a parallel in the known theologies of other races of mankind even of those who inhabit parts of the world most remote from palestine and the foundation of the whole the ghost theory is exactly that theological speculation which is the most widely spread of all and the most deeply rooted among uncivilised men i am able to base this statement to some extent on facts within my own knowledge in december 1848 hms rattlesnake the ship to which i then belonged was anchored off mount ernest an island in torres straits the people were few and well disposed and when a friend of mine whom i will call b and i went ashore we made acquaintance with an old native paouda by name in course of time we became quite intimate with the old gentleman partly by the rendering of mutual good offices but chiefly because paouda believed he had discovered that b was his fatherinlaw and his grounds for this singular conviction were very remarkable we had made a long stay at cape york hard by and in accordance with a theory which is widely spread among the australians that white men are the reincarnated spirits of black men b was held to be the ghost or narki of a certain mount ernest native one antarki who had lately died on the ground of some real or fancied resemblance to the latter now paouda had taken to wife a daughter of antarkis named domani and as soon as b informed him that he was the ghost of antarki paouda at once admitted the relationship and acted upon it for as all the women on the island had hidden away in fear of the ship and we were anxious to see what they were like b pleaded pathetically with paouda that it would be very unkind not to let him see his daughter and grandchildren after a good deal of hesitation and the exaction of pledges of deep secrecy paouda consented to take b and myself as bs friend to see domani and the three daughters by whom b was received quite as one of the family while i was courteously welcomed on his account  this scene made an impression upon me which is not yet effaced it left no question on my mind of the sincerity of the strange ghost theory of these savages and of the influence which their belief has on their practical life i had it in my mind as well as many a like result of subsequent anthropological studies when in 1869 14 i wrote as follows     there are savages without god in any proper sense of the word    but none without ghosts and the fetishism ancestorworship    heroworship and demonology of primitive savages are all i    believe different manners of expression of their belief in    ghosts and of the anthropomorphic interpretation of outofthe    way events which is its concomitant witchcraft and sorcery are    the practical expressions of these beliefs and they stand in    the same relation to religious worship as the simple    anthropomorphism of children or savages does to theology  i do not quote myself with any intention of making a claim to originality in putting forth this view for i have since discovered that the same conception is virtually contained in the great discours sur lhistoire universelle of bossuet now more than two centuries old 15     le culte des hommes morta faisoit presque tout le fond de    lidolatrie presque tous les hommes sacrificient aux manes    cestadire aux ames des morts de si anciennes erreurs nous    font voir a la verite combien etoit ancienne la croyance de    limmortalite de lame et nous montrent quelle doit etre    rangee parmi les premieres traditions du genre humain    mais lhomme qui gatoit tout en avoit etrangement abuse    puisquelle le portoit a sacrificer aux morts on alloit meme    jusqua cet exces de leur sacrifier des hommes vivans ou tuoit    leurs esclaves et meme leurs femmes pour les aller servir dans    lautre monde  among more modern writers j g muller in his excellent geschichte der amerikanischen urreligionen 1855 clearly recognises gespensterhafter geisterglaube as the foundation of all savage and semicivilised theology and i need do no more than mention the important developments of the same view which are to be found in mr tylors primitive culture and in the writings of mr herbert spencer especially his recentlypublished ecclesiastical institutions 16  it is a matter of fact that whether we direct our attention to the older conditions of civilised societies in japan in china in hindostan in greece or in rome 17 we find underlying all other theological notions the belief in ghosts with its inevitable concomitant sorcery and a primitive cult in the shape of a worship of ancestors which is essentially an attempt to please or appease their ghosts the same thing is true of old mexico and peru and of all the semicivilised or savage peoples who have developed a definite cult and in those who like the natives of australia have not even a cult the belief in and fear of ghosts is as strong as anywhere else the most clearly demonstrable article of the theology of the israelites in the eleventh and twelfth centuries bc is therefore simply the article which is to be found in all primitive theologies namely the belief that a man has a soul which continues to exist after death for a longer or shorter time and may return as a ghost with a divine or at least demonic character to influence for good or evil and usually for evil the affairs of the living but the correspondence between the old israelitic and other archaic forms of theology extends to details if in order to avoid all chance of direct communication we direct our attention to the theology of semicivilised people such as the polynesian islanders separated by the greatest possible distance and by every conceivable physical barrier from the inhabitants of palestine we shall find not merely that all the features of old israelitic theology which are revealed in the records cited are found among them but that extant information as to the inner mind of these people tends to remove many of the difficulties which those who have not studied anthropology find in the hebrew narrative  one of the best sources if not the best source of information on these topics is mariners tonga islands which tells us of the condition of cooks friendly islanders eighty years ago before european influence was sensibly felt among them mariner a youth of fair education and of no inconsiderable natural ability as the work which was drawn up from the materials he furnished shows was about fifteen years of age when his ship was attacked and plundered by the tongans he remained four years in the islands familiarised himself with the language lived the life of the people became intimate with many of them and had every opportunity of acquainting himself with their opinions as well as with their habits and customs he seems to have been devoid of prejudices theological or other and the impression of strict accuracy which his statements convey has been justified by all the knowledge of polynesian life which has been subsequently acquired  it is desirable therefore to pay close attention to that which mariner tells us about the theological views of these people 18     the human soul after its separation from the body is    termed a hotooa a god or spirit and is believed to    exist in the shape of the body to have the same propensities as    during life but to be corrected by a more enlightened    understanding by which it readily distinguishes good from evil    truth from falsehood right from wrong having the same    attributes as the original gods but in a minor degree and    having its dwelling for ever in the happy regions of bolotoo    holding the same rank in regard to other souls as during this    life it has however the power of returning to tonga to    inspire priests relations or others or to appear in dreams to    those it wishes to admonish and sometimes to the external eye    in the form of a ghost or apparition but this power of    reappearance at tonga particularly belongs to the souls of    chiefs rather than of matabooles vol ii p 130  the word hotooa is the same as that which is usually spelt atua by polynesian philologues and it will be convenient to adopt this spelling now under this head of atuas or supernatural intelligent beings the tongans include  1 the original gods 2 the souls of nobles that have all attributes in common with the first but inferior in degree 3 the souls of matabooles 19 that are still inferior and have not the power as the two first have of coming back to tonga to inspire the priest though they are supposed to have the power of appearing to their relatives 4 the original attendants or servants as it were of the gods who although they had their origin and have ever since existed in bolotoo are still inferior to the third class 5 the atua pow or mischievous gods 6 mooi or the god that supports the earth and does not belong to bolotoo vol ii pp 103 104  from this it appears that the atuas of the polynesian are exactly equivalent to the elohim of the old israelite 20 they comprise everything spiritual from a ghost to a god and from the merely tutelar gods to particular private families vol ii p 104 to taliytooboo who was the national god of tonga the tongans had no doubt that these atuas daily and hourly influenced their destinies and could conversely be influenced by them hence their piety the incessant acts of sacrificial worship which occupied their lives and their belief in omens and charms moreover the atuas were believed to visit particular personstheir own priests in the case of the higher gods but apparently anybody in that of the lowerand to inspire them by a process which was conceived to involve the actual residence of the god for the time being in the person inspired who was thus rendered capable of prophesying vol ii p 100 for the tongan therefore inspiration indubitably was possession  when one of the higher gods was invoked through his priest by a chief who wished to consult the oracle or in old israelitic phraseology to inquire of the god a hog was killed and cooked over night and together with plantains yams and the materials for making the peculiar drink kava of which the tongans were very fond was carried next day to the priest a circle as for an ordinary kavadrinking entertainment was then formed but the priest as the representative of the god took the highest place while the chiefs sat outside the circle as an expression of humility calculated to please the god      as soon as they are all seated the priest is considered as    inspired the god being supposed to exist within him from that    moment he remains for a considerable time in silence with his    hands clasped before him his eyes are cast down and he rests    perfectly still during the time the victuals are being shared    out and the kava preparing the matabooles sometimes begin to    consult him sometimes he answers and at other times not    in either case he remains with his eyes cast down frequently he    will not utter a word till the repast is finished and the kava    too when he speaks he generally begins in a low and very    altered tone of voice which gradually rises to nearly its    natural pitch though sometimes a little above it all that he    says is supposed to be the declaration of the god and he    accordingly speaks in the first person as if he were the god    all this is done generally without any apparent inward emotion    or outward agitation but on some occasions his countenance    becomes fierce and as it were inflamed and his whole frame    agitated with inward feeling he is seized with an universal    trembling the perspiration breaks out on his forehead and his    lips turning black are convulsed at length tears start in    floods from his eyes his breast heaves with great emotion and    his utterance is choked these symptoms gradually subside    before this paroxysm comes on and after it is over he often    eats as much as four hungry men under other circumstances could    devour the fit being now gone off he remains for some time    calm and then takes up a club that is placed by him for the    purpose turns it over and regards it attentively he then looks    up earnestly now to the right now to the left and now again    at the club afterwards he looks up again and about him in like    manner and then again fixes his eyes on the club and so on for    several times at length he suddenly raises the club and after    a moments pause strikes the ground or the adjacent part of the    house with considerable force immediately the god leaves him    and he rises up and retires to the back of the ring among the    people vol i pp 100 101  the phenomena thus described in language which to any one who is familiar with the manifestations of abnormal mental states among ourselves bears the stamp of fidelity furnish a most instructive commentary upon the story of the wise woman of endor as in the latter we have the possession by the spirit or soul atua elohim the strange voice the speaking in the first person unfortunately nothing beyond the loud cry is mentioned as to the state of the wise woman of endor but what we learn from other sources eg 1 sam x 2024 respecting the physical concomitants of inspiration among the old israelites has its exact equivalent in this and other accounts of polynesian prophetism an excellent authority moerenhout who lived among the people of the society islands many years and knew them well says that in tahiti the role of the prophet had very generally passed out of the hands of the priests into that of private persons who professed to represent the god often assumed his name and in this capacity prophesied i will not run the risk of weakening the force of moerenhouts description of the prophetic state by translating it  un individu dans cet etat avait le bras gauche enveloppe dun morceau detoffe signe de la presence de la divinite il ne parlait que dun ton imperieux et vehement ses attaques quand il allait prophetiser etaient aussi effroyables quimposantes il tremblait dabord de tous ses membres la figure enflee les yeux hagards rouges et etincelants dune expression sauvage il gesticulait articulait des mots vides de sens poussait des cris horribles qui faisaient tressaillir tous les assistants et sexaltait parfois au point quon nosait par lapprocher autour de lui le silence de la terreur et du respect cest alors quil repondait aux questions annoncait lavenir le destin des batailles la volonte des dieux et chose etonnante au sein de ce delire de cet enthousiasme religieux son langage etait grave imposant son eloquence noble et persuasive 21  just so saul strips off his clothes prophesies before samuel and lies down naked all that day and night  both mariner and moerenhout refuse to have recourse to the hypothesis of imposture in order to account for the inspired state of the polynesian prophets on the contrary they fully believe in their sincerity mariner tells the story of a young chief an acquaintance of his who thought himself possessed by the atua of a dead woman who had fallen in love with him and who wished him to die that he might be near her in bolotoo and he died accordingly but the most valuable evidence on this head is contained in what the same authority says about king finows son the previous king toogoo ahoo had been assassinated by finow and his soul become an atua of divine rank in bolotoo had been pleased to visit and inspire finows sonwith what particular object does not appear     when this young chief returned to hapai mr mariner who was    upon a footing of great friendship with him one day asked him    how he felt himself when the spirit of toogoo ahoo visited him    he replied that he could not well describe his feelings but the    best he could say of it was that he felt himself all over in a    glow of heat and quite restless and uncomfortable and did not    feel his own personal identity as it were but seemed to have a    mind different from his own natural mind his thoughts wandering    upon strange and unusual subjects though perfectly sensible of    surrounding objects he next asked him how he knew it was the    spirit of toogoo ahoo his answer was theres a fool how can    i tell you how i knew it i felt and knew it was so by a    kind of consciousness my mind told me that it was toogoo    ahoo vol i pp 104 105  finows son was evidently made for a theological disputant and fell back at once on the inexpugnable stronghold of faith when other evidence was lacking theres a fool i know it is true because i know it is the exemplar and epitome of the scepticcrushing process in other places than the tonga islands  the island of bolotoo to which all the souls of the upper classes at any rate repair after the death of the body and from which they return at will to interfere for good or evil with the lives of those whom they have left behind obviously answers to sheol in tongan tradition this place of souls is a sort of elysium above ground and pleasant enough to live in but in other parts of polynesia the corresponding locality which is called po has to be reached by descending into the earth and is represented dark and gloomy like sheol but it was not looked upon as a place of rewards and punishments in any sense whether in bolotoo or in po the soul took the rank it had in the flesh and a shadow lived among the shadows of the friends and houses and food of its previous life  the tongan theologians recognised several hundred gods but there was one already mentioned as their national god whom they regarded as far greater than any of the others as a great chief from the top of the sky down to the bottom of the earth mariner vol ii p 106 he was also god of war and the tutelar deity of the royal family whoever happened to be the incumbent of the royal office for the time being he had no priest except the king himself and his visits even to royalty were few and far between the name of this supreme deity was taliytooboo the literal meaning of which is said to be wait there tooboo from which it would appear that the peculiar characteristic of taliytooboo in the eyes of his worshippers was persistence of duration and it is curious to notice in relation to this circumstance that many hebrew philologers have thought the meaning of jahveh to be best expressed by the word eternal it would probably be difficult to express the notion of an eternal being in a dialect so little fitted to convey abstract conceptions as tongan better than by that of one who always waits there  the characteristics of the gods in tongan theology are exactly those of men whose shape they are supposed to possess only they have more intelligence and greater power the tongan belief that after death the human atua more readily distinguishes good from evil runs parallel with the old israelitic conception of elohim expressed in genesis ye shall be as elohim knowing good from evil they further agreed with the old israelites that all rewards for virtue and punishments for vice happen to men in this world only and come immediately from the gods vol ii p 100 moreover they were of opinion that though the gods approve of some kinds of virtue are displeased with some kinds of vice and to a certain extent protect or forsake their worshippers according to their moral conduct yet neglect to pay due respect to the deities and forgetfulness to keep them in good humour might be visited with even worse consequences than moral delinquency and those who will carefully study the socalled mosaic code contained in the books of exodus leviticus and numbers will see that though jahvehs prohibitions of certain forms of immorality are strict and sweeping his wrath is quite as strongly kindled against infractions of ritual ordinances accidental homicide may go unpunished and reparation may be made for wilful theft on the other hand nadab and abihu who offered strange fire before jahveh which he had not commanded them were swiftly devoured by jahvehs fire he who sacrificed anywhere except at the allotted place was to be cut off from his people so was he who ate blood and the details of the upholstery of the tabernacle of the millinery of the priests vestments and of the cabinet work of the ark can plead direct authority from jahveh no less than moral commands  amongst the tongans the sacrifices were regarded as gifts of food and drink offered to the divine atuas just as the articles deposited by the graves of the recently dead were meant as food for atuas of lower rank a kava root was a constant form of offering all over polynesia in the excellent work of the rev george turner entitled nineteen years in polynesia p 241 i find it said of the samoans near neighbours of the tongans     the offerings were principally cooked food as in ancient    greece so in samoa the first cup was in honour of the god    it was either poured out on the ground or waved towards    the heavens reminding us again of the mosaic ceremonies    the chiefs all drank a portion out of the same cup according to    rank and after that the food brought as an offering was    divided and eaten there before the lord  in tonga when they consulted a god who had a priest the latter as representative of the god had the first cup but if the god like taliytooboo had no priest then the chief place was left vacant and was supposed to be occupied by the god himself when the first cup of kava was filled the mataboole who acted as master of the ceremonies said give it to your god and it was offered though only as a matter of form in tonga and samoa there were many sacred places or morais with houses of the ordinary construction but which served as temples in consequence of being dedicated to various gods and there were altars on which the sacrifices were offered nevertheless there were few or no images mariner mentions none in tonga and the samoans seem to have been regarded as no better than atheists by other polynesians because they had none it does not appear that either of these peoples had images even of their family or ancestral gods  in tahiti and the adjacent islands moerenhout t i p 471 makes the very interesting observation not only that idols were often absent but that where they existed the images of the gods served merely as depositories for the proper representatives of the divinity each of these was called a maro aurou and was a kind of girdle artistically adorned with red yellow blue and black feathersthe red feathers being especially importantwhich were consecrated and kept as sacred objects within the idols they were worn by great personages on solemn occasions and conferred upon their wearers a sacred and almost divine character there is no distinct evidence that the maro aurou was supposed to have any special efficacy in divination but one cannot fail to see a certain parallelism between this holy girdle which endowed its wearer with a particular sanctity and the ephod  according to the rev r taylor the new zealanders formerly used the word karakia now employed for prayer to signify a spell charm or incantation and the utterance of these karakias constituted the chief part of their cult in the south the officiating priest had a small image about eighteen inches long resembling a peg with a carved head which reminds one of the form commonly attributed to the teraphim  the priest first bandaged a fillet of red parrot feathers under the gods chin which was called his pahau or beard this bandage was made of a certain kind of sennet which was tied on in a peculiar way when this was done it was taken possession of by the atua whose spirit entered it the priest then either held it in the hand and vibrated it in the air whilst the powerful karakia was repeated or he tied a piece of string formed of the centre of a flax leaf round the neck of the image and stuck it in the ground he sat at a little distance from it leaning against a tuahu a short stone pillar stuck in the ground in a slanting position and holding the string in his hand he gave the god a jerk to arrest his attention lest he should be otherwise engaged like baal of old either hunting fishing or sleeping and therefore must be awaked the god is supposed to make use of the priests tongue in giving a reply imageworship appears to have been confined to one part of the island the atua was supposed only to enter the image for the occasion the natives declare they did not worship the image itself but only the atua it represented and that the image was merely used as a way of approaching him 22  this is the excuse for imageworship which the more intelligent idolaters make all the world over but it is more interesting to observe that in the present case we seem to have the equivalents of divination by teraphim with the aid of something like an ephod which however is used to sanctify the image and not the priest mixed up together many hebrew archaeologists have supposed that the term ephod is sometimes used for an image particularly in the case of gideons ephod and the story of micah in the book of judges shows that images were at any rate employed in close association with the ephod if the pulling of the string to call the attention of the god seems as absurd to us as it appears to have done to the worthy missionary who tells us of the practice it should be recollected that the high priest of jahveh was ordered to wear a garment fringed with golden bells      and it shall be upon aaron to minister and the sound thereof    shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before    jahveh and when he cometh out that he die not exod    xxviii 35  an escape from the obvious conclusion suggested by this passage has been sought in the supposition that these bells rang for the sake of the worshippers as at the elevation of the host in the roman catholic ritual but then why should the priest be threatened with the wellknown penalty for inadvisedly beholding the divinity  in truth the intermediate step between the maori practice and that of the old israelites is furnished by the kami temples in japan these are provided with bells which the worshippers who present themselves ring in order to call the attention of the ancestorgod to their presence grant the fundamental assumption of the essentially human character of the spirit whether atua kami or elohim and all these practices are equally rational  the sacrifices to the gods in tonga and elsewhere in polynesia were ordinarily social gatherings in which the god either in his own person or in that of his priestly representative was supposed to take part these sacrifices were offered on every occasion of importance and even the daily meals were prefaced by oblations and libations of food and drink exactly answering to those offered by the old romans to their manes penates and lares the sacrifices had no moral significance but were the necessary result of the theory that the god was either a deified ghost of an ancestor or chief or at any rate a being of like nature to these if one wanted to get anything out of him therefore the first step was to put him in good humour by gifts and if one desired to escape his wrath which might be excited by the most trifling neglect or unintentional disrespect the great thing was to pacify him by costly presents king finow appears to have been somewhat of a freethinker to the great horror of his subjects and it was only his untimely death which prevented him from dealing with the priest of a god who had not returned a favourable answer to his supplications as saul dealt with the priests of the sanctuary of jahveh at nob nevertheless finow showed his practical belief in the gods during the sickness of a daughter to whom he was fondly attached in a fashion which has a close parallel in the history of israel     if the gods have any resentment against us let the whole    weight of vengeance fall on my head i fear not their vengeance    but spare my child and i earnestly entreat you toobo totai    the god whom he had evoked to exert all your influence with    the other gods that i alone may suffer all the punishment they    desire to inflict vol i p 354  so when the king of israel has sinned by numbering the people and they are punished for his fault by a pestilence which slays seventy thousand innocent men david cries to jahveh     lo i have sinned and i have done perversely but these sheep    what have they done let thine hand i pray thee be against me    and against my fathers house 2 sam xxiv 17  human sacrifices were extremely common in polynesia and in tonga the devotion of a child by strangling was a favourite method of averting the wrath of the gods the wellknown instances of jephthahs sacrifice of his daughter and of davids giving up the seven sons of saul to be sacrificed by the gibeonites before jahveh appear to me to leave no doubt that the old israelites even when devout worshippers of jahveh considered human sacrifices under certain circumstances to be not only permissible but laudable samuels hewing to pieces of the miserable captive sole survivor of his nation agag before jahveh can hardly be viewed in any other light the life of moses is redeemed from jahveh who sought to slay him by zipporahs symbolical sacrifice of her child by the bloody operation of circumcision jahveh expressly affirms that the firstborn males of men and beasts are devoted to him in accordance with that claim the firstborn males of the beasts are duly sacrificed and it is only by special permission that the claim to the firstborn of men is waived and it is enacted that they may be redeemed exod xiii 1215 is it possible to avoid the conclusion that immolation of their firstborn sons would have been incumbent on the worshippers of jahveh had they not been thus specially excused can any other conclusion be drawn from the history of abraham and isaac does abraham exhibit any indication of surprise when he receives the astounding order to sacrifice his son is there the slightest evidence that there was anything in his intimate and personal acquaintance with the character of the deity who had eaten the meat and drunk the milk which abraham set before him under the oaks of mamre to lead him to hesitateeven to wait twelve or fourteen hours for a repetition of the command not a whit we are told that abraham rose early in the morning and led his only child to the slaughter as if it were the most ordinary business imaginable whether the story has any historical foundation or not it is valuable as showing that the writer of it conceived jahveh as a deity whose requirement of such a sacrifice need excite neither astonishment nor suspicion of mistake on the part of his devotee hence when the incessant human sacrifices in israel during the age of the kings are put down to the influence of foreign idolatries we may fairly inquire whether editorial bowdlerising has not prevailed over historical truth  an attempt to compare the ethical standards of two nations one of which has a written code while the other has not is beset with difficulties with all that is strange and in many cases repulsive to us in the social arrangements and opinions respecting moral obligation among the tongans as they are placed before us with perfect candour in mariners account there is much that indicates a strong ethical sense they showed great kindliness to one another and faithfulness in standing by their comrades in war no people could have better observed either the third or the fifth commandment for they had a particular horror of blasphemy and their respectful tenderness towards their parents and indeed towards old people in general was remarkable  it cannot be said that the eighth commandment was generally observed especially where europeans were concerned nevertheless a wellbred tongan looked upon theft as a meanness to which he would not condescend as to the seventh commandment any breach of it was considered scandalous in women and as something to be avoided in selfrespecting men but among unmarried and widowed people chastity was held very cheap nevertheless the women were extremely well treated and often showed themselves capable of great devotion and entire faithfulness in the matter of cruelty treachery and bloodthirstiness these islanders were neither better nor worse than most peoples of antiquity it is to the credit of the tongans that they particularly objected to slander nor can covetousness be regarded as their characteristic for mariner says     when any one is about to eat he always shares out what he has    to those about him without any hesitation and a contrary    conduct would be considered exceedingly vile and selfish vol    ii p 145  in fact they thought very badly of the english when mariner told them that his countrymen did not act exactly on that principle it further appears that they decidedly belonged to the school of intuitive moral philosophers and believed that virtue is its own reward for     many of the chiefs on being asked by mr mariner what motives    they had for conducting themselves with propriety besides the    fear of misfortunes in this life replied the agreeable and    happy feeling which a man experiences within himself when he    does any good action or conducts himself nobly and generously as    a man ought to do and this question they answered as if they    wondered such a question should be asked vol ii p 161  one may read from the beginning of the book of judges to the end of the books of samuel without discovering that the old israelites had a moral standard which differs in any essential respect except perhaps in regard to the chastity of unmarried women from that of the tongans gideon jephthah samson and david are stronghanded men some of whom are not outdone by any polynesian chieftain in the matter of murder and treachery while deborahs jubilation over jaels violation of the primary duty of hospitality proffered and accepted under circumstances which give a peculiarly atrocious character to the murder of the guest and her witchlike gloating over the picture of the disappointment of the mother of the victim     the mother of sisera cried through the lattice    why is his chariot so long in coming jud v 28 would not have been out of place in the choral service of the most sanguinary god in the polynesian pantheon  with respect to the cannibalism which the tongans occasionally practised mariner says     although a few young ferocious warriors chose to imitate what    they considered a mark of courageous fierceness in a    neighbouring nation it was held in disgust by everybody else    vol ii p 171  that the moral standard of tongan life was less elevated than that indicated in the book of the covenant exod xxixxiii may be freely admitted but then the evidence that this book of the covenant and even the ten commandments as given in exodus were known to the israelites of the time of samuel and saul is to say the least by no means conclusive the deuteronomic version of the fourth commandment is hopelessly discrepant from that which stands in exodus would any later writer have ventured to alter the commandments as given from sinai if he had had before him that which professed to be an accurate statement of the ten words in exodus and if the writer of deuteronomy had not exodus before him what is the value of the claim of the version of the ten commandments therein contained to authenticity from one end to the other of the books of judges and samuel the only commandments of jahveh which are specially adduced refer to the prohibition of the worship of other gods or are orders given ad hoc and have nothing to do with questions of morality  in polynesia the belief in witchcraft in the appearance of spiritual beings in dreams in possession as the cause of diseases and in omens prevailed universally mariner tells a story of a woman of rank who was greatly attached to king finow and who for the space of six months after his death scarcely ever slept elsewhere than on his grave which she kept carefully decorated with flowers  one day she went with the deepest affliction to the house of mooonga toobo the widow of the deceased chief to communicate what had happened to her at the fytoca grave during several nights and which caused her the greatest anxiety she related that she had dreamed that the late how king appeared to her and with a countenance full of disappointment asked why there yet remained at vavaoo so many evildesigning persons for he declared that since he had been at bolotoo his spirit had been disturbed 22 by the evil machinations of wicked men conspiring against his son but he declared that the youth should not be molested nor his power shaken by the spirit of rebellion that he therefore came to her with a warning voice to prevent such disastrous consequences vol i p 424  on inquiry it turned out that the charm of tattao had been performed on finows grave with the view of injuring his son the reigning king and it is to be presumed that it was this sorcerers work which had disturbed finows spirit the rev richard taylor says in the work already cited the account given of the witch of endor agrees most remarkably with the witches of new zealand p 45  the tongans also believed in a mode of divination essentially similar to the casting of lots the twirling of a cocoanut     the object of inquiry is chiefly whether a sick person will    recover for this purpose the nut being placed on the ground a    relation of the sick person determines that if the nut when    again at rest points to such a quarter the east for example    that the sick man will recover he then prays aloud to the    patron god of the family that he will be pleased to

me what thou hast done and the people rescued jonathan so    that he died not 1 sam xiv 4145  as the israelites had great yearly feasts so had the polynesians as the israelites practised circumcision so did many polynesian people as the israelites had a complex and often arbitraryseeming multitude of distinctions between clean and unclean things and clean and unclean states of men to which they attached great importance so had the polynesians their notions of ceremonial purity and their tabu an equally extensive and strange system of prohibitions violation of which was visited by death these doctrines of cleanness and uncleanness no doubt may have taken their rise in the real or fancied utility of the prescriptions but it is probable that the origin of many is indicated in the curious habit of the samoans to make fetishes of living animals it will be recollected that these people had no gods made with hands but they substituted animals for them  at his birth  every samoan was supposed to be taken under the care of some tutelary god or aitu  atua as it was called the help of perhaps half a dozen different gods was invoked in succession on the occasion but the one who happened to be addressed just as the child was born was marked and declared to be the childs god for life  these gods were supposed to appear in some visible incarnation and the particular thing in which his god was in the habit of appearing was to the samoan an object of veneration it was in fact his idol and he was careful never to injure it or treat it with contempt one for instance saw his god in the eel another in the shark another in the turtle another in the dog another in the owl another in the lizard and so on throughout all the fish of the sea and birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things in some of the shellfish even gods were supposed to be present a man would eat freely of what was regarded as the incarnation of the god of another man but the incarnation of his own particular god he would consider it death to injure or eat 23  we have here that which appears to be the origin or one of the origins of food prohibitions on the one hand and of totemism on the other when it is remembered that the old israelites sprang from ancestors who are said to have resided near or in one of the great seats of ancient babylonian civilisation the city of ur that they had been it is said for centuries in close contact with the egyptians and that in the theology of both the babylonians and the egyptians there is abundant evidence notwithstanding their advanced social organisation of the belief in spirits with sorcery ancestorworship the deification of animals and the converse animalisation of godsit obviously needs very strong evidence to justify the belief that the rude tribes of israel did not share the notions from which their far more civilised neighbours had not emancipated themselves  but it is surely needless to carry the comparison further out of the abundant evidence at command i think that sufficient has been produced to furnish ample grounds for the belief that the old israelites of the time of samuel entertained theological conceptions which were on a level with those current among the more civilised of the polynesian islanders though their ethical code may possibly in some respects have been more advanced 24  a theological system of essentially similar character exhibiting the same fundamental conceptions respecting the continued existence and incessant interference in human affairs of disembodied spirits prevails or formerly prevailed among the whole of the inhabitants of the polynesian and melanesian islands and among the people of australia notwithstanding the wide differences in physical character and in grade of civilisation which obtain among them and the same proposition is true of the people who inhabit the riverain shores of the pacific ocean whether dyaks malays indochinese chinese japanese the wild tribes of america or the highly civilised old mexicans and peruvians it is no less true of the mongolic nomads of northern asia of the asiatic aryans and of the ancient greeks and romans and it holds good among the dravidians of the dekhan and the negro tribes of africa no tribe of savages which has yet been discovered has been conclusively proved to have so poor a theological equipment as to be devoid of a belief in ghosts and in the utility of some form of witchcraft in influencing those ghosts and there is no nation modern or ancient which even at this moment has wholly given up the belief and in which it has not at one time or other played a great part in practical life  this sciotheism 25 as it might be called is found in several degrees of complexity in rough correspondence with the stages of social organisation and like these separated by no sudden breaks  in its simplest condition such as may be met with among the australian savages theology is a mere belief in the existence powers and disposition usually malignant of ghostlike entities who may be propitiated or scared away but no cult can properly be said to exist and in this stage theology is wholly independent of ethics the moral code such as is implied by public opinion derives no sanction from the theological dogmas and the influence of the spirits is supposed to be exerted out of mere caprice or malice  as a next stage the fundamental fear of ghosts and the consequent desire to propitiate them acquire an organised ritual in simple forms of ancestorworship such as the rev mr turner describes among the people of tanna lc p 88 and this line of development may be followed out until it attains its acme in the statetheology of china and the kamitheology 26 of japan each of these is essentially ancestorworship the ancestors being reckoned back through family groups of higher and higher order sometimes with strict reference to the principle of agnation as in old rome and as in the latter it is intimately bound up with the whole organisation of the state there are no idols inscribed tablets in china and strips of paper lodged in a peculiar portable shrine in japan represent the souls of the deceased or the special seats which they occupy when sacrifices are offered by their descendants in japan it is interesting to observe that a national kamitenziodaizinis worshipped as a sort of jahveh by the nation in general and as lippert has observed it is singular that his special seat is a portable litterlike shrine termed the mikosi in some sort analogous to the israelitic ark in china the emperor is the representative of the primitive ancestors and stands as it were between them and the supreme cosmic deitiesheaven and earthwho are superadded to them and who answer to the tangaloa and the maui of the polynesians  sciotheism under the form of the deification of ancestral ghosts in its most pronounced form is therefore the chief element in the theology of a great moiety possibly of more than half of the human race i think this must be taken to be a matter of factthough various opinions may be held as to how this ancestorworship came about but on the other hand it is no less a matter of fact that there are very few people without additional gods who cannot with certainty be accounted for as deified ancestors  with all respect for the distinguished authorities on the other side i cannot find good reasons for accepting the theory that the cosmic deitieswho are superadded to deified ancestors even in china who are found all over polynesia in tangaloa and maui and in old peru in the sunare the product either of the search after the infinite or of mistakes arising out of the confusion of a great chiefs name with the thing signified by the name but however this may be i think it is again merely matter of fact that among a large portion of mankind ancestorworship is more or less thrown into the background either by such cosmic deities or by tribal gods of uncertain origin who have been raised to eminence by the superiority in warfare or otherwise of their worshippers  among certain nations the polytheistic theology thus constituted has become modified by the selection of some one cosmic or tribal god as the only god to whom worship is due on the part of that nation though it is by no means denied that other nations have a right to worship other gods and thus results a worship of one godmonolatry as wellhausen calls itwhich is very different from genuine monotheism 27 in ancestral sciotheism and in this monolatry the ethical code often of a very high order comes into closer relation with the theological creed morality is taken under the patronage of the god or gods who reward all morally good conduct and punish all morally evil conduct in this world or the next at the same time however they are conceived to be thoroughly human and they visit any shadow of disrespect to themselves shown by disobedience to their commands or by delay or carelessness in carrying them out as severely as any breach of the moral laws piety means minute attention to the due performance of all sacred rites and covers any number of lapses in morality just as cruelty treachery murder and adultery did not bar davids claim to the title of the man after gods own heart among the israelites crimes against men may be expiated but blasphemy against the gods is an unpardonable sin men forgive all injuries but those which touch their selfesteem and they make their gods after their own likeness in their own image make they them  it is in the category of monolatry that i conceive the theology of the old israelites must be ranged they were polytheists in so far as they admitted the existence of other elohim of divine rank beside jahveh they differed from ordinary polytheists in so far as they believed that jahveh was the supreme god and the one proper object of their own national worship but it will doubtless be objected that i have been building up a fictitious israelitic theology on the foundation of the recorded habits and customs of the people when they had lapsed from the ordinances of their great lawgiver and prophet moses and that my conclusions may be good for the perverts to canaanitish theology but not for the true observers of the sinaitic legislation the answer to the objection is thatso far as i can form a judgment of that which is well ascertained in the history of israelthere is very little ground for believing that we know much either about the theological and social value of the influence of moses or about what happened during the wanderings in the desert  the account of the exodus and of the occurrences in the sinaitic peninsula in fact all the history of israel before the invasion of canaan is full of wonderful stories which may be true in so far as they are conceivable occurrences but which are certainly not probable and which i for one decline to accept until evidence which deserves that name is offered of their historical truth up to this time i know of none 28 furthermore i see no answer to the argument that one has no right to pick out of an obviously unhistorical statement the assertions which happen to be probable and to discard the rest but it is also certain that a primitively veracious tradition may be smothered under subsequent mythical additions and that one has no right to cast away the former along with the latter thus perhaps the fairest way of stating the case may be as follows  there can be no a priori objection to the supposition that the israelites were delivered from their egyptian bondage by a leader called moses and that he exerted a great influence over their subsequent organisation in the desert there is no reason to doubt that during their residence in the land of goshen the israelites knew nothing of jahveh but as their own prophets declare see ezek xx were polytheistic idolaters sharing in the worst practices of their neighbours as to their conduct in other respects nothing is known but it may fairly be suspected that their ethics were not of a higher order than those of jacob their progenitor in which case they might derive great profit from contact with egyptian society which held honesty and truthfulness in the highest esteem thanks to the egyptologers we now know with all requisite certainty the moral standard of that society in the time and long before the time of moses it can be determined from the scrolls buried with the mummified dead and from the inscriptions on the tombs and memorial statues of that age for though the lying of epitaphs is proverbial so far as their subject is concerned they gave an unmistakable insight into that which the writers and the readers of them think praiseworthy  in the famous tombs at beni hassan there is a record of the life of prince nakht who served osertasen ii a pharaoh of the twelfth dynasty as governor of a province the inscription speaks in his name i was a benevolent and kindly governor who loved his country never was a little child distressed nor a widow illtreated by me i have never repelled a workman nor hindered a shepherd i gave alike to the widow and to the married woman and have not preferred the great to the small in my gifts and we have the high authority of the late dr samuel birch for the statement that the inscriptions of the twelfth dynasty abound in injunctions of a high ethical character to feed the hungry give drink to the thirsty clothe the naked bury the dead loyally serve the king formed the first duty of a pious man and faithful subject 29 the people for whom these inscriptions embodied their ideal of praiseworthiness assuredly had no imperfect conception of either justice or mercy but there is a document which gives still better evidence of the moral standard of the egyptians it is the book of the dead a sort of guide to spiritland the whole or a part of which was buried with the mummy of every welltodo egyptian while extracts from it are found in innumerable inscriptions portions of this work are of extreme antiquity evidence of their existence occurring as far back as the fifth and sixth dynasties while the 120th chapter which constitutes a sort of book by itself and is known as the book of redemption in the hall of the two truths is frequently inscribed upon coffins and other monuments of the nineteenth dynasty that under which there is some reason to believe the israelites were oppressed and the exodus took place and it occurs more than once in the famous tombs of the kings of this and the preceding dynasty at thebes 30 this book of redemption is chiefly occupied by the socalled negative confession made to the fortytwo divine judges in which the soul of the dead denies that he has committed faults of various kinds it is therefore obvious that the egyptians conceived that their gods commanded them not to do the deeds which are here denied the book of redemption in fact implies the existence in the mind of the egyptians if not in a formal writing of a series of ordinances couched like the majority of the ten commandments in negative terms and it is easy to prove the implied existence of a series which nearly answers to the ten words of course a polytheistic and imageworshipping people who observed a great many holy days but no sabbaths could have nothing analogous to the first or the second and the fourth commandments of the decalogue but answering to the third is i have not blasphemed to the fifth i have not reviled the face of the king or my father to the sixth i have not murdered to the seventh i have not committed adultery to the eighth i have not stolen i have not done fraud to man to the ninth i have not told falsehoods in the tribunal of truth and further i have not calumniated the slave to his master i find nothing exactly similar to the tenth commandment but that the inward disposition of mind was held to be of no less importance than the outward act is to be gathered from the praises of kindliness already cited and the cry of i am pure which is repeated by the soul on trial moreover there is a minuteness of detail in the confession which shows no little delicacy of moral appreciationi have not privily done evil against mankind i have not afflicted men i have not withheld milk from the mouths of sucklings i have not been idle i have not played the hypocrite i have not told falsehoods i have not corrupted woman or man i have not caused fear i have not multiplied words in speaking  would that the moral sense of the nineteenth century ad were as far advanced as that of the egyptians in the nineteenth century bc in this last particular what incalculable benefit to mankind would flow from strict observance of the commandment thou shalt not multiply words in speaking nothing is more remarkable than the stress which the old egyptians here and elsewhere lay upon this and other kinds of truthfulness as compared with the absence of any such requirement in the israelitic decalogue in which only a specific kind of untruthfulnes is forbidden  if as the story runs moses was adopted by a princess of the royal house and was instructed in all the wisdom of the egyptians it is surely incredible that he should not have been familiar from his youth up with the high moral code implied in the book of redemption it is surely impossible that he should have been less familiar with the complete legal system and with the method of administration of justice which even in his time had enabled the egyptian people to hold together as a complex social organisation for a period far longer than the duration of old roman society from the building of the city to the death of the last caesar nor need we look to moses alone for the influence of egypt upon israel it is true that the hebrew nomads who came into contact with the egyptians of osertasen or of ramses stood in much the same relation to them in point of culture as a germanic tribe did to the romans of tiberius or of marcus antoninus or as captain cooks omai did to the english of george the third but at the same time any difficulty of communication which might have arisen out of this circumstance was removed by the long preexisting intercourse of other semites of every grade of civilisation with the egyptians in mesopotamia and elsewhere as in phenicia semitic people had attained to a social organisation as advanced as that of the egyptians semites had conquered and occupied lower egypt for centuries so extensively had semitic influences penetrated egypt that the egyptian language during the period of the nineteenth dynasty is said by brugsch to be as full of semitisms as german is of gallicisms while semitic deities had supplanted the egyptian gods at heliopolis and elsewhere on the other hand the semites as far as phenicia were extensively influenced by egypt  it is generally admitted 31 that moses phinehas and perhaps aaron are names of egyptian origin and there is excellent authority for the statement that the name abir which the israelites gave to their golden calf and which is also used to signify the strong the heavenly and even god 32 is simply the egyptian apis brugsch points out that the god tum or tom who was the special object of worship in the city of pitom with which the israelites were only too familiar was called ankh and the great god and had no image ankh means he who lives the living one a name the resemblance of which to the i am that i am of exodus is unmistakable whatever may be the value of the fact every discussion of israelitic ritual seeks and finds the explanation of its details in the portable sacred chests the altars the priestly dress the breastplate the incense and the sacrifices depicted on the monuments of egypt but it must be remembered that these signs of the influence of egypt upon israel are not necessarily evidence that such influence was exerted before the exodus it may have come much later through the close connection of the israel of david and solomon first with phenicia and then with egypt  if we suppose moses to have been a man of the stamp of calvin there is no difficulty in conceiving that he may have constructed the substance of the ten words and even of the book of the covenant which curiously resembles parts of the book of the dead from the foundation of egyptian ethics and theology which had filtered through to the israelites in general or had been furnished specially to himself by his early education just as the great genevese reformer built up a puritanic social organisation on so much as remained of the ethics and theology of the roman church after he had trimmed them to his liking  thus i repeat i see no a priori objection to the assumption that moses may have endeavoured to give his people a theologicopolitical organisation based on the ten commandments though certainly not quite in their present form and the book of the covenant contained in our present book of exodus but whether there is such evidence as amounts to proof or i had better say to probability that even this much of the pentateuch owes its origin to moses is another matter the mythical character of the accessories of the sinaitic history is patent and it would take a good deal more evidence than is afforded by the bare assertion of an unknown writer to justify the belief that the people who saw the thunderings and the lightnings and the voice of the trumpet and the mountain smoking exod xx 18 to whom jahveh orders moses to say ye yourselves have seen that i have talked with you from heaven ye shall not make other gods with me gods of silver and gods of gold ye shall not make unto you ibid 22 23 should less than six weeks afterwards have done the exact thing they were thus awfully forbidden to do nor is the credibility of the story increased by the statement that aaron the brother of moses the witness and fellowworker of the miracles before pharaoh was their leader and the artificer of the idol and yet at the same time aaron was apparently so ignorant of wrongdoing that he made proclamation tomorrow shall be a feast to jahveh and the people proceeded to offer their burntofferings and peaceofferings as if everything in their proceedings must be satisfactory to the deity with whom they had just made a solemn covenant to abolish imageworship it seems to me that on a survey of all the facts of the case only a very cautious and hypothetical judgment is justifiable it may be that moses profited by the opportunities afforded him of access to what was best in egyptian society to become acquainted not only with its advanced ethical and legal code but with the more or less pantheistic unification of the divine to which the speculations of the egyptian thinkers like those of all polytheistic philosophers from polynesia to greece tend if indeed the theology of the period of the nineteenth dynasty was not as some egyptologists think a modification of an earlier more distinctly monotheistic doctrine of a long antecedent age it took only half a dozen centuries for the theology of paul to become the theology of gregory the great and it is possible that twenty centuries lay between the theology of the first worshippers in the sanctuary of the sphinx and that of the priests of ramses maimun  it may be that the ten commandments and the book of the covenant are based upon faithful traditions of the efforts of a great leader to raise his followers to his own level for myself as a matter of pious opinion i like to think so as i like to imagine that between moses and samuel there may have been many a seer many a herdsman such as him of tekoah lonely amidst the hills of ephraim and judah who cherished and kept alive these traditions in the present results of biblical criticism however i can discover no justification for the common assumption that between the time of joshua and that of rehoboam the israelites were familiar with either the deuteronomic or the levitical legislation or that the theology of the israelites from the king who sat on the throne to the lowest of his subjects was in any important respect different from that which might naturally be expected from their previous history and the conditions of their existence but there is excellent evidence to the contrary effect and for my part i see no reason to doubt that like the rest of the world the israelites had passed through a period of mere ghostworship and had advanced through ancestorworship and fetishism and totemism to the theological level at which we find them in the books of judges and samuel  all the more remarkable therefore is the extraordinary change which is to be noted in the eighth century bc the student who is familiar with the theology implied or expressed in the books of judges samuel and the first book of kings finds himself in a new world of thought in the full tide of a great reformation when he reads joel amos hosea isaiah micah and jeremiah  the essence of this change is the reversal of the position which in primitive society ethics holds in relation to theology originally that which men worship is a theological hypothesis not a moral ideal the prophets in substance if not always in form preach the opposite doctrine they are constantly striving to free the moral ideal from the stifling embrace of the current theology and its concomitant ritual theirs was not an intellectual criticism argued on strictly scientific grounds the imageworshippers and the believers in the efficacy of sacrifices and ceremonies might logically have held their own against anything the prophets have to say it was an ethical criticism from the height of his moral intuitionthat the whole duty of man is to do justice and to love mercy and to bear himself as humbly as befits his insignificance in face of the infinitethe prophet simply laughs at the idolaters of stocks and stones and the idolaters of ritual idols of the first kind in his experience were inseparably united with the practice of immorality and they were to be ruthlessly destroyed as for sacrifices and ceremonies whatever their intrinsic value might be they might be tolerated on condition of ceasing to be idols they might even be praiseworthy on condition of being made to subserve the worship of the true jahvehthe moral ideal  if the realm of david had remained undivided if the assyrian and the chaldean and the egyptian had left israel to the ordinary course of development of an oriental kingdom it is possible that the effects of the reforming zeal of the prophets of the eighth and seventh centuries might have been effaced by the growth according to its inevitable tendencies of the theology which they combated but the captivity made the fortune of the ideas which it was the privilege of these men to launch upon an endless career with the abolition of the templeservices for more than half a century the priest must have lost and the scribe gained influence the puritanism of a vigorous minority among the babylonian jews rooted out polytheism from all its hidingplaces in the theology which they had inherited they created the first consistent remorseless naked monotheism which so far as history records appeared in the world for zoroastrism is practically ditheism and buddhism anytheism or notheism and they inseparably united therewith an ethical code which for its purity and for its efficiency as a bond of social life was and is unsurpassed so i think we must not judge ezra and nehemiah and their followers too hardly if they exemplified the usual doom of poor humanity to escape from one error only to fall into another if they failed to free themselves as completely from the idolatry of ritual as they had from that of images and dogmas if they cherished the new fetters of the levitical legislation which they had fitted upon themselves and their nation as though such bonds had the sanctity of the obligations of morality and if they led succeeding generations to spend their best energies in building that hedge round the torah which was meant to preserve both ethics and theology but which too often had the effect of pampering the latter and starving the former the world being what it was it is to be doubted whether israel would have preserved intact the pure ore of religion which the prophets had extracted for the use of mankind as well as for their nation had not the leaders of the nation been zealous even to death for the dross of the law in which it was embedded the struggle of the jews under the maccabean house against the seleucidae was as important for mankind as that of the greeks against the persians and of all the strange ironies of history perhaps the strangest is that pharisee is current as a term of reproach among the theological descendants of that sect of nazarenes who without the martyr spirit of those primitive puritans would never have come into existence they like their historical successors our own puritans have shared the general fate of the poor wise men who save cities  a criticism of theology from the side of science is not thought of by the prophets and is at most indicated in the books of job and ecclesiastes in both of which the problem of vindicating the ways of god to man is given up though on different grounds as a hopeless one but with the extensive introduction of greek thought among the jews which took place not only during the domination of the seleucidae in palestine but in the great judaic colony which flourished in egypt under the ptolemies criticism on both ethical and scientific grounds took a new departure  in the hands of the alexandrian jews as represented by philo the fundamental axiom of later jewish as of christian monotheism that the deity is infinitely perfect and infinitely good worked itself out into its logical consequenceagnostic theism philo will allow of no point of contact between god and a world in which evil exists for him god has no relation to space or to time and as infinite suffers no predicate beyond that of existence it is therefore absurd to ascribe to him mental faculties and affections comparable in the remotest degree to those of men he is in no way an object of cognition he is greek and greek 33without quality and incomprehensible that is to say the alexandrian jew of the first century had anticipated the reasonings of hamilton and mansell in the nineteenth and for him god is the unknowable in the sense in which that term is used by mr herbert spencer moreover philos definition of the supreme being would not be inconsistent with that substantia constans infinitis attributis quorum unumquodque aeternam et infinitam essentiam exprimit given by another great israelite were it not that spinozas doctrine of the immanence of the deity in the world puts him at any rate formally at the antipodes of theological speculation but the conception of the essential incognoscibility of the deity is the same in each case however philo was too thorough an israelite and too much the child of his time to be content with this agnostic position with the help of the platonic and stoic philosophy he constructed an apprehensible if not comprehensible quasideity out of the logos while other more or less personified divine powers or attributes bridged over the interval between god and man between the sacred existence too pure to be called by any name which implied a conceivable quality and the gross and evil world of matter in order to get over the ethical difficulties presented by the naive naturalism of many parts of those scriptures in the divine authority of which he firmly believed philo borrowed from the stoics who had been in like straits in respect of greek mythology that great excalibur which they had forged with infinite pains and skillthe method of allegorical interpretation this mighty twohanded engine at the door of the theologian is warranted to make a speedy end of any and every moral or intellectual difficulty by showing that taken allegorically or as it is otherwise said poetically or in a spiritual sense the plainest words mean whatever a pious interpreter desires they should mean in biblical phrase zeno who probably had a strain of semitic blood in him was the father of all such as reconcile no doubt philo and his followers were eminently religious men but they did endless injury to the cause of religion by laying the foundations of a new theology while equipping the defenders of it with the subtlest of all weapons of offence and defence and with an inexhaustible store of sophistical arguments of the most plausible aspect  the question of the real bearing upon theology of the influence exerted by the teaching of philos contemporary jesus of nazareth is one upon which it is not germane to my present purpose to enter i take it simply as an unquestionable fact that his immediate disciples known to their countrymen as nazarenes were regarded as and considered themselves to be perfectly orthodox jews belonging to the puritanic or pharisaic section of their people and differing from the rest only in their belief that the messiah had already come christianity it is said first became clearly differentiated at antioch and it separated itself from orthodox judaism by denying the obligation of the rite of circumcision and of the food prohibitions prescribed by the law henceforward theology became relatively stationary among the jews 34 and the history of its rapid progress in a new course of evolution is the history of the christian churches orthodox and heterodox the steps in this evolution are obvious the first is the birth of a new theological scheme arising out of the union of elements derived from greek philosophy with elements derived from israelitic theology in the fourth gospel the logos raised to a somewhat higher degree of personification than in the alexandrian theosophy is identified with jesus of nazareth in the epistles especially the later of those attributed to paul the israelitic ideas of the messiah and of sacrificial atonement coalesce with one another and with the embodiment of the logos in jesus until the apotheosis of the son of man is almost or quite effected the history of christian dogma from justin to athanasius is a record of continual progress in the same direction until the fair body of religion revealed in almost naked purity by the prophets is once more hidden under a new accumulation of dogmas and of ritual practices of which the primitive nazarene knew nothing and which he would probably have regarded as blasphemous if he could have been made to understand them  as century after century the ages roll on polytheism comes back under the disguise of mariolatry and the adoration of saints imageworship becomes as rampant as in old egypt adoration of relics takes the place of the old fetishworship the virtues of the ephod pale before those of holy coats and handkerchiefs shrines and calvaries make up for the loss of the ark and of the high places and even the lustral fluid of paganism is replaced by holy water at the porches of the temples a touching ceremonythe common meal originally eaten in pious memory of a loved teacherbecomes metamorphosed into a fleshandblood sacrifice supposed to possess exactly that redeeming virtue which the prophets denied to the fleshandblood sacrifices of their day while the minute observance of ritual is raised to a degree of punctilious refinement which levitical legislators might envy and with the growth of this theology grew its inevitable concomitant the belief in evil spirits in possession in sorcery in charms and omens until the christians of the twelfth century after our era were sunk in more debased and brutal superstitions than are recorded of the israelites in the twelfth century before it  the greatest men of the middle ages are unable to escape the infection dantes inferno would be revolting if it were not so often sublime so often exquisitely tender the hideous pictures which cover a vast space on the south wall of the campo santo of pisa convey information as terrible as it is indisputable of the theological conceptions of dantes countrymen in the fourteenth century whose eyes were addressed by the painters of those disgusting scenes and whose approbation they knew how to win a candid mexican of the time of cortez could he have seen this christian burialplace would have taken it for an appropriately adorned teocalli the professed disciple of the god of justice and of mercy might there gloat over the sufferings of his fellowmen depicted as undergoing every extremity of atrocious and sanguinary torture to all eternity for theological errors no less than for moral delinquencies while in the central figure of satan 35 occupied in champing up souls in his capacious and welltoothed jaws to void them again for the purpose of undergoing fresh suffering we have the counterpart of the strange polynesian and egyptian dogma that there were certain gods who employed themselves in devouring the ghostly flesh of the spirits of the dead but in justice to the polynesians it must be recollected that after three such operations they thought the soul was purified and happy in the view of the christian theologian the operation was only a preparation for new tortures continued for ever and aye  with the growth of civilisation in europe and with the revival of letters and of science in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the ethical and intellectual criticism of theology once more recommenced and arrived at a temporary restingplace in the confessions of the various reformed protestant sects in the sixteenth century almost all of which as soon as they were strong enough began to persecute those who carried criticism beyond their own limit but the movement was not arrested by these ecclesiastical barriers as their constructors fondly imagined it would be it was continued tacitly or openly by galileo by hobbes by descartes and especially by spinoza in the seventeenth century by the english freethinkers by rousseau by the french encyclopaedists and by the german rationalists among whom lessing stands out a head and shoulders taller than the rest throughout the eighteenth century by the historians the philologers the biblical critics the geologists and the biologists in the nineteenth century until it is obvious to all who can see that the moral sense and the really scientific method of seeking for truth are once more predominating over false science once more ethics and theology are parting company  it is my conviction that with the spread of true scientific culture whatever may be the medium historical philological philosophical or physical through which that culture is conveyed and with its necessary concomitant a constant elevation of the standard of veracity the end of the evolution of theology will be like its beginningit will cease to have any relation to ethics i suppose that so long as the human mind exists it will not escape its deepseated instinct to personify its intellectual conceptions the science of the present day is as full of this particular form of intellectual shadowworship as is the nescience of ignorant ages the difference is that the philosopher who is worthy of the name knows that his personified hypotheses such as law and force and ether and the like are merely useful symbols while the ignorant and the careless take them for adequate expressions of reality so it may be that the majority of mankind may find the practice of morality made easier by the use of theological symbols and unless these are converted from symbols into idols i do not see that science has anything to say to the practice except to give an occasional warning of its dangers but when such symbols are dealt with as real existences i think the highest duty which is laid upon men of science is to show that these dogmatic idols have no greater value than the fabrications of mens hands the stocks and the stones which they have replaced     footnotes  footnote 1 even the most sturdy believers in the popular theory that the proper or titular names attached to the books of the bible are those of their authors will hardly be prepared to maintain that jephthah gideon and their colleagues wrote the book of judges nor is it easily admissible that samuel wrote the two books which pass under his name one of which deals entirely with events which took place after his death in fact no one knows who wrote either judges or samuel nor when within the range of 100 years their present form was given to these books  footnote 2 my citations are taken from the revised version but for lord and god i have substituted jahveh and elohim  footnote 3 i need hardly say that i depend upon authoritative biblical critics whenever a question of interpretation of the text arises as reuss appears to me to be one of the most learned acute and fairminded of those whose works i have studied i have made most use of the commentary and dissertations in his splendid french edition of the bible but i have also had recourse to the works of dillman kalisch kuenen thenius tuch and others in cases in which another opinion seemed desirable  footnote 4 see divination by hazoral journal of anthropology bombay vol i no 1  footnote 5 see for example the message of jephthah to the king of the ammonites so now jahveh the elohim of israel hath dispossessed the amorites from before his people israel and shouldest thou possess them wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy elohim giveth thee to possess jud xi 23 24 for jephthah chemosh is obviously as real a personage as jahveh  footnote 6 for example my oblation my food for my offerings made by fire of a sweet savour to me shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season num xxviii 2  footnote 7 in 2 samuel xv 27 david says to zadok the priest art thou not a seer and gad is called davids seer  footnote 8 this would at first appear to be inconsistent with the use of the word prophetess for deborah but it does not follow because the writer of judges applies the name to deborah that it was used in her day  footnote 9 samuel tells the cook bring the potion which i gave thee of which i said to thee set it by thee it was therefore samuels to give and the cook took up the thigh or shoulder and that which was upon it and set it before saul but in the levitical regulations it is the thigh or shoulder which becomes the priests own property and the right thigh or shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heaveoffering which is given along with the wave breast unto aaron the priest and unto his sons as a due for ever from the children of israel lev vii 3134 reuss writes on this passage la cuisse nest point agitee mais simplement prelevee sur ce que les convives mangeront  footnote 10 see for example elkanahs sacrifice 1 sam i 39  footnote 11 the ghost was not supposed to be capable of devouring the gross material substance of the offering but his vaporous body appropriated the smoke of the burnt sacrifice the visible and odorous exhalations of other offerings the blood of the victim was particularly useful because it was thought to be the special seat of its soul or life a west african negro replied to an european sceptic of course the spirit cannot eat corporeal food but he extracts its spiritual part and as we see leaves the material part behind lippert seelencult p 16  footnote 12 it is further well worth consideration whether indications of former ancestorworship are not to be found in the singular weight attached to the veneration of parents in the fourth commandment it is the only positive commandment in addition to those respecting the deity and that concerning the sabbath and the penalties for infringing it were of the same character in china a corresponding reverence for parents is part and parcel of ancestorworship so in ancient rome and in greece where parents were even called secondary and earthly the fifth commandment as it stands would be an excellent compromise between ancestorworship and monotheism the larger hereditary share allotted by israelitic law to the eldest son reminds one of the privileges attached to primogeniture in ancient rome which were closely connected with ancestorworship there is a good deal to be said in favour of the speculation that the ark of the covenant may have been a relic of ancestorworship but that topic is too large to be dealt with incidentally in this place  footnote 13 the scientific aspects of positivism fortnightly review 1869 republished in lay sermons  footnote 14 oeuvres de bossuet ed 1808 t xxxv p 282  footnote 15 i should like further to add the expression of my indebtedness to two works by herr julius lippert der seelencult in seinen beziehungen zur althebraischen religion and die religionen der europaischen culturvolker both pubished in 1881 i have found them full of valuable suggestions  footnote 16 see among others the remarkable work of fustel de coulanges la cite antique in which the social importance of the old roman ancestorworship is brought out with great clearness  footnote 17 supposed to be the finer or more aeriform part of the body standing in the same relation to the body as the perfume and the more essential qualities of a flower do to the more solid substances mariner vol ii p 127  footnote 18 a kind of clients in the roman sense  footnote 19 it is worthy of remark that greek among the greeks and deus among the romans had the same wide signification the dii manes were ghosts of ancestorsatuas of the family  footnote 20 voyages aux iles du grand ocean t i p 482  footnote 21 te ika a maui new zealand and its inhabitants p 72  footnote 22 compare and samuel said unto saul why hast thou disquieted me i sam xxviii l5  footnote 23 turner nineteen years in polynesia p 238  footnote 24 see lipperts excellent remarks on this subject der seelencult p 89  footnote 25 sciography has the authority of cudworth intellectual system vol ii p 836 sciomancy greek which in the sense of divination by ghosts may be found in baileys dictionary 1751 also furnishes a precedent for my coinage  footnote 26 kami is used in the sense of elohim and is also like our word lord employed as a title of respect among men as indeed elohim was  footnote 27 the assyrians thus raised assur to a position of preeminence  footnote 28 i refer those who wish to know the reasons which lead me to take up this position to the works of reuss and wellhausen and especially to stades geschichte des volkes israel  footnote 29 bunsen egypts place vol v p129 note  footnote 30 see birch in egypts place vol v and brugsch history of egypt  footnote 31 even by graetz who though a fair enough historian cannot be accused of any desire to overestimate the importance of egyptian influence upon his people  footnote 32 graetz geschichte der juden bd i p 370  footnote 33 see the careful analsyis of the work of the alexandrian philosopher and theologian who it should be remembered was a most devout jew held in the highest esteem by his countrymen in siegfrieds philo von alexandrien 1875 also dr j drummonds philo judaeus 1888  footnote 34 i am not unaware of the existence of many and widely divergent sects and schools among the jews at all periods of their history since the dispersion but i imagine that orthodox judaism is now pretty much what it was in philos time while peter and paul if they could return to life would certainly have to learn the catechism of either the roman greek or anglican churches if they desired to be considered orthodox christians  footnote 35 dantes description of lucifer engaged in the eternal mastication of brutus cassius and judas iscariot     da ogni bocca
