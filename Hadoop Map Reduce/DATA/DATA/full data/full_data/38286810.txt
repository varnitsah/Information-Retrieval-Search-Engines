38286810	ragged lady  by william dean howells     part 1     i  it was their first summer at middlemount and the landers did not know the roads when they came to a place where they had a choice of two she said that now he must get out of the carryall and ask at the house standing a little back in the edge of the pine woods which road they ought to take for south middlemount she alleged many cases in which they had met trouble through his perverse reluctance to find out where they were before he pushed rashly forward in their drives whilst she urged the facts she reached forward from the back seat where she sat and held her hand upon the reins to prevent his starting the horse which was impartially cropping first the sweet fern on one side and then the blueberry bushes on the other side of the narrow wheeltrack she declared at last that if he would not get out and ask she would do it herself and at this the dry little man jerked the reins in spite of her and the horse suddenly pulled the carryall to the right and seemed about to overset it  oh what are you doing albet mrs lander lamented falling helpless against the back of her seat havent i always told you to speak to the hoss fust  he wouldnt have minded my speakin said her husband im goin to take you up to the dooa so that you can ask for youaself without gettin out  this was so well in view of mrs landers age and bulk and the hardship she must have undergone if she had tried to carry out her threat that she was obliged to take it in some sort as a favor and while the vehicle rose and sank over the surface left rough after building in front of the house like a vessel on a chopping sea she was silent for several seconds  the house was still in a raw state of unfinish though it seemed to have been lived in for a year at least the earth had been banked up at the foundations for warmth in winter and the sheathing of the walls had been splotched with irregular spaces of weather boarding there was a good roof over all but the windowcasings had been merely set in their places and the trim left for a future impulse of the builder a block of wood suggested the intention of steps at the front door which stood hospitably open but remained unresponsive for some time after the landers made their appeal to the house at large by anxious noises in their throats and by talking loud with each other and then talking low they wondered whether there were anybody in the house and decided that there must be for there was smoke coming out of the stove pipe piercing the roof of the wing at the rear  mr lander brought himself under censure by venturing without his wifes authority to lean forward and tap on the doorframe with the butt of his whip at the sound a shrill voice called instantly from the region of the stove pipe clem clementina go to the front dooa thees somebody knockin the sound of feet soft and quick made itself heard within and in a few moments a slim maid too large for a little girl too childlike for a young girl stood in the open doorway looking down on the elderly people in the buggy with a face as glad as a flowers she had blue eyes and a smiling mouth a straight nose and a pretty chin whose firm jut accented a certain wistfulness of her lips she had hair of a dull dark yellow which sent out from its thick mass light prongs or tendrils curving inward again till they delicately touched it her tanned face was not very different in color from her hair and neither were her bare feet which showed well above her ankles in the calico skirt she wore at sight of the elders in the buggy she involuntarily stooped a little to lengthen her skirt in effect and at the same time she pulled it together sidewise to close a tear in it but she lost in her anxiety no ray of the joy which the mere presence of the strangers seemed to give her and she kept smiling sunnily upon them while she waited for them to speak  oh mrs lander began with involuntary apology in her tone we just wished to know which of these roads went to south middlemount weve come from the hotel and we want quite cetain  the girl laughed as she said both roads go to south middlemountm they join together again just a little piece farther on  the girl and the woman in their parlance replaced the letter r by vowel sounds almost too obscure to be represented except where it came last in a word before a word beginning with a vowel there it was annexed to the vowel by a strong liaison according to the custom universal in rural new england  oh do they said mrs lander  yesm answered the girl its a kind of tunout in the wintatime or i guess thats what made it in the beginning sometimes folks take one hand side and sometimes the other and that keeps them separate but theyre really the same road m  thank you said mrs lander and she pushed her husband to make him say something too but he remained silently intent upon the childs prettiness which her blue eyes seemed to illumine with a light of their own she had got hold of the door now and was using it as if it was a piece of drapery to hide not only the tear in her gown but somehow both her bare feet she leaned out beyond the edge of it and then at moments she vanished altogether behind it  since mr lander would not speak and made no sign of starting up his horse mrs lander added i presume you must be used to havin people ask about the road if its so puzzlin  o yesm returned the girl gladly almost every day in the summatime  you have got a pretty place for a home hee said mrs lander  well it will be when its finished up without leaning forward inconveniently mrs lander could see that the partitions of the house within were lathed but not plastered and the girl looked round as if to realize its condition and added it isnt quite finished inside  we wouldnt have troubled you said mrs lander if we had seen anybody to inquire of  yesm said the girl it ant any trouble  there are not many otha houses about very nea but i dont suppose you get lonesome young folks are plenty of company for themselves and if youve got any brothas and sistas  oh said the girl with a tender laugh ive got eva so many of them  there was a stir in the bushes about the carriage and mrs lander was aware for an instant of childrens faces looking through the leaves at her and then flashing out of sight with gay cries at being seen a boy older than the rest came round in front of the horse and passed out of sight at the corner of the house  lander now leaned back and looked over his shoulder at his wife as if he might hopefully suppose she had come to the end of her questions but she gave no sign of encouraging him to start on their way again  that your brotha too she asked the girl  yesm hes the oldest of the boys hes next to me  i dont know said mrs lander thoughtfully as i noticed how many boys there were or how many girls  ive got two sistas and three brothas m said the girl always smiling sweetly she now emerged from the shelter of the door and mrs lander perceived that the slight movements of such parts of her person as had been evident beyond its edge were the effects of some endeavor at greater presentableness she had contrived to get about her an overskirt which covered the rent in her frock and she had got a pair of shoes on her feet stockings were still wanting but by a mutual concession of her shoetops and the border of her skirt they were almost eliminated from the problem this happened altogether when the girl sat down on the threshold and got herself into such foreshortening that the eye of mrs lander in looking down upon her could not detect their absence her little head then showed in the dark of the doorway like a painted head against its background  you havent been livin here a great while by the looks said mrs lander it dont seem to be cleaed off very much  weve got quite a gadenpatch back of the house replied the girl and we should have had moa but fatha wasnt very well this spring hes eva so much better than when we fust came hee  it has the name of being a very healthy locality said mrs lander somewhat discontentedly though i cant see as its done me so very much good yit both your payrints livin  yesm oh yes indeed  and your mother is she real rugged she need to be with such a flock of little ones  yes mothas always well fatha was just run down the doctas said and ought to keep more in the open air thats what hes done since he came hee he helped a great deal on the house and he planned it all out himself  is he a capenta asked mrs lander  nom but hesi dont know how to express ithe likes to do every kind of thing  but hes got some business hant he a shadow of severity crept over mrs landers tone in provisional reprehension of possible shiftlessness  yesm he was a machinist at the mills thats what the doctas thought didnt agree with him he bought a piece of land hee so as to be in the pine woods and then we built this house  when did you say you came  two yeas ago this summa  well what did you do befoa you built this house  we camped the first summa  you camped in a tent  well it was pahtly a tent and pahtly bank  i should have thought you would have died  the girl laughed oh no we all kept fastrate we slept in the tents we had twoand we cooked in the shanty she smiled at the notion in adding at fast the neighbas thought we wee gipsies and the summa folks thought we were indians and wanted to get baskets of us  mrs lander did not know what to think and she asked but didnt it almost perish you stayin through the winter in an unfinished house  well it was pretty cold but it was so dry the air was and the woods kept the wind off nicely  the same shrill voice in the region of the stovepipe which had sent the girl to the landers now called her from them clem come here a minute  the girl said to mrs lander politely youll have to excuse me nowm ive got to go to motha  so do said mrs lander and she was so taken by the girls art and grace in getting to her feet and fading into the background of the hallway without visibly casting any detail of her raiment that she was not aware of her husbands starting up the horse in time to stop him they were fairly under way again when she lamented what you doin albet whee you goin  im goin to south middlemount didnt you want to  well of all the men drivin right off without waitin to say thankye to the child or take leave or anything  seemed to me as if she took leave  but she was comin back and i wanted to ask  i guess you asked enough for one while ask the rest tomorra  mrs lander was a woman who could often be thrown aside from an immediate purpose by the suggestion of some remoter end which had already perhaps intimated itself to her she said thats true but by the time her husband had driven down one of the roads beyond the woods into open country she was a quiver of intolerable curiosity well all ive got to say is that i shant rest till i know all about em  find out when we get back to the hotel i guess said her husband  no i cant wait till i get back to the hotel i want to know now i want you should stop at the very fust house we come to dea thee dont seem to be any houses any moa she peered out around the side of the carryall and scrutinized the landscape hold on no yes it is too whoa whoa thees a man in that hayfield now  she laid hold of the reins and pulled the horse to a stand mr lander looked round over his shoulder at her hadnt you betta wait till you get within half a mile of the man  well i want you should stop when you do git to him will you i want to speak to him and ask him all about those folks  i didnt suppose youd let me have much of a chance said her husband when he came within easy hail of the man in the hayfield he pulled up beside the meadowwall where the horse began to nibble the blackberry vines that overran it  mrs lander beckoned and called to the man who had stopped pitching hay and now stood leaning on the handle of his fork at the signs and sounds she made he came actively forward to the road bringing his fork with him when he arrived within easy conversational distance he planted the tines in the ground and braced himself at an opposite incline from the long smooth handle and waited for mrs lander to begin  will you please tell us who those folks ah livin back there in the edge of the woods in that new unfinished house  the man released his fork with one hand to stoop for a head of timothy that had escaped the scythe and he put the stem of it between his teeth where it moved up and down and whipped fantastically about as he talked before he answered you mean the claxons  i dont know what thei name is mrs lander repeated exactly what she had said  the farmer said long redheaded man kind of sicklylookin  we didnt see the man  little woman skinnylookin pootty tonguey  we didnt see her eitha but i guess we head her at the back of the house  lot o children about as big as patridges runnin round in the bushes  yes and a very prettyappearing girl about thiteen or fouteen i should think  the farmer pulled his fork out of the ground and planted it with his person at new slopes in the figure of a letter a rather more upright than before yes its them he said hant been in the neighbahood a great while eitha up from down potland way someres i guess built that house last summer as far as its got but i dont believe its goin to git much fatha  why whats the matta demanded mrs lander in an anguish of interest  the man in the hayfield seemed to think it more dignified to include lander in this inquiry and he said with a glimmer of the eye for him head of donothin folks  seen em too answered lander comprehensively  well that ant claxons complaint exactly he ant a donothin hes a doeverything i guess its about as bad lander glimmered back at the man but did not speak  kind of a machinist down at the mills where he come from the farmer began again and mrs lander eager not to be left out of the affair for a moment interrupted  yes yes thats what the gul said  but he dont seem to thinkt the ion agreed with him and now hes goin in for wood well he did have a kind of a footpowa tunin lathe and tuned all sots o things cups and bowls and uns for fenceposts and vases and sleevebuttons and little knickknacks but the place bunt down here a while back and hes been huntin round for wood the whole winta long to make canes out of for the summafolks seems to think that the smell o the wood whether its green or its dry is goin to cure him and he cant git too much of it  well i believe its so albet cried mrs lander as if her husband had disputed the theory with his taciturn back he made no other sign of controversy and the man in the hayfield went on  i hea hes goin to put up a wind mill back in an open place hes got and use the powa for tunin if he eva gits it up but he dont seem to be in any great of a hurry and they scrape along somehow wife takes in sewin and the girl woked at the middlemount house last season whole famlys got to tun in and help spot a man that can do everything  the farmer appealed with another humorous cast of his eye to lander but the old man tacitly refused to take any further part in the talk which began to flourish apace in question and answer between his wife and the man in the hayfield it seemed that the children had all inherited the fathers smartness the oldest boy could beat the nation at figures and one of the young ones could draw anything you had a mind to they were all clear up in their classes at school and yet you might say they almost ran wild between times the oldest girl was a prettybehaved little thing but the man in the hayfield guessed there was not very much to her compared with some of the boys any rate she had not the name of being so smart at school good little thing too and kind of mothered the young ones  mrs lander when she had wrung the last drop of information out of him let him crawl back to his work mentally flaccid and let her husband drive on but under a fire of conjecture and asseveration that was scarcely intermitted till they reached their hotel that night she talked along time about their afternoons adventure before she allowed him to go to sleep she said she must certainly see the child again that they must drive down there in the morning and ask her all about herself  albet she concluded i wish we had her to live with us yes i do i wonder if we could get her to you know i always did want to adopt a baby  you neva said so mr lander opened his mouth almost for the first time since the talk began  i didnt suppose youd like it said his wife  well she ant a baby i guess youd find you had your hands full takon a halfgrown gul like that to bring up  i shouldnt be afraid any the wife declared she has just twined herself round my heat i cant get her pretty looks out of my eyes i know shes good  well see how you feel about it in the morning  the old man began to wind his watch and his wife seemed to take this for a sign that the incident was closed for the present at least he seldom talked but there came times when he would not even listen one of these was the time after he had wound his watch a minute later he had undressed with an agility incredible of his years and was in bed as effectively blind and deaf to his wifes appeals as if he were already asleep     ii  when albert gallatin lander he was named for an early secretary of the treasury as a tribute to the statesmans financial policy went out of business his wife began to go out of health and it became the most serious affair of his declining years to provide for her invalid fancies he would have liked to buy a place in the boston suburbs he preferred one of the newtons where they could both have had something to do she inside of the house and he outside but she declared that what they both needed was a good long rest with freedom from care and trouble of every kind she broke up their establishment in boston and stored their furniture and she would have made him sell the simple old house in which they had always lived on an unfashionable upanddownhill street of the west end if he had not taken one of his stubborn stands and let it for a term of years without consulting her but she had her way about their own movements and they began that life of hotels which they had now lived so long that she believed any other impossible its luxury and idleness had told upon each of them with diverse effect  they had both entered upon it in much the same corporal figure but she had constantly grown in flesh while he had dwindled away until he was not much more than half the weight of his prime their digestion was alike impaired by their joint life but as they took the same medicines mrs lander was baffled to account for the varying result she was sure that all the anxiety came upon her and that logically she was the one who ought to have wasted away but she had before her the spectacle of a husband who while he gave his entire attention to her health did not audibly or visibly worry about it and yet had lost weight in such measure that upon trying on a pair of his old trousers taken out of storage with some clothes of her own he found it impossible to use the side pockets which the change in his figure carried so far to the rear when the garment was reduced at the waist at the same time her own dresses of ten years earlier would not half meet round her and one of the most corroding cares of a woman who had done everything a woman could to get rid of care was what to do with those things which they could neither of them ever wear again she talked the matter over with herself before her husband till he took the desperate measure of sending them back to storage and they had been left there in the spring when the landers came away for the summer  they always spent the later spring months at a hotel in the suburbs of boston where they arrived in may from a fortnight in a hotel at new york on their way up from hotels in washington ashville aiken and st augustine they passed the summer months in the mountains and early in the autumn they went back to the hotel in the boston suburbs where mrs lander considered it essential to make some sojourn before going to a boston hotel for november and december and getting ready to go down to florida in january she would not on any account have gone directly to the city from the mountains for people who did that were sure to lose the good of their summer and to feel the loss all the winter if they did not actually come down with a fever  she was by no means aware that she was a selfish or foolish person she made mr lander subscribe statedly to worthy objects in boston which she still regarded as home because they had not dwelt any where else since they ceased to live there and she took lavishly of tickets for all the charitable entertainments in the hotels where they stayed few if any guests at hotels enjoyed so much honor from porters bellboys waiters chambermaids and bootblacks as the landers for they gave richly in fees for every conceivable service which could be rendered them they went out of their way to invent debts of gratitude to menials who had done nothing for them he would make the boy who sold papers at the diningroom door keep the change when he had been charged a profit of a hundred per cent already and she would let no driver who had plundered them according to the carriage tariff escape without something for himself  a sense of their munificence penetrated the clerks and proprietors with a just esteem for guests who always wanted the best of everything and questioned no bill for extras mrs lander in fact who ruled these expenditures had no knowledge of the value of things and made her husband pay whatever was asked yet when they lived under their own roof they had lived simply and lander had got his money in an oldfashioned business way and not in some delirious speculation such as leaves a man reckless of money afterwards he had been first of all a tailor and then he had gone into boys and youths clothing in a small way and finally he had mastered this business and come out at the top with his hands full he invested his money so prosperously that the income for two elderly people who had no children and only a few outlying relations on his side was far beyond their wants or even their whims  she as a woman who in spite of her bulk and the jellylike majesty with which she shook in her smoothly casing brown silks as she entered hotel diningrooms and the severity with which she frowned over her fan down the length of the hotel drawingrooms betrayed more than her husband the commonness of their origin she could not help talking and her accent and her diction gave her away for a middleclass new england person of village birth and unfashionable sojourn in boston he on the contrary lurked about the hotels where they passed their days in a silence so dignified that when his verbs and nominatives seemed not to agree you accused your own hearing he was correctly dressed as an elderly man should be in the yesterday of the fashions and he wore with impressiveness a silk hat whenever such a hat could be worn a pair of drab cloth gaiters did much to identify him with an old school of gentlemen not very definite in time or place he had a full gray beard cut close and he was in the habit of pursing his mouth a great deal but he meant nothing by it and his wife meant nothing by her frowning they had no wish to subdue or overawe any one or to pass for persons of social distinction they really did not know what society was and they were rather afraid of it than otherwise as they caught sight of it in their journeys and sojourns they led a life of public seclusion and dwelling forever amidst crowds they were all in all to each other and nothing to the rest of the world just as they had been when they resided as they would have said on pinckney street in their own house they had never entertained though they sometimes had company in the style of the country town where mrs lander grew up as soon as she was released to the grandeur of hotel life she expanded to the full measure of its responsibilities and privileges but still without seeking to make it the basis of approach to society among the people who surrounded her she had not so much acquaintance as her husband even who talked so little that he needed none she sometimes envied his ease in getting on with people when he chose and his boldness in speaking to fellow guests and fellow travellers if he really wanted anything she wanted something of them all the time she wanted their conversation and their companionship but in her ignorance of the social arts she was thrown mainly upon the compassion of the chambermaids she kept these talking as long as she could detain them in her rooms and often fed them candy which she ate herself with childish greed to bribe them to further delays if she was staying some days in a hotel she sent for the housekeeper and made all she could of her as a listener and as soon as she settled herself for a week she asked who was the best doctor in the place with doctors she had no reserves and she poured out upon them the history of her diseases and symptoms in an inexhaustible flow of statement conjecture and misgiving which was by no means affected by her profound and inexpugnable ignorance of the principles of health from time to time she forgot which side her liver was on but she had been doctored as she called it for all her organs and she was willing to be doctored for any one of them that happened to be in the place where she fancied a present discomfort she was not insensible to the claims which her husbands disorders had upon science and she liked to end the tale of her own sufferings with some such appeal as i wish you could do something for mr landa too docta she made him take a little of each medicine that was left for her but in her presence he always denied that there was anything the matter with him though he was apt to follow the doctor out of the room and get a prescription from him for some ailment which he professed not to believe in himself but wanted to quiet mrs landers mind about  he rose early both from long habit and from the scant sleep of an elderly man he could not lie in bed but his wife always had her breakfast there and remained so long that the chambermaid had done up most of the other rooms and had leisure for talk with her as soon as he was awake he stole softly out and was the first in the diningroom for breakfast he owned to casual acquaintance in moments of expansion that breakfast was his best meal but he did what he could to make it his worst by beginning with oranges and oatmeal going forward to beefsteak and fried potatoes and closing with griddle cakes and syrup washed down with a cup of cocoa which his wife decided to be wholesomer than coffee by the time he had finished such a repast he crept out of the diningroom in a state of tension little short of anguish which he confided to the sympathy of the bootblack in the washroom  he always went from having his shoes polished to get a toothpick at the clerks desk and at the middlemount house the morning after he had been that drive with mrs lander he lingered a moment with his elbows beside the register how about a buckboad he asked  something you can drive yourselfthe clerk professionally dropped his eye to the registermr lander  well no i guess not this time the little man returned after a moments reflection know anything of a family named claxon down the road here a piece he twisted his head in the direction he meant  this is my first season at middlemount but i guess mr atwell will know the clerk called to the landlord who was smoking in his private room behind the office and the landlord came out the clerk repeated mr landers questions  pootty good kind of folks i guess said the landlord provisionally through his cigarsmoke mans a kind of univussal genius but hes got a nice family of children smaht as traps all of em  how about that oldest gul asked mr lander  well thea said the landlord taking the cigar out of his mouth i think shes about the nicest little thing goin weve had her up hee to help out in a busy time last summer and shes got moo sense than guls twice as old takes hold likelightnin  about how old did you say she was  well youve got me thea mr landa i guess ill ask mis atwell  thees no hurry said lander that buckboad be round pretty soon he asked of the clerk  be right along now mr lander said the clerk soothingly he stepped out to the platform that the teams drove up to from the stable and came back to say that it was coming i believe you said you wanted something you could drive yourself  no i didnt young man answered the elder sharply but the next moment he added come to think of it i guess its just as well you neednt get me no driver i guess i know the way well enough you put me in a hitchin strap  all right mr lander said the clerk meekly  the landlord had caught the peremptory note in landers voice and he came out of his room again to see that there was nothing going wrong  its all right said lander and went out and got into his buckboard  same horse you had yesterday said the young clerk you dont need to spare the whip  i guess i can look out for myself said lander and he shook the reins and gave the horse a smart cut as a hint of what he might expect  the landlord joined the clerk in looking after the brisk start the horse made not the way he set off with the old lady yesterday suggested the clerk  the landlord rolled his cigar round in his tubed lips i guess hes used to ridin after a good hoss he added gravely to the clerk you dont want to make very free with that man mr pane he wont stan it and hes a class of custom that you want to cata to when it comes in your way i suspicioned what he was when they came here and took the highest cost rooms without tunin a haia theyre a class of custom that you wont get outside the big hotels in the big resots yes sir said the landlord taking a fresh start theyre them kind of folks that live the whole yea round in hotels noth in summa south in winta and city hotels between times they want the best their money can buy and they got plenty of it shehe meant mrs landerhas been tellin my wife how they do she likes to talk a little betta than he doos and i guess when it comes to society theyre away up and they wont stun any nonsense     iii  lander came into his wifes room between ten and eleven oclock and found her still in bed but with her halffinished breakfast on a tray before her as soon as he opened the door she said i do wish you would take some of that heattonic of mine albet that the docta left for me in boston youll find it in the upper right bureau box thea and i know itll be the very thing for you itll relieve you of that suffocatin feeling that i always have comin up stars dea i dont see why they dont have an elevata they make you pay enough and i wish youd get me a little more silva sost i can give to the chambamaid and the bellboy i do hate to be out of it i guess you been up and out long ago they did make that polonaise of mine too tight after all i said and ive been thinkin how i could get it alted but i presume there aint a seamstress to be had around hee for love or money well now thats right albet im glad to see you doin it  lander had opened the lid of the bureau box and uncorked a bottle from it and tilted this to his lips  dont take too much she cautioned him or youll lose the effects when i take too much of a medicine its wose than nothing as fahs i can make out when i had that spell in thomasville spring before last i believe i should have been over it twice as quick if i had taken just half the medicine i did you dont really feel anyways bad about the heat do you albet  im all right said lander he put back the bottle in its place and sat down  mrs lander lifted herself on her elbow and looked over at him show me on the bottle how much you took  he got the bottle out again and showed her with his thumb nail a point which he chose at random  well that was just about the dose for you she said and she sank down in bed again with the air of having used a final precaution you dont want to slow your heat up too quick  lander did not put the bottle back this time he kept it in his hand with his thumb on the cork and rocked it back and forth on his knees as he spoke why dont you get that woman to alter it for you  what woman alta what  your polonaise the one whee we stopped yestaday  oh well ive been thinkin about that child albet i did before i went to sleep and i dont believe i want to risk anything with her it would be a cae said mrs lander with a sigh and i guess i dont want to take any moa cae than what ive got now what makes you think she could alta my polonaise  said she done dressmakin said lander doggedly  you hant been thea  he nodded  you didnt say anything to her about her daughta  yes i did said lander  well you cetainly do equal anything said his wife she lay still awhile and then she roused herself with indignant energy well then i can tell you what albet landa you can go right straight and take back everything you said i dont want the child and i wont have her ive got care enough to worry me now i should think and we should have her whole family on our hands with that shiftless father of hers and the whole pack of her brothas and sistas what made you think i wanted you to do such a thing  you wanted me to do it last night wouldnt hadly let me go to bed  yes and how many times have i told you nova to go off and do a thing that i wanted you to unless you asked me if i did must i die befoe you can find out that there is such a thing as talkin and such anotha thing as doin you wouldnt get yourself into half as many scrapes if you talked more and done less in this wold lander rose  wait hold on what are you going to say to the pooa thing shell be so disappointed  i dont know as i shall need to say anything myself answered the little man at his dryest leave that to you  well i can tell you returned his wife im not goin nea them again and if you thinkwhat did you ask the woman anyway  i asked her he said if she wanted to let the gul come and see you about some sewing you had to have done and she said she did  and you didnt speak about havin her come to live with us  no  well why in the land didnt you say so before albet  you didnt ask me what do you want i should say to her now  say to who  the gul shes down in the pahlor waitin  well of all the men cried mrs lander but she seemed to find herself upon reflection less able to cope with lander personally than with the situation generally will you send her up albet she asked very patiently as if he might be driven to further excesses if not delicately handled as soon as he had gone out of the room she wished that she had told him to give her time to dress and have her room put in order before he sent the child up but she could only make the best of herself in bed with a cap and a breakfast jacket arranged with the help of a handglass she had to get out of bed to put her other clothes away in the closet and she seized the chance to push the breakfast tray out of the door and smooth up the bed while she composed her features and her ideas to receive her visitor both from long habit rather than from any cause or reason were of a querulous cast and her ordinary tone was a snuffle expressive of deepseated affliction she was at once plaintive and voluable and in moments of excitement her need of freeing her mind was so great that she took herself into her own confidence and found a more sympathetic listener than when she talked to her husband as she now whisked about her room in her bedgown with an activity not predicable of her age and shape and finally plunged under the covering and drew it up to her chin with one hand while she pressed it out decorously over her person with the other she kept up a rapid flow of lamentation and conjecture i do suppose hell be right back with her before im half ready and what the man was thinkin of to do such a thing anyway i dont know i dont know as shell notice much comin out of such a lookin place as that and i dont know as i need to care if she did but if thees care anywhes around i presume im the one to have it i presume i did take a fancy to her and i guess i shall be glad to see how i like her now and if hes only told her i want some sewin done i can scrape up something to let her carry home with her its well i keep my things where i can put my hand on em at a time like this and i dont believe i shall scae the child as it is i do hope albet wont hang round half the day before he brings her i like to have a thing ova  lander wandered about looking for the girl through the parlors and the piazzas and then went to the office to ask what had become of her  the landlord came out of his room at his question to the clerk oh i guess shes round in my wifes room mr landa she always likes to see clementina and i guess they all do shes a sot o pet amongst em  no hurry said lander i guess my wife aint quite ready for her yet  well shell be right out in a minute or so said the landlord  the old man tilted his hat forward over his eyes and went to sit on the veranda and look at the landscape while he waited it was one of the loveliest landscapes in the mountains the river flowed at the foot of an abrupt slope from the road before the hotel stealing into and out of the valley and the mountains gray in the farther distance were draped with folds of cloud hanging upon their flanks and tops but lander was tired of nearly all kinds of views and prospects though he put up with them in his perpetual movement from place to place in the same resignation that he suffered the limitations of comfort in parlor cars and sleepers and the unwholesomeness of hotel tables he was chained to the restless pursuit of an ideal not his own but doomed to suffer for its impossibility as if he contrived each of his wifes disappointments from it he did not philosophize his situation but accepted it as in an order of providence which it would be useless for him to oppose though there were moments when he permitted himself to feel a modest doubt of its justice he was aware that when he had a house of his own he was master in it after a fashion and that as long as he was in business he was in some sort of authority he perceived that now he was a slave to the wishes of a mistress who did not know what she wanted and that he was never farther from pleasing her than when he tried to do what she asked he could not have told how all initiative had been taken from him and he had fallen into the mere follower of a woman guided only by her whims who had no object in life except to deprive it of all object he felt no rancor toward her for this he knew that she had a tender regard for him and that she believed she was considering him first in her most selfish arrangements he always hoped that sometime she would get tired of her restlessness and be willing to settle down again in some stated place and wherever it was he meant to get into some kind of business again till this should happen he waited with an apathetic patience of which his present abeyance was a detail he would hardly have thought it anything unfit and certainly nothing surprising that the landlady should have taken the young girl away from where he had left her and then in the pleasure of talking with her and finding her a centre of interest for the whole domestic force of the hotel should have forgotten to bring her back  the middlemount house had just been organized on the scale of a first class hotel with prices that had risen a little in anticipation of the other improvements the landlord had hitherto united in himself the functions of clerk and head waiter but he had now got a senior who was working his way through college to take charge of the diningroom and had put in the office a youth of a years experience as under clerk at a city hotel but he meant to relinquish no more authority than his wife who frankly kept the name as well as duty of housekeeper it was in making her morning inspection of the dusting that she found clementina in the parlor where lander had told her to sit down till he should come for her  why clem she said i didnt know you you have grown so youa folks all well i declae you ah quite a woman now she added as the girl stood up in her slender graceful height you look as pretty as a pink in that hat make that dress youaself well you do beat the witch i want you should come to my room with me  mrs atwell showered other questions and exclamations on the girl who explained how she happened to be there and said that she supposed she must stay where she was for fear mr lander should come back and find her gone but mrs atwell overruled her with the fact that mrs landers breakfast had just gone up to her and she made her come out and see the new features of the enlarged housekeeping in the diningroom there were some of the waitresses who had been there the summer before and recognitions of more or less dignity passed between them and clementina the place was now shut against guests and the headwaiter was having it put in order for the one oclock dinner as they came near him mrs atwell introduced him to clementina and he behaved deferentially as if she were some young lady visitor whom mrs atwell was showing the improvements but he seemed harassed and impatient as if he were anxious about his duties and eager to get at them again he was a handsome little fellow with hair lighter than clementinas and a sanguine complexion and the color coming and going  hes smaht said mrs atwell when they had left himhe held the diningroom door open for them and bowed them out i dont know but he worries almost too much thatll wear off when he gets things runnin to suit him hes pretty pticla now ill show you how theyve made the office over and built in a room for mr atwell behind it  the landlord welcomed clementina as if she had been some acceptable class of custom and when the tall young clerk came in to ask him something and mrs atwell said i want to introduce you to miss claxon mr fane the clerk smiled down upon her from the height of his smooth acquiline young face which he held bent encouragingly upon one side  now i want you should come in and see where i live a minute said mrs atwell she took the girl from the clerk and led her to the official housekeepers room which she said had been prepared for her so that folks need not keep running to her in her private room where she wanted to be alone with her children when she was there why you ant much moa than a child youaself clem and here i be talkin to you as if you was a mother in israel how old ah you this summa time does go so  im sixteen now said clementina smiling  you be well i dont see why i say that eitha youre full lahge enough for your age but not seein you in long dresses before i didnt realize your age so much my but you do all of you know how to do things  im about the only one that dont mrs atwell said the girl if it hadnt been for mother i dont believe i could have eva finished this dress she began to laugh at something passing in her mind and mrs atwell laughed too in sympathy though she did not know what at till clementina said why mrs atwell nealy the whole family woked on this dress jim drew the patten of it from the dress of one of the summa boadas that he took a fancy to at the centa and fatha cut it out and i helped motha make it i guess every one of the children helped a little  well its just as i said you can all of you do things said mrs atwell but i guess you ah the one that keeps em straight what did you say mr landa said his wife wanted of you  he said some kind of sewing that motha could do  well ill tell you what now if she hant really got anything that your mothall want you to help with i wish youd come here again and help me i tuned my foot here twothree weeks back and i feel it times and i should like some one to do about half my steppin for me i dont want to take you away from her but if you shant go int the dininroom or be under anybodys oddas but mine now will you  ill see mrs atwell i dont like to say anything till i know what mrs landa wants  well thats right i declae youve got moa judgment thats what i used to say about you last summa to my husband shes got judgment well whats wanted mrs atwell spoke to her husband who had opened her door and looked in and she stopped rocking while she waited his answer  i guess you dont want to keep clementina from mr landa much longa hes settin out there on the front piazza waitin for her  well thea cried mrs atwell aint that just like me why didnt you tell me sooner alonzo dont you forgit what i said clem     iv  mrs lander had taken twice of a specific for what she called her nervefag before her husband came with clementina and had rehearsed aloud many of the things she meant to say to the girl in spite of her preparation they were all driven out of her head when clementina actually appeared and gave her a bow like a young birchs obeisance in the wind  take a chaia said lander pushing her one and the girl tilted over toward him before she sank into it he went out of the room and left mrs lander to deal with the problem alone she apologized for being in bed but clementina said so sweetly mr landa told me you were not feeling very well m that she began to be proud of her ailments and bragged of them at length and of the different doctors who had treated her for them while she talked she missed one thing or another and clementina seemed to divine what it was she wanted and got it for her with a gentle deference which made the elder feel her age cushioned by the girls youth when she grew a little heated from the interest she took in her personal annals and cast off one of the folds of her bed clothing clementina got her a fan and asked her if she should put up one of the windows a little  how you do think of things said mrs lander i guess i will let you i presume you get used to thinkin of othas in a lahge family like youas i dont suppose they could get along without you very well she suggested  ive neva been away except last summa for a little while  and where was you then  i was helping mrs atwell  did you like it  i dont know said clementina its pleasant to be whee things ah going on  yesfor young folks said mrs lander whom the going on of things had long ceased to bring pleasure  its real nice at home too said clementina we have very good timesevenings in the winta in the summer its very nice in the woods around there its safe for the children and they enjoy it and fatha likes to have them motha dont cae so much about it i guess shed ratha have the house fixed up more and the place fathas going to do it pretty soon he thinks thees time enough  thats the way with men said mrs lander they always think thes time enough but i like to have things over and done with what chuhch do you tend  well there isnt any but the episcopal clementina answered i go to that and some of the children go to the sunday school i dont believe fatha caes very much for going to chuhch but he likes mr richling hes the recta they take walks in the woods and they go up the mountains togetha  they want said mrs lander severely to be caeful how they drink of them cold brooks when theyre heated mr richling a married man  oh yesm but they havent got any family  if i could see his wife i shd caution her about lettin him climb mountains too much ant your father afraid hell ovado  i dont know he thinks he cant be too much in the open air on the mountains  well he may not have the same complaint as mr landa but i know if i was to climb a mountain it would lay me up for a yea  the girl did not urge anything against this conviction she smiled politely and waited patiently for the next turn mrs landers talk should take which was oddly enough toward the business clementina had come upon  i declare i most forgot about my polonaise mr landa said your motha thought she could do something to it for me  yesm  well i may as well let you see it if youll reach into that fuhthest closet youll find it on the last uppa hook on the right hand and if youll give it to me ill show you what i want done dont mind the looks of that closet ive just tossed my things in till i could get a little time and strenth to put em in odda  clementina brought the polonaise to mrs lander who sat up and spread it before her on the bed and had a happy half hour in telling the girl where she had bought the material and where she had it made up and how it came home just as she was going away and she did not find out that it was all wrong till a week afterwards when she tried it on by the end of this time the girl had commended herself so much by judicious and sympathetic assent that mrs lander learned with a shock of disappointment that her mother expected her to bring the garment home with her where mrs lander was to come and have it fitted over for the alterations she wanted made  but i supposed from what mr landa said that your motha would come here and fit me she lamented  i guess he didnt undastand m motha doesnt eva go out to do wok said clementina gently but firmly  well i might have known mr landa would mix it up if it could be mixed mrs landers sense of injury was aggravated by her suspicion that he had brought the girl in the hope of pleasing her and confirming her in the wish to have her with them she was not a woman who liked to have her way in spite of herself she wished at every step to realize that she was taking it and that no one else was taking it for her  well she said dryly i shall have to see about it im a good deal of an invalid and i dont know as i could go back and foth to try on im moa used to havin the things brought to me  yesm said clementina she moved a little from the bed on her way to the door to be ready for mrs lander in leavetaking  im real sorry said mrs lander i presume its a disappointment for you too  oh not at all answered clementina im sorry we cant do the wok hea but i know mocha wouldnt like to goodmoningm  no no dont go yet a minute wont you just give me my hand bag off the bureau thea mrs lander entreated and when the girl gave her the bag she felt about among the banknotes which she seemed to have loose in it and drew out a handful of them without regard to their value hea she said and she tried to put the notes into clementinas hand i want you should get yourself something  the girl shrank back oh nom she said with an effect of seeming to know that her refusal would hurt and with the wish to soften it icouldnt indeed i couldnt  why couldnt you now you must if i cant let you have the wok the way you want i dont think its fair and you ought to have the money for it just the same  clementina shook her head smiling i dont believe motha would like to have me take it  oh now pshaw said mrs lander inadequately i want you should take this for youaself and if you dont want to buy anything to wea you can get something to fix your room up with dont you be afraid of robbin us land we got moa money now you take this  mrs lander reached the money as far toward clementina as she could and shook it in the vehemence of her desire  thank you i couldnt take it clementina persisted im afraid i must be going i guess i must bid you goodmoning  why i believe the childs scaed of me but you neednt be dont you suppose i know how you feel you set down in that chaia there and ill tell you how you feel i guess weve been pooa tooi dont mean anything that ant exactly rightand i guess ive had the same feelins you think its demeanin to you to take it ant that it clementina sank provisionally upon the edge of the chair well it did use to be so consided but its all changed nowadays we travel pretty nee the whole while mr lander and me and we see folks everywhere and it ant the custom to refuse any moa now ant there any little thing for your own room there in your nice new house or something your mothas got her heat set on or one of your brothas my if you dont have it some one else will do take it  the girl kept slipping toward the door i shouldnt know what to tell them when i got home they would think i must beout of my senses  i guess you mean theyd think i was now listen to me a minute mrs lander persisted  you just take this money and when you get home you tell your mother every word about it and if she says you bring it right straight back to me now cant you do that  i dont know but i can clementina faltered well then take it mrs lander put the bills into her hand but she did not release her at once she pulled clementina down and herself up till she could lay her other arm on her neck i want you should let me kiss you will you  why certainly said clementina and she kissed the old woman  you tell your mother im comin to see her before i go and i guess said mrs lander in instant expression of the idea that came into her mind we shall be goin pretty soon now  yesm said clementina  she went out and shortly after lander came in with a sort of hopeful apathy in his face  mrs lander turned her head on her pillow and so confronted him albet what made you want me to see that child  lander must have perceived that his wife meant business and he came to it at once i thought you might take a fancy to her and get her to come and live with us  yes  were both of us gettin pretty well on and youd ought to have somebody to look after you ifim not around you want somebody that can do for you and keep you company and read to you and talk to youwell moa like a daughta than a suvvantsomebody that youd get attached to maybe  and dont you see mrs lander broke out severely upon him what a cae that would be why its got so already that i cant help thinkin about her the whole while and if i got attached to her id have her on my mind day and night and the moa she done for me the more i should be tewin around to do for her i shouldnt have any peace of my life any moa cant you see that  i guess if you see it i dont need to said lander  well then i want you shouldnt eva mention her to me again ive had the greatest escape but ive got her off home and ive give her money enough had a time with her about itso that they wont feel as if wed made em trouble for nothing and now i neva want to hear of her again i dont want we should stay here a great while longer i shall be frettin if im in reach of her and i shant get any good of the aia will you promise  yes  well then mrs lander turned her face upon the pillow again in the dramatization of her exhaustion but she was not so far gone that she was insensible to the possible interest that a light rap at the door suggested she once more twisted her head in that direction and called come in  the door opened and clementina came in she advanced to the bedside smiling joyously and put the money mrs lander had given her down upon the counterpane  why you havent been home child  nom said clementina breathlessly but i couldnt take it i knew they wouldnt want me to and i thought youd like it better if i just brought it back myself goodmoning she slipped out of the door mrs lander swept the banknotes from the coverlet and pulled it over her head and sent from beneath it a stifled wail now we got to go and its all youa fault albet  lander took the money from the floor and smoothed each bill out and then laid them in a neat pile on the corner of the bureau he sighed profoundly but left the room without an effort to justify himself     v  the landers had been gone a week before clementinas mother decided that she could spare her to mrs atwell for a while it was established that she was not to serve either in the diningroom or the carving room she was not to wash dishes or to do any part of the chamber work but to carry messages and orders for the landlady and to save her steps when she wished to see the headwaiter or the headcook or to make an excuse or a promise to some of the ladyboarders or to send word to mr atwell about the buying or to communicate with the clerk about rooms taken or left  she had a good deal of dignity of her own and such a gravity in the discharge of her duties that the chef who was a middleaged yankee with grown girls of his own liked to pretend that it was mrs atwell herself who was talking with him and to discover just as she left him that it was clementina he called her the boss when he spoke of her to others in her hearing and he addressed her as boss when he feigned to find that it was not mrs atwell she did not mind that in him and let the chef have his joke as if it were not one but one day when the clerk called her boss she merely looked at him without speaking and made him feel that he had taken a liberty which he must not repeat he was a young man who much preferred a state of selfsatisfaction to humiliation of any sort and after he had endured clementinas gaze as long as he could he said perhaps you dont allow anybody but the chef to call you that  she did not answer but repeated the message mrs atwell had given her for him and went away  it seemed to him undue that a person who exchanged repartees with the young lady boarders across his desk when they came many times a day to look at the register or to ask for letters should remain snubbed by a girl who still wore her hair in a braid but he was an amiable youth and he tried to appease her by little favors and services instead of trying to bully her  he was great friends with the headwaiter whom he respected as a college student though for the time being he ranked the student socially he had him in behind the frame of letterboxes which formed a sort of little private room for him and talked with him at such hours of the forenoon and the late evening as the student was off duty he found comfort in the students fretful strength which expressed itself in the pugnacious frown of his hotlooking young face where a bright sorrel mustache was beginning to blaze on a short upper lip  fane thought himself a goodlooking fellow and he regarded his figure with pleasure as it was set off by the suit of fine gray check that he wore habitually but he thought gregorys educational advantages told in his face his own education had ended at a commercial college where he acquired a good knowledge of bookkeeping and the fine business hand he wrote but where it seemed to him sometimes that the earlier learning of the public school had been hermetically sealed within him by several coats of mathematical varnish he believed that he had once known a number of things that he no longer knew and that he had not always been so weak in his double letters as he presently found himself  one night while gregory sat on a high stool and rested his elbow on the desk before it with his chin in his hand looking down upon fane who sprawled sadly in his chair and listening to the last dance playing in the distant parlor fane said now whatll you bet that they wont every one of em come and look for a letter in her box before she goes to bed i tell you girls are queer and theres no place like a hotel to study em  i dont want to study them said gregory harshly  think greeks more worth your while or know em well enough already fane suggested  no i dont know them at all said the student  i dont believe urged the clerk as if it were relevant that theres a girl in the house that you couldnt marry if you gave your mind to it  gregory twitched irascibly i dont want to marry them  pretty cheap lot you mean well i dont know  i dont mean that retorted the student but ive got other things to think of  dont you believe the clerk modestly urged that it is natural for a manwell a young manto think about girls  i suppose it is  and you dont consider it wrong  how wrong  well a waste of time i dont know as i always think about wanting to marry em or be in love but i like to let my mind run on em theres something about a girl that well you dont know what it is exactly take almost any of em said the clerk with an air of inductive reasoning take that claxon girl now for example i dont know what it is about her shes goodlooking i dont deny that and shes got pretty manners and shes as graceful as a bird but it ant any one of em and it dont seem to be all of em put together that makes you want to keep your eyes on her the whole while ever noticed what a nice little foot shes got or her hands  no said the student  i dont mean that she ever tries to show them off though i know some girls that would but shes not that kind she aint much more than a child and yet you got to treat her just like a woman noticed the kind of way shes got  no said the student with impatience  the clerk mused with a plaintive air for a moment before he spoke well its something as if shed been trained to it so that she knew just the right thing to do every time and yet i guess its nature you know how the chef always calls her the boss that explains it about as well as anything and i presume thats what my mind was running on the other day when i called her boss but my i cant get anywhere near her since  it serves you right said gregory you had no business to tease her  now do you think it was teasing i did at first and then again it seemed to me that i came out with the word because it seemed the right one i presume i couldnt explain that to her  it wouldnt be easy  i look upon her said fane with an effect of argument in the sweetness of his smile just as i would upon any other young lady in the house do you spell apology with one p or two  one said the student and the clerk made a minute on a piece of paper  i feel badly for the girl i dont want her to think i was teasing her or taking any sort of liberty with her now would you apologize to her if you was in my place and would you write a note or just wait your chance and speak to her  gregory got down from his stool with a disdainful laugh and went out of the place you make me sick fane he said  the last dance was over and the young ladies who had been waltzing with one another came out of the parlor with gay cries and laughter like summer girls who had been at a brilliant hop and began to stray down the piazzas and storm into the office several of them fluttered up to the desk as the clerk had foretold and looked for letters in the boxes bearing their initials they called him out and asked if he had not forgotten something for them he denied it with a sad wise smile and then they tried to provoke him to a belated flirtation in lack of other material but he met their overtures discreetly and they presently said well they guessed they must go and went fane turned to encounter gregory who had come in by a side door  fane i want to beg your pardon i was rude to you just now  oh no oh no the clerk protested thats all right sit down a while cant you and talk with a fellow its early yet  no i cant i just wanted to say i was sorry i spoke in that way goodnight is there anything in particular  no goodnight i was just wondering aboutthat girl  oh     vi  gregory had an habitual severity with his own behavior which did not stop there but was always passing on to the behavior of others and his days went by in alternate offence and reparation to those he had to do with he had to do chiefly with the diningroom girls whose susceptibilities were such that they kept about their work bathed in tears or suffused with anger much of the time he was not only goodlooking but he was a college student and their feelings were ready to bud toward him in tender efflorescence but he kept them cropped and blighted by his curt words and impatient manner some of them loved him for the hurts he did them and some hated him but all agreed fondly or furiously that he was too cross for anything they were mostly young schoolmistresses and whether they were of a soft and amorous make or of a forbidding temper they knew enough in spite of their hurts to value a young fellow whose thoughts were not running upon girls all the time women even in their springtime like men to treat them as if they had souls as well as hearts and it was a saving grace in gregory that he treated them all the silliest of them as if they had souls very likely they responded more with their hearts than with their souls but they were aware that this was not his fault  the girls that waited at table saw that he did not distinguish in manner between them and the girls whom they served the knot between his brows did not dissolve in the smiling gratitude of the young ladies whom he preceded to their places and pulled out their chairs for any more than in the blandishments of a waitress who thanked him for some correction  they owned when he had been harshest that no one could be kinder if he saw a girl really trying or more patient with well meaning stupidity but some things fretted him and he was as apt to correct a girl in her grammar as in her table service out of work hours if he met any of them he recognized them with deferential politeness but he shunned occasions of encounter with them as distinctly as he avoided the ladies among the hotel guests some of the table girls pitied his loneliness and once they proposed that he should read to them on the back piazza in the leisure of their midafternoons he said that he had to keep up with his studies in all the time he could get he treated their request with grave civility but they felt his refusal to be final  he was seen very little about the house outside of his own place and function and he was scarcely known to consort with anyone but fane who celebrated his high sense of the honor to the ladyguests but if any of these would have been willing to show gregory that they considered his work to get an education as something that redeemed itself from discredit through the nobility of its object he gave them no chance to do so  the afternoon following their talk about clementina gregory looked in for fane behind the letter boxes but did not find him and the girl herself came round from the front to say that he was out buying but would be back now very soon it was occasionally the clerks business to forage among the farmers for the lighter supplies such as eggs and butter and poultry and this was the buying that clementina meant very well ill wait here for him a little while gregory answered  so do said clementina in a formula which she thought polite but she saw the frown with which gregory took a greek book from his pocket and she hurried round in front of the boxes again wondering how she could have displeased him she put her face in sight a moment to explain i have got to be here and give out the lettas till mr fane gets back and then withdrew it he tried to lose himself in his book but her tender voice spoke from time to time beyond the boxes and gregory kept listening for clementina to say nom there ant perhaps theell be something the next mail and yesm hees one and i guess this paper is for some of youa folks too  gregory shut his book with a sudden bang at last and jumped to his feet to go away  the girl came running round the corner of the boxes oh i thought something had happened  no nothing has happened said gregory with a sort of violence which was heightened by a sense of the rings and tendrils of loose hair springing from the mass that defined her pretty head dont you know that you oughtnt to say nom and yesm he demanded bitterly and then he expected to see the water come into her eyes or the fire into her cheeks  clementina merely looked interested did i say that i meant to say yes maam and no maam but i keep forgetting  you oughtnt to say anything gregory answered savagely just say yes and no and let your voice do the rest  oh said the girl with the gentlest abeyance as if charmed with the novelty of the idea i should be afraid it wasnt polite  gregory took an even brutal tone it seemed to him as if he were forced to hurt her feelings but his words in spite of his tone were not brutal they might have even been thought flattering the politeness is in the manner and you dont need anything but your manner  do you think so truly asked the girl joyously i should like to try it once  he frowned again ive no business to criticise your way of speaking  oh yesmyes maam sir i mean i mean oh yes indeed thea it does sound just as well dont it clementina laughed in triumph at the outcome of her efforts so that a reluctant visional smile came upon gregorys face too im very mach obliged to you mr gregoryi shall always want to do it if its the right way  its the right way said gregory coldly  and dont they she urged dont they really say sir and maam wheewhee you came from  he said gloomily not ladies and gentlemen servants do waiterslike me he inflicted this stab to his pride with savage fortitude and he bore with selfscorn the pursuit of her innocent curiosity  but i thoughti thought you was a college student  were gregory corrected her involuntarily and she said were i mean  im a student at college and here im a servant its all right he said with a suppressed gritting of the teeth and he added my master was the servant of the meanest and i musti beg your pardon for meddling with your manner of speaking  oh im very much obliged to you indeed i am and i shall not care if you tell me of anything thats out of the way in my talking said clementina generously  thank you i think i wont wait any longer for mr fane  why im sua hell be back very soon now ill try not to disturb you any moa  gregory turned from taking some steps towards the door and said i wish you would tell mr fane something  for you why suttainly  no for you tell him that its all right about his calling you boss  the indignant color came into clementinas face he had no business to call me that  no and he doesnt think he had now hes truly sorry for it  ill see said clementina  she had not seen by the time fane got back she received his apologies for being gone so long coldly and went away to mrs atwell whom she told what had passed between gregory and herself  is he truly so proud she asked  hes a very good young man said mrs atwell but i guess hes proud he cant help it but you can see he fights against it if i was you clem i wouldnt say anything to the guls about it  oh nomi mean no indeed i shouldnt think of it but dont you think that was funny his bringing in christ that way  well hes going to be a minister you know  is he really clementina was a while silent at last she said dont you think mr gregory has a good many freckles  well them redcomplected kind is liable to freckle said mrs atwell judicially  after rather a long pause for both of them clementina asked do you think it would be nice for me to ask mr gregory about things when i wasnt suttain  like what  ohwods and pronunciation and books to read  why i presume hed love to have you hes always correctin the guls i see him take up a book one day that one of em was readin and when she ast him about it he said it was rubbage i guess you couldnt have a betta guide  well that was what i was thinking i guess i shant do it though i shd neva have the courage clementina laughed and then fell rather seriously silent again     vii  one day the shoeman stopped his wagon at the door of the helps house and called up at its windows well guls any of you want to git a numba foua foot into a rumba two shoe today nows youa chance but you got to be quick abort it thee hart but just so many numba two shoes made and the wohlds full o rumba foua feet  the windows filled with laughing faces at the first sound of the shoemans ironical voice and at sight of his neat wagon with its drawers at the rear and sides and its buggyhood over the seat where the shoeman lounged lazily holding the reins the girls flocked down the stairs and out upon the piazza where the shoe man had handily ranged his vehicle  they began to ask him if he had not this thing and that but he said with firmness nothin but shoes guls i did carry a genl line one while of what you may call anklewea such as spats and stockins and gaitas but i nova did like to speak of such things befoa ladies and now i stick exelusively to shoes you know that well enough guls whats the use  he kept a sober face amidst the giggling that his words arousedand let his voice sink into a final note of injury  well if you dont want any shoes today i guess i must be goin he made a feint of jerking his horses reins but forebore at the entreaties that went up from the group of girls  yes we do lets see them oh dont go they chorused in an equally histrionic alarm and the shoeman got down from his perch to show his wares  now thea ladies he said pulling out one of the drawers and dangling a pair of shoes from it by the string that joined their heels thees a shoe that looks as good as any satdynight shoe you eva see looks as hansome as if it had a pasteboad sole and was split stock all through like the kind you buy for a dollar at the store and kick out in the fust walk you take with your fellar some other guls fella i dont cae which and yet thats an honest shoe made of the best of material all the way through and in the best manna just look at that shoe ladies examine it shant cost you a cent and ill pay for youa lost time myself if any complaint is made he began to toss pairs of the shoes into the crowd of girls who caught them from each other before they fell with hysterical laughter and ran away with them indoors to try them on this is a shoe that im intaducin the shoeman went on and every pair is warrantedwarranted numba two dont make any otha size because we want to cata to a strictly numba two custom if any lady doos feel em a little mite too snug im sorry for her but i cant do anything to help her in this shoe  too snug came a gay voice from indoors why my foot feels puffectly lost in this one  all right the shoeman shouted back call it a numba one shoe and then see if you cant find that lost foot in it someeres or try a little flour and see if it wont feel more at home ive head of a shoe that give that sensation of looseness by not goin on at all  the girls exulted joyfully together at the defeat of their companion but the shoeman kept a grave face while he searched out other sorts of shoes and slippers and offered them or responded to some definite demand with something as near like as he could hope to make serve the tumult of talk and laughter grew till the chef put his head out of the kitchen door and then came sauntering across the grass to the helps piazza at the same time the clerk suffered himself to be lured from his post by the excitement he came and stood beside the chef who listened to the shoemans flow of banter with a longing to take his chances with him  thats a nice hawss he said whatll you take for him  why hello said the shoeman with an eye that dwelt upon the chefs official white cap and apron you talk english dont you fust off i didnt know but it was one of them foreign dukes come ova hea to marry some oua poor millionaies daughtas the girls cried out for joy and the chef bore their mirth stoically but not without a personal relish of the shoemans upandcomingness want a hawss asked the shoeman with an air of business whatll you give  ill give you thuttyseven dollas and a half said the chef  sorry i cant take it that hawss is sellin at present for just one hundred and fifty dollas  well said the chef ill raise you a dolla and a quahta say thuttyeight and seventyfive  well now youre gittin up among the figgas where youre liable to own a hawss you just keep right on a raisin me while i sell these ladies some shoes and maybe youll hit it yit foe night  the girls were trying on shoes on every side now and they had dispensed with the formality of going indoors for the purpose more than one put out her foot to the clerk for his opinion of the fit and the shoeman was mingling with the crowd testing with his hand advising from his professional knowledge suggesting urging and in some cases artfully agreeing with the reluctance shown  this man said the chef indicating fane says you can tell moa lies to the square inch than any man out o boston  doos he asked the shoeman turning with a pair of highheeled bronze slippers in his hand from the wagon well now if i stood as nea to him as you do i believe i shd hit him  why man i cant dispute him said the chef and as if he had now at last scored a point he threw back his head and laughed when he brought down his head again it was to perceive the approach of clementina hello he said for her to hear hee comes the boss well i guess i must be goin he added in mock anxiety im a goin boss im a goin  clementina ignored him mr atwell wants to see you a moment mr fane she said to the clerk  all right miss claxon fane answered with the sorrowful respect which he always showed clementina now ill be right there but he waited a moment either in expression of his personal independence or from curiosity to know what the shoeman was going to say of the bronze slippers  clementina felt the fascination too she thought the slippers were beautiful and her foot thrilled with a mysterious prescience of its fitness for them  now thee ladies or as i may say guls if youll excuse it in one thats moa like a fatha to you than anything else in his feelingsthe girls tittered and some one shouted derisivelyits truenow there is a shoe or call it a slippa that ive rutha hesitated about showin to you because i know that youre all rutha seriousminded i dont cae how young ye be or how goodlookin ye be and i dont presume thees one among you thats eve head o dancin in the mirthful hooting and mocking that followed the shoeman hedged gravely from the extreme position he had taken what well maybe you have among some the summa folks but we all know what summa folks ah and i dont expect you to patten by them but what i will say is that if any young lady within the sound of my voicehe looked round for the applause which did not fail him in his parody of the pulpit styleshould get an invitation to a dance next winta and should feel it a wok of a charity to the young man to go shell be sorryon his account remembathat she hant got this pair o slippas  thea theyre a numba two and theyll fit any lady here i dont cae how small a foot shes got dont all speak at once sistas ample time allowed for meals thats a custommade shoe and if it hadnt ben too small for the lady they was oddid foh you couldnta got em for less than seven dollas but now im throwin on em away for three  a groan of dismay went up from the whole circle and some who had pressed forward for a sight of the slippers shrank back again  did i hea just now asked the shoeman with a soft insinuation in his voice and in the glance he suddenly turned upon clementina a party addressed as boss clementina flushed but she did not cower the chef walked away with a laugh and the shoeman pursued him with his voice not that i am goin to folla the wicked example of a man who tries to make spot of young ladies but if the young lady addressed as boss  miss claxon said the clerk with ingratiating reverence  miss claxoni stan corrected pursued the shoeman if miss claxon will do me the fava just to try on this slippa i shd be able to tell at the next place i stopped just how it looked on a ladys foot i see you ant any of you disposed to buy em this aftanoon and i ant complainin you done pootty well by me already and i dont want to uhge you but i do want to carry away the picture in my minds eyewhat you may call a mental photographof this slipper on the kind of a foot it was made fob sot i can praise it truthfully to my next customer what do you say maam he addressed himself with profound respect to clementina  oh do let him clem said one of the girls and another pleaded just so he neednt tell a story to his next customa and that made the rest laugh  clementinas heart was throbbing and joyous lights were dancing in her eyes i dont care if i do she said and she stooped to unlace her shoe but one of the big girls threw herself on her knees at her feet to prevent her clementina remembered too late that there was a hole in her stocking and that her little toe came through it but she now folded the toe artfully down and the big girl discovered the hole in time to abet her attempt at concealment she caught the slipper from the shoeman and harried it on she tied the ribbons across the instep and then put on the other now put out youa foot clem fast dancin position she leaned back upon her own heels and clementina daintily lifted the edge of her skirt a little and peered over at her feet the slippers might or might not have been of an imperfect taste in their imitation of the prevalent fashion but on clementinas feet they had distinction  them feet was made for them slippas said the shoeman devoutly  the clerk was silent he put his hand helplessly to his mouth and then dropped it at his side again  gregory came round the corner of the building from the diningroom and the big girl who was crouching before clementina and who boasted that she was not afraid of the student called saucily to him come here a minute mr gregory and as he approached she tilted aside to let him see clementinas slippers  clementina beamed up at him with all her happiness in her eyes but after a faltering instant his face reddened through its freckles and he gave her a rebuking frown and passed on  well i declae said the big girl fane turned uneasily and said with a sigh he guessed he must be going now  a blight fell upon the gay spirits of the group and the shoeman asked with an ironical glance after gregorys retreating figure owna of this propaty  no just the eath said the big girl angrily  the voice of clementina made itself heard with a cheerfulness which had apparently suffered no chill but was really a rising rebellion how much ah the slippas  three dollas said the shoeman in a surprise which he could not conceal at clementinas courage  she laughed and stooped to untie the slippers thats too much for me  let me untie em clem said the big girl its a shame for you eva to take em off  thats right lady said the shoeman and you dont eva need to he added to clementina unless you object to sleepin in em you pay me what you want to now and the rest when i come around the latta paht of august  oh keep em clem the big girl urged passionately and the rest joined her with their entreaties  i guess i betta not said clementina and she completed the work of taking off the slippers in which the big girl could lend her no further aid such was her affliction of spirit  all right lady said the shoeman thems youa slippas and ill just keep em for you till the latta paht of august  he drove away and in the woods which he had to pass through on the road to another hotel he overtook the figure of a man pacing rapidly he easily recognized gregory but he bore him no malice like a lift he asked slowing up beside him  no thank you said gregory im out for the walk he looked round furtively and then put his hand on the side of the wagon mechanically as if to detain it while he walked on  did you sell the slippers to the young lady  well not as you may say sell exactly returned the shoeman cautiously  have yougot them yet asked the student  guess so said the man like to see em  he pulled up his horse  gregory faltered a moment then he said id like to buy them quick  he looked guiltily about while the shoeman alertly obeyed with some delay for a box to put them in how much are they  well thats a custom made slipper and the price to the lady that oddidem was seven dollas but ill let you have em for threeif you want em for a presentthe shoeman was far too discreet to permit himself anything so overt as a smile he merely let a light of intelligence come into his face  gregory paid the money please consider this as confidential he said and he made swiftly away before the shoeman could lock the drawer that had held the slippers and clamber to his perch under the buggyhood gregory was running back to him again  stop he called and as he came up panting in an excitement which the shoeman might well have mistaken for indignation attending the discovery of some blemish in his purchase do you regard this as in any manner a deception he palpitated  why the shoeman began cautiously it want what you may call a promise exactly more of a joke than anything else i looked on it i just said id keep em for her but  you dont understand if i seemed to disapproveif i led any one to suppose by my manner or byanythingthat i thought it unwise or unbecoming to buy the shoes and then bought them myself do you think it is in the nature of an acted falsehood  lod no said the shoeman and he caught up the slack of his reins to drive on as if he thought this amusing maniac might also be dangerous  gregory stopped him with another question and shallwill youthink it necessary to speak ofof this transaction i leave you free  well said the shoeman i dont know what youre after exactly but if you think im so shot on for subjects that ive got to tell the folks at the next stop that i sold a fellar a pair of slippas for his gulgo long he called to his horse and left gregory standing in the middle of the road     viii  the people who came to the middlemount in july were ordinarily the nicest but that year the august folks were nicer than usual and there were some students among them and several graduates just going into business who chose to take their outing there instead of going to the seaside or the north woods this was a chance that might not happen in years again and it made the house very gay for the young ladies they ceased to pay court to the clerk and asked him for letters only at mailtime five or six couples were often on the floor together at the hops and the young people sat so thick upon the stairs that one could scarcely get up or down  so many young men made it gay not only for the young ladies but also for a certain young married lady when she managed to shirk her rather filial duties to her husband who was much about the verandas purblindly feeling his way with a stick as he walked up and down or sitting opaque behind the glasses that preserved what was left of his sight while his wife read to him she was soon acquainted with a good many more people than he knew and was in constant request for such occasions as needed a chaperon not averse to mountain climbing or drives to other hotels for dancing and supper and return by moonlight or the more boisterous sorts of charades no sheet and pillow case party was complete without her for welshrarebits her presence was essential the event of the conflict between these social claims and her duties to her husband was her appeal to mrs atwell on a point which the landlady referred to clementina  she wants somebody to read to her husband and i dont believe but what you could do it clem youre a good reader as good as i want to hear and while you may say that you dont put in a great deal of elocution i guess you can read full well enough all he wants is just something to keep him occupied and all she wants is a chance to occupy herself with otha folks well she is moa their own age i dknow as thes any hahm in her and my foots so much betta now that i dont need you the whole while any moa  did you speak to her about me asked the girl  well i told her id tell you i couldnt say how youd like  oh i guess i should like said clementina with her eyes shining buti should have to ask motha  i dont believe but what your mothad be willin said mrs atwell you just go down and see her about it  the next day mrs milray was able to take leave of her husband in setting off to matronize a coaching party with an exuberance of good conscience that she shared with the spectators she kissed him with lively affection and charged him not to let the child read herself to death for him she captioned clementina that mr milray never knew when he was tired and she had better go by the clock in her reading and not trust to any sign from him  clementina promised and when the public had followed mrs milray away to watch her ascent to the topmost seat of the towering coach by means of the ladder held in place by two porters and by help of the downstretched hands of all the young men on the coach clementina opened the book at the mark she found in it and began to read to mr milray  the book was a metaphysical essay which he professed to find a lighter sort of reading than fiction he said most novelists were too seriously employed in preventing the marriage of the lovers up to a certain point to be amusing but you could always trust a metaphysician for entertainment if he was very much in earnest and most metaphysicians were he let clementina read on a good while in her tender voice which had still so many notes of childhood in it before he manifested any consciousness of being read to he kept the smile on his delicate face which had come there when his wife said at parting i dont believe i should leave her with you if you could see how prettty she was and he held his head almost motionlessly at the same poise he had given it in listening to her final charges it was a fine head still well covered with soft hair which lay upon it in little sculpturesque masses like chiseled silver and the acquiline profile had a purity of line in the arch of the high nose and the jut of the thin lips and delicate chin which had not been lost in the change from youth to age one could never have taken it for the profile of a new york lawyer who had early found new york politics more profitable than law and after a long time passed in city affairs had emerged with a name shadowed by certain doubtful transactions but this was milrays history which in the rapid progress of american events was so far forgotten that you had first to remind people of what he had helped do before you could enjoy their surprise in realizing that this gentle person with the cast of intellectual refinement which distinguished his face was the notorious milray who was once in all the papers when he made his game and retired from politics his family would have sacrificed itself a good deal to reclaim him socially though they were of a severer social than spiritual conscience in the decay of some ancestral ideals but he had rendered their willingness hopeless by marrying rather late in life a young girl from the farther west who had come east with a general purpose to get on she got on very well with milray and it was perhaps not altogether her own fault that she did not get on so well with his family when she began to substitute a society aim for the artistic ambition that had brought her to new york they might have forgiven him for marrying her but they could not forgive her for marrying him they were of new england origin and they were perhaps a little more critical with her than if they had been new yorkers of dutch strain they said that she was a little western hoyden but that the stage would have been a good place for her if she could have got over her pike county accent in the hush of family councils they confided to one another the belief that there were phases of the variety business in which her accent would have been no barrier to her success since it could not have been heard in the dance and might have been disguised in the song  will you kindly read that passage over again milray asked as clementina paused at the end of a certain paragraph she read it while he listened attentively could you tell me just what you understand by that he pursued as if he really expected clementina to instruct him  she hesitated a moment before she answered i dont believe i undastand anything at all  do you know said milray thats exactly my own case and ive an idea that the author is in the same box and clementina perceived she might laugh and laughed discreetly  milray seemed to feel the note of discreetness in her laugh and he asked smiling how old did you tell me you were  im sixteen said clementina  its a great age said milray i remember being sixteen myself i have never been so old since but i was very old for my age then do you think you are  i dont believe i am said clementina laughing again but still very discreetly  then i should like to tell you that you have a very agreeable voice do you sing  nomno sirno said clementina i cant sing at all  ah thats very interesting said milray but its not surprising i wish i could see your face distinctly ive a great curiosity about matching voices and faces i must get mrs milray to tell me how you look where did you pick up your pretty knack at reading in school here  i dont know answered clementina do i readthe way you want  oh perfectly you let the meaning come throughwhen there is any  sometimes said clementina ingenuously i read too fast the children ah so impatient when im reading to them at home and they hurry me but i can read a great deal slower if you want me to  no im impatient too said milray are there many of themthe children  there ah six in all  and are you the oldest  yes said clementina she still felt it very blunt not to say sir too but she tried to make her tone imply the sir as mr gregory had bidden her  youve got a very pretty name  clementina brightened do you like it motha gave it to me she took it out of a book that fatha was reading to her  i like it very much said milray are you tall for your age  i guess i am pretty tall  youre fair of course i can tell that by your voice youve got a lighthaired voice and what are your eyes  blue clementina laughed at his pursuit  ah of course it isnt a grayeyed blonde voice do you thinkhas anybody ever told youthat you were graceful  i dont know as they have said clementina after thinking  and what is your own opinion clementina began to feel her dignity infringed she did not answer and now milray laughed i felt the little tilt in your step as you came up its all right shall we try for our friends meaning now  clementina began again and again milray stopped her you mustnt bear malice i can hear the grudge in your voice but i didnt mean to laugh at you you dont like being made fun of do you  i dont believe anybody does said clementina  no indeed said milray if i had tried such a thing i should be afraid you would make it uncomfortable for me but i havent have i  i dont know said clementina reluctantly  milray laughed gleefully well youll forgive me because im an old fellow if i were young you wouldnt would you  clementina thought of the clerk she had certainly never forgiven him shall i read on she asked  yes yes read on he said respectfully once he interrupted her to say that she pronounced admirable but he would like now and then to differ with her about a word if she did not mind she answered oh no indeed she should like it ever so much if he would tell her when she was wrong after that he corrected her and he amused himself by studying forms of respect so delicate that they should not alarm her pride clementina reassured him in terms as fine as his own she did not accept his instructions implicitly she meant to bring them to the bar of gregorys knowledge if he approved of them then she would submit  milray easily possessed himself of the history of her life and of all its circumstances and he said he would like to meet her father and make the acquaintance of a man whose mind as clementina interpreted it to him he found so original  he authorized his wife to arrange with mrs atwell for a monopoly of clementinas time while he stayed at middlemount and neither he nor mrs milray seemed surprised at the good round sum as the landlady thought it which she asked in the girls behalf     ix  the milrays stayed through august and mrs milray was the ruling spirit of the great holiday of the summer at middlemount it was this year that the landlords of the central mountain region had decided to compete in a coaching parade and to rival by their common glory the splendor of the east side and the west side parades the boardinghouses were to take part as well as the hotels the farms where only three or four summer folks were received were to send their mountainwagons and all were to be decorated with bunting an arch draped with flags and covered with flowers spanned the entrance to the main street at middlemount centre and every shop in the village was adorned for the event  mrs milray made the landlord tell her all about coaching parades and the champions of former years on the east side and the west side and then she said that the middlemount house must take the prize from them all this year or she should never come near his house again he answered with a dignity and spirit he rarely showed with mrs milrays class of custom im goin to drive our hossis myself  she gave her whole time to imagining and organizing the personal display on the coach she consulted with the other ladies as to the kind of dresses that were to be worn but she decided everything herself and when the time came she had all the young men ravaging the lanes and pastures for the goldenrod and asters which formed the keynote of her decoration for the coach  she made peace and kept it between factions that declared themselves early in the affair and of all who could have criticized her for taking the lead perhaps none would have willingly relieved her of the trouble she freely declared that it was killing her and she sounded her accents of despair all over the place when their dresses were finished she made the persons of her drama rehearse it on the coach top in the secret of the barn where no one but the stable men were suffered to see the effects she aimed at but on the eve of realizing these in public she was overwhelmed by disaster the crowning glory of her composition was to be a young girl standing on the highest seat of the coach in the character of the spirit of summer wreathed and garlanded with flowers and invisibly sustained by the twelve months of the year equally divided as to sex but with the more difficult and painful attitudes assigned to the gentlemen who were to figure as the fall and winter months it had been all worked out and the actors drilled in their parts when the spirit of summer who had been chosen for the inoffensiveness of her extreme youth was taken with mumps and withdrawn by the doctors orders mrs milray had now not only to improvise another spirit of summer but had to choose her from a group of young ladies with the chance of alienating and embittering those who were not chosen in her calamity she asked her husband what she should do with but the least hope that he could tell her but he answered promptly take clementina ill let you have her for the day and then waited for the storm of her renunciations and denunciations to spend itself  to be sure she said when this had happened it isnt as if she were a servant in the house and the position can be regarded as a kind of public function anyhow i cant say that ive hired her to take the part but i can give her a present afterwards and it will be the same thing  the question of clothes for clementina mrs milray declared was almost as sweeping in its implication as the question of the childs creation she has got to be dressed new from head to foot she said every stitch and how am i to manage it in twentyfour hours  by a succession of miracles with cheesecloth and sashes and ribbons it was managed and ended in a triumph so great that mrs milray took the girl in her arms and kissed her for looking the spirit of summer to a perfection that the victim of the mumps could not have approached the victory was not lastingly marred by the failure of clementinas shoes to look the spirit of summer as well as the rest of her costume no shoes at all world have been the very thing but shoes so shabby and worn down at one side of the heel as clementinas were very far from the thing mrs milray decided that another fold of cheesecloth would add to the statuesque charm of her figure and give her more height and she was richly satisfied with the effect when the middlemount coach drove up to the great veranda the next morning with all the figures of her picture in position on its roof and clementina supreme among them she herself mounted in simple undramatized authority to her official seat beside the landlord who in coachmans dress with a bouquet of autumnal flowers in his lapel sat holding his garlanded reins over the backs of his six horses and then the coach as she intended it to appear in the parade set out as soon as the turnouts of the other houses joined it they were all to meet at the middlemount which was thickly draped and festooned in flags with knots of evergreen and the first red boughs of the young swamp maples holding them in place over its irregular facade the coach itself was amass of foliage and flowers from which it defined itself as a wheeled vehicle in vague and partial outline the other wagons and coaches as they drove tremulously up with an effect of having been mired in blossoms about their spokes and hubs had the unwieldiness which seems inseparable from spectacularity they represented motives in color and design sometimes tasteless enough and sometimes so nearly very good that mrs milrays heart was a great deal in her mouth as they arrived each with its hotelcry roared and shrilled from a score of masculine and feminine throats and finally spelled for distinctness sake with an ultimate yell or growl but she had not finished giving the ladyrepresentative of a sunday newspaper the points of her own tableau before she regained the courage and the faith in which she remained serenely steadfast throughout the parade  it was when all the equipages of the neighborhood had arrived that she climbed to her place the ladder was taken away the landlord spoke to his horses and the middlemount coach led the parade amid the renewed slogans and the cries and fluttered handkerchiefs of the guests crowding the verandas  the line of march was by one road to middlemount centre where the prize was to be awarded at the judges stand and then the coaches were to escort the triumphant vehicle homeward by another route so as to pass as many houses on the way as possible it was a curious expression of the carnival spirit in a region immemorially starved of beauty in the lives of its people and whatever was the origin of the mountain coaching parade or from whatever impulse of sentimentality or advertising it came the effect was of undeniable splendor and of phantasmagoric strangeness  gregory watched its progress from a hillside pasture as it trailed slowly along the rising and falling road the songs of the young girls interrupted by the explosion of hotel slogans and college cries from the young men floated off to him on the thin breeze of the cloudless august morning like the hymns and shouts of a saturnalian rout going in holiday processional to sacrifice to their gods words of fierce hebrew poetry burned in his thought the warnings and the accusals and the condemnations of the angry prophets and he stood rapt from his own time and place in a dream of days when the most high stooped to commune face to face with his ministers while the young voices of those forgetful or ignorant of him called to his own youth and the garlanded chariots with their banners and their streamers passed on the road beneath him and out of sight in the shadow of the woods beyond  when the prize was given to the middlemount coach at the center the landlord took the flag and gallantly transferred it to mrs milray and mrs milray passed it up to clementina and bade her wave it wave it  the village street was thronged with people that cheered and swung their hats and handkerchiefs to the coach as it left the judges stand and drove under the triumphal arch with the other coaches behind it then atwell turned his horses heads homewards and at the brisker pace with which people always return from festivals or from funerals he left the village and struck out upon the country road with his long escort before him the crowd was quick to catch the courteous intention of the victors and followed them with applause as far beyond the village borders as wind and limb would allow but the last noisy boy had dropped off breathless before they reached a halffinished house in the edge of some woods a line of little children was drawn up by the roadside before it who watched the retinue with grave eagerness till the middlemount coach came in full sight then they sprang into the air and beating their hands together screamed clem clem oh its clem and jumped up and down and a shabby looking work worn woman came round the corner of the house and stared up at clementina waving her banner wildly to the children and shouting unintelligible words to them the young people on the coach joined in response to the children some simply some ironically and one of the men caught up a great wreath of flowers which lay at clementinas feet and flung it down to them the shabby woman quickly vanished round the corner of the house again mrs milray leaned over to ask the landlord who in the world are clementinas friends  why dont you know he retorted in abated voice thems her brothas and sistas  and that woman  the lady at the conna thats her motha  when the event was over and all the things had been said and said again and there was nothing more to keep the spring and summer months from going up to their rooms to lie down and the fall and winter months from trying to get something to eat mrs milray found herself alone with clementina  the child seemed anxious about something and mrs milray who wanted to go and lie down too asked a little impatiently what is it clementina  oh nothing only i was afraid maybe you didnt like my waving to the children when you saw how queea they looked clementinas lips quivered  did any of the rest say anything  i know what they thought but i dont care i should do it right over again  mrs milrays happiness in the days triumph was so great that she could indulge a generous emotion she caught the girl in her arms i want to kiss you i want to hug you clementina     x  the notion of a dance for the following night to celebrate the success of the house in the coaching parade came to mrs milray aver a welshrarebit which she gave at the close of the evening the party was in the charge of gregory who silently served them at their orgy with an austerity that might have conspired with the viand itself against their dreams if they had not been so used to the gloom of his ministrations he would not allow the waitresses to be disturbed in their evening leisure or kept from their sleep by such belated pleasures and when he had provided the materials for the rarebit he stood aloof and left their combination to mrs milray and her chafingdish  she had excluded clementina on account of her youth as she said to one of the fall and winter months who came in late and noticed clementinas absence with a hello anything the matter with the spirit of summer clementina had become both a pet and a joke with these months before the parade was over and now they clamored together and said they must have her at the dance anyway they were more tepidly seconded by the spring and summer months and mrs milray said well then youll have to all subscribe and get her a pair of dancing slippers they pressed her for her meaning and she had to explain the fact of clementinas destitution which that additional fold of cheesecloth had hidden so well in the coaching tableau that it had never been suspected the young men entreated her to let them each buy a pair of slippers for the spirit of summer which she should wear in turn for the dance that she must give each of them and this made mrs milray declare that no the child should not come to the dance at all and that she was not going to have her spoiled but before the party broke up she promised that she would see what could be done and she put it very prettily to the child the next day and waited for her to say as she knew she must that she could not go and why they agreed that the cheesecloth draperies of the spirit of summer were surpassingly fit for the dance but they had to agree that this still left the question of slippers untouched it remained even more hopeless when clementina tried on all of mrs milrays festive shoes and none of her razorpoints and high heels would avail she went away disappointed but not yet disheartened youth does not so easily renounce a pleasure pressed to the lips and clementina had it in her head to ask some of the table girls to help her out she meant to try first with that big girl who had helped her put on the shoemans bronze slippers and she hurried through the office pushing purblindly past fane without looking his way when he called to her in the deference which he now always used with her heres a package here for you clementinamiss claxon and he gave her an oblong parcel addressed in a hand strange to her who is it from she asked innocently and fane replied with the same ingenuousness im sure i dont know afterwards he thought of having retorted i havent opened it but still without being certain that he would have had the courage to say it  clementina did not think of opening it herself even when she was alone in her little room above mrs atwells until she had carefully felt it over and ascertained that it was a box of pasteboard three or four inches deep and wide and eight or ten inches long she looked at the address again miss clementina claxon and at the narrow notched ribbon which tied it and noted that the paper it was wrapped in was very white and clean then she sighed and loosed the knot and the paper slipped off the box and at the same time the lid fell off and the shoe mans bronze slippers fell out upon the floor  either it must be a dream or it must be a joke it could not be both real and earnest somebody was trying to tease her such flattery of fortune could not be honestly meant but it went to her head and she was so giddy with it as she caught the slippers from the floor and ran down to mrs atwell that she knocked against the sides of the narrow staircase  what is it what does it mean who did it she panted with the slippers in her hand whee did they come from she poured out the history of her trying on these shoes and of her present need of them and of their mysterious coming to meet her longing after it had almost ceased to be a hope mrs atwell closed with her in an exultation hardly short of a clapping the hands her hair was gray and the girls hair still hung in braids down her back but they were of the same age in their transport which they referred to mrs milray and joined with her in glad but fruitless wonder who had sent clementina the shoes mrs atwell held that the help who had seen the girl trying them on had clubbed together and got them for her at the time and had now given them to her for the honor she had done the middlemount house in the parade mrs milray argued that the spring and summer months had secretly dispatched some fall and winter month to ransack the stores at middlemount centre for them clementina believed that they came from the shoe man himself who had always wanted to send them in the hope that she would keep them and had merely happened to send them just then in that moment of extremity when she was helpless against them each conjecture involved improbabilities so gross that it left the field free to any opposite theory  rumor of the fact could not fail to go through the house and long before his days work was done it reached the chef and amused him as a piece of the bosss luck he was smoking his evening pipe at the kitchen door after supper when clementina passed him on one of the many errands that took her between mrs milrays room and her own and he called to her boss whats this i hear about a pair o glass slippas droppin out the sky int youa lap  clementina was so happy that she thought she might trust him for once and she said oh yes mr mahtin who do you suppose sent them she entreated him so sweetly that it would have softened any heart but the heart of a tease  i believe i could give a pootty good guess if i had the facts  clementina innocently gave them to him and he listened with a wellaffected sympathy  say fane fust told you about em  yes hees a package for you he said just that way and he couldnt tell me who left it or anything  anybody asked him about it since  oh yes mrs milray and mrs atwell and mr atwell and everybody  everybody the chef smiled with a peculiar droop of one eye and he didnt know when the slippas got into the landlods box  no the fust thing he knew the they wee clementina stood expectant but the chef smoked on as if that were all there was to say and seemed to have forgotten her who do you think put them thea mr mahtin  the chef looked up as if surprised to find her still there oh oh yes who d i think why i know boss but i dont believe id betta tell you  oh do mr mahtin if you knew how i felt about it  no no i guess i betta not twouldnt do you any good i guess i wont say anything moa but if i was in youa place and i really wanted to know whee them slippas come from  i doi do indeed  the chef paused before he added i should go at fane i guess what he dont know aint woth knowin and i guess nobody else knows anything thea i dont know but i said mon i ought now  what the chef said was of a piece with what had been more than once in clementinas mind but she had driven it out not because it might not be true but because she would not have it true her head drooped she turned limp and springless away even the heart of the tease was touched he had not known that it would worry her so much though he knew that she disliked the clerk  mind he called after her too late i aint got no proof t he done it  she did not answer him or look round she went to her room and sat down in the growing dusk to think with a hot lump in her throat  mrs atwell found her there an hour later when she climbed to the chamber where she thought she ought to have heard clementina moving about over her own room  didnt know but i could help you do youa dressin she began and then at sight of the dim figure she broke off why clem whats the matte ah you asleep ah you sick its half an hour of the time and  im not going clementina answered and she did not move  not goin why the land o  oh i cant go mrs atwell dont ask me tell mrs milray please  i will when i got something to tell said mrs atwell now you just say whats happened clementina claxon clementina suffered the woful truth to be drawn from her but you dont know whether its so or not the landlady protested  yes yes i do it was the last thing i thought of and the chef wouldnt have said it if he didnt believe it  thats just what he would done cried mrs atwell and ill give him such a goin ova for his teasin as he aint had in one while he just said it to tease what you goin to say to mrs milray  oh tell her im not a bit well mrs atwell my head does ache truly  why listen said mrs atwell recklessly if you believe he done itand he no business towhy dont you just go to the dance in em and then give em back to him after its ova it would suv him right  clementina listened for a moment of temptation and then shook her head it wouldnt do mrs atwell you know it wouldnt she said and mrs atwell had too little faith in her suggestion to make it prevail she went away to carry clementinas message to mrs milray and her task was greatly eased by the increasing difficulty mrs milray had begun to find since the way was perfectly smoothed for her in imagining the management of clementina at the dance neither child nor woman neither servant nor lady how was she to be carried successfully through it without sorrow to herself or offence to others in proportion to the relief she felt mrs milray protested her irreconcilable grief but when the simpler mrs atwell proposed her going and reasoning with clementina she said no no better let her alone if she felt as she did and perhaps after all she was right     xi  clementina listened to the music of the dance till the last note was played and she heard the gay shouts and laughter of the dancers as they issued from the ball room and began to disperse about the halls and verandas and presently to call good night to one another then she lighted her lamp and put the slippers back into the box and wrapped it up in the nice paper it had come in and tied it with the notched ribbon she thought how she had meant to put the slippers away so after the dance when she had danced her fill in them and how differently she was doing it all now she wrote the clerks name on the parcel and then she took the box and descended to the office with it there seemed to be nobody there but at the noise of her step fane came round the case of letterboxes and advanced to meet her at the long desk  whats wanted miss claxon he asked with his hopeless respectfulness anything i can do for you  she did not answer but looked him solemnly in the eyes and laid the parcel down on the open register and then went out  he looked at the address on the parcel and when he untied it the box fell open and the shoes fell out of it as they had with clementina he ran with them behind the letterbox frame and held them up before gregory who was seated there on the stool he usually occupied gloomily nursing his knee  what do you suppose this means frank  gregory looked at the shoes frowningly theyre the slippers she got today she thinks you sent them to her  and she wouldnt have them because she thought i sent them as sure as im standing here i never did it said the clerk solemnly  i know it said gregory i sent them  you  whats so wonderful gregory retorted i saw that she wanted them that day when the shoe peddler was here i could see it and you could  yes  i went across into the woods and the man overtook me with his wagon i was tempted and i bought the slippers of him i wanted to give them to her then but i resisted and i thought i should never give them today when i heard that she was going to that dance i sent them to her anonymously thats all there is about it  the clerk had a moment of bitterness if shed known it was you she wouldnt have given them back  thats to be seen i shall tell her now i never meant her to know but she must because shes doing you wrong in her ignorance  gregory was silent and fane was trying to measure the extent of his own suffering and to get the whole bearing of the incident in his mind in the end his attempt was a failure he asked gregory and do you think youve done just right by me  ive done right by nobody said gregory not even by myself and i can see that it was my own pleasure i had in mind i must tell her the truth and then i must leave this place  i suppose you want i should keep it quiet said fane  i dont ask anything of you  and she wouldnt said fane after reflection but i know shed be glad of it and i shant say anything of course she never can care for me andtheres my hand with my word if you want it gregory silently took the hand stretched toward him and fane added all ill ask is that youll tell her i wouldnt have presumed to send her the shoes she wouldnt be mad at you for it  gregory took the box and after some efforts to speak he went away it was an old trouble an old error an old folly he had yielded to impulse at every step and at every step he had sinned against another or against himself what pain he had now given the simple soul of fane what pain he had given that poor child who had so mistaken and punished the simple soul with fane it was over now but with clementina the worst was perhaps to come yet he could not hope to see the girl before morning and then what should he say to her at sight of a lamp burning in mrs atwells room which was on a level with the veranda where he was walking it came to him that first of all he ought to go to her and confess the whole affair if her husband were with her he ought to confess before him they were there in the place of the childs father and mother and it was due to them as he pressed rapidly toward the light he framed in his thought the things he should say and he did not notice as he turned to enter the private hallway leading to mrs atwells apartment a figure at the door it shrank back from his contact and he recognized clementina his purpose instantly changed and he said is that you miss claxon i want to speak with you will you come a moment where i can  ii dont know as id betta she faltered but she saw the box under his arm and she thought that he wished to speak to her about that and she wanted to hear what he would say she had been waiting at the door there because she could not bear to go to her room without having something more happen  you neednt be afraid i shall not keep you come with me a moment there is something i must tell you at once you have made a mistake and it is my fault come  clementina stepped out into the moonlight with him and they walked across the grass that sloped between the hotel and the river there were still people about late smokers singly and in groups along the piazzas and young couples like themselves strolling in the dry air under the pure sky  gregory made several failures in trying to begin before he said i have to tell you that you are mistaken about mr fane i was there behind the letter boxes when you came in and i know that you left these shoes because you thought he sent them to you he didnt send them clementina did not say anything and gregory was forced to ask do you wish to know who sent them i wont tell you unless you do wish it  i think i ought to know she said and she asked dont you  yes for you must blame some one else now for what you thought fane did i sent them to you  clementinas heart gave a leap in her breast and she could not say anything he went on  i saw that you wanted them that day and when the peddler happened to overtake me in the woods where i was walking after i left you i acted on a sudden impulse and i bought them for you i meant to send them to you anonymously then i had committed one error in acting upon impulsemy rashness is my besetting sinand i wished to add a species of deceit to that but i was kept from it untiltoday i hoped you would like to wear them to the dance tonight and i put them in the postoffice for you myself mr fane didnt know anything about it that is all i am to blame and no one else  he waited for her to speak but clementina could only say i dont know what to say  you cant say anything that would be punishment enough for me i have acted foolishly cruelly  clementina did not think so she was not indignant as she was when she thought fane had taken this liberty with her but if mr gregory thought it was so very bad it must be something much more serious than she had imagined she said i dont see why you wanted to do it hoping that he would be able to tell her something that would make his behavior seem less dreadful than he appeared to think it was  there is only one thing that could justify it and that is something that i cannot justify it was very mysterious but youth loves mystery and clementina was very young i did it said gregory solemnly and he felt that now he was acting from no impulse but from a wisely considered decision which he might not fail in without culpability because i love you  oh said clementina and she started away from him  i knew that it would make me detestable he cried bitterly i had to tell you to explain what i did i couldnt help doing it but now if you can forget it and never think of me again i can go away and try to atone for it somehow i shall be guided  clementina did not know why she ought to feel affronted or injured by what he had said to her but if mr gregory thought it was wrong for him to have spoken so it must be wrong she did not wish him to feel badly even if he had done wrong but she had to take his view of what he had done why suttainly mr gregory she answered you mustnt mind it  but i do mind it i have been very very selfish very thoughtless we are both too young i cant ask you to wait for me till i could marry  the word really frightened clementina she said i dont believe i betta promise  oh i know it said gregory i am going away from here i am going tomorrow as soon as i can arrangeas soon as i can get away goodnighticlementina in her agitation put her hands up to her face oh dont cryi cant bear to have you cry  she took down her hands im not crying but i wish i had neva seen those slippas  they had come to the bank of the river whose current quivered at that point in a scaly ripple in the moonlight at her words gregory suddenly pulled the box from under his arm and flung it into the stream as far as he could it caught upon a shallow of the ripple hung there a moment then loosed itself and swam swiftly down the stream  oh clementina moaned  do you want them back he demanded i will go in for them  no no no but it seemed such awaste  yes that is a sin too they climbed silently to the hotel at mrs atwells door he spoke try to forget what i said and forgive me if you can  yesyes i will mr gregory you mustnt think of it any moa     xii  clementina did not sleep till well toward morning and she was still sleeping when mrs atwell knocked and called in to her that her brother jim wanted to see her she hurried down and in the confusion of mind left over from the night before she cooed sweetly at jim as if he had been mr gregory what is it jim what do you want me for  the boy answered with the disgust a sisters company manners always rouse in a brother motha wants you says shes woked down and she wants you to come and help then he went his way  mrs atwell was used to having help snatched from her by their families at a moments notice i presume youve got to go clem she said  oh yes ive got to go clementina assented with a note of relief which mystified mrs atwell  you tied readin to mr milray  oh nomno i mean but i guess i betta go home i guess ive been away long enough  well youre a good gul clem i presume your mothas got a right to have you home if she wants you clementina said nothing to this but turned briskly and started upstairs toward her room again the landlady called after her shall you speak to mis milray or do you want i should  clementina looked back at her over her shoulder to warble why if you would mrs atwell and kept on to her room  mrs milray was not wholly sorry to have her go she was going herself very soon and clementinas earlier departure simplified the question of getting rid of her but she overwhelmed her with reproaches which clementina received with such sweet sincerity that another than mrs milray might have blamed herself for having abused her ingenuousness  the atwells could very well have let the girl walk home but they sent her in a buckboard with one of the stablemen to drive her the landlord put her neat bundle under the seat of the buckboard with his own hand there was something in the childs bearing her dignity and her amiability which made people offer her half in fun and half in earnest the deference paid to age and state  she did not know whether gregory would try to see her before she went she thought he must have known she was going but since he neither came to take leave of her nor sent her any message she decided that she had not expected him to do so about the third week of september she heard that he had left middlemount and gone back to college  she kept at her work in the house and helped her mother and looked after the little ones she followed her father in the woods in his quest of stuff for walking sticks and advised with both concerning the taste of summer folks in dress and in canes the winter came and she read many books in its long leisure mostly novels out of the rectors library he had a whole set of miss edgeworth and nearly all of miss austen and miss gurney and he gave of them to clementina as the best thing for her mind as well as her morals he believed nothing could be better for any one than these old english novels which he had nearly forgotten in their details she colored the faded english life of the stories afresh from her yankee circumstance and it seemed the consensus of their testimony that she had really been made love to and not so very much too soon at her age of sixteen for most of their heroines were not much older the terms of gregorys declaration and of its withdrawal were mystifying but not more mystifying than many such things and from what happened in the novels she read the affair might be trusted to come out all right of itself in time she was rather thoughtfuller for it and once her mother asked her what was the matter with her oh i guess im getting old motha she said and turned the question off she would not have minded telling her mother about gregory but it would not have been the custom and her mother would have worried and would have blamed him clementina could have more easily trusted her father with the case but so far as she knew fathers never were trusted with anything of the kind she would have been willing that accident should bring it to the knowledge of mrs richling but the moment never came when she could voluntarily confide in her though she was a great deal with her that winter she was mrs richlings lieutenant in the social affairs of the parish which the rectors wife took under her care she helped her get up entertainments of the kind that could be given in the church parlor and they managed together some dances which had to be exiled to the town hall they contrived to make the young people of the village feel that they were having a gay time and clementina did not herself feel that it was a dull one she taught them some of the new steps and figures which the help used to pick up from the summer folks at the middlemount and practise together she liked doing that her mother said the child would rather dance than eat any time she was never sad but so much dignity got into her sweetness that the rector now and then complained of feeling put down by her  she did not know whether she expected gregory to write to her or not but when no letters came she decided that she had not expected them she wondered if he would come back to the middlemount the next summer but when the summer came she heard that they had another student in his place she heard that they had a new clerk and that the boarders were not so pleasant another year passed and towards the end of the season mrs atwell wished her to come and help her again and clementina went over to the hotel to soften her refusal she explained that her mother had so much sewing now that she could not spare her and mrs atwell said well that was right and that she must be the greatest kind of dependence for her mother you ah going on seventeen this year aint you  i was nineteen the last day of august said clementina and mrs atwell sighed and said how the time did fly  it was the second week of september but mrs atwell said they were going to keep the house open till the middle of october if they could for the autumnal foliage which there was getting to be quite a class of custom for  i presume you knew mr landa was dead she added and at clementinas look of astonishment she said with a natural satisfaction mm died the thutteenth day of august i presumed somehow youd know it though you didnt see a great deal of em come to think of it i guess he was a good man too good for her i guess she concluded in the new england necessity of blaming some one she sent us the papah  there was an early frost and people said there was going to be a hard winter but it was not this that made clementinas father set to work finishing his house his turning business was well started now and he had got together money enough to pay for the work he had lately enlarged the scope of his industry by turning gateposts and urns for the tops of them which had become very popular for the front yards of the farm and village houses in a wide stretch of country they sold more steadily than the smaller wares the cups and tops and little vases and platters which had once been the output of his lathe after the first season the interest of the summer folks in these fell off but the gate posts and the urns appealed to a lasting taste in the natives  claxon wished to put the finishing touches on the house himself and he was willing to suspend more profitable labors to do so after some attempts at plastering he was forced to leave that to the plasterers but he managed the clapboarding with clementina to hand him boards and nails and to keep him supplied with the hammer he was apt to drop at critical moments they talked pretty constantly at their labors and in their leisure which they spent on the brown needles under the pines at the side of the house sometimes the hammering or the talking would be interrupted by a voice calling from a passing vehicle in the hidden roadway something about urns claxon would answer without troubling himself to verify the inquirer or moving from his place that he would get round to them and then would hammer on or talk on with clementina  one day in october a carriage drove up to the door after the work on the house had been carried as far as claxons mood and money allowed and he and clementina were picking up the litter of his carpentering he had replaced the block of wood which once served at the front door by some steps under an arbor of rustic work but this was still so novel that the younger children had not outgrown their pride in it and were playing at housekeeping there clementina ran around to the back door and out through the front entry in time to save the visitor and the children from the misunderstanding they began to fall into and met her with a smile of hospitable brilliancy and a recognition full of compassionate welcome  mrs lander gave way to her tears as she broke out oh it aint the way it was the last time i was hea you head that hethat mr landa  mrs atwell told me said clementina wont you come in and sit down  why yes mrs lander pushed in through the narrow door of what was to be the parlor her crapes swept about her and exhaled a strong scent of their dyes her veil softened her heavy face but she had not grown thinner in her bereavement  i just got to the middlemount last night she said and i wanted to see you and your payrents both miss claxon it doos bring him back so you wont neva know how much he thought of you and youll all think im crazy i wouldnt come as long as he was with me and now i have to come without him i held out aginst him as long as i had him to hold out aginst not that he was eva one to push and i dont know as he so much as spoke of it afta we left the hotel two yeas ago but i presume it want out of his mind a single minute time and time again id say to him now albet do you feel about it just the way you done and hed say i hart had any call to charge my mind about it and then id begin tryin to ahgue him out of it and keep a hectorin till hed say well im not askin you to do it and thats all i could get out of him but i see all the while t he wanted me to do it whateva he asked and now ive got to do it when it cant give him any pleasure mrs lander put up her blackbordered handkerchief and sobbed into it and clementina waited till her grief had spent itself then she gave her a fan and mrs lander gratefully cooled her hot wet face the children had found the noises of her affliction and the turbid tones of her monologue annoying and had gone off to play in the woods claxon kept incuriously about the work that clementina had left him to his wife maintained the confidence which she always felt in clementinas ability to treat with the world when it presented itself and though she was curious enough she did not offer to interrupt the girls interview with mrs lander clementina would know how to behave  mrs lander when she had refreshed herself with the fan seemed to get a fresh grip of her theme and she told clementina all abort mr landers last sickness it had been so short that it gave her no time to try the climate of colorado upon him which she now felt sure would have brought him right up and she had remembered when too late to give him a livermedicine of her own though it did not appear that it was his liver which was affected that was the strange part of it but brief as his sickness was he had felt that it was to be his last and had solemnly talked over her future with her which he seemed to think would be lonely he had not named clementina but mrs lander had known well enough what he meant and now she wished to ask her and her father and mother how they would all like clementina to come and spend the winter with her at boston first and then further south and wherever she should happen to go she apologized for not having come sooner upon this errand she had resolved upon it as soon as mr lander was gone but she had been sick herself and had only just now got out of bed  clementina was too young to feel the pathos of the case fully or perhaps even to follow the tortuous course of mrs landers motives but she was moved by her grief and she could not help a thrill of pleasure in the vague splendor of the future outlined by mrs landers proposal for a time she had thought that mrs milray was going to ask her to visit her in new york mrs milray had thrown out a hint of something of the kind at parting but that was the last of it and now she at once made up her mind that she would like to go with mrs lander while discreetly saying that she would ask her father and mother to come and talk with her     xiii  her parents objected to leaving their work each suggested that the other had better go but they both came at clementinas urgence her father laughed and her mother frowned when she told them what mrs lander wanted from the same misgiving of her sanity they partly abandoned this theory for a conviction of mrs landers mere folly when she began to talk and this slowly yielded to the perception that she had some streaks of sense it was sense in the first place to want to have clementina with her and though it might not be sense to suppose that they would be anxious to let her go they did not find so much want of it as mrs lander talked on it was one of her necessities to talk away her emotions before arriving at her ideas which were often found in a tangle but were not without a certain propriety she was now after her interview with clementina in the immediate presence of these and it was her ideas that she began to produce for the girls father and mother she said frankly that she had more money than she knew what to do with and they must not think she supposed she was doing a favor for she was really asking one  she was alone in the world without near connections of her own or relatives of her husbands and it would be a mercy if they could let their daughter come and visit her she would not call it more than a visit that would be the best thing on both sides she told of her great fancy for clementina the first time she saw her and of her husbands wish that she would come and visit with them then for the winter as for that money she had tried to make the child take she presumed that they knew about it and she wished to say that she did it because she was afraid mr lander had said so much about the sewing that they would be disappointed she gave way to her tears at the recollection and confessed that she wanted the child to have the money anyway she ended by asking mrs claxon if she would please to let her have a drink of water and she looked about the room and said that they had got it finished up a great deal now had not they she made other remarks upon it so apt that mrs claxon gave her a sort of permissive invitation to look about the whole lower floor ending with the kitchen  mrs lander sat down there while mrs claxon drew from the pipes a glass of water which she proudly explained was pumped all over the house by the wind mill that supplied the power for her husbands turning lathes  well i wish mah husband could have tasted that wata said mrs lander as if reminded of husbands by the word and by the action of putting down the glass he was always such a great hand for good cold wata my hed a liked youa kitchen mrs claxon he always was such a homebody and he did get so tied of hotels for all he had such an appearance when you see him of beinwellstiff and proud he was fah moa common in his tastesi dont mean common exactly eithathan what i was and many a time when wed be drivin through the country and wed pass some o them longstrungout houses dont you know with the kitchen next to the wood shed and then an ahchway befoa you get to the stable mr landa hed get out and make an urrand just sos to look in at the kitchen dooa he said it made him think of his own mothas kitchen we was both brought up in the country thats a fact and i guess if the truth was known we both expected to settle down and die thea some time but now hes gone and i dont know whatll become o me and sometimes i dont much care i guess if mr landad a seen youa kitchen it wouldnt a been so easy to git him out of it and i do believe if hes livin anywhe now he takes as much comfot in my settin here as what i do i presume i shall settle down somewhes before a great while and if you could make up youa mind to let your daughta come to me for a little visit till spring you couldnt do a thing that d please mr landa moa  mrs claxon said that she would talk it over with the childs father and then mrs lander pressed her to let her take clementina back to the middlemount with her for supper if they wouldnt let her stay the night after clementina had driven away mrs claxon accused herself to her husband of being the greatest fool in the state but he said that the carriage was one of the middlemount rigs and he guessed it was all right he could see that clem was wild to go and he didnt see why she shouldnt  well i do then his wife retorted we dont know anything about the woman or who she is  i guess no harmll come to clem for one night said claxon and mrs claxon was forced back upon the larger question for the maintenance of her anxiety she asked what he was going to do about letting clem go the whole winter with a perfect stranger and he answered that he had not got round to that yet and that there were a good many things to be thought of first he got round to see the rector before dark and in the light of his larger horizon was better able to orient mrs lander and her motives than he had been before  when she came back with the girl the next morning she had thought of something in the nature of credentials it was the letter from her church in boston which she took whenever she left home so that if she wished she might unite with the church in any place where she happened to be stopping it did not make a great impression upon the klaxons who were of no religion though they allowed their children to go to the episcopal church and sundayschool and always meant to go themselves they said they would like to talk the matter over with the rector if mrs lander did not object she offered to send her carriage for him and the rector was brought at once  he was one of those men who have in the breaking down of the old puritanical faith and the dying out of the later unitarian rationalism advanced and established the anglican church so notably in the new england hillcountry by a wise conformity to the necessities and exactions of the native temperament on the ecclesiastical side he was conscientiously uncompromising but personally he was as simplemannered as he was simplehearted he was a tall lean man in rusty black with a clerical waistcoat that buttoned high and scholarly glasses but with a belated straw hat that had counted more than one summer and a farmers tan on his face and hands he pronounced the churchletter though quite outside of his own church a document of the highest respectability and he listened with patient deference to the autobiography which mrs lander poured out upon him and her identifications through reference to this or that person in boston whom he knew either at first or second hand he had not to pronounce upon her syntax or her social quality it was enough for him in behalf of the claxons to find her what she professed to be  you must think he said laughing that we are overparticular but the fact is that we value clementina rather highly and we wish to be sure that your hospitable offer will be for her real good  of couse said mrs lander i should be just so myself abort her  i dont know he continued that ive ever said how much we think of her mrs richling and i but this seems a good opportunity as she is not present  she is not perfect but she comes as near being a thoroughly good girl as she can without knowing it she has a great deal of commonsense and we all want her to have the best chance  well thats just the way i feel about her and thats just what i mean to give her said mrs lander  i am not sure that i make myself quite clear said the rector i mean a chance to prove how useful and helpful she can be do you think you can make life hard for her occasionally can you be peevish and exacting and unreasonable can you do something to make her value superfluity and luxury at their true worth  mrs lander looked a little alarmed and a little offended i dont know as i undastand what you mean exactly she said frowning rather with perplexity than resentment but the child shant have a care and her own motha couldnt be betta to her than me there ant anything money can buy that she shant have if she wants it and all ill ask of her is t shell enjoy herself as much as she knows how i want her with me because i should love to have her round and we did from the very fust minute she spoke mr lander and me both she shall have her own money and spend it for anything she pleases and she neednt do a stitch o work from mohnin till night but if youre afraid i shall put upon her  no no said the rector and he threw back his head with a laugh  when it was all arranged a few days later after the verification of certain of mrs landers references by letters to boston he said to clementinas father and mother theres only one danger now and that is that she will spoil clementina but theres a reasonable hope that she wont know how he found the claxons struggling with a fresh misgiving which claxon expressed the way i look at it is like this i dont want that woman should eva think clem was after her money on the face of it there ant very much to her that would make anybody think but what we was after it and i should want it pootty well undastood that we want that kind but i dont seem to see any way of tellin her  no said the rector with a sympathetic twinkle that would be difficult  its plain to be seen mrs claxon interposed that she thinks a good deal of her money and i d know but what shed think she was doin clem most too much of a favor anyway if it cant be a puffectly even thing all round i d know as i should want it to be at all  youre quite right mrs claxon quite right but i believe mrs lander may be safely left to look out for her own interests after all she has merely asked clementina to pass the winter with her it will be a good opportunity for her to see something of the world and perhaps it may bring her the chance of placing herself in life we have got to consider these things with reference to a young girl  mrs claxon said of couse but claxon did not assent so readily  i dont feel as if i should want clem to look at it in that light if the chance dont come to her i dont want she should go huntin round for it  i thoroughly agree with you said the rector but i was thinking that there was not only no chance worthy of her in middlemount but there is no chance at all  i guess thats so claxon owned with a laugh well i guess we can leave it to clem to do whats right and proper everyway as you say shes got lots of sense  from that moment he emptied his mind of care concerning the matter but husband and wife are never both quite free of care on the same point of common interest and mrs claxon assumed more and more of the anxieties which he had abandoned she fretted under the load and expressed an exasperated tenderness for clementina when the girl seemed forgetful of any of the little steps to be taken before the great one in getting her clothes ready for leaving home she said finally that she presumed they were doing a wild thing and that it looked crazier and crazier the more she thought of it but all was if clem didnt like she could come home by this time her husband was in something of that insensate eagerness to have the affair over that people feel in a house where there is a funeral  at the station when clementina started for boston with mrs lander her father and mother with the rector and his wife came to see her off other friends mistakenly made themselves of the party and kept her talking vacuities when her heart was full till the train drew up her father went with her into the parlor car where the porter of the middlemount house set down mrs landers hand baggage and took the final fee she thrust upon him when claxon came out he was not so satisfactory about the car as he might have been to his wife who had never been inside a parlor car and who had remained proudly in the background where she could not see into it from the outside he said that he had felt so bad about clem that he did not notice what the car was like but he was able to report that she looked as well as any of the folks in it and that if there were any better dressed he did not see them he owned that she cried some when he said goodbye to her  i guess said his wife grimly were a passel o fools to let her go even if she dont like thea with that crazyhead she wont be the same clem when she comes back  they were too heavyhearted to dispute much and were mostly silent as they drove home behind claxons selfbroken colt a creature that had taken voluntarily to harness almost from its birth and was an example to its kind in sobriety and industry  the children ran out from the house to meet them with a story of having seen clem at a point in the woods where the train always slowed up before a crossing and where they had all gone to wait for her she had seen them through the carwindow and had come out on the car platform and waved her handkerchief as she passed and called something to them but they could not hear what it was they were all cheering so  at this their mother broke down and went crying into the house not to have had the last words of the child whom she should never see the same again if she ever saw her at all was more she said than heart could bear  the rectors wife arrived home with her husband in a mood of mounting hopefulness which soared to tops commanding a view of perhaps more of this worlds kingdoms than a clergymans wife ought ever to see even for another she decided that clementinas chances of making a splendid match somewhere were about of the nature of certainties and she contended that she would adorn any station with experience and with her native tact especially if it were a very high station in europe where mrs lander would now be sure to take her if she did not take her to europe however she would be sure to leave her all her money and this would serve the same end though more indirectly  mr richling scoffed at this ideal of clementinas future with a contempt which was as little becoming to his cloth he made his wife reflect that with all her inherent grace and charm clementina was an ignorant little country girl who had neither the hardness of heart nor the greediness of soul which gets people on in the world and repair for them the disadvantages of birth and education he represented that even if favorable chances for success in society showed themselves to the girl the intense and inexpugnable vulgarity of mrs lander would spoil them and he was glad of this he said for he believed that the best thing which could happen to the child would be to come home as sweet and good as she had gone away he added this was what they ought both to pray for  his wife admitted this but she retorted by asking if he thought such a thing was possible and he was obliged to own that it was not possible he marred the effect of his concession by subjoining that it was no more possible than her making a brilliant and triumphant social figure in society either at home or in europe     xiv  so far from embarking at once for europe mrs lander went to that hotel in a suburb of boston where she had the habit of passing the late autumn months in order to fortify herself for the climate of the early winter months in the city she was a little puzzled how to provide for clementina with respect to herself but she decided that the best thing would be to have her sleep in a room opening out of her own with a folding bed in it so that it could be used as a sort of parlor for both of them during the day and be within easy reach for conversation at all times  on her part clementina began by looking after mrs landers comforts large and little like a daughter to her own conception and to that of mrs lander but to other eyes like a servant mrs lander shyly shrank from acquaintance among the other ladies and in the absence of this she could not introduce clementina who went down to an early breakfast alone and sat apart with her at lunch and dinner ministering to her in public as she did in private she ran back to their rooms to fetch her shawl or her handkerchief or whichever drops or powders she happened to be taking with her meals and adjusted with closer care the hassock which the head waiter had officially placed at her feet they seldom sat in the parlor where the ladies met after dinner they talked only to each other and there as elsewhere the girl kept her filial care of the old woman the question of her relation to mrs lander became so pressing among several of the guests that after clementina had watched over the banisters with throbbing heart and feet a little dance one night which the other girls had got up among themselves and had fled back to her room at the approach of one of the kindlier and bolder of them the landlord felt forced to learn from mrs lander how miss claxon was to be regarded he managed delicately by saying he would give the sunday paper she had ordered to her nurse or i beg your pardon he added as if he had made a mistake why she ant my nuhse mrs lander explained simply neither annoyed nor amused shes just a young lady thats visiting me as you may say and this put an end to the misgiving among the ladies but it suggested something to mrs lander and a few days afterwards when they came out from boston where they had been shopping and she had been lavishing a bewildering waste of gloves hats shoes capes and gowns upon clementina she said ill tell you what weve got to have a maid  a maid cried the girl  it isnt me or my things i want her for said mrs lander its you and these dresses of youas i presume you could look afta them come to give youa mind to it but i dont want to have you tied up to a lot of clothes and i presume we should find her a comfot in moa ways than one both of us i dont know what we shall want her to do exactly but i guess she will if she undastands her business and i want you should go in with me tomorror and find one ill speak to some of the ladies and find out whes the best place to go and well get the best there is  a lady whom mrs lander spoke to entered into the affair with zeal born of a lurking sense of the wrong she had helped do clementina in the common doubt whether she was not herself mrs landers maid she offered to go into boston with them to an intelligence office where you could get nice girls of all kinds but she ended by giving mrs lander the address and instructions as to what she was to require in a maid she was chiefly to get an english maid if at all possible for the qualifications would more or less naturally follow from her nationality there proved to be no english maid but there was a swedish one who had received a rigid training in an english family living on the continent and had come immediately from that service to seek her first place in america the manager of the office pronounced her character as set down in writing faultless and mrs lander engaged her you want to look afta this young lady she said indicating clementina i can look afta myself but ellida took charge of them both on the train out from boston with prompt intelligence  we got to get used to it i guess mrs lander confided at the first chance of whispering to clementina  within a month after washing the faces and combing the hair of all her brothers and sisters who would suffer it at her hands clementinas own head was under the brush of a ladys maid who was of as great a discreetness in her own way as clementina herself she supplied the defects of mrs landers elementary habits by simply asking if she should get this thing and that thing for the toilet without criticising its absenceand then asking whether she should get the same things for her young lady she appeared to let mrs lander decide between having her brushes in ivory or silver but there was really no choice for her and they came in silver she knew not only her own place but the places of her two ladies and she presently had them in such training that they were as proficient in what they might and might not do for themselves and for each other as if making these distinctions were the custom of their lives  their hearts would both have gone out to ellida but ellida kept them at a distance with the smooth respectfulness of the iron hand in the glove of velvet and clementina first learned from her to imagine the impassable gulf between mistress and maid  at the end of her month she gave them out of a clear sky a weeks warning she professed no grievance and was not moved by mrs landers appeal to say what wages she wanted she would only say that she was going to take a place an commonwealth avenue where a friend of hers was living and when the week was up she went and left her late mistresses feeling rather blank i presume we shall have to get anotha said mrs lander  oh not right away clementina pleaded  well not right away mrs lander assented and provisionally they each took the other into her keeping and were much freer and happier together  soon after clementina was startled one morning as she was going in to breakfast by seeing mr fane at the clerks desk he did not see her he was looking down at the hotel register to compute the bill of a departing guest but when she passed out she found him watching for her with some letters  i didnt know you were with us he said with his pensive smile till i found your letters here addressed to mrs landers care and then i put two and two together it only shows how small the world is dont you think so ive just got back from my vacation i prefer to take it in the fall of the year because its so much pleasanter to travel then i suppose you didnt know i was here  no i didnt said clementina i never dreamed of such a thing  to be sure why should you fane reflected ive been here ever since last spring but ill say this miss claxon that if its the least unpleasant to you or the least disagreeable or awakens any kind of associations  oh no clementina protested and fane was spared the pain of saying what he would do if it were  he bowed and she said sweetly its pleasant to meet any one ive seen before i suppose you dont know how much its changed at middlemount since you we e thea fane answered blankly while he felt in his breast pocket oh he presumed so and she added hadly any of the same guests came back this summer and they had more in july than they had in august mrs atwell said mr mahtin the chef is gone and newly all the help is different  fane kept feeling in one pocket and then slapped himself over the other pockets no he said i havent got it with me i must have left it in my room i just received a letter from frankmr gregory you know i always call him frankand i thought i had it with me he was asking about middlemount and i wanted to read you what he said but ill find it upstairs hes out of college now and hes begun his studies in the divinity school hes at andover i dont know what to make of frank oftentimes the clerk continued confidentially i tell him hes a kind of a survival in religion hes so aesthetic it seemed to fane that he had not meant aesthetic exactly but he could not ask clementina what the word was he went on to say hes a grand good fellow frank is but he dont make enough allowance for human nature hes more like one of those old fashioned orthodox i go in for having a good time so long as you dont do anybody else any hurt  he left her and went to receive the commands of a lady who was leaning over the desk and saying severely my mail if you please and clementina could not wait for him to come back she had to go to mrs lander and get her ready for breakfast ellida had taught mrs lander a luxury of helplessness in which she persisted after the maids help was withdrawn  clementina went about the whole day with the wonder what gregory had said about middlemount filling her mind it must have had something to do with her he could not have forgotten the words he had asked her to forget she remembered them now with a curiosity which had no rancor in it to know why he really took them back she had never blamed him and she had outlived the hurt she had felt at not hearing from him but she had never lost the hope of hearing from him or rather the expectation and now she found that she was eager for his message she decided that it must be something like a message although it could not be anything direct no one else had come to his place in her fancy and she was willing to try what they would think of each other now to measure her own obligation to the past by a knowledge of his there was scarcely more than this in her heart when she allowed herself to drift near fanes place that night that he might speak to her and tell her what gregory had said but he had apparently forgotten about his letter and only wished to talk about himself he wished to analyze himself to tell her what sort of person he was he dealt impartially with the subject he did not spare some faults of his and after a week he proposed a correspondence with her in a letter of carefully studied spelling as a means of mutual improvement as well as further acquaintance  it cost clementina a good deal of trouble to answer him as she wished and not hurt his feelings she declined in terms she thought so cold that they must offend him beyond the point of speaking to her again but he sought her out as soon after as he could and thanked her for her kindness and begged her pardon he said he knew that she was a very busy person with all the lessons she was taking and that she had no time for carrying on a correspondence he regretted that he could not write french because then the correspondence would have been good practice for her clementina had begun taking french lessons of a teacher who came out from boston she lunched three times a week with her and mrs lander and spoke the language with clementina whose accent she praised for its purity purity of accent was characteristic of all this ladys pupils but what was really extraordinary in mademoiselle claxon was her sense of grammatical structure she wrote the language even more perfectly than she spoke it but beautifully but wonderfully her exercises were something marvellous  mrs lander would have liked clementina to take all the lessons that she heard any of the other young ladies in the hotel were taking one of them went in town every day and studied drawing at an artschool and she wanted clementina to do that too but clementina would not do that she had tried often enough at home when her brother jim was drawing and her father was designing the patterns of his woodwork she knew that she never could do it and the time would be wasted she decided against piano lessons and singing lessons too she did not care for either and she pleaded that it would be a waste to study them but she suggested dancing lessons and her gift for dancing won greater praise and perhaps sincerer than her accent won from mademoiselle blanc though mrs lander said that she would not have believed any one could be more complimentary she learned the new steps and figures in all the fashionable dances she mastered some fancy dances which society was then beginning to borrow from the stage and she gave these before mrs lander with a success which she felt herself  i believe i could teach dancing she said  well you wont eve haf to child returned mrs lander with an eye on the side of the case that seldom escaped her  in spite of his wish to respect these preoccupations fane could not keep from offering clementina attentions which took the form of persecution when they changed from flowers for mrs landers table to letters for herself he apologized for his letters whenever he met her but at last one of them came to her before breakfast with a special delivery stamp from boston he had withdrawn to the city to write it and he said that if she could not make him a favorable answer he should not come back to woodlake  she had to show this letter to mrs lander who asked you want he should come back  no indeed i dont want eva to see him again  well then i guess youll know how to tell him so  the girl went into her own room to write and when she brought her answer to show it to mrs lander she found her in frowning thought i dont know but youll have to go back and write it all over again clementina she said if youve told him not to come ive been thinkin if you dont want to have anything to do with him we betta go ouaselves  yes answered clementina thats what ive said  you have well the witch is in it how came you to  i just wanted to talk with you about it but i thought maybe youd like to go or at least i should i should like to go home mrs landa  home retorted mrs lander thees plenty of places where you can be safe from the fella besides home though ill take you back thea this minute if you say so but you neednt to feel woked up about it  oh im not said clementina but with a gulp which betrayed her nervousness  i did think mrs lander went on that i should go into the vonndome for december and january but just as likely as not hed come pesterin thea too and i wouldnt go now if you was to give me the whole city of boston why shouldnt we go to florid  when mrs lander had once imagined the move the nomadic impulse mounted irresistably in her she spoke of hotels in the south where they could renew the summer and she mapped out a campaign which she put into instant action so far as to advance upon new york     part 2     xv  mrs lander went to a hotel in new york where she had been in the habit of staying with her husband on their way south or north the clerk knew her and shook hands with her across the register and said she could have her old rooms if she wanted them the bellboy who took up their handbaggage recalled himself to her the elevatorboy welcomed her with a smile of remembrance  since she was already up from coming off the sleepingcar she had no excuse for not going to breakfast like other people and she went with clementina to the diningroom where the headwaiter who found them places spoke with an outlandish accent and the waiter who served them had a parlance that seemed superficially english but was inwardly something else there was even a touch in the cooking of the familiar dishes that needed translation for the girls inexperienced palate she was finding a refuge in the strangeness of everything when she was startled by the sound of a familiar voice calling clementina claxon well i was sure all along it was you and i determined i wouldnt stand it another minute why child how you have changed why i declare you are quite a woman when did you come how pretty you are mrs milray took clementina in her arms and kissed her in proof of her admiration before the whole breakfast room she was very nice to mrs lander too who when clementina introduced them made haste to say that clementina was there on a visit with her mrs milray answered that she envied her such a visitor as miss claxon and protested that she should steal her away for a visit to herself if mr milray was not so much in love with her that it made her jealous mr milray has to have his breakfast in his room she explained to clementina hes not been so well since he lost his mother yes she said with decorous solemnity im still in mourning for her and clementina saw that she was in a tempered black she died last year and now im taking mr milray abroad to see if it wont cheer him up a little are you going south for the winter she inquired politely of mrs lander i wish i was going she said when mrs lander guessed they should go later on well you must come in and see me all you can clementina and i shall have the pleasure of calling upon you she added to mrs lander with state that was lost in the soubrettelike volatility of her flight from them the next moment goodness i forgot all about mr milrays breakfast she ran back to the table she had left on the other side of the room  who is that clementina asked mrs lander on their way to their rooms clementina explained as well as she could and mrs lander summed up her feeling in the verdict well shes a lady if ever i saw a lady and you dont see many of em nowadays  the girl remembered how mrs milray had once before seemed very fond of her and had afterwards forgotten the pretty promises and professions she had made her but she went with mrs lander to see her and she saw mr milray too for a little while he seemed glad of their meeting but still depressed by the bereavement which mrs milray supported almost with gayety when he left them she explained that he was a good deal away from her with his family as she approved of his being though she had apparently no wish to join him in all the steps of the reconciliation which the mothers death had brought about among them sometimes his sisters came to the hotel to see her but she amused herself perfectly without them and she gave much more of her leisure to clementina and mrs lander  she soon knew the whole history of the relation between them and the first time that clementina found her alone with mrs lander she could have divined that mrs lander had been telling her of the fane affair even if mrs milray had not at once called out to her i know all about it and ill tell you what clementina im going to take you over with me and marry you to an english duke mrs lander and i have been planning it all out and im going to send down to the steamer office and engage your passage its all settled  when she was gone mrs lander asked what do you spose your folks would say to your goin to europe anyway clementina as if the matter had been already debated between them  clementina hesitated i should want to be sua mrs milray really wanted me to go ova with her  why didnt you hear her say so demanded mrs lander  yes sighed clementina mrs lander i think mrs milray means what she says at the time but she is one that seems to forget  she thinks the wold of you mrs lander urged  she was very nice to me that summer at middlemount i guess maybe she would like to have us go with her the girl relented  i guess well wait and see said mrs lander i shouldnt want she should change her mind when it was too late as you say they were both silent for a time and then mrs lander resumed but i presume she hant got the only steams thats crossin what should you say about goin over on some otha steams i been south a good many wintas and i should feel kind of lonesome goin round to the places where i been with mr landa i felt it since i been here in this hotel some and i cant seem to want to go ova the same ground again well not right away  clementina said why of couse mrs landa  should you be willin asked mrs lander after another little pause if your folks was willin to go ova thea to some of them european countries to spend the winta  oh yes indeed said clementina  they discussed the matter in one of the full talks they both liked at the end mrs lander said well i guess you betta write home and ask your motha whetha you can go sot if we take the notion we can go any time tell her to telegraph if shell let you and do write all the ifs and ands sot shell know just how to answa without havin to have you write again  that evening mrs milray came to their table from where she had been dining alone and asked in banter well have you made up your minds to go over with me  mrs lander said bluntly we cant hadly believe you really want us to mrs milray  i dont want you who put such an idea into your head oh i know she threatened clementina with the doorkey which she was carrying in her hand it was you was it what an artful suspicious thing whats got into you child do you hate me she did not give clementina time to protest well now i can just tell you i do want you and ill be quite heartbroken if you dont come  well she wrote to her friends this mohning mrs lander said but i guess she wont git an answa in time for youa steamer even if they do let her go  oh yes she will mrs milray protested its all right now youve got to go and theres no use trying to get out of it  she came to them whenever she could find them in the diningroom and she knocked daily at their door till she knew that clementina had heard from home the girls mother wrote without a punctuation mark in her letter but with a great deal of sense that such a thing as her going to europe could not be settled by telegraph she did not think it worth while to report all the facts of a consultation with the rector which they had held upon getting clementinas request and which had renewed all the original question of her relations with mrs lander in an intensified form he had disposed of this upon much the same terms as before and they had yielded more readily because the experiment had so far succeeded clementina had apparently no complaint to make of mrs lander she was eager to go and the rector and his wife who had been invited to be of the council were both of the opinion that a course of european travel would be of the greatest advantage to the girl if she wished to fit herself for teaching it was an opportunity that they must not think of throwing away if mrs lander went to florence as it seemed from clementinas letter she thought of doing the girl would pass a delightful winter in study of one of the most interesting cities in the world and she would learn things which would enable her to do better for herself when she came home than she could ever hope to do otherwise she might never marry mr richling suggested and it was only right and fair that she should be equipped with as much culture as possible for the struggle of life mrs richling agreed with this rather vague theory but she was sure that clementina would get married to greater advantage in florence than anywhere else they neither of them really knew anything at first hand about florence the rectors opinion was grounded on the thought of the joy that a sojourn in italy would have been to him his wife derived her hope of a florentine marriage for clementina from several romances in which love and travel had gone hand in hand to the lasting credit of triumphant american girlhood  the claxons were not able to enter into their view of the case but if mrs lander wanted to go to florence instead of florida they did not see why clementina should not go with her to one place as well as the other they were not without a sense of flattery from the fact that their daughter was going to europe but they put that as far from them as they could the mother severely and the father ironically as something too silly and they tried not to let it weigh with them in making up their mind but to consider only clementinas best good and not even to regard her pleasure her mother put before her the most crucial questions she could think of in her letter and then gave her full leave from her father as well as herself to go if she wished  clementina had rather it had been too late to go with the milrays but she felt bound to own her decision when she reached it and mrs milray whatever her real wish was made it a point of honor to help get mrs lander berths on her steamer it did not require much effort there are plenty of berths for the latestcomers on a winter passage and clementina found herself the fellow passenger of mrs milray     xvi  as soon as mrs lander could make her way to her stateroom she got into her berth and began to take the different remedies for seasickness which she had brought with her mrs milray said that was nice and that now she and clementina could have a good time but before it came to that she had taken pity on a number of lonely young men whom she found on board she cheered them up by walking round the ship with them but if any of them continued dull in spite of this she dropped him and took another and before she had been two days out she had gone through with nearly all the lonely young men on the list of cabin passengers she introduced some of them to clementina but at such times as she had them in charge and for the most part she left her to milray once as the girl sat beside him in her steamerchair mrs milray shed a wrap on his knees in whirring by on the arm of one of her young men with some laughed and shouted charge about it  what did she say he asked clementina slanting the downpulled brim of his soft hat purblindly toward her  she said she had not understood and then milray asked what sort of person is that boston youth of mrs milrays is he a donkey or a lamb  clementina said ingenuously oh shes walking with that english gentleman nowthat lod  ah yes said milray hes not very much to look at i hear  well not very much clementina admitted she did not like to talk against people  lords are sometimes disappointing clementina milray said but then so are other great men ive seen politicians on our side who were disappointing and there are clergymen and gamblers who dont look it he laughed sadly thats the way people talk who are a little disappointing themselves i hope you dont expect too much of yourself clementina  i dont know what you mean she said stiffening with a suspicion that he might be going to make fun of her  he laughed more gayly well i mean we must hold the other fellows up to their duty or we cant do our own we need their example charity may begin at home but duty certainly begins abroad he went on as if it were a branch of the same inquiry did you ever meet my sisters they came to the hotel in new york to see mrs milray  yes i was in the room once when they came in  did you like them  yesi scacely spoke to themi only stayed a moment  would you like to see any more of the family  why of couse clementina was amused at his asking but he seemed in earnest  one of my sisters lives in florence and mrs milray says you think of going there too  mrs landa thought it would be a good place to spend the winter is it a pleasant place  oh delightful do you know much about italy  not very much i dont believe  well my sister has lived a good while in florence i should like to give you a letter to her  oh thank you said clementina  milray smiled at her spare acknowledgment but inquired gravely what do you expect to do in florence  why i presume whateva mrs landa wants to do  do you think mrs lander will want to go into society  this question had not occurred to clementina i dont believe she will she said thoughtfully  shall you  clementina laughed why do you think she ventured that society would want me to  yes i think it would if youre as charming as youve tried to make me believe oh i dont mean to your own knowledge but some people have ways of being charming without knowing it if mrs lander isnt going into society and there should be a way found for you to go dont refuse will you  i shall wait and see if im asked fust  yes that will be best said milray but i shall give you a letter to my sister she and i used to be famous cronies and we went to a great many parties together when we were young people we thought the world was a fine thing then but it changes  he fell into a muse and they were both sitting quite silent when mrs milray came round the corner of the music room in the course of her twentieth or thirtieth compass of the deck and introduced her lord to her husband and to clementina he promptly ignored milray and devoted himself to the girl leaning over her with his hand against the bulkhead behind her and talking down upon her  lord lioncourt must have been about thirty but he had the heated and broken complexion of a man who has taken more than is good for him in twice that number of years this was one of the wrongs nature had done him in apparent resentment of the social advantages he was born to for he was rather abstemious as englishmen go he looked a very shy person till he spoke and then you found that he was not in the least shy he looked so english that you would have expected a strong english accent of him but his speech was more that of an american without the nasality this was not apparently because he had been much in america he was returning from his first visit to the states which had been spent chiefly in the territories after a brief interval of newport he had preferred the west he liked rather to hunt than to be hunted though even in the west his main business had been to kill time which he found more plentiful there than other game the natives everywhere were much the same thing to him if he distinguished it was in favor of those who did not suppose themselves cultivated if again he had a choice it was for the females they seemed to him more amusing than the males who struck him as having an exaggerated reputation for humor he did not care much for clementinas past as he knew it from mrs milray and if it did not touch his fancy it certainly did not offend his taste a real artistocracy is above social prejudice when it will he had known some of his order choose the mothers of their heirs from the music halls and when it came to a question of distinctions among americans he could not feel them they might be richer or poorer but they could not be more patrician or more plebeian  the passengers he told clementina were getting up at this point of the ships run an entertainment for the benefit of the seamans hospital in liverpool that wellknown convention of oceantravel which is sure at some time or other to enlist all the talent on board every english steamer in some sort of public appeal he was not very clear how he came to be on the committee for drumming up talent for the occasion his distinction seemed to have been conferred by a popular vote in the smoking room as nearly as he could make out but here he was and he was counting upon miss claxon to help him out he said mrs milray had told him about that charming affair they had got up in the mountains and he was sure they could have something of the kind again perhaps not a coaching party that mightnt be so easy to manage at sea but isnt there something elsesome tableaux or something if we couldnt have the months of the year we might have the points of the compass and you could take your choice  he tried to get something out of the notion but nothing came of it that mrs milray thought possible she said across her husband on whose further side she had sunk into a chair that they must have something very informal everybody must do what they could separately i know you can do anything you like clementina cant you play something or sing at clementinas look of utter denial she added desperately or dance something a light came into the girls face at which she caught i know you can dance something why of course now what is it  clementina smiled at her vehemence why its nothing and i dont know whether i should like to  oh yes urged lord lioncourt such a good cause you know  what is it mrs milray insisted is it something you could do alone  its just a dance that i learned at woodlake the teacha said that all the young ladies wee leaning it its a skutdance  the very thing mrs milray shouted itll be the hit of the evening  but ive never done it before any one clementina faltered  theyll all be doing their turns the englishman said speaking and singing and playing  clementina felt herself giving way and she pleaded in final reluctance but i havent got a pleated skut in my steama trunk  no matter we can manage that mrs milray jumped to her feet and took lord lioncourts arm now we must go and drum up somebody else he did not seem eager to go but he started then thats all settled she shouted over her shoulder to clementina  no no mrs milray clementina called after her the ship tilts so  nonsense its the smoothest run she ever made in december and ill engage to have the sea as steady as a rock for you remember now youve promised  mrs milray whirled her englishman away and left clementina sitting beside her husband  did you want to dance for them clementina he asked  i dont know she said with the vague smile of one to whom a pleasant hope has occurred  i thought perhaps you were letting mrs milray bully you into it shes a frightful tyrant  oh i guess i should like to do it if you think it would benice  i dare say it will be the nicest thing at their ridiculous show milray laughed as if her willingness to do the dance had defeated a sentimental sympathy in him  i dont believe it will be that said clementina beaming joyously but i guess i shall try it if i can find the right kind of a dress  is a pleated skirt absolutely necessary asked milray gravely  i dont see how i could get on without it said clementina  she was so serious still when she went down to her stateroom that mrs lander was distracted from her potential ailments to ask what is it clementina  oh nothing mrs milray has got me to say that i would do something at a concert they ah going to have on the ship she explained its that skut dance i learnt at woodlake of miss wilson  well i guess if youre worryin about that you neednt to  oh im not worrying about the dance i was just thinking what i should wear if i could only get at the trunks  it wont make any matte what you wear said mrs lander itll be the greatest thing and if t want for this seasickness that i have to keep fightin off hea night and day i should come up and see you myself you ah just lovely in that dance clementina  do you think so mrs landa asked the girl gratefully well mr milray didnt seem to think that i need to have a pleated skut any rate im going to look over my things and see if i cant make something else do     xvii  the entertainment was to be the second night after that and mrs milray at first took the whole affair into her own hands she was willing to let the others consult with her but she made all the decisions and she became so prepotent that she drove lord lioncourt to rebellion in the case of some theatrical people whom he wanted in the programme he wished her to let them feel that they were favoring rather than favored and she insisted that it should be quite the other way she professed a scruple against having theatrical people in the programme at all which she might not have felt if her own past had been different and she spoke with an abhorrence of the stage which he could by no means tolerate in the case she submitted with dignity when she could not help it perhaps she submitted with too much dignity her concession verged upon hauteur and in her arrogant meekness she went back to another of her young men whom she began to post again as the companion of her promenades  he had rather an anxious air in the enjoyment of the honor but the englishman seemed unconscious of its loss or else he chose to ignore it he frankly gave his leisure to clementina and she thought he was very pleasant there was something different in his way from that of any of the other men she had met something very natural and simple a way of being easy in what he was and not caring whether he was like others or not he was not ashamed of being ignorant of anything he did not know and she was able to instruct him on some points he took her quite seriously when she told him about middlemount and how her family came to settle there and then how she came to be going to europe with mrs lander he said mrs milray had spoken about it but he had not understood quite how it was before and he hoped mrs lander was coming to the entertainment  he did not seem aware that mrs milray was leaving the affair more and more to him he went forward with it and was as amiable with her as she would allow he was so amiable with everybody that he reconciled many true americans to his leadership who felt that as nearly all the passengers were americans the chief patron of the entertainment ought to have been some distinguished american the want of an american who was very distinguished did something to pacify them but the behavior of an english lord who put on no airs was the main agency when the night came they filled the large music room of the asia minor and stood about in front of the sofas and chairs so many deep that it was hard to see or hear through them  they each paid a shilling admittance they were prepared to give munificently besides when the hat came round and after the first burst of blundering from lord lioncourt they led the magnanimous applause he said he never minded making a bad speech in a good cause and he made as bad a one as very well could be he closed it by telling mark twains whistling story so that those who knew it by heart missed the paint but that might have been because he hurried it to get himself out of the way of the others following when he had done one of the most ardent of the americans proposed three cheers for him  the actress whom he had secured in spite of mrs milray appeared in womans dress contrary to her inveterate professional habit and followed him with great acceptance in her favorite varietystage song and then her husband gave imitations of sir henry irving and of miss maggie kline in trow him down mccloskey with a cockney accent a frightened little girl whose mother had volunteered her talent gasped a ballad to her mothers accompaniment and two young girls played a duet on the mandolin and guitar a gentleman of cosmopolitan military tradition who sold the pools in the smokingroom and was the friend of all the men present and the acquaintance of several gave selections of his autobiography prefatory to bellowing in a deep bass voice theyre hanging danny deaver and then a lady interpolated herself into the programme with a kindness which lord lioncourt acknowledged in saying the more the merrier and sang bonnie dundee thumping the piano out of all proportion to her size and apparent strength  some advances which clementina had made for mrs milrays help about the dress she should wear in her dance met with bewildering indifference and she had fallen back upon her own devices she did not think of taking back her promise and she had come to look forward to her part with a happiness which the good weather and the even sway of the ship encouraged but her pulses fluttered as she glided into the music room and sank into a chair next mrs milray she had on an accordion skirt which she had been able to get out of her trunk in the hold and she felt that the glance of mrs milray did not refuse it approval  that will do nicely clementina she said she added in careless acknowledgement of her own failure to direct her choice i see you didnt need my help after all and the thorny point which clementina felt in her praise was rankling when lord lioncourt began to introduce her  he made rather a mess of it but as soon as he came to an end of his wellmeant blunders she stood up and began her poses and paces it was all very innocent with something courageous as well as appealing she had a kind of tender dignity in her dance and the delicate beauty of her face translated itself into the grace of her movements it was not impersonal there was her own quality of sylvan of elegant in it but it was unconscious and so far it was typical it was classic mrs milrays bostonian achieved a snub from her by saying it was like a botticelli and in fact it was merely the skirtdance which society had borrowed from the stage at that period leaving behind the footlights its more acrobatic phases but keeping its pretty turns and bows and bends clementina did it not only with tender dignity but when she was fairly launched in it with a passion to which her sense of mrs milrays strange unkindness lent defiance the dance was still so new a thing then that it had a surprise to which the girls gentleness lent a curious charm and it had some adventitious fascinations from the necessity she was in of weaving it in and out among the stationary armchairs and sofas which still further cramped the narrow space where she gave it her own delight in it shone from her smiling face which was appealingly happy just before it should have ended one of those wandering waves that roam the smoothest sea struck the ship and clementina caught herself skilfully from falling and reeled to her seat while the room rang with the applause and sympathetic laughter for the mischance she had baffled there was a storm of encores but clementina called out the ship tilts so and her naivete won her another burst of favor which was at its height when lord lioncourt had an inspiration  he jumped up and said miss claxon is going to oblige us with a little bit of dramatics now and im sure youll all enjoy that quite as much as her beautiful dancing shes going to take the principal part in the laughable afterpiece of passing round the hat and i hope the audience willaaado the rest shes consented on this occasion to use a hator cap ratherof her own the charming tam oshanter in which weve all seen her andaadmired her about the ship for the week past  he caught up the flat woolen steamercap which clementina had left in her seat beside mrs milray when she rose to dance and held it aloft some one called out chorus for hes a jolly good fellow and led off in his praise lord lioncourt shouted through the uproar the announcement that while miss claxon was taking up the collection mr ewins of boston would sing one of the student songs of cambridgeno harvarduniversity the music being his own  everyone wanted to make some joke or some compliment to clementina about the cap which grew momently heavier under the sovereigns and half sovereigns half crowns and half dollars shillings quarters greenbacks and every fraction of english and american silver and the actor who had given the imitations made bold as he said to ask his lordship if the audience might not hope before they dispersed for something more from miss claxon he was sure she could do something more he for one would be glad of anything and clementina turned from putting her cap into mrs milrays lap to find lord lioncourt bowing at her elbow and offering her his arm to lead her to the spot where she had stood in dancing  the joy of her triumph went to her head she wished to retrieve herself from any shadow of defeat  she stood panting a moment and then if she had had the professional instinct she would have given her admirers the surprise of something altogether different from what had pleased them before that was what the actor would have done but clementina thought of how her dance had been brought to an untimely close by the rolling of the ship she burned to do it all as she knew it no matter how the sea behaved and in another moment she struck into it again this time the sea behaved perfectly and the dance ended with just the swoop and swirl she had meant it to have at first the spectators went generously wild over her they cheered and clapped her and crowded upon her to tell how lovely it was but she escaped from them and ran back to the place where she had left mrs milray she was not there and clementinas cap full of alms lay abandoned on the chair lord lioncourt said he would take charge of the money if she would lend him her cap to carry it in to the purser and she made her way into the saloon in a distant corner she saw mrs milray with mr ewins  she advanced in a vague dismay toward them and as she came near mrs milray said to mr ewins i dont like this place lets go over yonder she rose and rushed him to the other end of the saloon  lord lioncourt came in looking about ah have you found her he asked gayly there were twenty pounds in your cap and two hundred dollars  yes said clementina shes over thea she pointed and then shrank and slipped away     xviii  at breakfast mrs milray would not meet clementinas eye she talked to the people across the table in a loud lively voice and then suddenly rose and swept past her out of the saloon  the girl did not see her again till mrs milray came up on the promenade at the hour when people who have eaten too much breakfast begin to spoil their appetite for luncheon with the tea and bouillon of the deckstewards she looked fiercely about and saw clementina seated in her usual place but with lord lioncourt in her own chair next her husband and ewins on foot before her they were both talking to clementina whom lord lioncourt was accusing of being in low spirits unworthy of her last nights triumphs he jumped up and offered his place ive got your chair mrs milray  oh no she said coldly i was just coming to look after mr milray but i see hes in good hands  she turned away as if to make the round of the deck and ewins hurried after her he came back directly and said that mrs milray had gone into the library to write letters he stayed uneasily trying to talk but with the air of a man who has been snubbed and has not got back his composure  lord lioncourt talked on until he had used up the incidents of the night before and the probabilities of their getting into queenstown before morning then he and mr ewins went to the smokingroom together and clementina was left alone with milray  clementina he said gently i dont see everything but isnt there some trouble between you and mrs milray  why i dont know what it can be answered the girl with trembling lips ive been trying to find out and i cant undastand it  ah those things are often very obscure said milray with a patient smile  clementina wanted to ask him if mrs milray had said anything to him about her but she could not and he did not speak again till he heard her stir in rising from her chair then he said i havent forgotten that letter to my sister clementina i will give it to you before we leave the steamer are you going to stay in liverpool over night or shall you go up to london at once  i dont know it will depend upon how mrs landa feels  well we shall see each other again dont be worried he looked up at her with a smile and he could not see how forlornly she returned it  as the day passed mrs milrays angry eyes seemed to search her out for scorn whenever clementina found herself the centre of her last nights celebrity many people came up and spoke to her at first with a certain expectation of knowingness in her which her simplicity baffled then they either dropped her and went away or stayed and tried to make friends with her because of this an elderly english clergyman and his wife were at first compassionately anxious about her and then affectionately attentive to her in her obvious isolation clementinas simplehearted response to their advances appeared to win while it puzzled them and they seemed trying to divine her in the strange double character she wore to their more single civilization the theatrical people thought none the worse of her for her simplehearted ness apparently they were both very sweet to her and wanted her to promise to come and see them in their little box in st johns wood once indeed clementina thought she saw relenting in mrs milrays glance but it hardened again as lord lioncourt and mr ewins came up to her and began to talk with her she could not go to her chair beside milray for his wife was now keeping guard of him on the other side with unexampled devotion lord lioncourt asked her to walk with him and she consented she thought that mr ewins would go and sit by mrs milray of course but when she came round in her tour of the ship mrs milray was sitting alone beside her husband  after dinner she went to the library and got a book but she could not read there every chair was taken by people writing letters to send back from queenstown in the morning and she strayed into the ladies sitting room where no ladies seemed ever to sit and lost herself in a miserable muse over her open page  some one looked in at the door and then advanced within and came straight to clementina she knew without looking up that it was mrs milray i have been hunting for you miss claxon she said in a voice frostily fierce and with a bearing furiously formal i have a letter to miss milray that my husband wished me to write for you and give you with his compliments  thank you said clementina she rose mechanically to her feet and at the same time mrs milray sat down  you will find miss milray she continued with the same glacial hauteur a very agreeable and cultivated lady  clementina said nothing and mrs milray added  and i hope she may have the happiness of being more useful to you than i have  what do you mean mrs milray clementina asked with unexpected spirit and courage  i mean simply this that i have not succeeded in putting you on your guard against your love of admirationespecially the admiration of gentlemen a young girl cant be too careful how she accepts the attentions of gentlemen and if she seems to invite them  mrs milray cried clementina how can you say such a thing to me  how i shall have to be plain with you i see perhaps i have not considered that after all you know nothing about life and are not to blame for things that a person born and bred in the world would understand from childhood if you dont know already i can tell you that the way you have behaved with lord lioncourt during the last two or three days and the way you showed your pleasure the other night in his ridiculous flatteries of you was enough to make you the talk of the whole steamer i advise you for your own sake to take my warning in time you are very young and inexperienced and ignorant but that will not save you in the eyes of the world if you keep on mrs milray rose and now i will leave you to think of what i have said here is the letter for miss milray  clementina shook her head i dont want it  you dont want it but i have written it at mr milrays request and i shall certainly leave it with you  if you do said clementina i shall not take it  and what shall i say to mr milray  what you have just said to me  what have i said to you  that im a bold girl and that ive tried to make men admia me  mrs milray stopped as if suddenly daunted by a fact that had not occurred to her before did i say that  the same as that  i didnt mean thatimerely meant to put you on your guard it may be because you are so innocent yourself that you cant imagine what others think andi did it out of my regard for you  clementina did not answer  mrs milray went on that was why i was so provoked with you i think that for a young girl to stand up and dance alone before a whole steamer full of strangersclementina looked at her without speaking and mrs milray hastened to say to be sure i advised you to do it but i certainly was surprised that you should give an encore but no matter now this letter  i cant take it mrs milray said clementina with a swelling heart  now listen urged mrs milray you think im just saying it because if you dont take it i shall have to tell mr milray i was so hateful to you you couldnt well i should hate to tell him that but that isnt the reason there she tore the letter in pieces and threw it on the floor clementina did not make any sign of seeing this and mrs milray dropped upon her chair again oh how hard you are cant you say something to me  clementina did not lift her eyes i dont feel like saying anything just now  mrs milray was silent a moment then she sighed well you may hate me but i shall always be your friend what hotel are you going to in liverpool  i dont know said clementina  you had better come to the one where we go im afraid mrs lander wont know how to manage very well and weve been in liverpool so often may i speak to her about it  if you want to clementina coldly assented  i see said mrs milray you dont want to be under the same roof with me well you neednt but ill tell you a good hotel the one that the trains start out of and ill send you that letter for miss milray clemeutina was silent well ill send it anyway  mrs milray went away in sudden tears but the girl remained dryeyed     xix  mrs lander realized when the ship came to anchor in the stream at liverpool that she had not been seasick a moment during the voyage in the brisk cold of the winter morning as they came ashore in the tug she fancied a property of health in the european atmosphere which she was sure would bring her right up if she stayed long enough and a regret that she had never tried it with mr lander mingled with her new hopes for herself  but clementina looked with homesick eyes at the strangeness of the alien scene the pale low heaven which seemed not to be clouded and yet was so dim the flat shores with the little railroad trains running in and out over them the grimy bulks of the city and the shipping in the river sparse and sombre after the gay forest of sails and stacks at new york  she did not see the milrays after she left the tug in the rapid dispersal of the steamers passengers they both took leave of her at the dock and mrs milray whispered with penitence in her voice and eyes i will write but the girl did not answer  before mrs landers trunks and her own were passed she saw lord lioncourt going away with his heavily laden man at his heels mr ewins came up to see if he could help her through the customs but she believed that he had come at mrs milrays bidding and she thanked him so prohibitively that he could not insist the english clergyman who had spoken to her the morning after the charity entertainment left his wife with mrs lander and came to her help and then mr ewins went his way  the clergyman who appeared to feel the friendlessness of the young girl and the old woman a charge laid upon him bestowed a sort of fatherly protection upon them both he advised them to stop at a hotel for a few hours and take the later train for london that he and his wife were going up by they drove to the hotel together where mrs lander could not be kept from paying the omnibus and made them have luncheon with her she allowed the clergyman to get her tickets and she could not believe that he had taken second class tickets for himself and his wife she said that she had never heard of anyone travelling second class before and she assured him that they never did it in america she begged him to let her pay the difference and bring his wife into her compartment which the guard had reserved for her she urged that the money was nothing to her compared with the comfort of being with some one you knew and the clergyman had to promise that as they should be neighbors he would look in upon her whenever the train stopped long enough  before it began to move clementina thought she saw lord lioncourt hurrying past their carriagewindow at rugby the clergyman appeared but almost before he could speak lord lioncourts little red face showed at his elbow he asked clementina to present him to mrs lander who pressed him to get into her compartment the clergyman vanished and lord lioncourt yielded  mrs lander found him able to tell her the best way to get to florence whose situation he seemed to know perfectly he confessed that he had been there rather often he made out a little itinerary for going straight through by sleepingcar as soon as you crossed the channel she had said that she always liked a through train when she could get it and the less stops the better she bade clementina take charge of the plan and not lose it without it she did not see what they could do she conceived of him as a friend of clementinas and she lost in the strange environment the shyness she had with most people she told him how mr lander had made his money and from what beginnings he rose to be ignorant of what he really was worth when he died she dwelt upon the diseases they had suffered and at the thought of his death so unnecessary in view of the good that the air was already doing her in europe she shed tears  lord lioncourt was very polite but there was no resumption of the ships comradery in his manner clementina could not know how quickly this always drops from people who have been fellowpassengers and she wondered if he were guarding himself from her because she had danced at the charity entertainment the poison which mrs milray had instilled worked in her thoughts while she could not help seeing how patient he was with all mrs landers questions he answered them with a simplicity of his own or laughed and put them by when they were quite impossible many of them related to the comparative merits of english and american railroads and what he thought himself of these mrs lander noted the difference of the english stations but she did not see much in the landscape to examine him upon she required him to tell her why the rooks they saw were not crows and she was not satisfied that he should say the country seat she pointed out was a castle when it was plainly deficient in battlements she based upon his immovable confidence in respect to it an inquiry into the structure of english society and she made him tell her what a lord was and a commoner and how the royal family differed from both she asked him how he came to be a lord and when he said that it was a peerage of george the thirds creation she remembered that george iii was the one we took up arms against she found that lord lioncourt knew of our revolution generally but was ignorant of such particulars as the battle of bunker hill and the surrender of cornwallis as well as the throwing of the tea into boston harbor he was much struck by this incident and said and quite right he was sure  he told clementina that her friends the milrays had taken the steamer for london in the morning he believed they were going to egypt for the winter cairo he said was great fun and he advised mrs lander if she found florence a bit dull to push on there she asked if it was an easy place to get to and he assured her that it was very easy from italy  mrs lander was again at home in her world of railroads and hotels but she confessed after he left them at the next station that she should have felt more at home if he had been going on to london with them she philosophized him to the disadvantage of her own countrymen as much less offish than a great many new york and boston peuple he had given her a good opinion of the whole english nation and the clergyman who had been so nice to them at liverpool confirmed her friendly impressions of england by getting her a small omnibus at the station in london before he got a cab for himself and his wife and drove away to complete his own journey on another road she celebrated the omnibus as if it were an effect of his goodness in her behalf she admired its capacity for receiving all their trunks and saving the trouble and delay of the express which always vexed her so much in new york and which had nearly failed in getting her baggage to the steamer in time  the omnibus remained her chief association with london for she decided to take the first through train for italy in the morning she wished to be settled by which she meant placed in a florentine hotel for the winter that lord as she now began and always continued to call lioncourt had first given her the name of the best little hotel in florence but as it had neither elevator nor furnace heat in it he agreed in the end that it would not do for her and mentioned the most modern and expensive house on the lungarno he told her he did not think she need telegraph for rooms but she took this precaution before leaving london and was able to secure them at a price which seemed to her quite as much as she would have had to pay for the same rooms at a first class hotel on the back bay  the manager had reserved for her one of the best suites which had just been vacated by a russian princess i guess you better cable to your folks where you ah clementina she said because if youre satisfied i am and i presume we shant want to change as long as we stay in florence my but its sightly she joined clementina a moment at the windows looking upon the arno and the hills beyond it i guess youll spend most of your time settin at this winder and i shant blame you  they had arrived late in the dull soft winter afternoon the landlord led the way himself to their apartment and asked if they would have fire a facchino came in and kindled roaring blazes on the hearths at the same time a servant lighted all the candles on the tables and mantels they both gracefully accepted the fees that mrs lander made clementina give them the facchino kissed the girls hand my said mrs lander i guess you never had your hand kissed before  the hotel developed advantages which if not those she was used to were still advantages the halls were warmed by a furnace and she came to like the little logs burning in her rooms in the care of her own fire she went back to the simple time of her life in the country and chose to kindle it herself when it died out with the fagots of broom that blazed up so briskly  in the first days of her stay she made inquiry for the best american doctor in florence and she found him so intelligent that she at once put her liver in his charge with a history of her diseases and symptoms of every kind she told him that she was sure that he could have cured mr lander if he had only had him in time she exacted a new prescription from him for herself and made him order some quinine pills for clementina against the event of her feeling debilitated by the air of florence     xx  in these first days a letter came to clementina from mrs landers banker enclosing the introduction which mrs milray had promised to her sisterinlaw it was from mr milray as before and it was in mrs milrays handwriting but no message from her came with it to clementina it explained itself but she had to explain it to mrs lander she had to tell her of mrs milrays behavior after the entertainment on the steamer and mrs lander said that clementina had done just exactly right and they both decided against some impulses of curiosity in clementinas heart that she should not make use of the introduction  the hotel des financieres was mainly frequented by rich americans full of ready money and by rich russians of large credit better americans and worse went like the english to smaller and cheaper hotels and clementinas acquaintance was confined to mothers as shy and ungrammatical as mrs lander herself and daughters blankly indifferent to her mrs lander drove out every day when it did not rain and she took clementina with her because the doctor said it would do them both good but otherwise the girl remained pent in their apartment the doctor found her a teacher and she kept on with her french and began to take lessons in italian she spoke with no one but her teacher except when the doctor came at the table dhote she heard talk of the things that people seemed to come to florence for pictures statues palaces famous places and it made her ashamed of not knowing about them but she could not go to see these things alone and mrs lander in the content she felt with all her circumstances seemed not to suppose that clementina could care for anything but the comfort of the hotel and the doctors visits when the girl began to get letters from home in answer to the first she had written back boasting how beautiful florence was they assumed that she was very gay and demanded full accounts of her pleasures her brother jim gave something of the village news but he said he supposed that she would not care for that and she would probably be too proud to speak to them when she came home the richlings had called in to share the family satisfaction in clementinas first experiences and mrs richling wrote her very sweetly of their happiness in them she charged her from the rector not to forget any chance of selfimprovement in the allurements of society but to make the most of her rare opportunities she said that they had got a guidebook to florence with a plan of the city and were following her in the expeditions they decided she must be making every day they were reading up the florentine history in sismondis italian republics and she bade clementina be sure and see all the scenes of savonarolas martyrdom so that they could talk them over together when she returned  clementina wondered what mrs richling would think if she told her that all she knew of florence was what she overheard in the talk of the girls in the hotel who spoke before her of their dances and afternoon teas and evenings at the opera and drives in the cascine and parties to fiesole as if she were not by  the days and weeks passed until carnival was half gone and mrs lander noticed one day that clementina appeared dull you dont seem to get much acquainted she suggested  oh thees plenty of time said clementina  i wish thee was somebody you could go round with and see the place shouldnt you like to see the place mrs lander pursued  theres no hurry about it mrs lander it will stay as long as we do  mrs lander was thoughtfully silent then she said i declare ive got half a mind to make you send that letta to miss milray after all what difference if mrs milray did act so ugly to you he never did and shes his sista  oh i dont want to send it mrs landa you mustnt ask me to i shall get along said clementina the recognition of her forlornness deepened it but she was cheerfuller for no reason the next morning and that afternoon the doctor unexpectedly came upon a call which he made haste to say was not professional  ive just come from another patient of mine and i promised to ask if you had not crossed on the same ship with a brother of hersmr milray  celementina and mrs lander looked guiltily at each other i guess we did mrs lander owned at last with a reluctant sigh  then she says you have a letter for her  the doctor spoke to both but his looks confessed that he was not ignorant of the fact when mrs lander admitted well clementina hee has  she wants to know why you havent delivered it the doctor blurted out  mrs lander looked at clementina i guess she hant quite got round to it yet have you clementina  the doctor put in well miss milray is rather a dangerous person to keep waiting if you dont deliver it pretty soon i shouldnt be surprised if she came to get it dr welwright was a young man in the early thirties with a laugh that a great many ladies said had done more than any one thing for them and he now prescribed it for clementina but it did not seem to help her in the trouble her face betrayed  mrs lander took the word well i wouldnt say it to everybody but youre our doctor and i guess you wont mind it we dont like the way mrs milray acted to clementina in the ship and we dont want to be beholden to any of her folks i dont know as clementina wants me to tell you just what it was and i wont but thats the long and shot of it  im sorry the doctor said ive never met mrs milray but miss milray has such a pleasant house and likes to get young people about her there are a good many young people in your hotel though and i suppose you all have a very good time here together he ended by speaking to clementina and now he said he had done his errand and must be going  when he was gone mrs lander faltered i dont know but what we made a mistake clementina  its too late to worry about it now said the girl  we hant bound to stay in florence said mrs lander thoughtfully i only took the rooms by the week and we can go any time clementina if you are uncomftable bein here on miss milrays account we could go to rome they say romes a nice place or to egypt  mrs milrays in egypt clementina suggested  thats true mrs lander admitted with a sigh after a while she went on i dont know as weve got any right to keep the letter it belongs to her dont it  i guess it belongs to me as much as it does to her said clementina if its to her its for me i am not going to send it mrs landa  they were still in this conclusion when early in the following afternoon miss milrays cards were brought up for mrs lander and miss claxon  well i declae cried mrs lander that docta must have gone straight and told her what we said  he had no right to said clementina but neither of them was displeased and after it was over mrs lander said that any one would have thought the call was for her instead of clementina from the way miss milray kept talking to her she formed a high opinion of her and miss milray put clementina in mind of mr milray she had the same hair of chiseled silver and the same smile she moved like him and talked like him but with a greater liveliness she asked fondly after him and made clementina tell her if he seemed quite well and in good spirits she was civilly interested in mrs milrays health at the embarrassment which showed itself in the girl she laughed and said dont imagine i dont know all about it miss claxon my sisterinlaw has owned up very handsomely she isnt half bad as the english say and i think she likes owning up if she can do it safely  and you dont think asked mrs lander that clementina done wrong to dance that way  clementina blushed and miss milray laughed again if youll let miss claxon come to a little party im giving she may do her dance at my house but she shant be obliged to do it or anything she doesnt like dont say she hasnt a gown ready or something of that kind you dont know the resources of florence and how the dress makers here doat upon doing impossible things in no time at all and being ready before they promise if youll put miss claxon in my hands ill see that shes dressed for my dance i live out on one of the hills over there that you see from your windowsshe nodded toward themin a beautiful villa too cold for winter and too hot for summer but i think miss claxon can endure its discomfort for a day if you can spare her and she will consent to leave you to the tender mercies of your maid and miss milray paused at the kind of unresponsive blank to which she found herself talking and put up her lorgnette to glance from mrs lander to clementina the girl said with embarrassment i dont think i ought to leave mrs landa just now she isnt very well and i shouldnt like to leave her alone  but were just as much obliged to you as if she could come mrs lander interrupted and later on maybe she can you see we hant got any maid yit well we did have one at woodlake but she made us do so many things for her that we thought we should like to do a few things for ouaselves awhile  if miss milray perhaps did not conceive the situation exactly she said oh they were quite right in that but she might count upon miss claxon for her dance might not she and might not she do anything in her power for them she rose to go but mrs lander took her at her word so far as to say why yes if she could tell clementina the best place to get a dress she guessed the child would be glad enough to come to the dance  tell her miss milray cried ill take her put on your hat my dear she said to clementina and come with me now my carriage is at your door  clementina looked at mrs lander who said go of couse child i wish i could go too  do come too miss milray entreated  no no said mrs lander flattered i ant feeling very well today i guess im better off at home but dont you hurry back on my account clementina while the girl was gone to put on her hat she talked on about her shes the best gul in the wold and she wont be one of the poorest and i shall feel that im doin just what mr landa would have wanted i should he picked her out himself moa than three yeas ago when we was drivin past her house at middlemount and it was to humor him afta he was gone moa than anything else that i took her well she want so very easy to git either i can tell you she cut short her history of the affair to say when clementina came back i want you should do the odderin yourself miss milray and not let her scrimp with the money she wants to git some visitin cahds and if you miss anything about her that shed ought to have or that any otha yong ladys got wont you just git it for her  as soon as she imagined the case miss milray set herself to overcome mrs landers reluctance from a maid she prevailed with her to try the italian woman whom she sent her and in a day the genial maddalena had effaced the whole tradition of the bleak ellida it was not essential to the understanding which instantly established itself between them that they should have any language in common they babbled at each other mrs lander in her bostonized yankee and maddalena in her gutteral florentine and mrs lander was flattered to find how well she knew italian  miss milray had begun being nice to clementina in fealty to her brother who so seldom made any proof of her devotion to him and to whom she bad remained passionately true through his shady past she was eager to humor his whim for the little country girl who had taken his fancy because it was his whim and not because she had any hopes that clementina would justify it she had made dr welwright tell her all he knew about her and his report of her grace and beauty had piqued her curiosity his account of the forlorn dullness of her life with mrs lander in their hotel had touched her heart but she was still skeptical when she went to get her letter of introduction when she brought clementina home from the dressmakers she asked if she might kiss her and said she was already in love with her  her love might have made her wish to do everything for her that she now began to do but it simplified the situation to account for her to the world as the ward of mrs lander who was as rich as she was vulgar and it was with clementina in this character that miss milray began to make the round of afternoon teas and inspired invitations for her at pleasant houses by giving a young ladies lunch for her at her own before the night of her little dance she had lost any misgiving she had felt at first in the delight of seeing clementina take the world as if she had thought it would always behave as amiably as that and as if she had forgotten her unkind experiences to the contrary she knew from mrs lander how the girls at their hotel had left her out but miss milray could not see that clementina met them with rancor when her authority brought them together if the child was humiliated by her past in the gross lonely luxury of mrs landers life or the unconscious poverty of her own home she did not show it in the presence of the world that now opened its arms to her she remained so tranquil in the midst of all the novel differences that it made her friend feel rather vulgar in her anxieties for her and it was not always enough to find that she had not gone wrong simply because she had hold still and had the gift of waiting for things to happen sometimes when miss milray had almost decided that her passivity was the calm of a savage she betrayed so sweet and grateful a sense of all that was done for her that her benefactress decided that she was not rustic but was sylvan in a way of her own and not so much ignorant as innocent she discovered that she was not ignorant even of books but with no literary effect from them she had transmitted her reading into the substance of her native gentleness and had both ideas and convictions when clementina most affected her as an untried wilderness in the conventional things she most felt her equality to any social fortune that might befall her and then she would have liked to see her married to a title and taking the glory of this world with an unconsciousness that experience would never wholly penetrate but then again she felt that this would be somehow a profanation and she wanted to pack her up and get her back to middlemount before anything of the kind should happen she gave milray these impressions of clementina in the letter she wrote to thank him for her and to scold him for sending the girl to her she accused him of wishing to get off on her a riddle which he could not read himself but she owned that the charm of clementinas mystery was worth a thousand times the fatigue of trying to guess her out and that she was more and more infatuated with her every day  in the meantime miss milrays little dance grew upon her till it became a very large one that filled her villa to overflowing when the time came for it she lived on one of the fine avenues of the oltrarno region laid out in the brief period of prosperity which florence enjoyed as the capital of italy the villa was built at that time and it was much newer than the house on seventeenth street in new york where she spent the girlhood that had since prolonged itself beyond middle life with her she had first lived abroad in the paris of the second empire and she had been one winter in rome but she had settled definitely in florence before london became an american colony so that her friends were chiefly americans though she had a wide international acquaintance perhaps her habit of taking her brothers part when he was a black sheep inclined her to mercy with people who had not been so blameless in their morals as they were in their minds and manners she exacted that they should be interesting and agreeable and not too threadbare but if they had something that decently buttoned over the frayed places she did not frown upon their poverty bohemians of all kinds liked her philistines liked her too and in such a place as florence where the philistines themselves are a little bohemian she might be said to be very popular you met persons whom you did not quite wish to meet at her house but if these did not meet you there it was your loss     xi  on the night of the dance the line of private carriages remises and cabs lined the viale ariosto for a mile up and down before her gates where young artists of both sexes arrived on foot by this time her passion for clementina was at its height she had maddalena bring her out early in the evening and made her dress under her own eye and her french maids while maddalena went back to comfort mrs lander  i hated to leave her said clementina i dont believe shes very well  isnt she always ill demanded miss milray she embraced the girl again as if once were not enough clementina if mrs lander wont give you to me im going to steal you do you know what i want you to do tonight i want you to stand up with me and receive till the dancing begins as if it were your comingout i mean to introduce everybody to you youll be easily the prettiest girl there and youll have the nicest gown and i dont mean that any of your charms shall be thrown away you wont be frightened  no i dont believe i shall said clementina you can tell me what to do  the dress she wore was of pale green like the light seen in thin woods out of it shone her white shoulders and her young face as if rising through the verdurous light the artists to a man and woman wished to paint her and severally told her so during the evening which lasted till morning she was not surprised when lord lioncourt appeared toward midnight and astonished miss milray by claiming acquaintance with clementina he asked about mrs lander and whether she had got to florence without losing the way he laughed but he seemed really to care he took clementina out to supper when the time came and she would have topped him by half a head as she leaned on his arm if she had not considerately drooped and trailed a little after him  she could not know what a triumph he was making for her and it was merely part of the magic of the time that mr ewins should come in presently with one of the ladies he had arrived in florence that day and had to be brought unasked he put on the effect of an old friend with her but clementinas curiosity was chiefly taken with a tall american whom she thought very handsome his light yellow hair was brushed smooth across his forehead like a wellbehaving boys he was dressed like the other men but he seemed not quite happy in his evening coat and his gloves which he smote together uneasily from time to time he appeared to think that somehow the radiant clementina would know how he felt he did not dance and he professed to have found himself at the party by a species of accident he told her that he was out in europe looking after a patent right that he had just taken hold of and was having only a middling good time he pretended surprise to hear her say that she was having a firstrate time and he tried to reason her out of it he confessed that from the moment he came into the room he had made up his mind to take her to supper and had never been so disgusted in his life as when he saw that little lord toddling off with her and trying to look as large as life he asked her what a lord was like anyway and he made her laugh all the time  he told her his name g w hinkle and asked whether she would be likely to remember it if they ever met again  another man who interested her very much was a young russian with curling hair and neat small features who spoke better english than she did and said he was going to be a writer but had not yet decided whether to write in russian or french she supposed he had wanted her advice but he did not wait for it or seem to expect it he was very much in earnest while he fanned her and his earnestness amused her as much as the americans irony he asked which city of america she came from and when she said none he asked which part of america she answered new england and he said oh yes that is where they have the conscience she did not know what he meant and he put before her the ideal of new england girlhood which he had evolved from reading american novels are you like that he demanded  she laughed and said not a bit and asked him if he had ever met such an american girl and he said frankly no the american girls were all mercenary and cared for nothing but money or marrying titles he added that he had a title but he would not wear it  clementina said she did not believe she cared for titles and then he said but you care for money she denied it but as if she had confessed it he went on the only american that i have seen with that conscience was a man i will tell you of him if you wish  he did not wait for her answer it was in naplesat pompeii i saw at the first glance that he was different from other americans and i resolved to know him he was there in company with a stupid boy whose tutor he was and he told me that he was studying to be a minister of the protestant church next year he will go home to be consecrated he promised to pass through florence in the spring and he will keep his word every act every word every thought of his is regulated by conscience it is terrible but it is beautiful all the time the russian was fanning clementina with every outward appearance of flirtation will you dance again no i should like to draw such a character as his in a romance     xxii  it was six oclock in the morning before miss milray sent clementina home in her carriage she would have kept her to breakfast but clementina said she ought to go on mrs landers account and she wished to go on her own  she thought she would steal to bed without waking her but she was stopped by the sound of groans when she entered their apartment the light gushed from mrs landers door maddalena came out and blessed the name of her latin deity so much more familiar and approachable than the anglosaxon divinity that clementina had come at last and poured upon her the story of a night of suffering for mrs lander through her story came the sound of mrs landers voice plaintively reproachful summoning clementina to her bedside oh how could you go away and leave me ive been in such misery the whole night long and the docta didnt do a thing for me im puffectly wohn out and i couldnt make my wants known with that italian crazyhead if it hadnt been for the portyary comin in and interpretin when the docta left i dont know what i should have done i want you should give him a twentyleary note just as quick as you see him and oh isnt the docta comin  clementina set about helping maddalena put the room which was in an impassioned disorder to rights and she made mrs lander a cup of her own tea which she had brought from s s pierces in passing through boston it was the first thing the sufferer said that had saved her life clementina comforted her and promised her that the doctor should be there very soon and before mrs lander fell away to sleep she was so far out of danger as to be able to ask how clementina had enjoyed herself and to be glad that she had such a good time  the doctor would not wake her when he came he said that she had been through a pretty sharp gastric attack which would not recur if she ate less of the most unwholesome things she could get and went more into the air and walked a little he did not seem alarmed and he made clementina tell him about the dance which he had been called from to mrs landers bed of pain he joked her for not having missed him in the midst of their fun she caught herself in the act of yawning and the doctor laughed and went away  maddalena had to call her just before dinner when mrs lander had been awake long enough to have sent for the doctor to explain the sort of gone feeling which she was now the victim of it proved when he came to be hunger and he prescribed tea and toast and a small bit of steak before he came she had wished to arrange for going home at once and dying in her own country but his opinion so far prevailed with her that she consented not to telegraph for berths i presume she said itll do any time before the icebugs begin to run but i d know afta this clementina as i can let you leave me quite as you ben doin there was a lot of flowas come for you this aftanoon but i made maddalena put em on the balcony for i dont want you should get poisoned with em in your sleep i always head they was dangerous in a persons bed room i d know as they are eitha  maddalena seemed to know that mrs lander was speaking of the flowers she got them and gave them to clementina who found they were from some of the men she had danced with mr hinkle had sent a vast bunch of violets which presently began to give out their sweetness in the warmth of the room and the odor brought him before her with his yellow hair scrupulously parted at the side and smoothly brushed showing his forehead very high up most of the gentlemen wore their hair parted in the middle or falling in a fringe over their brows the russians was too curly to part and lord lioncourt had none except at the sides  she laughed and mrs lander said tell about it clementina and she began with mr hinkle and kept coming back to him from the others mrs lander wished most to know how that lord had got down to florence and clementina said he was coming to see her  well i hope to goodness he wont come today i ant fit to see anybody  oh i guess he wont come till tomorrow said clementina she repeated some of the compliments she had got and she told of all miss milrays kindness to her but mrs lander said well the next time ill thank her not to keep you so late she was astonished to hear that mr ewins was there and any of the nasty things out of the hotel thee she asked  yes clementina said thee wee and some of them wee very nice they wanted to know if i wouldnt join them and have an aftanoon of our own here in the hotel so that people could come to us all at once  she went back to the party and described the rest of it when she came to the part about the russian she told what he had said of american girls being fond of money and wanting to marry foreign noblemen  mrs lander said well i hope you ant a going to get married in a hurry anyway and when you do i hope youll pick out a nice american  oh yes said clementina  mrs lander had their dinner brought to their apartment she cheered up and she was in some danger of eating too much but with clementinas help she denied herself their short evening was one of the gayest clementina declared she was not the least sleepy but she went to bed at nine and slept till nine the next day  mrs lander the doctor confessed the second morning was more shaken up by her little attack than he had expected but she decided to see the gentleman who had asked to call on clementina lord lioncourt did not come quite so soon as she was afraid he might and when he came he talked mostly to clementina he did not get to mrs lander until just before he was going she hospitably asked him what his hurry was and then he said that he was off for rome that evening at seven he was nice about hoping she was comfortable in the hotel and he sympathized with her in her wish that there was a setbowl in her room she told him that she always tried to have one and he agreed that it must be very convenient where any one was as she said sick so much  mr hinkle came a day later and then it appeared that he had a mother whose complaints almost exactly matched mrs landers he had her photograph with him and showed it he said if you had no wife to carry round a photograph of you had better carry your mothers and mrs lander praised him for being a good son a good son she added always made a good husband and he said that was just what he told the young ladies himself but it did not seem to make much impression on them he kept clementina laughing and he pretended that he was going to bring a diagram of his patent right for her to see because she would be interested in a gleaner like that and he said he wished her father could see it for it would be sure to interest the kind of man mrs lander described him to be ill be along up there just about the time you get home miss clementina then did you say it would be  i dont know pretty ealy in the spring i guess  she looked at mrs lander who said well it depends upon how i git up my health i couldnt bea the voyage now  mr hinkle said no best look out for your health if it takes all summer i shouldnt want you to hurry on my account your time is my time all i want is for miss clementina here to personally conduct me to her father if i could get him to take hold of my gleaner in new england we could make the blueberry crop worth twice what it is  mrs lander perceived that he was joking and she asked what he wanted to run away for when the young russians card came up he said oh give every man a chance and he promised that he would look in every few days and see how she was getting along he opened the door after he had gone out and put his head in to say in confidence to mrs lander but so loud that clementina could hear i suppose shes told you who the belle of the ball was the other night went out to supper with a lord he seemed to think a lord was such a good joke that if you mentioned one you had to laugh  the russians card bore the name baron belsky with the baron crossed out in pencil and he began to attack in mrs lander the demerits of the american character as he had divined them he instructed her that her countrymen existed chiefly to make money that they were more shopkeepers than the english and worse snobs that their women were trivial and their men sordid that their ambition was to unite their families with the european aristocracies and their doctrine of liberty and equality was a shameless hypocrisy this followed hard upon her asking as she did very promptly why he had scratched out the title on his card he told her that he wished to be known solely as an artist and he had to explain to her that he was not a painter but was going to be a novelist she taxed him with never having been in america but he contended that as all america came to europe he had the materials for a study of the national character at hand without the trouble of crossing the ocean in return she told him that she had not been the least seasick during the voyage and that it was no trouble at all then he abruptly left her and went over to beg a cup of tea from clementina who sat behind the kettle by the window  i have heard this morning from that american i met in pompeii he began he is coming northward and i am going down to meet him in rome  mrs lander caught the word and called across the room why ant that whee that lods gone  clementina said yes and while the kettle boiled she asked if baron belsky were going soon  oh in a week or ten days perhaps i shall know when he arrives then i shall go we write to each other every day he drew a letter from his breast pocket this will give you the idea of his character and he read if we believe that the hand of god directs all our actions how can we set up our theories of conduct against what we feel to be his inspiration  what do you think of that he demanded  i dont believe that god directs our wrong actions said clementina  how is there anything outside of god  i dont know whether there is or not but there is something that tempts me to do wrong sometimes and i dont believe that is god  the russian seemed struck i will write that to him  no said clementina i dont want you to say anything about me to him  no no said baron belsky waving his band reassuringly i would not mention your name  mr ewins came in and the russian said he must go mrs lander tried to detain him too as she had tried to keep mr hinkle but he was inexorable mr ewins looked at the door when it had closed upon him mrs lander said that is one of the gentlemen that clementina met the otha night at the dance he is a baron but he scratches it out youd ought to head him go on about americans  yes said mr ewins coldly hes at our hotel and he airs his peculiar opinions at the table dhote pretty freely hes a revolutionist of some kind i fancy he pronounced the epithet with an abhorrence befitting the citizen of a state born of revolution and a city that had cradled the revolt hes a nihilist i believe  mrs lander wished to know what that was and he explained that it was a russian who wanted to overthrow the czar and set up a government of the people when they were not prepared for liberty  then maybe he isnt a baron at all said mrs lander  oh i believe he has a right to his title ewins answered its a german one  he said he thought that sort of man was all the more mischievous on account of his sincerity he instanced a russian whom a friend of his knew in berlin a man of rank like this fellow he got to brooding upon the condition of working people and that kind of thing till he renounced his title and fortune and went to work in an iron foundry  mr ewins also spoke critically of mrs milray he had met her in egypt but you soon exhausted the interest of that kind of woman he professed a great concern that clementina should see florence in just the right way and he offered his services in showing her the place  the russian came the next day and almost daily after that in the interest with which clementinas novel difference from other american girls seemed to inspire him his imagination had transmuted her simple yankee facts into something appreciable to a slav of his temperament he conceived of her as the daughter of a peasant whose beauty had charmed the widow of a rich citizen and who was to inherit the wealth of her adoptive mother he imagined that the adoption had taken place at a much earlier period than the time when clementinas visit to mrs lander actually began and that all which could be done had been done to efface her real character by indulgence and luxury  his curiosity concerning her childhood her home her father and mother her brothers and sisters and his misunderstanding of everything she told him amused her but she liked him and she tried to give him some notion of the things he wished so much to know it always ended in a dissatisfaction more or less vehement with the outcome of american conditions as he conceived them  but you he urged one day you who are a daughter of the fields and woods why should you forsake that pure life and come to waste yourself here  why dont you think its very nice in florence she asked with eyes of innocent interest  nice nice do we live for what is nice is it enough that you have what you americans call a nice time  clementina reflected i wasnt doing much of anything at home and i thought i might as well come with mrs lander if she wanted me so much she thought in a certain way that he was meddling with what was not his affair but she believed that he was sincere in his zeal for the ideal life he wished her to lead and there were some things she had heard about him that made her pity and respect him his selfexile and his renunciation of home and country for his principles whatever they were she did not understand exactly she would not have liked never being able to go back to middlemount or to be cut off from all her friends as this poor young nihilist was and she said now i didnt expect that it was going to be anything but a visit and i always supposed we should go back in the spring but now mrs lander is beginning to think she wont be well enough till fall  and why need you stay with her  because shes not very well answered clementina and she smiled a little triumphantly as well as tolerantly  she could hire nurses and doctors all she wants with her money  i dont believe it would be the same thing exactly and what should i do if i went back  do teach uplift the lives about you  but you say it is better for people to live simply and not read and think so much  then labor in the fields with them  clementina laughed outright i guess if anyone saw me woking in the fields they would think i was a disgrace to the neighbahood  belsky gave her a stupified glare through his spectacles i cannot understand you americans  well you must come ova to america then mr belskyhe had asked her not to call him by his titleand then you would  no i could not endure the disappointment you have the great opportunity of the earth you could be equal and just and simple and kind there is nothing to hinder you but all you try to do is to get more and more money  now that isnt faia mr belsky and you know it  well then you joke jokealways joke like that mr hinkle he wants to make money with his patent of a gleaner that will take the last grain of wheat from the poor and he wants to jokejoke  clementina said i wont let you say that about mr hinkle you dont know him or you wouldnt if he jokes why shouldnt he  belsky made a gesture of rejection oh you are an american too  she had not grown less american certainly since she had left home even the little conformities to europe that she practiced were traits of americanism clementina was not becoming sophisticated but perhaps she was becoming more conventionalized the knowledge of good and evil in things that had all seemed indifferently good to her once had crept upon her and she distinguished in her actions she sinned as little as any young lady in florence against the superstitions of society but though she would not now have done a skirtdance before a shipful of people she did not afflict herself about her past errors she put on the world but she wore it simply and in most matters unconsciously some things were imparted to her without her asking or wishing and merely in virtue of her youth and impressionability she took them from her environment without knowing it and in this way she was coming by an english manner and an english tone she was only the less american for being rather english without trying when other americans tried so hard in the region of harsh nasals clementina had never spoken through her nose and she was now as unaffected in these alien inflections as in the tender cooings which used to rouse the misgivings of her brother jim when she was with english people she employed them involuntarily and when she was with americans she measurably lost them so that after half an hour with mr hinkle she had scarcely a trace of them and with mrs lander she always spoke with her native accent     xxiii  one sunday night toward the end of lent mrs lander had another of her attacks she now began to call them so as if she had established an ownership in them it came on from her cumulative overeating again but the doctor was not so smiling as he had been with regard to the first clementina had got ready to drive out to miss milrays for one of her sunday teas but she put off her things and prepared to spend the night at mrs landers bedside well i should think you would want to said the sufferer im goin to do everything for you and youd ought to be willing to give up one of youa junketins for me im sure i dont know what you see in em anyway  oh i am willing mrs lander im glad i hadnt stahted before it began clementina busied herself with the pillows under mrs landers dishevelled head and the bedclothes disordered by her throes while mrs lander went on  i dont see whats the use of so much gaddin anyway i dont see as anything comes of it but just to get a passal of wothless fellas afta you that think youa going to have money theres such a thing as two sides to everything and if the favas is goin to be all on one side i guess thered betta be a clear undastandin about it i think i got a right to a little attention as well as them that hant done anything and if im goin to be left alone hee to die among strangers every time one of my attacks comes on  the doctor interposed i dont think youre going to have a very bad attack this time mrs lander  oh thank you thank you docta but you can undastand cant you how i shall want to have somebody around that can undastand a little english  the doctor said oh yes and miss claxon and i can understand a good deal between us and were going to stay and see how a little morphine behaves with you  mrs lander protested oh i cant bea mophine docta  did you ever try it he asked preparing his little instrument to imbibe the solution  no but mr landa did and it most killed him it made him sick  well youre about as sick as you can be now mrs lander and if you dont die of this pinprickhe pushed the needlepoint under the skin of her massive forearmi guess youll live through it  she shrieked but as the pain began to abate she gathered courage and broke forth joyfully why its beautiful ant it i declare it woks like a cham well i shall always keep mophine around after this and when i feel one of these attacks comin on  send for a physician mrs lander said dr welwright and hell know what to do  i ant so sure of that returned mrs lander fondly he would if you was the one i declare

clementina did not answer and the doctor laughed well i should like to know what more i could do  perhaps you could do less well see about that better go to sleep now if you feel like it  well i will if youll make this silly child go to her tea i spose she wont because i scolded her shes an awful hand to lay anything up against you you know you ah clementina but i can say this doctor a betta child dont breathe and i just couldnt live without her come hee clementina i want to kiss you once before i go to sleep sos to make sua you dont bea malice she pulled clementina down to kiss her and babbled on affectionately and optimistically till her talk became the voice of her dreams and then ceased altogether  you could go perfectly well miss claxon said the doctor  no i dont cae to go answered clementina id ratha stay if she should wake  she wont wake until long after youve got back ill answer for that im going to stay here awhile go ill take the responsibility  clementinas face brightened she wanted very much to go she should meet some pleasant people she always did at miss milrays then the light died out of her gay eyes and she set her lips no i told her i shouldnt go  i didnt hear you said dr welwright a doctor has no eyes and ears except for the symptoms of his patients  oh i know said clementina she had liked dr welwright from the first and she thought it was very nice of him to stay on after he left mrs landers bedside and help to make her lonesome evening pass pleasantly in the parlor he jumped up finally and looked at his watch bless my soul he said and he went in for another look at mrs lander when he came back he said shes all right but youve made me break an engagement miss claxon i was going to tea at miss milrays she promised me i should meet you there  it seemed a great joke and clementina offered to carry his excuses to miss milray when she went to make her own  she went the next morning mrs lander insisted that she should go she said that she was not going to have miss milray thinking that she wanted to keep her all to herself  miss milray kissed the girl in full forgiveness but she asked did dr welwright think it a very bad attack  has he been hea returned clementina  miss milray laughed doctors dont betray their patientsgood doctors no he hasnt been here if that will help you i wish it would help me but it wont quite i dont like to think of that old woman using you up clementina  oh she doesnt miss milray you mustnt think so you dont know how good she is to me  does she ever remind you of it  clementinas eyes fell she isnt like herself when she doesnt feel well  i knew it miss milray triumphed i always knew that she was a dreadful old tabby i wish you were safely out of her clutches come and live with me my dear when mrs lander gets tired of you but shell never get tired of you youre just the kind of helpless mouse that such an old tabby would make her natural prey but she shant even if another sort of cat has to get you im sorry you couldnt come last night your little russian was here and went away early and very bitterly because you didnt come he seemed to think there was nobody and said so in everything but words  oh said clementina dont you think hes very nice miss milray  hes very mystical or else so very simple that he seems so i hope you can make him out  dont you think hes very much in eanest  oh as the grave or the asylum i shouldnt like him to be in earnest about me if i were you  but thats just what he is clementina told how the russian had lectured her and wished her to go back to the country and work in the fields  oh if thats all cried miss milray i was afraid it was another kind of earnestness the kind i shouldnt like if i were you  theres no danger of that i guess clementina laughed and miss milray went on  another of your admirers was here but he was not so inconsolable or else be found consolation in staying on and talking about you or joking  oh yes mr hinkle cried clementina with the smile that the thought of him always brought hes lovely  lovely well i dont know why it isnt the word it suits him a great deal better than some insipid girls that people give it to yes i could really fall in love with mr hinkle hes the only man i ever saw who would know how to break the fall  it was lunchtime before their talk had begun to run low and it swelled again over the meal miss milray returned to mrs lander and she made clementina confess that she was a little trying sometimes but she insisted that she was always good and in remorse she went away as soon as miss milray rose from table  she found mrs lander very much better and willing to have had her stay the whole afternoon with miss milray i dont want she should have anything to say against me to you clementina shed be glad enough to but i guess its just as well youa back that scratchedout baron has been hee twice and hes waitin for you in the pahla now i presume hell keep comin till you do see him i guess you betta have it ova whatever it is  i guess youre right mrs lander  clementina found the russian walking up and down the room and as soon as their greeting was over he asked leave to continue his promenade but he stopped abruptly before her when she had sunk upon a sofa  i have come to tell you a strange story he said  it is the story of that american friend of mine i tell it to you because i think you can understand and will know what to advise what to do  he turned upon his heel and walked the length of the room and back before he spoke again  since several years he said growing a little less idiomatic in his english as his excitement mounted he met a young girl a child when he was still not a mans full age it was in the country in the mountains of america andhe loved her both were very poor he a student earning the means to complete his education in the university he had dedicated himself to his church and with the temperament of the puritans he forbade himself all thoughts of love but he was of a passionate and impulsive nature and in a moment of abandon he confessed his love the child was bewildered frightened she shrank from his avowal and he filled with remorse for his selfbetrayal bade her let it be as if it had not been he bade her think of him no more  clementina sat as if powerless to move staring at belsky he paused in his walk and allowed an impressive silence to ensue upon his words  time passed days months years and he did not see her again he pursued his studies in the university at their completion he entered upon the course of divinity and he is soon to be a minister of his church in all that time the image of the young girl has remained in his heart and has held him true to the only love he has ever known he will know no other while he lives  again he stopped in front of clementina she looked helplessly up at him and he resumed his walk  he with his dreams of renunciation of abnegation had thought some day to return to her and ask her to be his he believed her capable of equal sacrifice with himself and he hoped to win her not for himself alone but for the religion which he put before himself he would have invited her to join her fate with his that they might go together on some mission to the paganin the south seas in the heart of africa in the jungle of india he had always thought of her as gay but good unworldly in soul and exalted in spirit she has remained with him a vision of angelic loveliness as he had seen her last in the moonlight on the banks of a mountain torrent but he believes that he has disgraced himself before her that the very scruple for her youth her ignorance which made him entreat her to forget him must have made her doubt and despise him he has never had the courage to write to her one word since all those years but he maintains himself bound to her forever he stopped short before clementina and seized her hands if you knew such a girl what would you have her do should she bid him hope again would you have her say to him that she too had been faithful to their dream and that she too  let me go mr belsky let me go i say clementina wrenched her hands from him and ran out of the room belsky hesitated then he found his hat and after a glance at his face in the mirror left the house     xxiv  the tide of travel began to set northward in april many english many americans appeared in florence from naples and rome many who had wintered in florence went on to venice and the towns of northern italy on their way to switzerland and france and germany  the spring was cold and rainy and the irresolute italian railroads were interrupted by the floods a tawny deluge rolled down from the mountains through the bed of the arno and kept the florentine firedepartment on the alert night and day it is a curious thing about this country said mr hinkle encountering baron belsky on the ponte trinita that the only thing they ever have here for a fire company to put out is a freshet if they had a real conflagration once i reckon they would want to bring their lifepreservers  the russian was looking down over the parapet at the boiling river he lifted his head as if he had not heard the american and stared at him a moment before he spoke it is said that the railway to rome is broken at grossetto  well im not going to rome said hinkle easily are you  i was to meet a friend there but he wrote to me that he was starting to florence and now  hes resting on the way well hell get here about as quick as he would in the ordinary course of travel one good thing about italy is you dont want to hurry if you did youd get left  belsky stared at him in the stupefaction to which the american humor commonly reduced him if he gets left on the grossetto line he can go back and come up by orvieto no  he can if he isnt in a hurry hinkle assented  its a good way if youve got time to burn  belsky did not attempt to explore the americans meaning do you know he asked whether mrs lander and her young friend are still in florence  i guess they are  it was said they were going to venice for the summer  thats what the doctor advised for the old lady but they dont start for a week or two yet  oh  are you going to miss milrays sunday night last of the season i believe  belsky seemed to recall himself from a distance  nono he said and he moved away forgetful of the ceremonious salutation which he commonly used at meeting and parting hinkle looked after him with the impression people have of a difference in the appearance and behavior of some one whose appearance and behavior do not particularly concern them  the day that followed belsky haunted the hotel where gregory was to arrive with his pupil and where the pupils family were waiting for them that night long after their belated train was due they came the pupil was with his father and mother and gregory was alone when belsky asked for him the fourth or fifth time  you are not well he said as they shook hands you are fevered  im tired said gregory weve bad a bad time getting through  i come inconveniently you have not dined perhaps  yes yes ive had dinner sit down how have you been yourself  oh always well belsky sat down and the friends stared at each other i have strange news for you  for me  you she is here  she  yes the young girl of whom you told me if i had not forbidden myself by my loyalty to youif i had not said to myself every moment in her presence no it is for your friend alone that she is beautiful and goodbut you will have nothing to reproach me in that regard  what do you mean demanded gregory  i mean that miss claxon is in florence with her protectress the rich mrs lander the most admired young lady in society going everywhere and everywhere courted and welcomed the favorite of the fashionable miss milray but why should this surprise you  you said nothing about it in your letters you  i was not sure it was she you never told me her name when i had divined the fact i was so soon to see you that i thought best to keep it till we met  gregory tried to speak but he let belsky go on  if you think that the world has spoiled her that she will be different from what she was in her home among your mountains let me reassure you in her you will find the miracle of a woman whom no flattery can turn the head i have watched her in your interest i have tested her she is what you saw her last  surely asked gregory in an anguish for what he now dreaded you havent spoken to her of me  not by name no i could not have that indiscretion  the name is nothing have you said that you knew meof course not but have you hinted at any knowledgebecause  you will hear said belsky and he poured out upon gregory the story of what he had done she did not deny anything she was greatly moved but she did not refuse to let me bid you hope  oh gregory took his head between his hands you have spoiled my life  spoiled belsky stopped aghast  i told you my story in a moment of despicable weaknessof impulsive folly but how could i dream that you would ever meet her how could i imagine that you would speak to her as you have done he groaned and began to creep giddily about the room in his misery oh oh oh what shall i do  but i do not understand belsky began if i have committed an error  oh an error that never could be put right in all eternity  then let me go to herlet me tell her  keep away from her shouted gregory do you hear never go near her again  gregory  ah i beg your pardon i dont know what im doingsaying what will she thinkwhat will she think of me he had ceased to speak to belsky he collapsed into a chair and hid his face in his arms stretched out on the table before him  belsky watched him in the stupefaction which the artistic nature feels when life proves sentient under its hand and not the mere material of situations and effects he could not conceive the full measure of the disaster he had wrought the outrage of his own behavior had been lost to him in his preoccupation with the romantic end to be accomplished he had meant to be the friend the prophet to these american lovers whom he was reconciling and interpreting to each other but in some point he must have misunderstood yet the error was not inexpiable and in his expiation he could put the seal to his devotion he left the room where gregory made no effort to keep him  he walked down the street from the hotel to the arno and in a few moments he stood on the bridge where he had talked with that joker in the morning as they looked down together on the boiling river he had a strange wish that the joker might have been with him again to learn that there were some things which could not be joked away  the night was blustering and the wind that blew the ragged clouds across the face of the moon swooped in sudden gusts upon the bridge and the deluge rolling under it and hoarsely washing against its piers belsky leaned over the parapet and looked down into the eddies and currents as the fitful light revealed them he had a fantastic pleasure in studying them and choosing the moment when he should leap the parapet and be lost in them the incident could not be used in any novel of his and no one else could do such perfect justice to the situation but perhaps afterwards when the facts leading to his death should be known through the remorse of the lovers whom he had sought to serve some other artistnature could distil their subtlest meaning in a memoir delicate as the aroma of a faded flower  he was willing to make this sacrifice too and he stepped back a pace from the parapet when the fitful blast caught his hat from his head and whirled it along the bridge the whole current of his purpose changed and as if it had been impossible to drown himself in his bare head he set out in chase of his hat which rolled and gamboled away and escaped from his clutch whenever he stooped for it till a final whiff of wind flung it up and tossed it over the bridge into the river where he helplessly watched it floating down the flood till it was carried out of sight     xxv  gregory did not sleep and he did not find peace in the prayers he put up for guidance he tried to think of some one with whom he might take counsel but he knew no one in florence except the parents of his pupil and they were impossible he felt himself abandoned to the impulse which he dreaded in going to clementina and he went without hope willing to suffer whatever penalty she should visit upon him after he had disavowed belskys action and claimed the responsibility for it  he was prepared for her refusal to see him he had imagined her wounded and pathetic he had fancied her insulted and indignant but she met him eagerly and with a mystifying appeal in her welcome he began at once without attempting to bridge the time since they had met with any formalities  i have come to speak to you aboutthatrussian about baron belsky  yes yes she returned anxiously then you have head  he came to me last night andi want to say that i feel myself to blame for what he has done  you  yes i i never spoke of you by name to him i didnt dream of his ever seeing you or that he would dare to speak to you of what i told him but i believe he meant no wrong and it was i who did the harm whether i authorized it or not  yes yes she returned with the effect of putting his words aside as something of no moment have they head anything more  how anything more he returned in a daze  then dont you know about his falling into the river i know he didnt drown himself  gregory shook his head whenwhat makes them thinkhe stopped and stared at her  why they know that he went down to the ponte trinity last night somebody saw him going and then that peasant found his hat with his name in it in the driftwood below the cascine  yes said gregory lifelessly he let his arms drop forward and his helpless hands hang over his knees his gaze fell from her face to the floor  neither spoke for a time that seemed long and then it was clementina who spoke but it isnt true  oh yes it is said gregory as before  mr hinkle doesnt believe it is she urged  mr hinkle  hes an american whos staying in florence he came this moning to tell me about it even if hes drowned mr hinkle believes he didnt mean to he must have just fallen in  what does it matter demanded gregory lifting his heavy eyes whether he meant it or not i caused it i drove him to it  you drove him  yes he told me what he had said to you and isaid that he had spoiled my lifei dont know  well he had no right to do it but i didnt blame you clementina began compassionately  its too late it cant be helped now gregory turned from the mercy that could no longer save him he rose dizzily and tried to get himself away  you mustnt go she interposed i dont believe you made him do it mr hinkle will be back soon and he will  if he should bring word that it was true gregory asked  well said clementina then we should have to bear it  a sense of something finer than the surface meaning of her words pierced his morbid egotism im ashamed he said will you let me stay  why yes you must she said and if there was any censure of him at the bottom of her heart she kept it there and tried to talk him away from his remorse which was in his temperament perhaps rather than his conscience she made the time pass till there came a knock at the door and she opened it to hinkle  i didnt send up my name i thought i wouldnt stand upon ceremony just now he said  oh no she returned mr hinkle this is mr gregory mr gregory knew mr belsky and he thinks  she turned to gregory for prompting and he managed to say i dont believe he was quite the sort of person toand yet he mighthe was in trouble  money trouble asked hinkle they say these russians have a perfect genius for debt i had a little inspiration since i saw you but there doesnt seems to be anything in it so far he addressed himself to clementina but he included gregory in what he said it struck me that he might have been running his board and had used this drowning episode as a blind but ive been around to his hotel and hes settled up all fair and square enough the landlord tried to think of something he hadnt paid but he couldnt and i never saw a man try harder either clementina smiled she put her hand to her mouth to keep from laughing but gregory frowned his distress in the untimely droning  i dont give up my theory that its a fake of some kind though he could leave behind a good many creditors besides his landlord the authorities have sealed up his effects and theyve done everything but call out the fire department thats on duty looking after the freshet and it couldnt be spared ill go out now and slop round a little more in the cause hinkle looked down at his shoes and his drabbled trousers and wiped the perspiration from his face but i thought id drop in and tell you not to worry about it miss clementina i would stake anything you pleased on mr belskys safety mr gregory here looks like he would be willing to take odds he suggested  gregory commanded himself from his misery to say i wish i could believei mean  of course we dont want to think that the mans a fraud any more than that hes dead perhaps we might hit upon some middle course at any rate its worth trying  may ido you object to my joining you gregory asked  why come hinkle hospitably assented glad to have you ill be back again miss clementina  gregory was going away without any form of leavetaking but he turned back to ask will you let me come back too  why suttainly mr gregory said clementina and she went to find mrs lander whom she found in bed  i thought id lay down she explained i dont believe im goin to be sick but its one of my pooa days and i might just as well be in bed as not clementina agreed with her and mrs lander asked you head anything moa  no mr hinkle has just been hea but he hadnt any news  mrs lander turned her face toward the wall next thing hell be drownin himself i neva wanted you should have anything to do with the fellas that go to that womans there aint any of em to be depended on  it was the first time that her growing jealousy of miss milray had openly declared itself but clementina had felt it before without knowing how to meet it as an escape from it now she was almost willing to say mrs lander i want to tell you that mr gregory has just been hea too  mr gregory  yes dont you remember at the middlemount the first summa he was the headwaitathat student  mrs lander jerked her head round on the pillow well of all thewhat does he want over hea  nothing that ishes travelling with a pupil that hes preparing for college andhe came to see us  dyou tell him i couldnt see him  yes  i guess hed think i was a pretty changed pusson now i want you should stay with me clementina and if anybody else comes  maddalena entered the room with a card which she gave to the girl  who is it mrs lander demanded  miss milray  of couse well you may just send wod that you cantor no you must shed have it all ova the place by night that i wouldnt let you see her but dont you make any excuse for me if she asks after me dont you say im sick you say im not at home  ive come about that little wretch miss milray began after kissing clementina i didnt know but you had heard something i hadnt or i had heard something you hadnt you know i belong to the hinkle persuasion i think belskys run his boardas mr hinkle calls it  clementina explained how this part of the hinkle theory had failed and then miss milray devolved upon the belief that he had run his tailors bill or his shoemakers they are delightful those russians but theyre born insolvent i dont believe hes drowned himself how she broke off to ask in a burlesque whisper istheoldtabby she laughed for answer to her own question and then with another sudden diversion she demanded of a look in clementinas face which would not be laughed away well my dear what is it  miss milray said the girl should you think me very silly if i told you somethingsilly  not in the least cried miss milray joyously its the final proof of your wisdom that ive been waiting for  its because mr belsky is all mixed up in it said clementina as if some excuse were necessary and then she told the story of her love affair with gregory miss milray punctuated the several facts with vivid nods but at the end she did not ask her anything and the girl somehow felt the freer to add i believe i will tell you his name it is mr gregoryfrank gregory  and hes been in egypt  yes the whole winta  then hes the one that my sisterinlaw has been writing me about  oh did he meet her thea  i should think so and hell meet her there very soon shes coming with my poor brother i meant to tell you but this ridiculous belsky business drove it out of my head  and do you think clementina entreated that he was to blame  why i dont believe hes done it you know  oh i didnt mean mr belsky i meantmr gregory for telling mr belsky  certainly not men always tell those things to some one i suppose nobody was to blame but belsky for his meddling  miss milray rose and shook out her plumes for flight as if she were rather eager for flight but at the little sigh with which clementina said yes that is what i thought she faltered  i was going to run away for i shouldnt like to mix myself up in your affairits certainly a very strange oneunless i was sure i could help you but if you think i can  clementina shook her head i dont believe you can she said with a candor so wistful that miss milray stopped quite short how does mr gregory take this belsky business she asked  i guess he feels it moa than i do said the girl  he shows his feeling more  yesnohe believes he drove him to it  miss milray took her hand for parting but did not kiss her i wont advise you my dear in fact you havent asked me to youll know what to do if you havent done it already girls usually have when they want advice was there something you were going to say  oh no nothing do you think she hesitated appealingly do you think we areengaged  if hes anything of a man at all he must think he is  yes said clementina wistfully i guess he does  miss milray looked sharply at her and does he think you are  i dont knowhe didnt say  well said miss milray rather dryly then its something for you to think over pretty carefully     xxvi  hinkle came back in the afternoon to make a hopeful report of his failure to learn anything more of belsky but gregory did not come with him he came the next morning long before clementina expected visitors and he was walking nervously up and down the room when she appeared as if he could not speak he held toward her without speaking a telegram in english dated that day in rome       deny report of my death have written                    belsky  she looked up at gregory from the paper when she had read it with joyful eyes oh i am so glad for you i am so glad he is alive  he took the dispatch from her hand i brought it to you as soon as it came  yes yes of couse  i must go now and do what he saysi dont know how yet he stopped and then went on from a different impulse clementina it isnt a question now of that wretchs life and death and i wish i need never speak of him again but what he told you was true he looked steadfastly at her and she realized how handsome he was and how well dressed his thick red hair seemed to have grown darker above his forehead his moustache was heavier and it curved in at the corners of his mouth he bore himself with a sort of selfdisdain that enhanced his splendor i have never changed toward you i dont say it to make favor with you i dont expect to do that now but it is true that night there at middlemount i tried to take back what i said because i believed that i ought  oh yes i knew that said clementina in the pause he made  we were both too young i had no prospect in life i saw the instant after i had spoken that i had no right to let you promise anything i tried to forget you i couldnt i tried to make you forget me he faltered and she did not speak but her head drooped a little i wont ask how far i succeeded i always hoped that the time would come when i could speak to you again when i heard from fane that you were at woodlake i wished to come out and see you but i hadnt the courage i hadnt the right ive had to come to you without either now did he speak to you about me  i thought he was beginning to once but he neva did  it didnt matter it could only have made bad worse it cant help me to say that somehow i was wishing and trying to do what was right but i was  oh i know that mr gregory said clementina generously  then you didnt doubt me in spite of all  i thought you would know what to do no i didnt doubt you exactly  i didnt deserve your trust he cried how came that man to mention me he demanded abruptly after a moments silence  mr belsky it was the first night i saw him and we were talking about americans and he began to tell me about an american friend of his who was very conscientious i thought it must be you the fust moment said clementina smiling with an impersonal pleasure in the fact  from the conscientiousness he asked in bitter selfirony  why yes she returned simply that was what made me think of you and the last time when he began to talk about you i couldnt stop him although i knew he had no right to  he had no right but i gave him the power to do it he meant no harm but i enabled him to do all the harm  oh if hes only alive now there is no harm  he looked into her eyes with a misgiving from which he burst impetuously then you do care for me still after all that i have done to make you detest me he started toward her but she shrank back  i didnt mean that she hesitated  you know that i love youthat i have always loved you  yes she assented but you might be sorry again that you had said it it sounded like coquetry but he knew it was not coquetry  never ive wished to say it again ever since that night at middlemount i have always felt bound by what i said then though i took back my words for your sake but the promise was always there and my life was in it you believe that  why i always believed what you said mr gregory  well  clementina paused with her head seriously on one side i should want to think about it before i said anything  you are right he submitted dropping his outstretched arms to his side i have been thinking only of myself as usual  no she protested compassionately but doesnt it seem as if we ought to be sua this time i did cae for you then but i was very young and i dont know yeti thought i had always felt just as you did but nowdont you think we had both betta wait a little while till we ah moa suttain  they stood looking at each other and he said with a kind of passionate selfdenial yes think it over for me too i will come back if you will let me  oh thank you she cried after him gratefully as if his forbearance were the greatest favor  when he was gone she tried to release herself from the kind of abeyance in which she seemed to have gone back and been as subject to him as in the first days when he had awed her and charmed her with his superiority at middlemount and he again older and freer as she had grown since  he came back late in the afternoon looking jaded and distraught hinkle who looked neither was with him well he began this is the greatest thing in my experience belskys not only alive and well but mr gregory and i are both at large i did think one time that the police would take us into custody on account of our morbid interest in the thing and i dont believe we should have got off if the consul hadnt gone bail for us so to speak i thought we had better take the consul in on our way and it was lucky we did  clementina did not understand all the implications but she was willing to take mr hinkles fun on trust i dont believe youll convince mrs landa that mr belskys alive and well till you bring him back to say so  is that so said hinkle well we must have him brought back by the authorities then perhaps theyll bring him anyway they cant try him for suicide but as i understand the police here a man cant lose his hat over a bridge in florence with impunity especially in a time of high water anyway theyre identifying belsky by due process of law in rome now and i guess mr gregoryhe nodded toward gregory who sat silent and absent will be kept under surveillance till the whole mystery is cleared up  clementina responded gayly still but with less and less sincerity and she let hinkle go at last with the feeling that he knew she wished him to go he made a brave show of not seeing this and when he was gone she remembered that she had not thanked him for the trouble he had taken on her account and her heart ached after him with a sense of his sweetness and goodness which she had felt from the first through his quaint drolling it was as if the door which closed upon him shut her out of the life she had been living of late and into the life of the past where she was subject again to the spell of gregorys mood it was hardly his will  he began at once i wished to make you say something this morning that i have no right to hear you say yet and i have been trying ever since to think how i could ask you whether you could share my life with me and yet not ask you to do it but i cant do anything without knowingyou may not care for what my life is to be at all  clementinas head drooped a little but she answered distinctly i do cae mr gregory  thank you for that much i dont count upon more than you have said clementina i am going to be a missionary i think i shall ask to be sent to china ive not decided yet my life will be hard it will be full of danger and privation it will be exile you will have to think of sharing such a life if you think  he stopped the time had come for her to speak and she said i knew you wanted to be a missionary  andandyou would go with me you wouldhe started toward her and she did not shrink from him now but he checked himself but you mustnt you know for my sake  i dont believe i quite undastand she faltered  you must not do it for me but for what makes me do it without that our life our work could have no consecration  she gazed at him in patient faintly smiling bewilderment as if it were something he would unriddle for her when he chose  we mustnt err in this it would be worse than error it would be sin he took a turn about the room and then stopped before her will youwill you join me in a prayer for guidance clementina  ii dont know she hesitated i will butdo you think i had betta  he began why surelyafter a moment he asked gravely you believe that our actions will be guided aright if we seek help  oh yesyes  and that if we do not we shall stumble in our ignorance  i dont know i never thought of that  never thought of it  we never did it in our family father always said that if we really wanted to do right we could find the way gregory looked daunted and then he frowned darkly are you provoked with me do you think what i have said is wrong  no no you must say what you believe it would be double hypocrisy in me if i prevented you  but i would do it if you wanted me to she said  oh for me for me he protested i will try to tell you what i mean and why you must not for that very reason but he had to speak of himself of the miracle of finding her again by the means which should have lost her to him forever and of the significance of this then it appeared to him that he could not reject such a leading without error without sin such a thing could not have merely happened  it seemed so to clementina too she eagerly consented that this was something they must think of as well but the light waned the dark thickened in the room before he left her to do so then he said fervently we must not doubt that everything will come right and his words seemed an effect of inspiration to them both     xxvii  after gregory was gone a misgiving began in clementinas mind which grew more distinct through all the difficulties of accounting to mrs lander for his long stay the girl could see that it was with an obscure jealousy that she pushed her questions and said at last that mr hinkle is about the best of the lot hes the only one thats eva had the mannas to ask after me except that lod he did  clementina could not pretend that gregory had asked but she could not blame him for a forgetfulness of mrs lander which she had shared with him this helped somehow to deepen the misgiving which followed her from mrs landers bed to her own and haunted her far into the night she could escape from it only by promising herself to deal with it the first thing in the morning she did this in terms much briefer than she thought she could have commanded she supposed she would have to write a very long letter but she came to the end of all she need say in a very few lines     dear mr gregory     i have been thinking about what you said yesterday and i have to    tell you something then you can do what is right for both of us    you will know better than i can but i want you to understand that    if i go with you in your missionary life i shall do it for you and    not for anything else i would go anywhere and live anyhow for you    but it would be for you i do not believe that i am religious and i    know that i should not do it for religion     that is all but i could not get any peace till i let you know just    how i felt                         clementina claxon  the letter went early in the morning though not so early but it was put in gregorys hand as he was leaving his hotel to go to mrs landers he tore it open and read it on the way and for the first moment it seemed as if it were providence leading him that he might lighten clementinas heart of its doubts with the least delay he had reasoned that if she would share for his sake the life that he should live for righteousness sake they would be equally blest in it and it would be equally consecrated in both but this luminous conclusion faded in his thought as he hurried on and he found himself in her presence with something like a hope that she would be inspired to help him  his soul lifted at the sound of the gay voice in which she asked did you get my letta and it seemed for the instant as if there could be no trouble that their love could not overcome  yes he said and he put his arms around her but with a provisionality in his embrace which she subtly perceived  and what did you think of it she asked did you think i was silly  he was aware that she had trusted him to do away her misgiving no no he answered guiltily wiser than i am always ii want to talk with you about it clementina i want you to advise me  he felt her shrink from him and with a pang he opened his arms to free her but it was right he must she had been expecting him to say that there was nothing in her misgiving and he could not say it  clementina he entreated why do you think you are not religious  why i have never belonged to chuch she answered simply he looked so daunted that she tried to soften the blow after she had dealt it of course i always went to chuch though father and motha didnt i went to the episcopalto mr richlings but i neva was confirmed  butyou believe in god  why certainly  and in the bible  why of couse  and that it is our duty to bear the truth to those who have never heard of it  i know that is the way you feel about it but i am not certain that i should feel so myself if you didnt want me to thats what i got to thinking about last night she added hopefully but perhaps it isnt so great a thing as i  its a very great thing he said and from standing in front of her he now sat down beyond a little table before her sofa how can i ask you to share my life if you dont share my faith  why i should try to believe everything that you do of couse  because i do  wellyes  you wring my heart are you willing to studyto look into these questionstotoit all seemed very hopeless very absurd but she answered seriously  yes but i believe it would all come back to just where it is now  what you say clementina makes me so happy but it ought to make memiserable and you would do all this be all this for me a wretched and erring creature of the dust and yet not do it forgod  clementina could only say perhaps if he meant me to do it for him he would have made me want to he made you  yes said gregory and for a long time he could not say any more he sat with his elbow on the table and his head against his lifted hand  you see she began gently i got to thinking that even if i eva came to believe what you wanted me to i should be doing it after all because you wanted me to  yes yes he answered desolately there is no way out of it if you only hated me clementina despised mei dont mean that but if you were not so good i could have a more hope for youfor myself its because you are so good that i cant make myself wish to change you and yet i knowi am afraid that if you told me my life and objects were wrong i should turn from them and be whatever you said do you tell me that  no indeed cried clementina with abhorrence then i should despise you  he seemed not to heed her he moved his lips as if he were talking to himself and he pleaded what shall we do  we must try to think it out and if we cantif you cant let me give up to you unless i do it for the same reason that you do and if i cant let you give up for me and i know i could neva do that thenwe mustnt  do you mean we must part not see each other again  what use would it be  none he owned she had risen and he stood up perforce may imay i come back to tell you  tell me what she asked  you are right if i cant make it right i wont come but i wont say good bye icant  she let him go and maddalena came in at the door signorina she said the signora is not well shall i send for the doctor  yes yes maddalena run cried clementina distractedly she hurried to mrs landers room where she found her too sick for reproaches for anything but appeals for help and pity the girl had not to wait for doctor welwrights coming to understand that the attack was severer than any before  it lasted through the day and she could see that he was troubled it had not followed upon any imprudeuce as mrs lander pathetically called clementina to witness when her pain had been so far quelled that she could talk of her seizure  he found her greatly weakened by it the next day and he sat looking thoughtfully at her before he said that she needed toning up she caught at the notion yes yes thats what i need docta toning up thats what i need  he suggested how would you like to try the sea air and the bathsat venice  oh anything anywhere to get out of this dreadful hole i hant had a well minute since i came and clementina the sick woman whimpered is so taken up all the time hea that i cant get the right attention  the doctor looked compassionately away from the girl and said well we must arrange about getting you off then  but i want you should go with me doctor and see me settled all right you can cant you i shant cae how much it costs  the doctor said gravely he thought he could manage it and he ignored the long unconscious sigh of relief that clementina drew  in all her confusing anxieties for mrs lander gregory remained at the bottom of her heart a dumb ache when the pressure of her fears was taken from her she began to suffer for him consciously then a letter came from him     i cannot make it right it is where it was and i feel that i must    not see you again i am trying to do right but with the fear that    i am wrong send some word to help me before i go away tomorrow    f g  it was what she had expected she knew now but it was none the less to be borne because of her expectation she wrote back     i believe you are doing the best you can and i shall always    believe that  her note brought back a long letter from him he said that whatever he did or wherever he went he should try to be true to her ideal of him if they renounced their love now for the sake of what seemed higher than their love they might suffer but they could not choose but do as they were doing  clementina was trying to make what she could of this when miss milrays name came up and miss milray followed it  i wanted to ask after mrs lander and i want you to tell her i did will you dr welwright says hes going to take her to venice well im sorrysorry for your going clementina and im truly sorry for the cause of it i shall miss you my dear i shall indeed you know i always wanted to steal you but youll do me the justice to say i never did and i wont try now  perhaps i wasnt worth stealing clementina suggested with a ruefulness in her smile that went to miss milrays heart  she put her arms round her and kissed her i wasnt very kind to you the other day clementina was i  i dont know clementina faltered with halfaverted face  yes you do i was trying to makebelieve that i didnt want to meddle with your affairs but i was really vexed that you hadnt told me your story before it hasnt taken me all this time to reflect that you couldnt but it has to make myself come and confess that i had been dry and cold with you she hesitated its come out all right hasnt it clementina she asked tenderly you see i want to meddle now  we ah trying to think so sighed the girl  tell me about it miss milray pulled her down on the sofa with her and modified her embrace to a clasp of clementinas bands  why there isnt much to tell she began but she told what there was and miss milray kept her countenance concerning the scruple that had parted clementina and her lover perhaps he wouldnt have thought of it she said in a final selfreproach if i hadnt put it into his head  well then im not sorry you put it into his head cried miss milray clementina may i say what i think of mr gregorys performance  why certainly miss milray  i think hes not merely a gloomy little bigot but a very hardhearted little wretch and im glad youre rid of him no stop let me go on you said i might she persisted at a protest which imparted itself from clementinas restive hands it was selfish and cruel of him to let you believe that he had forgotten you it doesnt make it right now when an accident has forced him to tell you that he cared for you all along  why do you look at it that way miss milray if he was doing it on my account  he may think he was doing it on your account but i think he was doing it on his own in such a thing as that a man is bound by his mistakes if he has made any he cant go back of them by simply ignoring them it didnt make it the same for you when he decided for your sake that he would act as if he had never spoken to you  i presume he thought that it would come right sometime clementina urged i did  yes that was very well for you but it wasnt at all well for him he behaved cruelly theres no other word for it  i dont believe he meant to be cruel miss milray said clementina  youre not sorry youve broken with him demanded miss milray severely and she let go of clementinas hands  i shouldnt want him to think i hadnt been faia  i dont understand what you mean by not being fair said miss milray after a study of the girls eyes  i mean clementina explained that if i let him think the religion was all thee was it wouldnt have been faia  why werent you sincere about that  of couse i was returned the girl almost indignantly but if thee was anything else i ought to have told him that too and i couldnt  then you cant tell me of course miss milray rose in a little pique  perhaps some day i will the girl entreated and perhaps that was all  miss milray laughed well if that was enough to end it im satisfied and ill let you keep your mysteryif it is onetill we meet in venice i shall be there early in june good bye dear and say good bye to mrs lander for me     xxviii  dr welwright got his patient a lodging on the grand canal in venice and decided to stay long enough to note the first effect of the air and the baths and to look up a doctor to leave her with  this took something more than a week which could not all be spent in mrs landers company much as she wished it there were hours which he gave to going about in a gondola with clementina whom he forbade to be always at the invalids side he tried to reassure her as to mrs landers health when he found her rather mute and absent while they drifted in the silvery sun of the late april weather just beginning to be warm but not warm enough yet for the tent of the open gondola he asked her about mrs landers family and clementina could only tell him that she had always said she had none she told him the story of her own relation to her and he said yes i heard something of that from miss milray after a moment of silence during which he looked curiously into the girls eyes do you think you can bear a little more care miss claxon  i think i can said clementina not very courageously but patiently  its only this and i wouldnt tell you if i hadnt thought you equal to it mrs landers case puzzles me but i shall leave dr tradonico watching it and if it takes the turn that theres a chance it may take he will tell you and youd better find out about her friends andlet them know thats all  yes said clementina as if it were not quite enough perhaps she did not fully realize all that the doctor had intended life alone is credible to the young life and the expectation of it  the night before he was to return to florence there was a full moon and when he had got mrs lander to sleep he asked clementina if she would not go out on the lagoon with him he assigned no peculiar virtue to the moonlight and he had no new charge to give her concerning his patient when they were embarked he seemed to wish her to talk about herself and when she strayed from the topic he prompted her return then he wished to know how she liked florence as compared with venice and all the other cities she had seen and when she said she had not seen any but boston and new york and london for one night he wished to know whether she liked florence as well she said she liked it best of all and he told her he was very glad for he liked it himself better than any place he had ever seen he spoke of his family in america which was formed of grownup brothers and sisters so that he had none of the closest and tenderest ties obliging him to return there was no reason why he should not spend all his days in florence except for some brief visits home it would be another thing with such a place as venice he could never have the same settled feeling there it was beautiful but it was unreal it would be like spending ones life at the opera did not she think so  she thought so oh yes she never could have the homefeeling at venice that she had at florence  exactly thats what i meanta homefeeling im glad you had it he let the gondola dip and slide forward almost a minute before he added with an effect of pulling a voice up out of his throat somewhere how would you like to live therewith meas my wife  why what do you mean dr welwright asked clementina with a vague laugh  dr welwright laughed too but not vaguely there was a mounting cheerfulness in his laugh what i say i hope it isnt very surprising  no but i never thought of such a thing  perhaps you will think of it now  but youre not in eanest  im thoroughly in earnest said the doctor and he seemed very much amused at her incredulity  then im sorry she answered i couldnt  no he said still with amusement or with a courage that took that form why not  because i amnot free  for an interval they were so silent that they could hear each other breathe then after he had quietly bidden the gondolier go back to their hotel he asked if you had been free you might have answered me differently  i dont know said clementina candidly i never thought of it  it isnt because you disliked me  oh no  then i must get what comfort i can out of that i hope with all my heart that you may be happy  why dr welwright said clementina dont you suppose that i should be glad to do it if i could any one would  it doesnt seem very probable just now he answered humbly but ill believe it if you say so  i do say so and i always shall  thank you  dr welwright professed himself ready for his departure at breakfast next morning and he must have made his preparations very late or very early he was explicit in his charges to clementina concerning mrs lander and at the end of them he said she will not know when she is asking too much of you but you will and you must act upon your knowledge and remember if you are in need of help of any kind youre to let me know will you  yes i will dr welwright  people will be going away soon and i shall not be so busy i can come back if dr tradonico thinks it necessary  he left mrs lander full of resolutions to look after her own welfare in every way and she went out in her gondola the same morning she was not only to take the air as much as possible but she was to amuse herself and she decided that she would have her second breakfast at the caffe florian venice was beginning to fill up with arrivals from the south and it need not have been so surprising to find mr hinkle there over a cup of coffee he said he had just that moment been thinking of her and meaning to look her up at the hotel he said that he had stopped at venice because it was such a splendid place to introduce his gleaner he invited mrs lander to become a partner in the enterprise he promised her a return of fifty per cent on her investment if he could once introduce his gleaner in venice he should be a made man he asked mrs lander with real feeling how she was as for miss clementina he need not ask  oh indeed the docta thinks she wants a little lookin after too said mrs lander  well about as much as you do mrs lander hinkle allowed tolerantly i dont know how it affects you maam such a meeting of friends in these strange waters but its building me right up its made another man of me already and ive got the other mans appetite too mind my letting him have his breakfast here with me at your table he bade the waiter just fetch his plate he attached himself to them he spent the day with them mrs lander asked him to dinner at her lodgings and left him to clementina over the coffee  shes looking fine doesnt the doctor think this air will do everything for her  oh yes shes a great deal betta than she was befoe we came  thats right well now youve got me here you must let me make myself useful any way i can ive got a spare month that i can put in here in venice just as well as not i shant want to push north till the frosts out of the ground they wouldnt have a chance to try my gleaner on the other side of the alps much before september anyway now in ohio the part i come from we cut our wheat in june when is your wheat harvest at middlemount  clementina laughed i dont believe weve got any i guess its all grass  i wish you could see our country out there once  is it nice  nice were right in the centre of the state measuring from north to south on the old national road clementina had never heard of this road but she did not say so about five miles back from the ohio river where the coal comes up out of the ground because theres so much of it theres no room for it below our farms in a valley along a creek bottom what you yankees call an intervals weve got three hundred acres my grandfather took up the land and then he went back to pennsylvania to get the girl hed left therewe were pennsylvania dutch thats where i got my romantic namethey drove all the way out to ohio again in his buggy and when he came in sight of our valley with his bride he stood up in his buggy and pointed with his whip there as far as the sky is blue its all ours  clementina owned the charm of his story as he seemed to expect but when he said yes i want you to see that country some day she answered cautiously  it must be lovely but i dont expect to go west eva  i like your eastern way of saying everr said hinkle and he said it in his western way i like new england folks  clementina smiled discreetly they have their faults like everybody else i presume  ah thats a regular yankee word presume said hinkle our teacher my first one always said presume she was from your state too     xxix  in the time of provisional quiet that followed for clementina she was held from the remorses and misgivings that had troubled her before hinkle came she still thought that she had let dr welwright go away believing that she had not cared enough for the offer which had surprised her so much and she blamed herself for not telling him how doubly bound she was to gregory though when she tried to put her sense of this in words to herself she could not make out that she was any more bound to him than she had been before they met in florence unless she wished to be so yet somehow in this time of respite neither the regret for dr welwright nor the question of gregory persisted very strongly and there were whole days when she realized before she slept that she had not thought of either  she was in full favor again with mrs lander whom there was no one to embitter in her jealous affection hinkle formed their whole social world and mrs lander made the most of him she was always having him to the dinners which her landlord served her from a restaurant in her apartment and taking him out with clementina in her gondola he came into a kind of authority with them both which was as involuntary with him as with them and was like an effect of his constant wish to be doing something for them  one morning when they were all going out in mrs landers gondola she sent clementina back three times to their rooms for outer garments of differing density when she brought the last mrs lander frowned  this wont do ive got to have something elsesomething lighter and warma  i cant go back any moa mrs landa cried the girl from the exasperation of her own nerves  then i will go back myself said mrs lander with dignity and we shant need the gondoler any more this moning she added unless you and mr hinkle wants to ride  she got ponderously out of the boat with the help of the gondoliers elbow and marched into the house again while clementina followed her she did not offer to help her up the stairs hinkle had to do it and he met the girl slowly coming up as he returned from delivering mrs lander over to maddalena  shes all right now he ventured to say tentatively  is she clementina coldly answered  in spite of her repellent air he persisted shes a pretty sick woman isnt she  the docta doesnt say  well i think it would be safe to act on that supposition miss clementinai think she wants to see you  im going to her directly  hinkle paused rather daunted she wants me to go for the doctor  shes always wanting the docta clementina lifted her eyes and looked very coldly at him  if i were you id go up right away he said boldly  she felt that she ought to resent his interference but the mild entreaty of his pale blue eyes or the elderbrotherly injunction of his smile forbade her did she ask for me  no  ill go to her she said and she kept herself from smiling at the long sigh of relief he gave as she passed him on the stairs  mrs lander began as soon as she entered her room well i was just wonderin if you was goin to leave me here all day alone while you staid down thee carryin on with that simpleton i dont know whats got into the men  mr hinkle has gone for the docta said clementina trying to get into her voice the kindness she was trying to feel  well if i have one of my attacks now youll have yourself to thank for it  by the time dr tradonico appeared mrs lander was so much better that in her revulsion of feeling she was all day rather tryingly affectionate in her indirect appeals for clementinas sympathy  i dont want you should mind what i say when i ant feelin just right she began that evening after she had gone to bed and clementina sat looking out of the open window on the moonlit lagoon  oh no the girl answered wearily  mrs lander humbled herself farther im real sorry i plagued you so today and i know mr hinkle thought i was dreadful but i couldnt help it i should like to talk with you clementina about something thats worryin me if you ant busy  im not busy now mrs lander said clementina a little coldly and relaxing the clasp of her hands to knit her fingers together had been her sole business and she put even this away  she did not come nearer the bed and mrs lander was obliged to speak without the advantage of noting the effect of her words upon her in her face its like this what am i agoin to do for them relations of mr landas out in michigan  i dont know what relations  i told you about em the only ones hes got his halfsistas children he neva saw em and he neva wanted to but theyre his kin and it was his money it dont seem right to pass em ova do you think it would yourself clementina  why of couse not mrs lander it wouldnt be right at all  mrs lander looked relieved and she said as if a little surprised im glad you feel that way i should feel just so myself i mean to do by you just what i always said i should i shant forget you but whee thees so much i got to thinkin theed ought to some of it go to his folks whetha he caed for em or not its worried me some and i guess if anything its that thats made me wose lately  why by mrs landa said the girl why dont you give it all to them  you dont know what youa talkin about said mrs lander severely i guess if i give em five thousand or so amongstem its full moa than they eve thought of havin and its moa than they got any right to well thats all right then and we dont need to talk about it any moa yes she resumed after a moment thats what i shall do i hunt eva felt just satisfied with that last will i got made and i guess i shall tear it up and get the fust american lawyer that comes along to make me a new one the proptys all goin to you but i guess i shall leave five thousand apiece to the two families out thee you wont miss it any and i presume its what mr landa would expect i should do though why he didnt do it himself i cant undastand unless it was to show his confidence in me  she began to ask clementina how she felt about staying in venice all summer she said she had got so much better there already that she believed she should be well by fall if she stayed on she was certain that it would put her all back if she were to travel now and in europe where it was so hard to know how to get to places she did not see how they could pick out any that would suit them as well as venice did  clementina agreed to it all more or less absentmindedly as she sat looking into the moonlight and the day that had begun so stormily ended in kindness between them  the next morning mrs lander did not wish to go out and she sent clementina and hinkle together as a proof that they were all on good terms again she did not spare the girl this explanation in his presence and when they were in the gondola he felt that he had to say i was afraid you might think i was rather meddlesome yesterday  oh no she answered i was glad you did  yes he returned i thought you would be afterwards he looked at her wistfully with his slanted eyes and his odd twisted smile and they both gave way in the same conscious laugh what i like he explained further is to be understood when ive said something that doesnt mean anything dont you you know anybody can understand you if you really mean something but most of the time you dont and thats when a friend is useful i wish youd call on me if youre ever in that fix  oh i will mr hinkle clementina promised gayly  thank you he said and her gayety seemed to turn him graver miss clementina might i go a little further in this direction without danger  what direction she added with a flush of sudden alarm  mrs lander  why suttainly she answered in quick relief  i wish youd let me do some of the worrying about her for you while im here you know i havent got anything else to do  why i dont believe i worry much im afraid i foget about her when im not with her thats the wost of it  no no he entreated thats the best of it but i want to do the worrying for you even when youre with her will you let me  why if you want to so very much  then its settled he said dismissing the subject  but she recurred to it with a lingering compunction  i presume that i dont remember how sick she is because ive neva been sick at all myself  well he returned you neednt be sorry for that altogether there are worse things than being well though sick people dont always think so ive wasted a good deal of time the other way though ive reformed now  they went on to talk about themselves sometimes they talked about others in excursions which were more or less perfunctory and were merely in the way of illustration or instance she got so far in one of these as to speak of her family and he seemed to understand them he asked about them all and he said he believed in her fathers unworldly theory of life he asked her if they thought at home that she was like her father and he added as if it followed im the worldling of my family i was the youngest child and the only boy in a flock of girls that always spoils a boy  are you spoiled she asked  well im afraid theyd be surprised if i didnt come to grief somehowall butmother she expects ill be kept from harm  is she religious  yes shes a moravian did you ever hear of them clementina shook her head theyre something like the quakers and something like the methodists they dont believe in war but they have bishops  and do you belong to her church  no said the young man i wish i did for her sake i dont belong to any do you  no i go to the episcopal at home perhaps i shall belong sometime but i think that is something everyone must do for themselves he looked a little alarmed at the note of severity in her voice and she explained i mean that if you try to be religious for anything besides religion it isnt being religiousand no one else has any right to ask you to be  oh thats what i believe too he said with comic relief i didnt know but id been trying to convert you without knowing it they both laughed and were then rather seriously silent  he asked after a moment in a fresh beginning have you heard from miss milray since you left florence  oh yes didnt i tell you shes coming here in june  well she wont have the pleasure of seeing me then im going the last of may  i thought you were going to stay a month she protested  that will be a month and more too  so it will she owned  im glad it doesnt seem any longersay a yearmiss clementina  oh not at all she returned miss milrays brother and his wife are coming with her theyve been in egypt  i never saw them said hinkle he paused before he added well it would seem rather crowded after they get here i suppose and he laughed while clementina said nothing     xxx  hinkle came every morning now to smoothe out the doubts and difficulties that had accumulated in mrs landers mind over night and incidentally to propose some pleasure for clementina who could feel that he was pitying her in her slavery to the sick womans whims and yet somehow entreating her to bear them he saw them together in what mrs lander called her well days but there were other days when he saw clementina alone and then she brought him word from mrs lander and reported his talk to her after he went away on one of these she sent him a cheerfuller message than usual and charged the girl to explain that she was ever so much better but had not got up because she felt that every minute in bed was doing her good clementina carried back his regrets and congratulation and then told mrs lander that he had asked her to go out with him to see a church which he was sorry mrs lander could not see too he professed to be very particular about his churches for he said he had noticed that they neither of them had any great gift for sights and he had it on his conscience to get the best for them he told clementina that the church he had for them now could not be better if it had been built expressly for them instead of having been used as a place of worship for eight or ten generations of venetians before they came she gave his invitation to mrs lander who could not always be trusted with his jokes and she received it in the best part  well you go she said maddalena can look after me i guess hes the only one of the fellas except that lod that id give a cent for she added with a sudden lapse from her pleasure in hinkle to her severity with clementina but you want to be caeful what you doin  caeful  yesabout mr hinkle i ant agoin to have you lead him on and then say you didnt know where he was goin i cant keep runnin away everywhee fo you the way i done at woodlake  clementinas heart gave a leap whether joyful or woeful but she answered indignantly how can you say such a thing to me mrs lander im not leading him on  i dont know what you call it youre round with him in the gondoler night and day and when hes hee youa settin with him half the time on the balcony and its talk talk the whole while clementina took in the fact with silent recognition and mrs lander went on i aint sayin anything against it hes the only one i dont believe is afta the money he thinks youa goin to have but if you dont want him you want to look what youre about  the girl returned to hinkle in the embarrassment which she was helpless to hide and without the excuse which she could not invent for refusing to go with him is mrs lander worseor anything he asked  oh no shes quite well said clementina but she left it for him to break the constraint in which they set out he tried to do so at different points but it seemed to close upon themthe more inflexibly at last he asked as they were drawing near the church have you ever seen anything of mr belsky since you left florence  no she said with a nervous start what makes you ask  i dont know but you see nearly everybody again that you meet in your travels that friend of histhat mr gregoryhe seems to have dropped out too i believe you told me you used to know him in america  yes she answered briefly she could not say more and hinkle went on it seemed to me that as far as i could make him out he was about as much of a crank in his way as the russian its curious but when you were talking about religion the other day you made me think of him the blood went to clementinas heart i dont suppose you had him in mind but what you said fitted him more than anyone i know of i could have almost believed that he had been trying to convert you she stared at him and he laughed he tackled me one day there in florence all of a sudden and i didnt know what to say exactly of course i respected his earnestness but i couldnt accept his view of things and i tried to tell him so i had to say just where i stood and why and i mentioned some books that helped to get me there he said he never read anything that went counter to his faith and i saw that he didnt want to save me so much as he wanted to convince me he didnt know it and i didnt tell him that i knew it but i got him to let me drop the subject he seems to have been left over from a time when people didnt reason about their beliefs but only argued i didnt think there was a man like that to be found so late in the century especially a young man but that was just where i was mistaken if there was to be a man of that kind at all it would have to be a young one hell be a good deal openerminded when hes older he was conscientious i could see that and he did take the russians death to heart as long as he was dead but id like to talk with him ten years from now he wouldnt be where he is  clementina was still silent and she walked up the church steps from the gondola without the power to speak she made no show of interest in the pictures and statues she never had really cared much for such things and now his attempts to make her look at them failed miserably when they got back again into the boat he began miss clementina im afraid i oughtnt to have spoken as i did of that mr gregory if he is a friend of yours  he is she made herself answer  i didnt mean anything against him i hope you dont think i wanted to be unfair  you were not unfair but i oughtnt to have let you say it mr hinkle i want to tell you somethingi mean i mustshe found herself panting and breathless you ought to know itmr gregory isi mean we are  she stopped and she saw that she need not say more  in the days that followed before the time that hinkle had fixed to leave venice he tried to come as he had been coming to see mrs lander but he evaded her when she wished to send him out with clementina his quaintness had a heartache in it for her and he was boyishly simple in his failure to hide his suffering he had no explicit right to suffer for he had asked nothing and been denied nothing but perhaps for this reason she suffered the more keenly for him  a senseless resentment against gregory for spoiling their happiness crept into her heart and she wished to show hinkle how much she valued his friendship at any risk and any cost when this led her too far she took herself to task with a severity which hurt him too in the midst of the impulses on which she acted there were times when she had a confused longing to appeal to him for counsel as to how she ought to behave toward him  there was no one else whom she could appeal to mrs lander after her first warning had not spoken of him again though clementina could feel in the grimness with which she regarded her variable treatment of him that she was silently hoarding up a sum of inculpation which would crush her under its weight when it should fall upon her she seemed to be growing constantly better now and as the interval since her last attack widened behind her she began to indulge her appetite with a recklessness which clementina in a sense of her own unworthiness was helpless to deal with when she ventured to ask her once whether she ought to eat of something that was very unwholesome for her mrs lander answered that she had taken her case into her own hands now for she knew more about it than all the doctors she would thank clementina not to bother about her she added that she was at least not hurting anybody but herself and she hoped clementina would always be able to say as much  clementina wished that hinkle would go away but not before she had righted herself with him and he lingered his month out and seemed as little able to go as she to let him she had often to be cheerful for both when she found it too much to be cheerful for herself in his absence she feigned free and open talks with him and explained everything and experienced a kind of ghostly comfort in his imagined approval and forgiveness but in his presence nothing really happened except the alternation of her kindness and unkindness in which she was too kind and then too unkind  the morning of the day he was at last to leave venice he came to say good bye he did not ask for mrs lander when the girl received him and he did not give himself time to lose courage before he began miss clementina i dont know whether i ought to speak to you after what i understood you to mean about mr gregory he looked steadfastly at her but she did not answer and he went on theres just one chance in a million though that i didnt understand you rightly and ive made up my mind that i want to take that chance may i she tried to speak but she could not if i was wrongif there was nothing between you and himcould there ever be anything between you and me  his pleading looks entreated her even more than his words  there was something she answered with him  and i mustnt know what the young man said patiently  yesyes she returned eagerly oh yes i want you to knowi want to tell you i was only sixteen yeas old and he said that he oughtnt to have spoken we were both too young but last winta he spoke again he said that he had always felt boundshe stopped and he got infirmly to his feet i wanted to tell you from the fust but  how could you you couldnt i havent anything more to say if you are bound to him  he is going to be a missionary and he wanted me to say that i would believe just as he did and i couldnt but i thought that it would come right andyes i felt bound to him too that is alli cant explain it  oh i understand he returned listlessly  and do you blame me for not telling before she made an involuntary movement toward him a pathetic gesture which both entreated and compassionated  theres nobody to blame you have tried to do just right by me as well as him well ive got my answer mrs landercan i  why she isnt up yet mr hinkle clementina put all her pain for him into the expression of their regret  then ill have to leave my goodbye for her with you i dont believe i can come back again he looked round as if he were dizzy goodbye he said and offered his hand it was cold as clay  when he was gone clementina went into mrs landers room and gave her his message  couldnt he have come back this aftanoon to see me if he aint goin till five she demanded jealously  he said he couldnt come back clementina answered sadly  the woman turned her head on her pillow and looked at the girls face oh she said for all comment     xxxi  the milrays came a month later to seek a milder sun than they had left burning in florence the husband and wife had been sojourning there since their arrival from egypt but they had not been his sisters guests and she did not now pretend to be of their party though the same train even the same carriage had brought her to venice with them they went to a hotel and miss milray took lodgings where she always spent her junes before going to the tyrol for the summer  you are wonderfully improved every way mrs milray said to clementina when they met i knew you would be if miss milray took you in hand and i can see she has what she doesnt know about the world isnt worth knowing i hope she hasnt made you too worldly but if she has shes taught you how to keep from showing it youre just as innocentlooking as ever and thats the main thing you oughtnt to lose that you wouldnt dance a skirt dance now before a ships company but if you did no one would suspect that you knew any better have you forgiven me yet well i didnt use you very well clementina and i never pretended i did ive eaten a lot of humble pie for that my dear did miss milray tell you that i wrote to her about it of course you wont say how she told you but she ought to have done me the justice to say that i tried to be a friend at court with her for you if she didnt she wasnt fair  she neva said anything against you mrs milray clementina answered  discreet as ever my dear i understand and i hope you understand about that old affair too by this time it was a complication i had to get back at lioncourt somehow and i dont honestly think now that his admiration for a young girl was a very wholesome thing for her but never mind you had that boston goose in florence too last winter and i suppose he gobbled up what little miss milray had left of me but shes charming i could go down on my knees to her art when she really tries to finish any one  clementina noticed that mrs milray had got a new way of talking she had a chirpiness and a lift in her inflections which if it was not exactly english was no longer western american clementina herself in her association with hinkle had worn off her english rhythm and in her long confinement to the conversation of mrs lander she had reverted to her clipped yankee accent mrs milray professed to like it and said it brought back so delightfully those pleasant days at middlemount when clementina really was a child i met somebody at cairo who seemed very glad to hear about you though he tried to seem not can you guess who it was i see that you never could in the world we got quite chummy one day when we were going out to the pyramids together and he gave himself away finely hes a simple soul but when theyre in love theyre all so it was a little queer colloguing with the exheadwaiter on society terms but the headwaitership was merely an episode and the main thing is that he is very talented and is going to be a minister its a pity hes so devoted to his crazy missionary scheme some one ought to get hold of him and point him in the direction of a rich new york congregation hed find heathen enough among them and he could do the greatest amount of good with their money i tried to talk it into him i suppose you saw him in florence this spring she suddenly asked  yes clementina answered briefly  and you didnt make it up together i got that much out of miss milray well if he were here i should find out why but i dont suppose you would tell me she waited a moment to see if clementina would and then she said its a pity for ive a notion i could help you and i think i owe you a good turn for the way i behaved about your dance but if you dont want my help you dont  i would say so if i did mrs milray said clementina i was hut at the time but i dont care anything for it now i hope you wont think about it any more  thank you said mrs milray ill try not to and she laughed but i should like to do something to prove my repentance  clementina perceived that for some reason she would rather have more than less cause for regret and that she was mocking her but she was without the wish or the power to retaliate and she did not try to fathom mrs milrays motives most motives in life even bad motives lie nearer the surface than most people commonly pretend and she might not have had to dig deeper into mrs milrays nature for hers than that layer of her consciousness where she was aware that clementina was a pet of her sisterinlaw for no better reason she herself made a pet of mrs lander whose dislike of miss milray was not hard to divine and whose willingness to punish her through clementina was akin to her own the sick woman was easily flattered back into her first belief in mrs milray and accepted her large civilities and small services as proof of her virtues she began to talk them into clementina and to contrast them with the wicked principles and actions of miss milray  the girl had forgiven mrs milray but she could not go back to any trust in her and she could only passively assent to her praise when mrs lander pressed her for anything more explicit she said what she thought and then mrs lander accused her of hating mrs milray who was more her friend than some that flattered her up for everything and tried to make a fool of her  i undastand now she said one day what that recta meant by wantin me to make life bad for you he saw how easy you was to spoil miss milray is one to praise you to your face and disgrace you be hind your back and so i tell you when mrs milray thought you done wrong she come and said so and you cant forgive her  clementina did not answer she had mastered the art of reticence in her relations with mrs lander and even when miss milray tempted her one day to give way she still had strength to resist but she could not deny that mrs lander did things at times to worry her though she ended compassionately with the reflection shes sick  i dont think shes very sick now retorted her friend  no thats the reason shes so worrying when shes really sick shes betta  because shes frightened i suppose and how long do you propose to stand it  i dont know clementina listlessly answered  she couldnt get along without me i guess i can stand it till we go home she says she is going home in the fall  miss milray sat looking at the girl a moment  shall you be glad to go home  oh yes indeed  to that place in the woods  why yes what makes you ask  nothing but clementina sometimes i think you dont quite understand yourself dont you know that you are very pretty and very charming ive told you that often enough but shouldnt you like to be a great success in the world havent you ever thought of that dont you care for society  the girl sighed yes i think thats all very nice i did cae one while there in florence last winter  my dear you dont know how much you were admired i used to tell you because i saw there was no spoiling you but i never told you half if you had only had the time for it you could have been the greatest sort of success you were formed for it it wasnt your beauty alone lots of pretty girls dont make anything of their beauty it was your temperament you took things easily and naturally and thats what the world likes it doesnt like your being afraid of it and you were not afraid and you were not bold you were just right miss milray grew more and more exhaustive in her analysis and enjoyed refining upon it all that you needed was a little hardheartedness and that would have come in time you would have learned how to hold your own but the chance was snatched from you by that old cat i could weep over you when i think how you have been wasted on her and now youre actually willing to go back and lose yourself in the woods  i shouldnt call it being lost miss milray  i dont mean that and you must excuse me my dear but surely your peopleyour father and motherwould want to have you get on in the worldto make a brilliant match  clementina smiled to think how far such a thing was from their imaginations i dont believe they would cae you dont undastand about them and i couldnt make you fatha neva liked the notion of my being with such a rich woman as mrs lander because it would look as if we wanted her money  i never could have imagined that of you clementina  i didnt think you could said the girl gratefully but now if i left her when she was sick and depended on me it would look wohse yetas if i did it because she was going to give her money to mr landas family she wants to do that and i told her to i think that would be right dont you  it would be right for you clementina if you preferred itandi should prefer it but it wouldnt be right for her she has given you hopesshe has made promisesshe has talked to everybody  i dont cae for that i shouldnt like to feel beholden to any one and i think it really belongs to his relations it was his  miss milray did not say anything to this she asked and if you went back what would you do there labor in the fields as poor little belsky advised  clementina laughed no but i expect youll think its almost as crazy you know how much i like dancing well i think i could give dancing lessons at the middlemount there are always a good many children and girls that have not grown up and i guess i could get pupils enough as long as the summa lasted and come winter im not afraid but what i could get them among the young folks at the center i used to teach them before i left home  miss milray sat looking at her i dont know about such things but it sounds sensiblelike everything about you my dear it sounds queer perhaps because youre talking of such a white mountain scheme here in venice  yes dont it said clementina sympathetically i was thinking of that myself but i know i could do it i could go round to different hotels different days yes i should like to go home and they would be glad to have me you cant think how pleasantly we live and were company enough for each other i presume i should miss the things ive got used to ova here at fust but i dont believe i should care a great while i dont deny but what the wold is nice but you have to pay for it i dont mean that you would make me  no no we understand each other go on  miss milray leaned towards her and pressed the girls arm reassuringly  as often happens with people when they are told to go on clementina found that she had not much more to say i think i could get along in the wold well enough yes i believe i could do it but i wasnt bohn to it and it would be a great deal of troublea great deal moa than if i had been bohn to it i think it would be too much trouble i would rather give it up and go home when mrs landa wants to go back  miss milray did not speak for a time i know that you are serious clementina and youre wise always and good  it isnt that exactly said clementina but is iti dont know how to express it very wellis it woth while  miss milray looked at her as if she doubted the girls sincerity even when the world in return for our making it our whole life disappoints and defeats us with its prizes we still question the truth of those who question the value of these prizes we think they must be hopeless of them or must be governed by some interest momentarily superior  clementina pursued i know that you have had all you wanted of the wold  oh no the woman broke out almost in anguish not what i wanted what i tried for it never gave me what i wanted itcouldnt  well  it isnt worth while in that sense but if you cant have what you wantif theres been a hollow left in your lifewhy the world goes a great way towards filling up the aching void the tone of the last words was lighter than their meaning but clementina weighed them aright  miss milray she said pinching the edge of the table by which she sat a little nervously and banging her head a little i think i can have what i want  then give the whole world for it child  there is something i should like to tell you  yes  for you to advise me about  i will my dear gladly and truly  he was here before you came he asked me  miss milray gave a start of alarm she said to gain time how did he get here i supposed he was in germany with his  no he was here the whole of may  mr gregory  mr gregory clementinas face flushed and drooped still lower i meant mr hinkle but if you think i oughtnt  i dont think anything im so glad i supposed from what you said about the world that it must bebut if it isnt all the better if its mr hinkle that you can have  im not sure i can i should like to tell you just how it is and then you will know it needed fewer words for this than she expected and then clementina took a letter from her pocket and gave it to miss milray he wrote it on the train going away and its not very plain but i guess you can make it out  miss milray received the penciled leaves which seemed to be pages torn out of a notebook they were dated the day hinkle left venice and the envelope bore the postmark of verona they were not addressed but began abruptly i believe i have made a mistake i ought not to have given you up till i knew something that no one but you can tell me you are not bound to any body unless you wish to be so that is what i see now and i will not give you up if i can help it even if you had made a promise and then changed your mind you would not be bound in such a thing as this i say this and i know you will not believe i say it because i want you i do want you but i would not urge you to break your faith i only ask you to realize that if you kept your word when your heart had gone out of it you would be breaking your faith and if you broke your word you would be keeping your faith but if your heart is still in your word i have no more to say nobody knows but you i would get out and take the first train back to venice if it were not for two things i know it would be hard on me and i am afraid it might be hard on you but if you will write me a line at milan when you get this or if you will write to me at london before july or at new york at any timefor i expect to wait as long as i live  the letter ended here in the local addresses which the writer gave  miss milray handed the leaves back to clementina who put them into her pocket and apparently waited for her questions  and have you written  no said the girl slowly and thoughtfully i havent i wanted to at fust and then i thought that if he truly meant what he said he would be willing to wait  and why did you want to wait  clementina replied with a question of her own miss milray what do you think about mr gregory  oh you mustnt ask me that my dear i was afraid i had told you too plainly the last time  i dont mean about his letting me think he didnt cae for me so long but dont you think he wants to do what is right mr gregory i mean  well if you put me on my honor im afraid i do  you see clementina resumed he was the fust one and i did cae for him a great deal and i might have gone on caring for him ifwhen i found out that i didnt care any longer or so much it seemed to me as if it must be wrong do you think it was  nono  when i got to thinking about some one else at fust it was only not thinking about himi was ashamed then i tried to make out that i was too young in the fust place to know whether i really caed for any one in the right way but after i made out that i was i couldnt feel exactly easyand ive been wanting to ask you miss milray  ask me anything you like my dear  why its only whether a person ought eva to change  we change whether we ought or not it isnt a matter of duty one way or another  yes but ought we to stop caring for somebody when perhaps we shouldnt if somebody else hadnt come between that is the question  no miss milray retorted that isnt at all the question the question is which you want and whether you could get him whichever you want most it is right for you to have  do you truly think so  i do indeed this is the one thing in life where one may choose safest what one likes best i mean if there is nothing bad in the man himself  i was afraid it would be wrong that was what i meant by wanting to be faia with mr gregory when i told you about him there in florence i dont believe but what it had begun then  what had begun  about mr hinkle  miss milray burst into a laugh clementina youre delicious the girl looked hurt and miss milray asked seriously why do you like mr hinkle bestif you do  clementina sighed oh i dont know hes so resting  then that settles it from first to last what we poor women want is rest it would be a wicked thing for you to throw your life away on some one who would worry you out of it i dont wish to say any thing against mr gregory i dare say he is goodand conscientious but life is a struggle at the best and its your duty to take the best chance for resting  clementina did not look altogether convinced whether it was miss milrays logic or her morality that failed to convince her she said after a moment i should like to see mr gregory again  what good would that do  why then i should know  know what  whether i didnt really cae for him any moreor so much  clementina said miss milray you mustnt make me lose patience with you  no but i thought you said that it was my duty to do what i wished  well yes that is what i said miss milray consented but i supposed that you knew already  no said clementina candidly i dont believe i do  and what if you dont see him  i guess i shall have to wait till i do thee will be time enough  miss milray sighed and then she laughed you are young     xxxii  miss milray went from clementina to call upon her sisterinlaw and found her brother which was perhaps what she hoped might happen  do you know she said that that old wretch is going to defraud that poor thing after all and leave her money to her husbands halfsisters children  you wish me to infer the mrs landerclementina situation milray returned  yes  im glad you put it in terms that are not actionable then for your words are decidedly libellous  what do you mean  ive just been writing mrs landers will for her and shes left all her property to clementina except five thousand apiece to the halfsisters three children  i cant believe it  well said milray with his gentle smile i think thats safe ground for you mrs lander will probably have time enough to change her will as well as her mind several times yet before she dies the halfsisters children may get their rights yet  i wish they might said miss milray with an impassioned sigh then perhaps i should get clementinafor a while  her brother laughed isnt there somebody else wants clementina  oh plenty but shes not sure she wants anybody else  does she want you  no i cant say she does she wants to go home  thats not a bad scheme i should like to go home myself if i had one what would you have done with clementina if you had got her jenny  what would any one have done with her married her brilliantly of course  but you say she isnt sure she wishes to be married at all  miss milray stated the case of clementinas divided mind and her belief that she would take hinkle in the end together with the fear that she might take gregory shes very odd miss milray concluded she puzzles me why did you ever send her to me  milray laughed i dont know i thought she would amuse you and i thought it would be a pleasure to her  they began to talk of some affairs of their own from which miss milray returned to clementina with the ache of an imperfectly satisfied intention if she had meant to urge her brother to seek justice for the girl from mrs lander she was not so well pleased to have found justice done already but the will had been duly signed and witnessed before the american viceconsul and she must get what good she could out of an accomplished fact it was at least a consolation to know that it put an end to her sisterinlaws patronage of the girl and it would be interesting to see mrs milray adapt her behavior to clementinas fortunes she did not really dislike her sisterinlaw enough to do her a wrong she was only willing that she should do herself a wrong but one of the most disappointing things in all hostile operations is that you never can know what the enemy would be at and mrs milrays manoeuvres were sometimes dictated by such impulses that her strategy was peculiarly baffling the thought of her past unkindness to clementina may still have rankled in her or she may simply have felt the need of outdoing miss milray by an unapproachable benefaction it is certain that when baron belsky came to venice a few weeks after her own arrival they began to pose at each other with reference to clementina she with a measure of consciousness he with the singleness of a nature that was all pose in his forbearance to win clementina from gregory he had enjoyed the distinction of an unique suffering and in allowing the fact to impart itself to mrs milray he bathed in the warmth of her flattering sympathy before she withdrew this as she must when she got tired of him she learned from him where gregory was for it seemed that gregory had so far forgiven the past that they had again written to each other  during the fortnight of belskys stay in venice mrs lander was much worse and clementina met him only once very brieflyshe felt that he had behaved like a very silly person but that was all over now and she had no wish to punish him for it at the end of his fortnight he went northward into the austrian tyrol and a few days later gregory came down from the dolomites to venice  it was in his favor with clementina that he yielded to the impulse he had to come directly to her and that he let her know with the first words that he had acted upon hopes given him through belsky from mrs milray he owned that he doubted the authority of either to give him these hopes but he said he could not abandon them without a last effort to see her and learn from her whether they were true or false  if she recognized the design of a magnificent reparation in what mrs milray had done she did not give it much thought her mind was upon distant things as she followed gregorys explanation of his presence and in the muse in which she listened she seemed hardly to know when he ceased speaking  i know it must seem to take something for granted which ive no right to take for granted i dont believe you could think that i cared for anything but you or at all for what mrs lander has done for you  do you mean her leaving me her money asked clementina with that boldness her sex enjoys concerning matters of finance and affection  yes said gregory blushing for her as far as i should ever have a right to care i could wish there were no money it could bring no blessing to our life we could do no good with it nothing but the sacrifice of ourselves in poverty could be blessed to us  that is what i thought too clementina replied  oh then you did think  but afterwards i changed my mind if she wants to give me her money i shall take it  gregory was blankly silent again  i shouldnt know how to refuse and i dont know as i should have any right to gregory shrank a little from her reyankeefied english as well as from the apparent cynicism of her speech but he shrank in silence still she startled him by asking with a kindness that was almost tenderness mr gregory how do you think anything has changed  changed  you know how it was when you went away from florence do you think differently now i dont i dont think i ought to do something for you and pretend that i was doing it for religion i dont believe the way you do and i know i neva shall do you want me in spite of my saying that i can neva help you in your work because i believe in it  but if you believe in me  she shook her bead compassionately you know we ahgued that out before we are just whee we were i am sorry nobody had any right to tell you to come hee but i am glad you came she saw the hope that lighted up his face but she went on unrelentinglyi think we had betta be free  free  yes from each other i dont know how you have felt but i have not felt free it has seemed to me that i promised you something if i did i want to take my promise back and be free  her frankness appealed to his own you are free i never held you bound to me in my fondest hopes you have always done right  i have tried to and i am not going to let you go away thinking that the reason i said is the only reason it isnt i wish to be free becausethere is some one else now it was hard to tell him this but she knew that she must not do less and the train that carried him from venice that night bore a letter from her to hinkle     xxxiii  clementina told miss milray what had happened but with mrs milray the girl left the sudden departure of gregory to account for itself  they all went a week later and mrs milray having now done her whole duty to clementina had the easiest mind concerning her miss milray felt that she was leaving her to greater trials than ever with mrs lander but since there was nothing else she submitted as people always do with the trials of others and when she was once away she began to forget her  by this time however it was really better for her with no one to suspect of tampering with her allegiance mrs lander returned to her former fondness for the girl and they were more peaceful if not happier together again they had long talks such as they used to have and in the first of these clementina told her how and why she had written to mr hinkle mrs lander said that it suited her exactly  there hant but just two men in europe behaved like gentlemen to me and one is mr hinkle and the other is that lod and between the two i ratha youd have mr hinkle i dont know as i believe much in american guls marryin lods the best of em  clementina laughed why mrs landa lod lioncout never thought of me in the wold  you cant eva know mrs milray was tellin that hes what they call a pooa lod and that he was carryin on with the american girls like everything down there in egypt last winta i guess if it comes to money youd have enough to buy him and sell him again  the mention of money cast a chill upon their talk and mrs lander said gloomily i dont know as i cae so much for that will mr milray made for me after all i did want to say ten thousand apiece for mr landas relations but i hated to befoe him id told the whole kit of em so much about you and i knew what they would think  she looked at clementina with recurring grudge and the girl could not bear it  then why dont you tear it up and make another i dont want anything unless you want me to have it and id ratha not have anything  yes and what would folks say afta youa taken care of me  do you think i do it fo that  what do you do it fo  what did you want me to come with you fo  thats true mrs lander brightened and warmed again i guess its all right i guess i done right and i got to be satisfied i presume i could get the consul to make me a will any time  clementina did not relent so easily mrs landa whateva you do i dont cae to know it and if you talk to me again about this i shall go home i would stay with you as long as you needed me but i cant if you keep bringing this up  i suppose you think you dont need me any moa betta not be too sua  the girl jumped to her feet and mrs lander interposed well thea i didnt mean anything and i wont pesta you about it any moa but i think its pretty had who am i going to talk it ova with then  you can talk it ova with the viceconsul paid clementina at random  well thats so mrs lander let clementina get her ready for the night in sign of returning amity when she was angry with her she always refused her help and made her send maddalena  the summer heat increased and the sick woman suffered from it but she could not be persuaded that she had strength to get away though the viceconsul whom she advised with used all his logic with her he was a gaunt and weary widower who described himself as being officially between hay and grass the consul who appointed him had resigned after going home and a new consul had not yet been sent out to remove him on what she called her well days mrs lander went to visit him and she did not mind his being in his shirtsleeves in the bit of garden where she commonly found him with his collar and cravat off and clouded in his own smoke when she was sick she sent for him to visit her he made excuses as often as she could and if he saw mrs landers gondola coming down the grand canal to his house he hurried on his cast clothing and escaped to the piazza at whatever discomfort and risk from the heat  i dont know how you stand it miss claxon he complained to clementina as soon as he learned that she was not a blood relation of mrs landers and divined that she had her own reservations concerning her but that woman will be the death of me if she keeps this up what does she think im here for if this goes on much longer ill resign the salary wont begin to pay for it what am i going to do i dont want to hurt her feelings or not to help her but i know ten times as much about mrs landers liver as i do about my own now  he treated clementina as a person of mature judgment and a sage discretion and he accepted what comfort she could offer him when she explained that it was everything for mrs lander to have him to talk with she gets tied of talking to me she urged and theres nobody else now  why dont she hire a valet de place and talk to him id hire one myself for her it would be a good deal cheaper for me its as much as i can do to stand this weather as it is  the viceconsul laughed forlornly in his exasperation but he agreed with clementina when she said in further excuse that mrs lander was really very sick he pushed back his hat and scratched his head with a grimace  of course weve got to remember shes sick and i shall need a little sympathy myself if she keeps on at me this way i believe ill tell her about my liver next time and see how she likes it look here miss claxon couldnt we get her off to some of those german watering places that are good for her complaints i believe it would be the best thing for hernot to mention me  mrs lander was moved by the suggestion which he made in person afterwards it appealed to her old nomadic instinct but when the consul was gone she gave it up we couldnt git thee clementina i got to stay hee till i git up my strenth i suppose youd be glad enough to have me stat now thees nobody hee but me she added suspiciously you git this scheme up or him  clementina did not defend herself and mrs lander presently came to her defence i dont believe but what he meant it fo the bestor you whichever it was and i appreciate it but all is i couldnt git off i guess this aia will do me as much good as anything come to have it a little coola  they went every afternoon to the lido where a wheeled chair met them and mrs lander was trundled across the narrow island to the beach in the evenings they went to the piazza where their faces and figures had become known and the venetians gossipped them down to the last fact of their relation with an accuracy creditable to their ingenuity in the affairs of others to them mrs lander was the sick american very rich and clementina was her adoptive daughter who would have her millions after her neither knew the character they bore to the amiable and inquisitive public of the piazza or cared for the fine eyes that aimed their steadfast gaze at them along the tubes of strawbarreled virginia cigars or across little cups of coffee mrs lander merely remarked that the venetians seemed great for gaping and clementina was for the most part innocent of their stare  she rested in the choice she had made in a content which was qualified by no misgiving she was sorry for gregory when she remembered him but her thought was filled with some one else and she waited in faith and patience for the answer which should come to the letter she had written she did not know where her letter would find him or when she should hear from him she believed that she should hear and that was enough she said to herself that she would not lose hope if no answer came for months but in her heart she fixed a date for the answer by letter and an earlier date for some word by cable but she feigned that she did not depend upon this and when no word came she convinced herself that she had not expected any  it was nearing the end of the term which she had tacitly given her lover to make the first sign by letter when one morning mrs lander woke her she wished to say that she had got the strength to leave venice at last and she was going as soon as their trunks could be packed she had dressed herself and she moved about restless and excited clementina tried to reason her out of her haste but she irritated her and fixed her in her determination i want to get away i tell you i want to get away she answered all persuasion and there seemed something in her like the wish to escape from more than the oppressive environment though she spoke of nothing but the heat and the smell of the canal i believe its that moa than any one thing thats kept me sick hee she said i tell you its the malariar and youll be down too if you stay  she made clementina go to the bankers and get money to pay their landlords bill and she gave him notice that they were going that afternoon clementina wished to delay till they had seen the viceconsul and the doctor but mrs lander broke out i dont want to see em either of em the docta wants to keep me hee and make money out of me i undastand him and i dont believe that consuls a bit too good to take a pussentage now dont you say a wod to either of em if you dont do exactly what i tell you ill go away and leave you hee now will you  clementina promised and broke her word she went to the viceconsul and told him she had broken it and she agreed with him that he had better not come unless mrs lander sent for him the doctor promptly imagined the situation and said he would come in casually during the morning so as not to alarm the invalids suspicions he owned that mrs lander was getting no good from remaining in venice and if it were possible for her to go he said she had better go somewhere into cooler and higher air  his opinion restored him to mrs landers esteem when it was expressed to her and as she was left to fix the sum of her debt to him she made it handsomer than anything he had dreamed of she held out against seeing the viceconsul till the landlord sent in his account this was for the whole month which she had just entered upon and it included fantastic charges for things hitherto included in the rent not only for the current month but for the months past when the landlord explained he had forgotten to note them mrs lander refused to pay these demands for they touched her in some of those economies which the gross rich practice amidst their profusion the landlord replied that she could not leave his house either with or without her effects until she had paid he declared clementina his prisoner too and he would not send for the viceconsul at mrs landers bidding how far he was within his rights in all this they could not know but he was perhaps himself doubtful and he consented to let them send for the doctor who when he came behaved like anything but the steadfast friend that mrs lander supposed she had bought in him he advised paying the account without regard to its justice as the shortest and simplest way out of the trouble but mrs lander who saw him talking amicably and even respectfully with the landlord when he ought to have treated him as an extortionate scamp returned to her former ill opinion of him and the viceconsul now appeared the friend that doctor tradonico had falsely seemed the doctor consented in leaving her to her contempt of him to carry a message to the viceconsul though he came back with his finger at the side of his nose to charge her by no means to betray his bold championship to the landlord  the viceconsul made none of those shows of authority which mrs lander had expected of him she saw him even exchanging the common decencies with the landlord when they met but in fact it was not hard to treat the smiling and courteous rogue well in all their disagreement he had looked as constantly to the comfort of his captives as if they had been his chosen guests he sent mrs lander a much needed refreshment at the stormiest moment of her indignation and he deprecated without retort the denunciations aimed at him in italian which did not perhaps carry so far as his conscience the consul talked with him in a calm scarcely less shameful than that of dr tradonico and at the end of their parley which she had insisted upon witnessing he said  well mrs lander youve got to stand this gouge or youve got to stand a law suit i think the gouge would be cheaper in the end you see hes got a right to his months rent  it aint the rent i cae for its the candles and the suvvice and the things he says we broke it was undastood that everything was to be in the rent and his two old chaias went to pieces of themselves when we tried to pull em out from the wall and ill neva pay for em in the wold  why the viceconsul pleaded its only about forty francs for the whole thing  i dont care if its only fotty cents and i must say mr bennam youre about the strangest viceconsul to want me to do it that i eva saw  the viceconsul laughed unresentfully well shall i send you a lawyer  no mrs lander retorted and after a moments reflection she added im goin to stay my month and so you may tell him and then ill see whetha he can make me pay for that breakage and the candles and suvvice im all wore out as it is and i aint fit to travel now and i dont know when i shall be clementina you can go and tell maddalena to stop packin or no ill do it  she left the room without further notice of the consul who said ruefully to clementina well ive missed my chance miss claxon but i guess shes done the wisest thing for herself  oh yes shes not fit to go she must stay now till its coola will you tell the landlod or shall  ill tell him said the viceconsul and he had in the landlord he received her message with the pleasure of a host whose cherished guests have consented to remain a while longer and in the rush of his good feeling he offered if the charge for breakage seemed unjust to the viceconsul to abate it and since the signora had not understood that she was to pay extra for the other things he would allow the viceconsul to adjust the differences between them it was a trifle and he wished above all things to content the signora for whom he professed a cordial esteem both on his own part and the part of all his family  then that lets me out for the present said the viceconsul when clementina repeated mrs landers acquiescence in the landlords proposals and he took his straw hat and called a gondola from the nearest traghetto and bargained at an expense consistent with his salary to have himself rowed back to his own gardengate  the rest of the day was an era of better feeling between mrs lander and her host than they had ever known and at dinner he brought in with his own hand a dish which he said he had caused to be specially made for her it was so tempting in odor and complexion that mrs lander declared she must taste it though as she justly said she had eaten too much already when it had once tasted it she ate it all against clementinas protestations she announced at the end that every bite had done her good and that she never felt better in her life she passed a happy evening with renewed faith in the air of the lagoon her sole regret now was that mr lander had not lived to try it with her for if he had she was sure he would have been alive at that moment  she allowed herself to be got to bed rather earlier than usual before clementina dropped asleep she heard her breathing with long easy quiet respirations and she lost the fear of the landlords dish which had haunted her through the evening she was awakened in the morning by a touch on her shoulder maddalena hung over her with a frightened face and implored her to come and look at the signora who seemed not at all well clementina ran into her room and found her dead she must have died some hours before without a struggle for the face was that of sleep and it had a dignity and beauty which it had not worn in her life of selfindulgent wilfulness for so many years that the girl had never seen it look so before     xxxiv  the viceconsul was not sure how far his powers went in the situation with which mrs lander had finally embarrassed him but he met the new difficulties with patience and he agreed with clementina that they ought to see if mrs lander had left any written expression of her wishes concerning the event she had never spoken of such a chance but had always looked forward to getting well and going home so far as the girl knew and the most careful search now brought to light nothing that bore upon it in the absence of instructions to the contrary they did what they must and the body emptied of its life of senseless worry and greedy care was laid to rest in the island cemetery of venice  when all was over the viceconsul ventured an observation which he had hitherto delicately withheld the question of mrs landers kindred had already been discussed between him and clementina and he now felt that another question had duly presented itself you didnt notice he suggested anything like a will when we went over the papers he had looked carefully for it expecting that there might have been some expression of mrs landers wishes in it because he added i happen to know that mr milray drew one up for her i witnessed it  no said clementina i didnt see anything of it she told me she had made a will but she didnt quite like it and sometimes she thought she would change it she spoke of getting you to do it i didnt know but she had  the viceconsul shook his head no and these relations of her husbands up in michigan you dont know where they live exactly  no she neva told me she wouldnt she didnt like to talk about them i dont even know their names  the viceconsul thoughtfully scratched a corner of his chin through his beard if there isnt any will theyre the heirs i used to be a sort of wildcat lawyer and i know that much law  yes said clementina she left them five thousand dollas apiece she said she wished she had made it ten  i guess shes made it a good deal more if shes made it anything miss claxon dont you understand that if no will turns up they come in for all her money  well thats what i thought they ought to do said clementina  and do you understand that if thats so you dont come in for anything you must excuse me for mentioning it but she has told everybody that you were to have it and if there is no will  he stopped and bent an eye of lacklustre compassion on the girl who replied oh yes i know that its what i always told her to do i didnt want it  you didnt want it  no  well the viceconsul stared at her but he forbore the comment that her indifference inspired he said after a pause then what weve got to do is to advertise for the michigan relations and let em take any action they want to  thats the only thing we could do i presume  this gave the viceconsul another pause at the end of it he got to his feet is there anything i can do for you miss claxon  she went to her portfolio and produced mrs landers letter of credit it had been made out for three thousand pounds in clementinas name as well as her own but she had lived wastefully since she had come abroad and little money remained to be taken up with the letter clementina handed the viceconsul the roll of italian and austrian banknotes which she had drawn when mrs lander decided to leave venice they were to the amount of several thousand lire and golden she offered them with the insensibility to the quality of money which so many women have and which is always so astonishing to men what must i do with these she asked  why keep them returned the viceconsul on the spur of his surprise  i dont know as i should have any right to said clementina they were hers  why butthe viceconsul began his protest but he could not end it logically and he did not end it at all he insisted with clementina that she had a right to some money which mrs lander had given her during her life he took charge of the banknotes in the interest of the possible heirs and gave her his receipt for them in the meantime he felt that he ought to ask her what she expected to do  i think she said i will stay in venice awhile  the viceconsul suppressed any surprise he might have felt at a decision given with mystifying cheerfulness he answered well that was right and for the second time he asked her if there was anything he could do for her  why yes she returned i should like to stay on in the house here if you could speak for me to the padrone  i dont see why you shouldnt if we can make the padrone understand its different  you mean about the price the viceconsul nodded thats what i want you should speak to him about mr bennam if you would tell him that i havent got but a little money now and he would have to make it very reasonable that is if you think it would be right for me to stay afta the way he tried to treat mrs lander  the viceconsul gave the point some thought and decided that the attempted extortion need not make any difference with clementina if she could get the right terms he said he did not believe the padrone was a bad fellow but he liked to take advantage of a stranger when he could we all did when he came to talk with him he found him a man of heart if not of conscience he entered into the case with the prompt intelligence and vivid sympathy of his race and he made it easy for clementina to stay till she had heard from her friends in america for himself and for his wife he professed that she could not stay too long and they proposed that if it would content the signorina still further they would employ maddalena as chambermaid till she wished to return to florence she had offered to remain if the signorina stayed  then that is settled said clementina with a sigh of relief and she thanked the viceconsul for his offer to write to the milrays for her and said that she would rather write herself  she meant to write as soon as she heard from mr hinkle which could not be long now for then she could be independent of the offers of help which she dreaded from miss milray even more than from mrs milray it would be harder to refuse them and she entered upon a passage of her life which a nature less simple would have found much more trying but she had the power of taking everything as if it were as much to be expected as anything else if nothing at all happened she accepted the situation with implicit resignation and with a gayety of heart which availed her long and never wholly left her  while the suspense lasted she could not write home as frankly as before and she sent off letters to middlemount which treated of her delay in venice with helpless reticence they would have set another sort of household intolerably wondering and suspecting but she had the comfort of knowing that her father would probably settle the whole matter by saying that she would tell what she meant when she got round to it and apart from this she had mainly the comfort of the viceconsuls society he had little to do besides looking after her and he employed himself about this in daily visits which the padrone and his wife regarded as official and promoted with a serious respect for the viceconsular dignity if the visits ended as they often did in a turn on the grand canal and an ice in the piazza they appealed to the imagination of more sophisticated witnesses who decided that the young american girl had inherited the millions of the sick lady and become the betrothed of the viceconsul and that they were thus passing the days of their engagement in conformity to the american custom however much at variance with that of other civilizations  this view of the affair was known to maddalena but not to clementina who in those days went back in many things to the tradition of her life at middlemount the viceconsul was of a tradition almost as simple and his longer experience set no very wide interval between them it quickly came to his telling her all about his dead wife and his married daughters and how after his home was broken up he thought he would travel a little and see what that would do for him he confessed that it had not done much he was always homesick and he was ready to go as soon as the president sent out a consul to take his job off his hands he said that he had not enjoyed himself so much since he came to venice as he was doing now and that he did not know what he should do if clementina first got her call home he betrayed no curiosity as to the peculiar circumstances of her stay but affected to regard it as something quite normal and he watched over her in every way with a fatherly as well as an official vigilance which never degenerated into the semblance of any other feeling clementina rested in his care in entire security the world had quite fallen from her or so much of it as she had seen at florence and in her indifference she lapsed into life as it was in the time before that with a tender renewal of her allegiance to it there was nothing in the conversation of the viceconsul to distract her from this and she said and did the things at venice that she used to do at middlemount as nearly as she could to make the days of waiting pass more quickly she tried to serve herself in ways that scandalized the proud affection of maddalena it was not fit for the signorina to make her bed or sweep her room she might sew and knit if she would but these other things were for servants like herself she continued in the faith of clementinas gentility and saw her always as she had seen her first in the brief hour of her social splendor in florence clementina tried to make her understand how she lived at middlemount but she only brought before maddalena the humiliating image of a contadina which she rejected not only in clementinas behalf but that of miss milray she told her that she was laughing at her and she was fixed in her belief when the girl laughed at that notion her poverty she easily conceived of plenty of signorine in italy were poor and she protected her in it with the duty she did not divide quite evenly between her and the padrone  the date which clementina had fixed for hearing from hinkle by cable had long passed and the time when she first hoped to hear from him by letter had come and gone her address was with the viceconsul as mrs landers had been and he could not be ignorant of her disappointment when he brought her letters which she said were from home on the surface of things it could only be from home that she wished to hear but beneath the surface he read an anxiety which mounted with each gratification of this wish he had not seen much of the girl while hinkle was in venice mrs lander had not begun to make such constant use of him until hinkle had gone mrs milray had told him of clementinas earlier romance and it was to gregory that the viceconsul related the anxiety which he knew as little in its nature as in its object  clementina never doubted the good faith or constancy of her lover but her heart misgave her as to his wellbeing when it sank at each failure of the viceconsul to bring her a letter from him something must have happened to him and it must have been something very serious to keep him from writing or there was some mistake of the postoffice the viceconsul indulged himself in personal inquiries to make sure that the mistake was not in the venetian postoffice but he saw that he brought her greater distress in ascertaining the fact he got to dreading a look of resolute cheerfulness that came into her face when he shook his head in sign that there were no letters and he suffered from the covert eagerness with which she glanced at the superscriptions of those he brought and failed to find the hopedfor letter among them ordeal for ordeal he was beginning to regret his trials under mrs lander in them he could at least demand clementinas sympathy but against herself this was impossible once she noted his mute distress at hers and broke into a little laugh that he found very harrowing  i guess you hate it almost as much as i do mr bennam  i guess i do ive half a mind to write the letter you want myself  ive half a mind to let youor the letter id like to write  it had come to her thinking she would write again to hinkle but she could not bring herself to do it she often imagined doing it she had every word of such a letter in her mind and she dramatized every fact concerning it from the time she should put pen to paper to the time when she should get back the answer that cleared the mystery of his silence away the fond reveries helped her to bear her suspense they helped to make the days go by to ease the doubt with which she lay down at night and the heartsick hope with which she rose up in the morning  one day at the hour of his wonted visit she say the viceconsul from her balcony coming as it seemed to her with another figure in his gondola and a thousand conjectures whirled through her mind and then centred upon one idea after the first glance she kept her eyes down and would not look again while she told herself incessantly that it could not be and that she was a fool and a goose and a perfect coot to think of such a thing for a single moment when she allowed herself or forced herself to look a second time as the boat drew near she had to cling to the balcony parapet for support in her disappointment  the person whom the viceconsul helped out of the gondola was an elderly man like himself and she took a last refuge in the chance that he might be hinkles father sent to bring her to him because he could not come to her or to soften some terrible news to her then her fancy fluttered and fell and she waited patiently for the fact to reveal itself there was something countrified in the figure of the man and something clerical in his face though there was nothing in his uncouth best clothes that confirmed this impression in both face and figure there was a vague resemblance to some one she had seen before when the viceconsul said  miss claxon i want to introduce the rev mr james b orson of michigan mr orson took clementinas hand into a dry rough grasp while he peered into her face with small shy eyes the viceconsul added with a kind of official formality mr orson is the halfnephew of mr lander and then clementina now knew whom it was that he resembled he has come to venice continued the viceconsul at the request of mrs lander and he did not know of her death until i informed him of the fact i should have said that mr orson is the son of mr landers halfsister he can tell you the balance himself the viceconsul pronounced the concluding word with a certain distaste and the effect of gladly retiring into the background  wont you sit down said clementina and she added with one of the remnants of her middlemount breeding wont you let me take your hat  mr orson in trying to comply with both her invitations knocked his well worn silk hat from the hand that held it and sent it rolling across the room where clementina pursued it and put it on the table  i may as well say at once he began in a flat irresonant voice that i am the representative of mrs landers heirs and that i have a letter from her enclosing her last will and testament which i have shown to the consul here  viceconsul the dignitary interrupted with an effect of rejecting any part in the affair  viceconsul i should sayand i wish to lay them both before you in order that  oh that is all right said clementina sweetly im glad there is a will i was afraid there wasnt any at all mr bennam and i looked for it everywhee she smiled upon the rev mr orson who silently handed her a paper it was the will which milray had written for mrs lander and which with whatever crazy motive she had sent to her husbands kindred it provided that each of them should be given five thousand dollars out of the estate and that then all should go to clementina it was the will mrs lander told her she had made but she had never seen the paper before and the legal forms hid the meaning from her so that she was glad to have the viceconsul make it clear then she said tranquilly yes that is the way i supposed it was  mr orson by no means shared her calm he did not lift his voice but on the level it had taken it became agitated mrs lander gave me the address of her lawyer in boston when she sent me the will and i made a point of calling on him when i went east to sail i dont know why she wished me to come out to her but being sick i presume she naturally wished to see some of her own family  he looked at clementina as if he thought she might dispute this but she consented at her sweetest oh yes indeed and he went on  i found her affairs in a very different condition from what she seemed to think the estate was mostly in securities which had not been properly looked after and they had depreciated until they were some of them not worth the paper they were printed on the house in boston is mortgaged up to its full value i should say and i should say that mrs lander did not know where she stood she seemed to think that she was a very rich woman but she lived high and her lawyer said he never could make her understand how the money was going mr lander seemed to lose his grip the year he died and engaged in some very unfortunate speculations i dont know whether he told her i might enter into details  oh that is not necessary said clementina politely witless of the disastrous quality of the facts which mr orson was imparting  but the sum and substance of it all is that there will not be more than enough to pay the bequests to her own family if there is that  clementina looked with smiling innocence at the viceconsul  that is to say he explained there wont be anything at all for you miss claxon  well thats what i always told mrs lander i ratha when she brought it up i told her she ought to give it to his family said clementina with a satisfaction in the event which the viceconsul seemed unable to share for he remained gloomily silent there is that last money i drew on the letter of credit you can give that to mr orson  i have told him about that money said the viceconsul dryly it will be handed over to him when the estate is settled if there isnt enough to pay the bequests without it  and the money which mrs landa gave me before that she pursued eagerly mr orson had the effect of pricking up his ears though it was in fact merely a gleam of light that came into his eyes  thats yours said the viceconsul sourly almost savagely she didnt give it to you without she wanted you to have it and she didnt expect you to pay her bequests with it in my opinion he burst out in a wrathful recollection of his own sufferings from mrs lander she didnt give you a millionth part of your due for all the trouble she made you and i want mr orson to understand that right here  clementina turned her impartial gaze upon mr orson as if to verify the impression of this extreme opinion upon him he looked as if he neither accepted nor rejected it and she concluded the sentence which the viceconsul had interrupted because i ratha not keep it if there isnt enough without it  the viceconsul gave way to violence its none of your business whether theres enough or not what youve got to do is to keep what belongs to you and im going to see that you do thats what im here for if this assumption of official authority did not awe clementina at least it put a check upon her headlong selfsacrifice the viceconsul strengthened his hold upon her by asking what would you do i should like to know if you gave that up  oh i should get along she returned lightheartedly but upon questioning herself whether she should turn to miss milray for help or appeal to the viceconsul himself she was daunted a little and she added but just as you say mr bennam  i say keep what fairly belongs to you its only two or three hundred dollars at the outside he explained to mr orsons hungry eyes but perhaps the sum did not affect the country ministers imagination as trifling his yearly salary must sometimes have been little more  the whole interview left the viceconsul out of humor with both parties to the affair and as to clementina between the ideals of a perfect little saint and a perfect little simpleton he remained for the present unable to class her     xxxv  clementina and the viceconsul afterwards agreed that mrs lander must have sent the will to mr orson in one of those moments of suspicion when she distrusted everyone about her or in that trouble concerning her husbands kindred which had grown upon her more and more as a means of assuring them that they were provided for  but even then the viceconsul concluded i dont see why she wanted this man to come out here the only explanation is that she was a little off her base towards the last thats the charitable supposition  i dont think she was herself some of the time clementina assented in acceptance of the kindly construction  the viceconsul modified his good will toward mrs landers memory so far as to say well if shed been somebody else most of the time it would have been an improvement  the talk turned upon mr orson and what he would probably do the viceconsul had found him a cheap lodging at his request and he seemed to have settled down at venice either without the will or without the power to go home but the viceconsul did not know where he ate or what he did with himself except at the times when he came for letters once or twice when he looked him up he found him writing and then the minister explained that he had promised to correspond for an organ of his sect in the northwest but he owned that there was no money in it he was otherwise reticent and even furtive in his manner he did not seem to go much about the city but kept to his own room and if he was writing of venice it must have been chiefly from his acquaintance with the little court into which his windows looked he affected the viceconsul as forlorn and helpless and he pitied him and rather liked him as a fellowvictim of mrs lander  one morning mr orson came to see clementina and after a brief passage of opinion upon the weather he fell into an embarrassed silence from which he pulled himself at last with a visible effort i hardly know how to lay before you what i have to say miss claxon he began and i must ask you to put the best construction upon it i have never been reduced to a similar distress before you would naturally think that i would turn to the viceconsul on such an occasion but i feel through our relation to theto mrs landerahsomewhat more at home with you  he stopped as if he wished to be asked his business and she entreated him why what is it mr osson is there something i can do there isnt anything i wouldnt  a gleam watery and faint which still could not be quite winked away came into his small eyes why the fact is could youahadvance me about five dollars  why mr orson she began and he seemed to think she wished to withdraw her offer of help for he interposed  i will repay it as soon as i get an expected remittance from home i came out on the invitation of mrs lander and as her guest and i supposed  oh dont say a wod cried clementina but now that he had begun he was powerless to stop  i would not ask but my landlady has pressed me for her renti suppose she needs itand i have been reduced to the last copper  the girl whose eyes the tears of self pity so rarely visited broke into a sob that seemed to surprise her visitor but she checked herself as with a quick inspiration have you been to breakfast  wellahnot this morning mr orson admitted as if to imply that having breakfasted some other morning might be supposed to serve the purpose  she left him and ran to the door maddalena maddalena she called and maddalena responded with a frightened voice from the direction of the kitchen  vengo subito  she hurried out with the coffeepot in her hand as if she had just taken it up when clementina called and she halted for the whispered colloquy between them which took place before she set it down on the table already laid for breakfast then she hurried out of the room again she came back with a cantaloupe and grapes and cold ham and put them before clementina and her guest who both ignored the hunger with which he swept everything before him when his famine had left nothing he said in decorous compliment  that is very good coffee i should think the genuine berry though i am told that they adulterate coffee a great deal in europe  do they asked clementina i didnt know it  she left him still sitting before the table and came back with some banknotes in her hand are you sure you hadnt betta take moa she asked  i think that five dollars will be all that i shall require he answered with dignity i should be unwilling to accept more i shall undoubtedly receive some remittances soon  oh i know you will clementina returned and she added i am waiting for lettas myself i dont think any one ought to give up  the preacher ignored the appeal which was in her tone rather than her words and went on to explain at length the circumstances of his having come to europe so unprovided against chances when he wished to excuse his imprudence she cried out oh dont say a wod its just like my own fatha and she told him some things of her home which apparently did not interest him very much he had a kind of dull cold selfabsorption in which he was indeed so little like her father that only her kindness for the lonely man could have justified her in thinking there was any resemblance  she did not see him again for a week and meantime she did not tell the viceconsul of what had happened but an anxiety for the minister began to mingle with her anxieties for herself she constantly wondered why she did not hear from her lover and she occasionally wondered whether mr orson were not falling into want again she had decided to betray his condition to the viceconsul when he came bringing the money she had lent him he had received a remittance from an unexpected source and he hoped she would excuse his delay in repaying her loan she wished not to take the money at least till he was quite sure he should not want it but he insisted  i have enough to keep me now till i hear from other sources with the means for returning home i see no object in continuing here under the circumstances  in the relief which she felt for him clementinas heart throbbed with a pain which was all for herself why should she wait any longer either for that instant she abandoned the hope which had kept her up so long a wave of homesickness overwhelmed her  i should like to go back too she said i dont see why im staying  mr osson why cant you let meshe was going to saygo home with you but she really said what was also in her heart why cant you let me give you the money to go home it is all mrs landas money anyway  there is certainly that view of the matter he assented with a promptness that might have suggested a lurking grudge for the viceconsuls decision that she ought to keep the money mrs lander had given her  but clementina urged unsuspiciously oh yes indeed and i shall feel better if you take it i only wish i could go home too  the minister was silent while he was revolving with whatever scruple or reluctance a compromise suitable to the occasion then he said why should we not return together  would you take me she entreated  that should be as you wished i am not much acquainted with the usages in such matters but i presume that it would be entirely practicable we could ask the viceconsul  yes  he must have had considerable experience in cases of the kind would your friends meet you in new york or  i dont know said clementina with a pang for the thought of a meeting she had sometimes fancied there when her lover had come out for her and her father had been told to come and receive them no she sighed thee wouldnt be time to let them know but it wouldnt make any difference i could get home from new yok alone she added listlessly her spirits had fallen again she saw that she could not leave venice till she had heard in some sort from the letter she had written perhaps it couldnt be done after all but i will see mr bennam about it mr osson and i know he will want you to have that much of the money he will be coming hee soon  he rose upon what he must have thought her hint and said i should not wish to have him swayed against his judgment  the viceconsul came not long after the minister had left her and she began upon what she wished to do for him  the viceconsul was against it i would rather lend him the money out of my own pocket how are you going to get along yourself if you let him have so much  she did not answer at once then she said hopelessly ive a great mind to go home with him i dont believe theres any use waiting here any longa the viceconsul could not say anything to this she added yes i believe i will go home we wee talking about it the other day and he is willing to let me go with him  i should think he would be the viceconsul retorted in his indignation for her did you offer to pay for his passage  yes she owned i did and again the viceconsul could say nothing if i went it wouldnt make any difference whether it took it all or not i should have plenty to get home from new york with  well the viceconsul assented dryly its for you to say  i know you dont want me to do it  well i shall miss you he answered evasively  and i shall miss you too mr bennam dont you believe it but if i dont take this chance to get home i dont know when i shall eva have anotha and there isnt any use waitingno there isnt  the viceconsul laughed at the sort of imperative despair in her tone how are you going which way i mean  they counted up clementinas debts and assets and they found that if she took the next steamer from genoa which was to sail in four days she would have enough to pay her own way and mr orsons to new york and still have some thirty dollars over for her expenses home to middlemount they allowed for a second cabinpassage which the viceconsul said was perfectly good on the genoa steamers he rather urged the gentility and comfort of the second cabinpassage but his reasons in favor of it were wasted upon clementinas indifference she wished to get home now and she did not care how she asked the viceconsul to see the minister for her and if he were ready and willing to telegraph for their tickets he transacted the business so promptly that he was able to tell her when he came in the evening that everything was in train he excused his coming he said that now she was going so soon he wanted to see all he could of her he offered no excuse when he came the next morning but he said he had got a letter for her and thought she might want to have it at once  he took it out of his hat and gave it to her it was addressed in hinkles writing her answer had come at last she stood trembling with it in her hand  the viceconsul smiled is that the one  yes she whispered back  all right he took his hat and set it on the back of his head before he left her without other salutation  then clementina opened her letter it was in a womans hand and the writer made haste to explain at the beginning that she was george w hinkles sister and that she was writing for him for though he was now out of danger he was still very weak and they had all been anxious about him a month before he had been hurt in a railroad collision and had come home from the west where the accident happened suffering mainly from shock as his doctor thought he had taken to his bed at once and had not risen from it since he had been out of his head a great part of the time and had been forbidden everything that could distress or excite him his sister said that she was writing for him now as soon as he had seen clementinas letter it had been forwarded from one address to another and had at last found him there at his home in ohio he wished to say that he would come out for clementina as soon as he was allowed to undertake the journey and in the meantime she must let him know constantly where she was the letter closed with a few words of love in his own handwriting  clementina rose from reading it and put on her hat in a bewildered impulse to go to him at once she knew in spite of all the cautions and reserves of the letter that he must still be very sick when she came out of her daze she found that she could only go to the viceconsul she put the letter in his hands to let it explain itself youll undastand now she said what shall i do  when he had read it he smiled and answered i guess i understood pretty well before though i wasnt posted on names well i suppose youll want to layout most of your capital on cables now  yes she laughed and then she suddenly lamented why didnt they telegraph  well i guess he hadnt the head for it said the viceconsul and the rest wouldnt think of it they wouldnt in the country  clementina laughed again in joyous recognition of the fact no my fatha wouldnt eitha  the viceconsul reached for his hat and he led the way to clementinas gondola at his garden gate in greater haste than she at the telegraph office he framed a dispatch which for expansive fullness and precision was apparently unexampled in the experience of the clerk who took it and spelt over its english with them it asked an answer in the viceconsuls care and ill tell you what miss claxon he said with a husky weakness in his voice i wish youd let this be my treat  she understood do you really mr bennam  i do indeed  well then i will she said but when he wished to include in his treat the dispatch she sent home to her father announcing her coming she would not let him  he looked at his watch as they rowed away its eight oclock here now and it will reach ohio about six hours earlier but you cant expect an answer tonight you know  noshe had expected it though he could see that  but whenever it comes ill bring it right round to you now its all going to be straight dont you be afraid and youre going home the quickest way you can get there ive been looking up the sailings and this genoa boat will get you to new york about as soon as any could from liverpool besides theres always a chance of missing connections and losing time between here and england i should stick to the genoa boat  oh i shall said clementina far less fidgetted than he she was in fact resting securely again in the faith which had never really deserted her and had only seemed for a little time to waver from her when her hope went now that she had telegraphed her heart was at peace and she even laughed as she answered the anxious viceconsul     xxxvi  the next morning clementina watched for the viceconsul from her balcony she knew he would not send she knew he would come but it was nearly noon before she saw him coming they caught sight of each other almost at the same moment and he stood up in his boat and waved something white in his hand which must be a dispatch for her  it acknowledged her telegram and reported george still improving his father would meet her steamer in new york it was very reassuring it was every thing hopeful but when she had read it she gave it to the viceconsul for encouragement  its all right miss claxon he said stoutly dont you be troubled about mr hinkles not coming to meet you himself he cant keep too quiet for a while yet  oh yes said clementina patiently  if you really want somebody to worry about you can help mr orson to worry about himself the viceconsul went on with the grimness he had formerly used in speaking of mrs lander hes sick or he thinks hes going to be he sent round for me this morning and i found him in bed you may have to go home alone but i guess hes more scared than hurt  her heart sank and then rose in revolt against the mere idea of delay i wonder if i ought to go and see him she said  well it would be a kindness returned the viceconsul with a promptness that unmasked the apprehension he felt for the sick man  he did not offer to go with her and she took maddalena she found the minister seated in his chair beside his bed a three days beard heightened the gauntness of his face he did not move when his padrona announced her  i am not any better he answered when she said that she was glad to see him up i am merely resting the bed is hard i regret to say he added with a sort of formal impersonality that i shall be unable to accompany you home miss claxon that is if you still think of taking the steamer this week  her whole being had set homeward in a tide that already seemed to drift the vessel from its moorings whatwhat do you mean she gasped  i didnt know he returned but that in view of the circumstancesall the circumstancesyou might be intending to defer your departure to some later steamer  no no no i must go now i couldnt wait a day an hour a minute after the first chance of going you dont know what you are saying he might die if i told him i was not coming and then what should i do this was what clementina said to herself but what she said to mr orson with an inspiration from her terror at his suggestion was dont you think a little chicken broth would do you good mr osson i dont believe but what it would  a wistful gleam came into the preachers eyes it might he admitted and then she knew what must be his malady she sent maddalena to a trattoria for the soup and she did not leave him even after she had seen its effect upon him it was not hard to persuade him that he had better come home with her and she had him there tucked away with his few poor belongings in the most comfortable room the padrone could imagine when the viceconsul came in the evening  he says he thinks he can go now she ended when she had told the viceconsul and i know he can it wasnt anything but poor living  it looks more like no living said the viceconsul why didnt the old fool let some one know that he was short of money he went on with a partial transfer of his contempt of the preacher to her i suppose if hed been sick instead of hungry youd have waited over till the next steamer for him  she cast down her eyes i dont know what youll think of me i should have been sorry for him and i should have wanted to stay she lifted her eyes and looked the viceconsul defiantly in the face but he hadnt the fust claim on me and i should have gonei couldnt have helped iti should have gone if he had been dying  well youve got more horsesense said the viceconsul than any ten men i ever saw and he testified his admiration of her by putting his arms round her where she stood before him and kissing her dont you mind he explained if my youngest girl had lived she would have been about your age  oh its all right mr bennam said clementina  when the time came for them to leave venice mr orson was even eager to go the viceconsul would have gone with them in contempt of the official responsibilities which he felt to be such a thankless burden but there was really no need of his going and he and clementina treated the question with the matteroffact impartiality which they liked in each other he saw her off at the station where maddalena had come to take the train for florence in token of her devotion to the signorina whom she would not outstay in venice she wept long and loud upon clementinas neck so that even clementina was once moved to put her handkerchief to her tearless eyes  at the last moment she had a question which she referred to the vice consul should you tell him she asked  tell who what he retorted  mr ossonthat i wouldnt have stayed for him  do you think it would make you feel any better asked the consul upon reflection  i believe he ought to know  well then i guess i should do it  the time did not come for her confession till they had nearly reached the end of their voyage it followed upon something like a confession from the minister himself which he made the day he struggled on deck with her help after spending a week in his berth  here is something he said which appears to be for you miss claxon i found it among some letters for mrs lander which mr bennam gave me after my arrival and i only observed the address in looking over the papers in my valise this morning he handed her a telegram i trust that it is nothing requiring immediate attention  clementina read it at a glance no she answered and for a while she could not say anything more it was a cable message which hinkles sister must have sent her after writing no evil had come of its failure to reach her and she recalled without bitterness the suffering which would have been spared her if she had got it before it was when she thought of the suffering of her lover from the silence which must have made him doubt her that she could not speak as soon as she governed herself against her first resentment she said with a little sigh it is all right now mr osson and her stress upon the word seemed to trouble him with no misgiving besides if youre to blame for not noticing so is mr bennam and i dont want to blame any one she hesitated a moment before she added i have got to tell you something now because i think you ought to know it i am going home to be married mr osson and this message is from the gentleman i am going to be married to he has been very sick and i dont know yet as hell be able to meet me in new yok but his fatha will  mr orson showed no interest in these facts beyond a silent attention to her words which might have passed for an open indifference at his time of life all such questions which are of permanent importance to women affect men hardly more than the angels who neither marry nor are given in marriage besides as a minister he must have had a surfeit of all possible qualities in the love affairs of people intending matrimony as a casuist he was more reasonably concerned in the next fact which clementina laid before him  and the otha day there in venice when you wee sick and you seemed to think that i might put off stahting home till the next steamer i dont know but i let you believe i would  i supposed that the delay of a week or two could make no material difference to you  but now you see that it would and i feel as if i ought to tell youi spoke to mr bennam about it and he didnt tell me not tothat i shouldnt have staid no not for anything in the wold i had to do what i did at the time but eva since it has seemed as if i had deceived you and i dont want to have it seem so any longer it isnt because i dont hate to tell you i do but i guess if it was to happen over again i couldnt feel any different do you want i should tell the deckstewahd to bring you some beeftea  i think i could relish a small portion said mr orson cautiously and he said nothing more  clementina left him with her nerves in a flutter and she did not come back to him until she decided that it was time to help him down to his cabin he suffered her to do this in silence but at the door he cleared his throat and began  i have reflected upon what you told me and i have tried to regard the case from all points i believe that i have done so without personal feeling and i think it my duty to say fully and freely that i believe you would have done perfectly right not to remain  yes said clementina i thought you would think so  they parted emotionlessly to all outward effect and when they met again it was without a sign of having passed through a crisis of sentiment neither referred to the matter again but from that time the minister treated clementina with a deference not without some shadows of tenderness such as her helplessness in venice had apparently never inspired she had cast out of her mind all lingering hardness toward him in telling him the hard truth and she met his faint relentings with a grateful gladness which showed itself in her constant care of him  this helped her a little to forget the strain of the anxiety that increased upon her as the time shortened between the last news of her lover and the next and there was perhaps no more exaggeration in the import than in the terms of the formal acknowledgment which mr orson made her as their steamer sighted fire island light and they both knew that their voyage had ended i may not be able to say to you in the hurry of our arrival in new york that i am obliged to you for a good many little attentions which i should be pleased to reciprocate if opportunity offered i do not think i am going too far in saying that they are such as a daughter might offer a parent  oh dont speak of it mr osson she protested i havent done anything that any one wouldnt have done  i presume said the minister thoughtfully as if retiring from an extreme position that they are such as others similarly circumstanced might have done but it will always be a source of satisfaction for you to reflect that you have not neglected them     xxxvii  in the crowd which thronged the steamers dock at hoboken clementina strained her eyes to make out some one who looked enough like her lover to be his father and she began to be afraid that they might miss each other when she failed she walked slowly down the gangway with the people that thronged it glad to be hidden by them from her failure but at the last step she was caught aside by a small blackeyed blackhaired woman who called out isnt this miss claxon im georrges sisterr oh yourre just like what he said i knew it i knew it and then hugged her and kissed her and passed her to the little lean dark old man next her this is fatherr i knew you couldnt tell us because i take afterr him and georrge is exactly like motherr  georges father took her hand timidly but found courage to say to his daughter hadnt you betterr let her own fatherr have a chance at herr and amidst a tempest of apologies and self blame from the sister claxon showed himself over the shoulders of the little man  why there want no hurry as long as shes hea he said in prompt enjoyment of the joke and he and clementina sparely kissed each other  why fatha she said i didnt expect you to come to new yok to meet me  well i didnt hadly expect it myself but id neva been to yok and i thought i might as well come things ah ratha slack at home just now anyway  she did not heed his explanation wee you scaed when you got my dispatch  no we kind of expected youd come any time the way you wrote afta mrs landa died we thought something must be up  yes she said absently then whees motha she asked  well i guess she thought she couldnt get round to it exactly said the father shes all right neednt ask you  no im fustrate clementina returned with a silent joy in her fathers face and voice she went back in it to the girl of a year ago and the world which had come between them since their parting rolled away as if it had never been there  neither of them said anything about that she named over her brothers and sisters and he answered yes yes in assurance of their wellbeing and then he explained as if that were the only point of real interest i see your folks waitin hee fo somebody and i thought id see if it want the same one and we kind of struck up an acquaintance on your account befoe you got hee clem  your folks she silently repeated to herself yes they ah mine and she stood trying to realize the strange fact while georges sister poured out a voluminous comment upon claxons spare statement and georges father admired her volubility with the shut smile of toothless age she spoke with the burr which the scotchirish settlers have imparted to the whole middle west but it was music to clementina who heard now and then a tone of her lover in his sisters voice in the midst of it all she caught sight of a mute unfriended figure just without their circle his traveling shawl hanging loose upon his shoulders and the valise which had formed his sole baggage in the voyage to and from europe pulling his long hand out of his coat sleeve  oh yes she said here is mr osson that came ova with me fatha hes a relation of mr landas and she presented him to them all  he shifted his valise to the left hand and shook hands with each asking what name and then fell motionless again  well said her father i guess this is the end of this paht of the ceremony and im goin to see your baggage through the customhouse clementina ive read about it and i want to know how its done i want to see what you ah tryin to smuggle in  i guess you wont find much she said but youll want the keys wont you she called to him as he was stalking away  well i guess that would be a good idea want to help miss hinkle  i guess we might as well all help said clementina and mr orson included himself in the invitation he seemed unable to separate himself from them though the passage of clementinas baggage through the customs and its delivery to an expressman for the hotel where the hinkles said they were staying might well have severed the last tie between them  ah you going straight home mr osson she asked to rescue him from the forgetfulness into which they were all letting him fall  i think i will remain over a day he answered i may go on to boston before starting west  well thats right said clementinas father with the wish to approve everything native to him and an instinctive sense of clementinas wish to befriend the minister betta come to oua hotel were all goin to the same one  i presume it is a good one mr orson assented  well said claxon you must make miss hinkle hea stand it if it aint shes got me to go to it  mr orson apparently could not enter into the joke but he accompanied the party which again began to forget him across the ferry and up the elevated road to the street car that formed the last stage of their progress to the hotel at this point georges sister fell silent and clementinas father burst out look hea i guess we betty not keep this up any tonga i dont believe much in surprises and i guess she betta know it now  he looked at georges sister as if for authority to speak further and clementina looked at her too while georges father nervously moistened his smiling lips with the tip of his tongue and let his twinkling eyes rest upon clementinas face  is he at the hotel she asked  yes said his sister monosyllabic for once  i knew it said clementina and she was only half aware of the fullness with which his sister now explained how he wanted to come so much that the doctor thought he had better but that they had made him promise he would not try to meet her at the steamer lest it should be too great a trial of his strength  yes clementina assented when the story came to an end and was beginning over again  she had an inexplicable moment when she stood before her lover in the room where they left her to meet him alone she faltered and he waited constrained by her constraint  is it all a mistake clementina he asked with a piteous smile  no no  am i so much changed  no you are looking better than i expected  and you are not sorryfor anything  no i amperhaps i have thought of you too much it seems so strange  i understand he answered we have been like spirits to each other and now we find that we are alive and on the earth like other people and we are not used to it  it must be something like that  but if its something elseif you have the least regretif you would ratherhe stopped and they remained looking at each other a moment then she turned her head and glanced out of the window as if something there had caught her sight  its a very pleasant view isnt it she said and she lifted her hands to her head and took off her hat with an effect of having got home after absence to stay     xxxviii  it was possibly through some sense finer than any cognition that clementina felt in meeting her lover that she had taken up a new burden rather than laid down an old one afterwards when they once recurred to that meeting and she tried to explain for him the hesitation which she had not been able to hide she could only say i presume i didnt want to begin unless i was sure i could carry out it would have been silly  her confession if it was a confession was made when one of his returns to health or rather one of the arrests of his unhealth flushed them with hope and courage but before that first meeting was ended she knew that he had overtasked his strength in coming to new york and he must not try it further fatha she said to claxon with the authority of a woman doing her duty im not going to let geoge go up to middlemount with all the excitement it will be as much as he can do to get home you can tell mother about it and the rest i did suppose it would be mr richling that would marry us and i always wanted him to but i guess somebody else can do it as well  just as you say clem her father assented why not brother osson hea he suggested with a pleasure in the joke whatever it was that the ministers relation to clementina involved i guess he can put off his visit to boston long enough  well i was thinking of him said clementina will you ask him  yes ill get round to it in the mohning  nonow right away ive been talking with geoge about it and thees no sense in putting it off i ought to begin taking care of him at once  well i guess when i tell your motha how youre layin hold she wont think its the same pusson said her father proudly  but it is i havent changed a bit  you hant changed for the wohse anyway  didnt i always try to do what i had to  i guess you did clem  well then  mr orson after a decent hesitation consented to perform the ceremony it took place in a parlor of the hotel according to the law of new york which facilitates marriage so greatly in all respects that it is strange any one in the state should remain single he had then a luxury of choice between attaching himself to the bridal couple as far as ohio on his journey home to michigan or to claxon who was going to take the boat for boston the next day on his way to middlemount he decided for claxon since he could then see mrs landers lawyer at once and arrange with him for getting out of the viceconsuls hands the money which he was holding for an authoritative demand he accepted without open reproach the handsome fee which the elder hinkle gave him for his services and even went so far as to say if your son should ever be blest with a return to health he has got a helpmeet such as there are very few of he then admonished the young couple in whatever trials life should have in store for them to be resigned and always to be prepared for the worst when he came later to take leave of them he was apparently not equal to the task of fitly acknowledging the return which hinkle made him of all the money remaining to clementina out of the sum last given her by mrs lander but he hid any disappointment he might have suffered and with a brief thank you put it in his pocket  hinkle told clementina of the apathetic behavior of mr orson he added with a laugh like his old self its the best that he doesnt seem prepared for  yes she assented he wasnt very cheeful but i presume that he meant well it must be a trial for him to find out that mrs landa wasnt rich after all  it was apparently never a trial to her she went to ohio with her husband and took up her life on the farm where it was wisely judged that he had the best chance of working out of the wreck of his health and strength there was often the promise and always the hope of this and their love knew no doubt of the future her sistersinlaw delighted in all her strangeness and difference while they petted her as something not to be separated from him in their petting of their brother to his mother she was the darling which her youngest had never ceased to be clementina once went so far as to say to him that if she was ever anything she would like to be a moravian  the question of religion was always related in their minds to the question of gregory to whom they did justice in their trust of each other it was hinkle himself who reasoned out that if gregory was narrow his narrowness was of his conscience and not of his heart or his mind she respected the memory of her first lover but it was as if he were dead now as well as her young dream of him and she read with a curious sense of remoteness a paragraph which her husband found in the religious intelligence of his sunday paper announcing the marriage of the rev frank gregory to a lady described as having been a frequent and bountiful contributor to the foreign missions she was apparently a widow and they conjectured that she was older than he his departure for his chosen field of missionary labor in china formed part of the news communicated by the rather exulting paragraph  well that is all right said clementinas husband he is a good man and he is where he can do nothing but good i am glad i neednt feel sorry for him any more  clementinas father must have given such a report of hinkle and his family that they felt easy at home in leaving her to the lot she had chosen when claxon parted from her he talked of coming out with her mother to see her that fall but it was more than a year before they got round to it they did not come till after the birth of her little girl and her father then humorously allowed that perhaps they would not have got round to it at all if something of the kind had not happened the hinkles and her father and mother liked one another so much that in the first glow of his enthusiasm claxon talked of settling down in ohio and the older hinkle drove him about to look at some places that were for sale but it ended in his saying one day that he missed the hills and he did not believe that he would know enough to come in when it rained if he did not see old middlemount with his nightcap on first his wife and he started home with the impatience of their years rather earlier than they had meant to go and they were silent for a little while after they left the flagstation where hinkle and clementina had put them aboard their train  well said claxon at last  well echoed his wife and then she did not speak for a little while longer at last she asked  dhe look that way when you fust see him in new yok  claxon gave his honesty time to get the better of his optimism even then he answered evasively he doos look pootty slim  the way i cypher it out said his wife he no business to let her marry him if he want goin to get well it was throwin of herself away as you may say  i dont know about that said claxon as if the point had occurred to him too and had been already argued in his mind i guess they must a had it out there in new york before they got marriedor she had i dont believe but what he expected to get well right away its the kind of a thing that lingas along and lingas along as fah foth as clem went i guess there want any let about it i guess shed made up her mind from the staht and she was goin to have him if she had to hold him on his feet to do it look hea w hat would you done  oh i presume were all fools said mrs claxon impatient of a sex not always so frank with itself but that dont excuse him  i dont say it doos her husband admitted but i presume he was expectin to get well right away then and i dont believe he added energetically but what he will yet as i undastand there aint anything ogganic about him its just this hee nuvvous prostration resultin from shock his docta tells me and hell wok out of that all right  they said no more and mrs claxon did not recur to any phase of the situation till she undid the lunch which the hinkles had put up for them and laid out on the napkin in her lap the portions of cold ham and cold chicken the buttered biscuit and the little pot of applebutter with the large bottle of cold coffee then she sighed they live well  yes said her husband glad of any concession and they ah good folks and clems as happy as a bud with em you can see that  oh she was always happy enough if thats all you want i presume she was happy with that hectorin old thing that fooled her out of her money  i hant ever regretted that money rebecca said claxon stiffly almost sternly and i guess you ant eitha  i dont say i have retorted mrs claxon but i dont like to be made a fool of i presume she added remotely but not so irrelevantly clem could ha got most anybody ova thea  well said claxon taking refuge in the joke i shouldnt want her to marry a crowned head myself  it was clementina who drove the claybank colt away from the station after the train had passed out of sight her husband sat beside her and let her take the reins from his nerveless grasp and when they got into the shelter of the piece of woods that the road passed through he put up his hands to his face and broke into sobs she allowed him to weep on though she kept saying geoge geoge softly and stroking his knee with the hand next him when his sobbing stopped she said i guess theyve had a pleasant visit but im glad wea together again he took up her hand and kissed the back of it and then clutched it hard but did not speak its strange she went on how i used to be homesick for father and mothashe had sometimes lost her yankee accent in her association with his people and spoke with their western burr but she found it in moments of deeper feelingwhen i was there in europe and now im glad to have them go i dont want anybody to be between us and i want to go back to just the way we wee befoe they came its been a strain on you and now you must throw it all off and rest and get up your strength one thing i could see that fatha noticed the gain you had made since he saw you in new yok he spoke about it to me the fust thing and he feels just the way i do about it he dont want you to hurry and get well but take it slowly and not excite yourself he believes in your gleaner and he knows all about machinery he says the patent makes it puffectly safe and you can take your own time about pushing it its sua to go and motha liked you shes not one to talk a great dealshe always leaves that to father and mebut shes got deep feelings and she just worshipped the baby i neva saw her take a child in her ahms before but she seemed to want to hold the baby all the time she stopped and then added tenderly now i know what you ah thinking about geoge and i dont want you to think about it any more if you do i shall give up  they had come to a bad piece of road where a slough of thick mud forced the wagonway over the stumps of a turnout in the woods you had better let me have the reins clementina he said he drove home over the yellow leaves of the hickories and the crimson leaves of the maples that heavy with the morning dew fell slanting through the still air and on the way he began to sing his singing made her heart ache his father came out to put up the colt for him and hinkle would not have his help  he unhitched the colt himself while his father trembled by with bent knees he clapped the colt on the haunch and started him through the pasturebars with a gay shout and then put his arm round clementinas waist and walked her into the kitchen amidst the grins of his mother and sisters who said he ought to be ashamed  the winter passed and in the spring he was not so well as he had been in the fall it was the outdoor life which was best for him and he picked up again in the summer when another autumn came it was thought best for him not to risk the confinement of another winter in the north the prolongation of the summer in the south would complete his cure and clementina took her baby and went with him to florida he was very well there and courageous letters came to middlemount and ohio boasting of the gains he had made one day toward spring he came in languid from the damp unnatural heat and the next day he had a fever which the doctor would not in a resort absolutely free from malaria pronounce malarial after it had once declared itself in compliance with this reluctance a simple fever hinkle was delirious and he never knew clementina again for the mother of his child they were once more at venice in his ravings and he was reasoning with her that belsky was not drowned  the mystery of his malady deepened into the mystery of his death with that his look of health and youth came back and as she gazed upon his gentle face it wore to her the smile of quaint sweetness that she had seen it wear the first night it won her fancy at miss milrays horse in florence     xxxix  six years after miss milray parted with clementina in venice she found herself towards the close of the summer at middlemount she had definitely ceased to live in florence where she had meant to die and had come home to close her eyes she was in no haste to do this and in the meantime she was now at middlemount with her brother who had expressed a wish to revisit the place in memory of mrs milray it was the second anniversary of her divorce which had remained after a married life of many vicissitudes almost the only experience untried in that relation and which had been happily accomplished in the courts of dacotah upon grounds that satisfied the facile justice of that state milray had dealt handsomely with his widow as he unresentfully called her and the money he assigned her was of a destiny perhaps as honored as its origin she employed it in the negotiation of a second marriage in which she redressed the balance of her first by taking a husband somewhat younger than herself  both milray and his sister had a wish which was much more than a curiosity to know what had become of clementina they had heard that her husband was dead and that she had come back to middlemount and miss milray was going to the office the afternoon following their arrival to ask the landlord about her when she was arrested at the door of the ballroom by a sight that she thought very pretty at the bottom of the room clearly defined against the long windows behind her stood the figure of a lady in the middle of the floor in rows on either side sat little girls and little boys who left their places one after another and turned at the door to make their manners to her in response to each obeisance the lady dropped a curtsey now to this side now to that taking her skirt between her finger tips on either hand and spreading it delicately with a certain elegance of movement and a grace that was full of poetry and to miss milray somehow full of pathos there remained to the end a small mite of a girl who was the last to leave her place and bow to the lady she did not quit the room then like the others but advanced toward the lady who came to meet her and lifted her and clasped her to her breast with a kind of passion she walked down toward the door where miss milray stood gently drifting over the polished floor as if still moved by the music that had ceased and as she drew near miss milray gave a cry of joy and ran upon her why clementina she screamed and caught her and the child both in her arms  she began to weep but clementina smiled instead of weeping as she always used to do she returned miss milrays affectionate greeting with a tenderness as great as her own but with a sort of authority such as sometimes comes to those who have suffered she quieted the older woman with her own serenity and met the torrent of her questions with as many answers as their rush permitted when they were both presently in miss milrays room talking in their old way from time to time miss milray broke from the talk to kiss the little girl whom she declared to be clementina all over again and then returned to her better behavior with an effect of shame for her want of selfcontrol as if clementinas mood had abashed her sometimes this was almost severe in its quiet that was her mother coming to her share in her but again she was like her father full of the sunny gayety of selfforgetfulness and then miss milray said now you are the old clementina  upon the whole she listened with few interruptions to the story which she exacted it was mainly what we know after her husbands death clementina had gone back to his family for a time and each year since she had spent part of the winter with them but it was very lonesome for her and she began to be homesick for middlemount they saw it and considered it they ah the best people miss milray she said and her voice which was firm when she spoke of her husband broke in the words of minor feeling besides being a little homesick she ended she was not willing to live on there doing nothing for herself and so she had come back  and you are here doing just what you planned when you talked your life over with me in venice  yes but life isnt eva just what we plan it to be miss milray  ah dont i know it  clementina surprised miss milray by adding in a great many thingsi dont know but in mostits better i dont complain of mine  you poor child you never complained of anythingnot even of mrs lander  but its different from what i expected and itsstrange  yes life is very strange  i dont meanlosing him that had to be i can see now that it had to be almost from the beginning it seems to me that i knew it had to be from the fust minute i saw him in new yok but he didnt and i am glad of that except when he was getting wohse he always believed he should get well and he was getting well when he  miss milray did not violate the pause she made with any question though it was apparent that clementina had something on her mind that she wished to say and could hardly say of herself  she began again i was glad through everything that i could live with him so long if there is nothing moa here or anywhea that was something but it is strange sometimes it doesnt seem as if it had happened  i think i can understand clementina  i feel sometimes as if i hadnt happened myself she stopped with a patient little sigh and passed her hand across the childs forehead in a mothers fashion and smoothed her hair from it bending over to look down into her face we think she has her fathas eyes she said  yes she has miss milray assented noting the upward slant of the childs eyes which gave his quaintness to her beauty he had fascinating eyes  after a moment clementina asked do you believe that the looks are all that ah left  miss milray reflected i know what you mean i should say character was left and personalitysomewhere  i used to feel as if it wee left here at fustas if he must come back but that had to go  yes  everything seems to go after a while even the loss of him seemed to go  yes losses go with the rest  thats what i mean by its seeming as if it never any of it happened some things before it are a great deal more real  little things  not exactly but things when i was very young miss milray did not know quite what she intended but she knew that clementina was feeling her way to something she wanted to say and she let her alone when it was all over and i knew that as long as i lived he would be somewhere else i tried to be paht of the wold i was left in do you think that was right  it was wise and yes it was best said miss milray and for relief from the tension which was beginning to tell upon her own nerves she asked i suppose you know about my poor brother id better tell you to keep you from asking for mrs milray though i dont know that its so very painful with him there isnt any mrs milray now she added and she explained why  neither of them cared for mrs milray and they did not pretend to be concerned about her but clementina said vaguely as if in recognition of mrs milrays latest experiment do you believe in second marriages  miss milray laughed well not that kind exactly  no clementina assented and she colored a little  miss milray was moved to add but if you mean another kind i dont see why not my own mother was married twice  was she clementina looked relieved and encouraged but she did not say any more at once then she asked do you know what ever became of mr belsky  yes hes taken his title again and gone back to live in russia hes made peace with the czar i believe  thats nice said clementina and miss milray made bold to ask  and what has become of mr gregory  clementina answered as miss milray thought tentatively and obliquely you know his wife died  no i never knew that she lived  yes they went out to china and she died thea  and is he there yet but of course he could never have given up being a missionary  well said clementina he isnt in china his health gave out and he had to come home hes in middlemount centa  miss milray suppressed the oh that all but broke from her lips preaching to the heathen there she temporized  to the summa folks clementina explained innocent of satire they have got a union chapel thea now and mr gregory has been preaching all summa there seemed nothing more that miss milray could prompt her to say but it was not quite with surprise that she heard clementina continue as if it were part of the explanation and followed from the fact she had stated he wants me to marry him  miss milray tried to emulate her calm in asking and shall you  i dont know i told him i would see he only asked me last night it would be kind of natural he was the fust you may think it is strange  miss milray in the superstition of her oldmaidenhood concerning love really thought it coldblooded and shocking but she said oh no  clementina resumed and he says that if it was right for me to stop caring for him when i did it is right now for me to cae for him again where thees no one to be hut by it do you think it is  yes why not miss milray was forced to the admission against what she believed the finer feelings of her nature  clementina sighed i suppose hes right i always thought he was good women dont seem to belong very much to themselves in this wold do they  no they seem to belong to the men either because they want the men or the men want them it comes to the same thing i suppose you dont wish me to advise you my dear  no i presume its something ive got to think out for myself  but i think hes good too i ought to say that much for i didnt always stand his friend with you if mr gregory has any fault its being too scrupulous  you mean about that old troubleour not believing just the same miss milray meant something much more temperamental than that but she allowed clementina to limit her meaning and clementina went on hes changed all round now he thinks its all in the life he says that in china they couldnt understand what he believed but they could what he lived and he knows i neva could be very religious  it was in miss milrays heart to protest clementina i think you are one of the most religious persons i ever knew but she forebore because the praise seemed to her an invasion of clementinas dignity she merely said well i am glad he is one of those who grow more liberal as they grow older that is a good sign for your happiness but i dare say its more of his happiness you think  oh i should like to be happy too there would be no sense in it if i wasnt  no certainly not  miss milray said clementina with a kind of abruptness do you eva hear anything from dr welwright  no why miss milray fastened her gaze vividly upon her  oh nothing he wanted me to promise him there in venice too  i didnt know it  yes buti couldnt then and nowhes written to me he wants me to let him come ova and see me  andand will you asked miss milray rather breathlessly  i dont know i dont know as id ought i should like to see him so as to be puffectly sua but if i let him come and then didntit wouldnt be right i always felt as if id ought to have seen then that he caed for me and stopped him but i didnt no i didnt she repeated nervously i respected him and i liked him but i nevashe stopped and then she asked what do you think id ought to do miss milray  miss milray hesitated she was thinking superficially that she had never heard clementina say had ought so much if ever before interiorly she was recurring to a sense of something like all this before and to the feeling which she had then that clementina was really coldblooded and selfseeking but she remembered that in her former decision clementina had finally acted from her heart and her conscience and she rose from her suspicion with a rebound she dismissed as unworthy of clementina any theory which did not account for an ideal of scrupulous and unselfish justice in her  that is something that nobody can say but yourself clementina she answered gravely  yes sighed clementina i presume that is so  she rose and took her little girl from miss milrays knee say goodbye she bade looking tenderly down at her  miss milray expected the child to put up her lips to be kissed but she let go her mothers hand took her tiny skirts between her fingertips and dropped a curtsey  you little witch cried miss milray i want a hug and she crushed her to her breast while the child twisted her face round and anxiously questioned her mothers for her approval tell her its all right clementina cried miss milray when shes as old as you were in florence im going to make you give her to me  ah you going back to florence asked clementina provisionally  oh no you cant go back to anything thats what makes new york so impossible i think we shall go to los angeles     xl  on her way home clementina met a man walking swiftly forward a sort of impassioned abstraction expressed itself in his gait and bearing they had both entered the shadow of the deep pine woods that flanked the way on either side and the fallen needles helped with the velvety summer dust of the roadway to hush their steps from each other she saw him far off but he was not aware of her till she was quite near him  oh he said with a start you filled my mind so full that i couldnt have believed you were anywhere outside of it i was coming to get youi was coming to get my answer  gregory had grown distinctly older sickness and hardship had left traces in his wasted face but the full beard he wore helped to give him an undue look of age  i dont know said clementina slowly as ive got an answa fo you mr gregoryyet  no answer is better that the one i am afraid of  oh im not so sure of that she said with gentle perplexity as she stood holding the hand of her little girl who stared shyly at the intense face of the man before her  i am he retorted i have been thinking it all ever clementina ive tried not to think selfishly about it but i cant pretend that my wish isnt selfish it is i want you for myself and because ive always wanted you and not for any other reason i never cared for any one but you in the way i cared for you and  oh she grieved i never caed at all for you after i saw him  i know it must be shocking to you i havent told you with any wretched hope that it would commend me to you  i dont say it was so very bad said clementina reflectively if it was something you couldnt help  it was something i couldnt help perhaps i didnt try  didshe know it  she knew it from the first i told her before we were married  clementina drew back a little insensibly pulling her child with her i dont believe i exactly like it  i knew you wouldnt if i could have thought you would i hope i shouldnt have wishedand fearedso much to tell you  oh i know you always wanted to do what you believed was right mr gregory she answered but i havent quite thought it out yet you mustnt hurry me  no no heaven forbid he stood aside to let her pass  i was just going home she added  may i go with you  yes if you want to i dont know but you betta we might as well i want to talk with you dont you think its something we ought to talk aboutsensibly  why of course and i shall try to be guided by you i should always submit to be ruled by you if  thats not what i mean exactly i dont want to do the ruling you dont undastand me  im afraid i dont he assented humbly  if you did you wouldnt say thatso he did not venture to make any answer and they walked on without speaking till she asked did you know that miss milray was at the middlemount  miss milray of florence  with her brother i didnt see him mrs milray is not hea they ah divoced miss milray used to be very nice to me in florence she isnt going back there any moa she says you cant go back to anything do you think we can  she had left moments between her incoherent sentences where he might interrupt her if he would but he waited for her question i hoped we might but perhaps  no no we couldnt we couldnt go back to that night when you threw the slippas into the riva no to that time in florence when we gave up no to that day in venice when i had to tell you that i caed moa fo some one else dont you see  yes i see he said in quick revulsion from the hope he had expressed the past is full of the pain and shame of my errors  i dont want to go back to whats past eitha she reasoned without gainsaying him  she stopped again as if that were all and he asked then is that my answer  i dont believe that even in the otha wold we shall want to go back to the past much do you she pursued thoughtfully  once gregory would have answered confidently he even now checked an impulse to do so i dont know he owned meekly  i do like you mr gregory she relented as if touched by his meekness to the confession you know i domoa than i ever expected to like anybody again but its not because i used to like you or because i think you always acted nicely i think it was cruel of you if you caed for me to let me believe you didnt afta that fust time i cant eva think it wasnt no matta why you did it  it was atrocious i can see that now  i say it because i shouldnt eva wish to say it again i know that all the time you wee betta than what you did and i blame myself a good deal moa fo not knowing when you came to florence that i had begun to cae fosome one else but i did wait till i could see you again so as to be sua which i caed for the most i tried to be faia before i told you that i wanted to be free that is all she said gently and gregory perceived that the word was left definitely to him  he could not take it till he had disciplined himself to accept unmurmuringly his sentence as he understood it at any rate he began i can thank you for rating my motive above my conduct  oh she said i dont think either of us acted very well i didnt know till aftawads that i was glad to have you give up the way you did in florence i wasbewilded but i ought to have known and i want you to undastand everything now i dont cae for you because i used to when i was almost a child and i shouldnt want you to cae for me eitha because you did then thats why i wish you had neva felt that you had always caed fo me  yes said gregory he let fall his head in despair  that is what i mean said clementina if we ah going to begin togetha now its got to be as if we had neva begun before and you mustnt think or say or look as if thee had been anything in oua lives but ouaselves will you do you promise she stopped and put her hand on his breast and pushed against it with a nervous vehemence  no he said i dont promise for i couldnt keep my promise what you ask is impossible the past is part of us it cant be ignored any more than it can be destroyed if we take each other it must be for all that we have been as well as all that we are if we havent the courage for that we must part  he dropped the little ones hand which he had been holding and moved a few steps aside dont she said theyll think ive made you and he took the childs hand again  they had emerged from the shadow of the woods and come in sight of her fathers house claxon was standing coatless before the door in full enjoyment of the late afternoon air his wife beside him at sight of gregory quelled a natural impulse to run round the corner of the house from the presence of strangers  i wonda what theya sayin she fretted  it looks some as if she was sayin yes said claxon with an impersonal enjoyment of his conjecture i guess she saw he was bound not to take no for an answa  i dont know as i should like it very much his wife relucted clems doin very well as it is she no need to marry again  oh i guess it ant that altogetha hes a good man claxon mused a moment upon the figures which had begun to advance again with the little one between them and then gave way in a burst of paternal pride and i dont know as i should blame him so very much for wantin clem she always did want to be of moa usebut i guess she likes him too   pg editors bookmarks      all in all to each other     chained to the restless pursuit of an ideal not his own     composed her features and her ideas to receive
