dont know that its any of your business said stickytoes  such a thing as unc billy forgetting to say goodby had never happened      before  blackys eyes twinkled as he listened to sammy jays tale of woe  good moning brer coon said ol mistah buzzard  there sat the three little scamps on the big rock  sometimes he woke up in the night and would sing for very joy     the adventures of mistah mocker     i   the lone traveler  when mistress spring starts from way down south to bring joy and gladness to the green meadows and the green forest the laughing brook and the smiling pool a great many travelers start with her or follow her winsome bluebird goes just a little way ahead of her for winsome is the herald of mistress spring then comes honker the goose and all the world hearing his voice from way way up in the blue blue sky knows that truly mistress spring is on her way and with her come little friend the song sparrow and cheerful robin and mr and mrs redwing then follow other travelers ever so many of them all eager to get back to the beautiful green forest and green meadows  now there are a few feathered folk who think the far away south is quite good enough for them to live there all the year round ol mistah buzzard used to think that way indeed he used to think that there was no place like the dear ol souf and it wasnt until he went looking for his old friend unc billy possum who had come up to live in the green forest that he found out how nice it is where the laughing brook dances down through the green forest to the smiling pool and then through the green meadows to the big river now when he is sure that there is no danger that he will have cold feet or that he will catch cold in his bald head he likes to come up to spend the summer near unc billy possum  of course ol mistah buzzard has wonderful stories to tell when he goes back south in the fall and all winter long he warms his toes on the chimney tops while he tells his friends about the wonderful things he has seen in his travels now there is a certain friend of his and of unc billy possum who had listened to these stories for a long time without seeming in the least interested but he was yes sir he was he was so much interested that he began to wish he could see for himself all these things ol mistah buzzard was telling about but he didnt say a word not a word he just listened and listened and then went on about his business  but when all the other little people in feathers had flown to that far away country ol mistah buzzard had told about even ol mistah buzzard himself then did this friend of his and of unc billy possum make up his mind that he would go too he didnt say anything about it to any one but he just started off by himself now of course he didnt know the way never having been that way before but he kept on going and going keeping out of sight as much as he could and asking no questions sometimes he wondered if he would know the green forest when he reached it and then he would remember how ol mistah buzzard dearly loves to fly round and round high up in the blue blue sky  all ah done got to do is to keep on going till ah see brer buzzard thought he so he traveled and traveled without speaking to any one and always looking up in the blue blue sky then one day he saw a black speck high up in the blue blue sky and it went round and round and round and round finally it dropped down down down until it disappeared among the trees  its brer buzzard and that must be the green forest where unc billy possum lives thought the lone traveler and chuckled ah reckon ahll give unc billy a surprise yes sah ah reckon so  and all the time unc billy possum and ol mistah buzzard knew nothing at all about the coming of their old friend and neighbor but thought him far far away down in ol virginny where they had left him     ii   unc billy possum grows excited  unc billy possum sat at the foot of the great hollow tree in which his home is unc billy felt very fine that morning he had had a good breakfast and you know a good breakfast is one of the best things in the world to make one feel fine then unc billys worries were at an end for farmer browns boy no longer hunted with his dreadful gun through the green forest or on the green meadows then too old granny fox and reddy fox had moved way way off to the old pasture on the edge of the mountain and so unc billy felt that his eight little possums could play about without danger  so he sat with his back to the great hollow tree wondering if it wouldnt be perfectly safe for him to slip up to farmer browns henhouse in the dark of the next night for some fresh eggs he could hear old mrs possum cleaning house and scolding the little possums who kept climbing up on her back as he listened unc billy grinned and began to sing in a queer cracked voice    mah ol woman am a plain ol dame     deed she am deed she am   quick with her broom with her tongue the same     deed she am deed she am   but she keeps mah house all spick and span   she has good vittles fo her ol man   she spanks the chillun but she loves em too   she sho am sharp but shes good and true     deed she am deed she am  youall better stop lazing and hustle about fo something fo dinner said old mrs possum sticking her sharp little face out of the doorway  yasm yasm ah was just aiming to do that very thing replied unc billy meekly as he scrambled to his feet  just then out tumbled his eight children making such a racket that unc billy clapped both hands over his ears mah goodness gracious sakes alive he exclaimed one pulled unc billys tail two scrambled up on his back in two minutes unc billy was down on the ground rolling and tumbling in the maddest kind of a frolic with his eight children  right in the midst of it unc billy sprang to his feet his eyes were shining and his funny little ears were pricked up hush yoalls he commanded how do yoalls think ah can hear anything with yoalls making such a racket he boxed the ears of one and shook another and then when all were still he stood with his right hand behind his right ear listening and listening  ah certnly thought ah heard the voice of an ol friend from way down souf ah certnly did he muttered and without another word he started off into the green forest more excited than he had been since his family came up from ol virginny     iii   unc billys vain search  unc billy possum was excited any one would have known it just to look at him he hurried off up the lone little path through the green forest without even saying goodby to old mrs possum and all the little possums they just stared after unc billy and didnt know what to make of it for such a thing as unc billy forgetting to say goodby had never happened before yes indeed unc billy certainly was excited  old mrs possum sat in the doorway of their home in the great hollow tree and watched unc billy out of sight her sharp little eyes seemed to grow sharper as she watched ah done sent that noaccount possum to hunt fo something fo dinner but pears to me hes plumb forgot it already she muttered just look at him with his head up in the air like he thought dinner fo we uns would drap right down to him out o the sky if hes aiming to find a birds nest with eggs in it this time o year he sholy am plumb foolish in his haid no sah that onery possum has clean fogotten what ah just done tole him and if we uns am going to have any dinner ah certnly have got to flax round right smart spry mahself  old mrs possum chased the eight little possums into the house and warned them not to so much as put their heads outside the door while she was gone then she started out to hunt for their dinner still muttering as she went  old mrs possum was quite right unc billy had forgotten all about that dinner you see he had something else on his mind while he had been playing with his children he had thought that he heard a voice way off in the distance and it had sounded very very much like the voice of an old friend from way down south in ol virginny he had listened and listened but didnt hear it again and yet he was sure he had heard it that once the very thought that that old friend of his might be somewhere in the green forest excited unc billy so that it fairly made him homesick he just had to go look for him  so all the rest of that day unc billy possum walked and walked through the green forest peering up in the treetops and looking into the bushes until his neck ached but nowhere did he catch a glimpse of his old friend the longer he looked the more excited he grew  whats the matter with you asked jimmy skunk meeting unc billy on the crooked little path near the top of the hill  nuffin nuffin sah ahm just walking fo mah health replied unc billy over his shoulder as he hurried on you see he didnt like to tell any one what he thought he had heard for fear that it might not be true and then they would laugh at him  didnt suppose unc billy ever worried about his health muttered jimmy skunk with a puzzled look as he watched unc billy disappear  just as jolly round red mr sun dropped out of sight behind the purple hills unc billy gave it up and turned toward home his neck ached from looking up in the treetops and his feet were sore from walking and just then unc billy for the first time thought of that dinner that old mrs possum had sent him to get unc billy sat down and mopped his brow in dismay  ah specks ahm in fo it this time sho enough he said     iv   unc billy comes home  unc billy possum crept along in the darkest shadows he could find as he drew near to the great hollow tree which is his home  ah specks ahm in fo it ah specks ah sholy am in fo it this time he kept muttering  so unc billy crept along in the black shadows until he got where he could look up and see his own doorway then he sat down and watched a while all was still there wasnt a sound in the great hollow tree  perhaps mah ol woman am out calling and ah can slip in and go to bed before she gets back said unc billy hopefully to himself as he started to climb the great hollow tree  but at the first scratch of his toenails on the bark the sharp face of old mrs possum appeared in the doorway  good evening mah dear said unc billy in the mildest kind of a voice  old mrs possum said nothing but unc billy felt as if her sharp black eyes were looking right through him  unc billy grinned a sickly kind of grin as he said  ah hopes yoalls are feeling good tonight  wheres that dinner ah sent yo fo demanded old mrs possum sharply  unc billy fidgeted uneasily ah done brought yo two eggs from farmer browns henhouse he replied meekly  two eggs two eggs how do yo think ah am going to feed eight hungry mouths on two eggs snapped old mrs possum  unc billy hung his head he hadnt a word to say he just couldnt tell her that he had spent the whole day tramping through the green forest looking for an old friend whose voice he had thought he heard when he ought to have been helping her find a dinner for the eight little possums no sir unc billy hadnt a word to say  my my my how old mrs possum did scold as she came down the great hollow tree to get the two eggs unc billy knew that he deserved every bit of it he felt very miserable and he was too tired to have a bit of spirit left so he just sat at the foot of the great hollow tree and said nothing while old mrs possum bit a hole in the end of one egg and began to suck it all the time she was looking at unc billy with those sharp eyes of hers when she had finished the egg she pushed the other over to him  yo eat that she said shortly yo look as if yo hadnt had anything to eat today which was true then yo hustle up to bed its all ready fo yo  unc billy did as he was bid and as he tucked himself into his snug warm bed he murmured sleepily    ol mrs possum has a sharp sharp tongue     but her bark is worse than her bite   for ol mrs possum has a soft soft heart     though she hides it way out of sight     v   sammy jay is indignant  sammy jay was indignant yes sir sammy jay was very much put out in fact sammy was just plain downright mad it is bad enough to be found out and blamed for the things you really do but to be blamed for things that you dont do and dont even know anything about is more than even mr jaybird can stand it had begun when he met jimmy skunk early in the morning  hello sammy jay what were you doing up so late last night said jimmy skunk  i wasnt up late i went to bed at my usual hour just after mr sun went to bed behind the purple hills replied sammy jay  oh come sammy jay be honest for once in your life it was a long long long time after mr sun went to bed that i heard you screaming and making a great fuss over in the green forest what was it all about  sammy jay stamped one foot he was beginning to lose his temper you know he loses it very easily i am honest he screamed i tell you i went to bed just as i always do and i didnt wake up until this morning  then you must talk something dreadful in your sleep said jimmy skunk turning his back on sammy jay who was so mad by this time that for a few minutes he couldnt find his tongue when he did he flew off screaming at the top of his lungs he was still screaming when he flew over the old briarpatch where peter rabbit was just beginning to doze off  peter was sleepy he didnt like to have his morning nap disturbed  hi sammy jay didnt you make racket enough last night to give honest folks a little peace and quiet today shouted peter rabbit  sammy jay flew up into a young cherry tree on the edge of the old briarpatch and his eyes were fairly red with anger as he glared down at peter rabbit  whats the joke peter rabbit thats the second time this morning that ive been told that i was screaming last night when all the time i was fast asleep said sammy jay  then its a funny way you have of sleeping replied peter rabbit come sammy be honest and tell me what you were yelling thief for over in the green forest  peter rabbit you and jimmy skunk are crazy just as crazy as loons sputtered sammy jay i tell you i was asleep and i guess i ought to know  and i guess i know your voice when i hear it replied peter rabbit its bad enough in daytime but if i was you id quit yelling in the night some one of these times hooty the owl will hear you and that will be the end of you and your noise now go away i want to sleep  sammy went he was mad clear through and yet he didnt know what to make of it were they just trying to make him mad or had he really been screaming in his sleep he flew over to the smiling pool jerry muskrat looked up and saw him  what were you yelling about in the night sammy jay asked jerry  this was too much sammy jay let his wings and his tail droop dejectedly and hung his head  i dont know i really dont know anything about it he said     vi   sammy jay thinks hes going crazy    sammy jay screams all day long     and now what do you think   why sammy sits and yells all night     and doesnt sleep a wink  everywhere he went sammy jay heard that shouted after him dozens and dozens of times a day he heard it at first he lost his temper and was the very maddest jaybird ever seen on the green meadows or in the green forest  it isnt true it isnt true it isnt true he would scream at the top of his lungs  and then everybody within hearing would shout it is true  sammy would just dance up and down and scream and scream and scream he was so angry and then he was sure to hear some one pipe up    sammys mad and we are glad     and we know how to tease him   but some dark night hell get a fright     for hootyll come and seize him  that really began to worry him at first he had thought that it was all a joke on the part of the little people of the green forest and the green meadows and that they had made up the story about hearing him in the night then he began to think that it might be true that he did talk in his sleep and this worried him a whole lot if he did that hooty the owl would surely find him sooner or later and in the morning there wouldnt be anything left of him but a few feathers from his fine coat  the more he thought about it the more worried sammy jay became he lost his appetite and began to grow thin he kept out of sight whenever possible and no longer screamed thief thief through the green forest in fact his voice was rarely heard during the day but it seemed that he must be talking just as much as ever in the night at least everybody said that he was worse still different ones said that they heard him in different places in the green forest and even down on the green meadows could it be that he was flying about as well as talking in his sleep and nobody believed him when he said that he was asleep all night they thought that he was awake and doing it purposely they might have known that he couldnt see in the night for his eyes are made for daylight and not for darkness like the eyes of boomer the nighthawk and hooty the owl but they didnt seem to think of this and insisted that almost every night they heard him down in the alders along the laughing brook yet every morning when he awoke sammy would find himself just where he went to sleep the night before safely hidden in the thickest part of a big pinetree  if they are not all crazy then i must be said sammy jay to himself as he turned away from the breakfast which he could not eat then he had a happy idea why didnt i think of it before ill sleep all day and then ill keep awake all night and see what happens then he exclaimed  so sammy jay hurried away to the darkest part of the green forest and tried to sleep through the day     vii   sammy jay sits up all night  sammy jay sat in the dark and shivered sammy was lonely more lonely than he had ever supposed anybody could be and to tell the truth sammy jay was scared yes sir that was just the way sammy jay feltscared every time a leaf rustled sammy jumped almost out of his skin his heart went pitapat pitapat pitapat he could hear it himself or at least he thought he could and it seemed to him that if hooty the owl should happen to come along he would surely hear it  you see it was the first time in all his life that sammy jay had not gone to sleep just as soon as jolly round red mr sun had pulled his rosy nightcap on and gone to bed behind the purple hills but tonight sammy sat in the darkest thickest part of a big pinetree and kept blinking his eyes to keep from going to sleep he had made up his mind that he wouldnt go to sleep at all that night no matter how lonely and frightened he might be he just would keep his eyes and his ears wide open  what was he doing it for why because all the little meadow and forest people insisted that every night lately sammy jay had spent a great part of his time screaming in the harsh unpleasant way he does during the day and some of them were very cross because they said that he waked them up when they wanted to sleep now sammy knew better he never in his life had screamed in the night unlesswell unless he did it in his sleep and didnt know it so he had made up his mind to keep awake all of this night and see if in the morning any one would say that he had waked them up  he had watched the black shadows creep through the green forest and grow blacker and blacker the blacker they grew the lonesomer he became by and by it was so dark that he couldnt see anything at all and every little noise made him shiver it is easy to be brave in daylight but in the dark when you cannot see a thing every little sound seems twice as loud as it really is and gives you such a creepy creepy feeling sammy jay had it now he felt so creepy that it seemed as if he would crawl right out of his skin he kept saying over and over to himself theres nothing to be afraid of theres nothing to be afraid of im just as safe as if i was fast asleep but still he shivered and shook  by and by looking up through the top of the big pinetree he saw the little stars come out one by one they seemed to be looking right down at him and winking at him in the jolliest way somehow he didnt feel quite so lonely then and he tried to wink back then little soft silvery bars of light began to creep through the branches of the trees and along the ground they were moonbeams and sammy could see just a little a very little he began to feel better  whooohoohoo whooohoo  it was a terrible sound fierce and hungry sammy jay nearly fell from his perch he opened his mouth to scream with fright then he remembered just in time and closed it without a sound it was the huntingcry of hooty the owl sammy jay sat huddled in a little forlorn shivering heap while twice more that fierce cry rang through the green forest then a shadow floated over the big pinetree hooty the owl had flown away without seeing him and sammy breathed easier     viii   sammy jay is glad he sat up all night  sammy jay was having no trouble in keeping awake now not a bit he couldnt have gone to sleep if he wanted tonot since hooty the owl had frightened him almost out of his skin with his fierce hungry huntingcall he was too frightened and shivery and creepy to sleep but he didnt want to anyway  so he sat in the thickest part of the big pinetree shivering and creepy and miserable he heard bobby coon go down the lone little path on his way to fanner browns cornfield where the corn was just beginning to get milky and sweet out in a patch of bright moonlight he saw peter rabbit jumping and dancing and having the greatest kind of a time all by himself pretty soon peter was joined by his cousin jumper the hare such antics as they did cut up sammy jay almost laughed aloud as he watched it was less lonely with them there and he did want to call to them dreadfully but that would never never do for no one must know that he was sitting up awake all night  by and by along came jimmy skunk walking out into the patch of bright moonlight he touched noses with peter rabbit and jumper the hare which is one way of saying good evening in the green forest  isnt it most time for sammy jay to scream in his sleep asked peter rabbit  sammy pricked up his ears scream in his sleep nonsense sammy jay isnt any more asleep than i am he just screams out of pure meanness to wake up and frighten good honest folks who want to sleep for my part i dont see what any one wants to sleep for on such a fine night as this anyway it serves em right if they do get waked up replied jimmy skunk  but sammy jay says that he doesnt do it and doesnt know anything about it said peter rabbit have you ever seen him scream in the night jimmy skunk  no i dont have to replied jimmy skunk i guess i know his voice when i hear it and ive heard it enough times the last few nights goodness knows tell me this peter rabbit who else is there that cries thief thief thief and screams like sammy jay  peter shook his head i guess youre right jimmy skunk i guess youre right he said  of course im right there now jimmy held up one hand to warn peter to keep still sure enough there was sammy jays voice way over in the alders beside the laughing brook and it was screaming thief thief thief  they all heard it sammy jay heard it too and scratched himself to be sure that he was awake and sitting there in the big pinetree  its my voice and it isnt my voice for i havent made a sound and its over in the alders while im here in my own big pinetree muttered sammy jay to himself im glad i kept awake but    maybe im going crazy   my wits are getting hazy     thats surely me     yet here i be   oh dear i sure am crazy     ix   the mystery grows    can a body be a body     yet not a body be   tell a body anybody     didst such a body see  of course it was sammy jay who was humming such a foolishsounding rhyme as that but really it wasnt so foolish in sammys case after all he had sat up wide awake all night just to try to find out why it was that all the little meadow and forest people had complained that he spent part of each night screaming thief thief thief just as he does in the daytime now he knew sitting in the dark in his big pinetree he had heard his own voice or what sounded like his own voice screaming down in the alders by the laughing brook sammy had scratched himself to be sure that he was really and truly awake and not dreaming for there was his voice down in the alders and there was himself sitting in the big pine tree with his mouth closed as tight as he could shut it did ever a jaybird have anything so queer as that to puzzle him  anyway sammy jay knew that he didnt scream in his sleep and there was a whole lot of comfort in that he could eat with a better appetite now you see when he had been told that he was screaming in the night sammy had been afraid that he was doing it in his sleep and if he was doing that why some dark night hooty the owl might hear him and find him and that would be the end of him now he knew that he could go to sleep in peace just as he always had  sammy jay brushed and smoothed out his handsome blue coat and made himself as pert and smartappearing as possible he had been so worried lately that he hadnt taken much care of himself which is very unusual for sammy jay now however he felt so much better that he began to think about his looks when he had finished dressing he started for the alders beside the laughing brook just to have a look around of course he didnt expect to find his voice down there for who ever saw a voice still he thought that he might find something that would explain the mystery  he hunted all around in the thicket of alders beside the laughing brook but nothing unusual did he find then for a long time he sat as still as still can be studying and thinking finally he thought to himself ill just see how my voice really does sound down here and opening his mouth he screamed  thief thief thief  then out popped jenny wren and she was so mad that she couldnt sit still a second my my my how she did scold  you ought to be ashamed of yourself sammy jay you ought to be ashamed of yourself she sputtered isnt it enough to keep us awake half the night without coming down and screaming all day  i havent been down here in the night and i havent kept anybody awake replied sammy jay indignantly  jenny wren came right up in front of sammy jay and hopped up and down she was so mad that with every word she jerked her funny little tail so that sammy jay almost had to laugh  dont tell that to me sammy jay dont tell that to me she cried didnt i see you with my own eyes sitting in that alder over there dont tell that to me you ought to be ashamed of yourself     x   sammy jay seeks advice  sammy jay had a headache such a headache he had thought and thought and thought until now it seemed to him that the world surely had turned topsyturvy his poor little head was all in a whirl and that was what made it ache first he had been accused of screaming in the night to waken and scare the little meadow and forest people who wanted to sleep then he had kept awake all night to find out what it meant and he had heard what sounded like his own voice screaming thief thief thief down by the laughing brook when all the time he was sitting in the dark in his own big pinetree in the green forest  that was bad enough but to have jenny wren tell him that she had seen him with her own eyes sitting in an alder tree and screaming at the very time that he had been back there in the big pinetree was more than sammy jay could stand it was no wonder that his head ached hardly any of the little meadow and forest people would speak to him now they just turned their backs to him whenever he met them he didnt mind this so much because he knew that none of them had ever liked him very well you see he had played too many mean tricks for any one to really like him but he did hate to have them blame him for something that he hadnt done  its too much for me said sammy jay its too much for me ive thought and thought until my brain just goes round and round and makes me dizzy and my thoughts turn somersaults over each other i must get help somewhere now who can i go to so few will have anything to do with me  caw caw caw  sammy jay pricked up his ears and spread his wings my cousin blacky the crow he cried why didnt i think of him before hes very smart is blacky the crow and perhaps he can tell me what to do  so sammy jay hurried as fast as he could to lay his troubles before blacky the crow blackys eyes twinkled as he listened to sammy jays tale of woe when sammy had finished and had asked for blackys advice blacky went into a black study sammy sat and waited patiently for he felt certain that blackys shrewd head would find some plan to solve the mystery  i dont know how you can find out who it is thats making you all this trouble but ill tell you how you can prove that it isnt you that screams in the night said blacky the crow after a while  how asked sammy jay eagerly  go away from the green meadows and the green forest and stay away for a week replied blacky the crow go up to the faraway old pasture on the edge of the mountain where reddy and granny fox are living have boomer the nighthawk see you go to bed there and then ask him to come straight down here and tell peter rabbit just where you are peter will tell every one else for he cant keep his tongue still and then theyll all know that it isnt you that screams in the night  the very thing cried sammy jay ill move at once and off he hurried to prepare to move up to the old pasture     xi   how blacky the crows plan worked out  thief thief thief old granny fox trotting along a cowpath in the old pasture on the edge of the mountain heard it and grinned reddy fox sitting in the doorway of their new home under the great rocks in the midst of the thickest clump of bushes and young trees heard it too and he grinned even more broadly than granny fox it sounded good to him did that harsh scream for it was the first time he had heard the voice of a single one of the little meadow and forest people since he and granny fox had moved up to the lonesome old pasture  now i wonder what has brought sammy jay way up here said reddy as he limped out to the edge of the thick tangle of bushes and young trees pretty soon he caught sight of a wonderful coat of bright blue with white trimmings  hi sammy jay what are you doing up here shouted reddy fox  sammy jay heard him and hurried over to where reddy fox was sitting  hello reddy fox how are you feeling said sammy jay  better thank you what are you doing way up here in this lonely place replied reddy  its a long story said sammy jay  tell it to me begged reddy fox  so sammy jay told him all about the trouble he had had on the green meadows and in the green forest and how hardly any one would speak to him because they said that he kept them awake by screaming in the night he told how he had sat up all night and had heard what sounded like his own voice when all the time he was sitting with his mouth shut as tight as tight could be then he told about blacky the crows plan which was that sammy should come to the old pasture and live for a week then if the little people of the green meadows and the green forest heard screams in the night they would know that it was not sammy jay who was waking them up reddy fox chuckled as he listened you know misery likes company and it tickled reddy to think that some one else had been forced to leave the green meadows and the green forest  that night sammy jay found a comfortable place which seemed quite safe in which to go to sleep just after jolly round red mr sun went to bed behind the purple hills sammy saw boomer the nighthawk circling round high in the air catching his dinner sammy screamed twice boomer heard him and down he came with a rush  why sammy jay what under the sun are you doing way off here exclaimed boomer  going to bed replied sammy say boomer will you do something for me  that depends upon what it is replied boomer  its just an errand replied sammy jay and then he asked boomer to go down to the green meadows and tell peter rabbit how he boomer had seen sammy going to bed up in the faraway old pasture  boomer promised that he would and off he started he found peter and told him of course peter was very much surprised and because he cannot keep his tongue still he started off at once to tell everybody he could find just as blacky the crow had thought he would do     xii   no one believes peter rabbit  peter rabbit sat in his secret place in the middle of the old briarpatch peter was doing some very hard thinking he ought to have been asleep for he had been out the whole night long but instead of sleeping he was wide awake and thinking and thinking  you see early the night before boomer the nighthawk had told peter that sammy jay was up in the faraway old pasture boomer had seen him going to bed there and had come straight down to tell peter this was great news and peter could hardly wait for boomer to stop talking he was so anxious to spread the news over the green meadows and through the green forest for peter is a great gossip and cannot keep his tongue still  so he had hurried this way and that way telling every one he met how sammy jay had moved away to the old pasture but no one believed him  wait and see wait and see said jimmy skunk  its just a trick said bobby coon  but boomer the nighthawk saw him up there going to bed and talked with him cried peter rabbit  perhaps he did and then again perhaps he didnt replied bobby coon carefully washing an ear of sweet milky corn that he had brought down to the laughing brook from farmer browns cornfield for bobby coon is very very neat and always washes his food before eating for my part he continued i believe that boomer the nighthawk just made up that story to help sammy jay fool us  but that would be a wrong story and i dont believe that boomer would do anything like that cried peter  just then there was a shrill scream of thief thief thief over in the alder bushes it certainly sounded like sammy jays voice  what did i tell you now what do you think cried bobby coon  peter didnt know what to think and he said so he left bobby to eat his corn and spent the rest of the night telling every one he met what boomer the nighthawk had said but of course no one believed it and every one laughed at him for hadnt they heard sammy jay screaming that very night  so now peter sat in the old briarpatch thinking and thinking when he should have been asleep finally he yawned and stretched and then started along one of his private little paths  ill just run up to the green forest and try to find sammy jay he said  so peter hunted and hunted all through the green forest for sammy jay and asked everybody he met if they had seen sammy but no one had though every one took pains to tell peter that they had heard sammy in the night at last peter found stickytoes the tree toad he was muttering and grumbling to himself and he didnt see peter peter stopped to listen which was of course a very wrong thing to do and what he heard gave peter an idea     xiii   stickytoes the tree toad pours out his troubles  stickytoes was quite upset there was no doubt about it either he had gotten out of the wrong side of his bed that morning or his breakfast had disagreed with him or something had happened to make him lose his temper completely  dont know what it means dont know what it means dont know what it means croaked stickytoes the tree toad over and over again heard it last night and the night before that and before that and before that and before that and i dont know what it means  dont know what what means asked peter rabbit whose curiosity would not let him keep still  hello longears i dont know that its any of your business said stickytoes  peter allowed that it wasnt but that as he had so much on his own mind he couldnt help being interested when he found that stickytoes had troubles too then he told stickytoes all about how boomer the nighthawk had said that he had seen sammy jay going to bed up in the faraway old pasture and how that very night sammy jays voice had been heard screaming down in the alders beside the laughing brook stickytoes nodded his head  i heard it said he  but how could sammy jay be down here if he went to bed way off there in the old pasture tell me that stickytoes said peter rabbit  stickytoes shook his head dont ask me dont ask me just tell me how it is that i hear my own voice when i dont speak a word said stickytoes the tree toad  whats that exclaimed peter rabbit  then stickytoes poured out all his troubles to peter rabbit they were very much like the troubles of sammy jay every night stickytoes would hear what sounded like his own voice coming from a tree in which he was not sitting at all and at a time when he was keeping his mouth shut as tight as he knew how in fact he had been so worried that for several nights he hadnt said a word yet his neighbors had complained that he had been very noisy he was getting so worried that he couldnt eat  peter rabbit listened with his mouth wide open it was just the same kind of a story that sammy jay had told what under the sun could be going on peter couldnt understand it at all it certainly was very very curious he just must find out about it     xiv   peter rabbit meets unc billy possum  after stickytoes the tree toad had poured out his troubles peter went back to the old briarpatch more puzzled than ever if sammy jay was asleep in the faraway old pasture on the edge of the mountain how could he be at the same time down in the green forest screaming and if stickytoes the tree toad sat all night with his mouth shut tight how could the voice of stickytoes be heard in an altogether different tree than the one stickytoes was spending the night in wasnt it enough to drive any one crazy  the more peter studied over it the more puzzled he grew the next night he started out for the green forest with a new plan in his head he would hide down among the alders by the laughing brook he would see for himself who was screaming with the voice of sammy jay and talking with the voice of stickytoes the tree toad he just had to know  so across the green meadows and up the lone little path hurried peter rabbit so as to reach the laughing brook before jolly round red mr sun had wholly turned out his light after going to bed behind the purple hills he was hurrying so that he almost ran into unc billy possum  yo seem to be in a powerful hurry brer rabbit said unc billy  i am replied peter i must get down to the laughing brook before dark  pears to me it must be mighty impotant to make yo hurry this way said unc billy possum  it is replied peter rabbit its to keep me from going crazy  unc billy looked at peter very hard for a few minutes just as if he thought that peter was crazy already then he put a hand behind one ear just as if he was hard of hearing ah beg yo pardon brer rabbit but ah don seem to have it quite right in mah haid what yoall am going down to the laughing brook for said unc billy in the politest way  peter chuckled in spite of himself as he once more replied  its to keep me from going crazy  then peter told unc billy all about sammy jays troubles and all about the troubles of stickytoes the tree toad it was the first unc billy possum had heard about it for unc billy had been away from the green forest and the green meadows for a visit and had just returned he listened to all that peter rabbit had to say and a funny pleased sort of look came into his eyes  ah reckon ah will go along with yoall said he  so unc billy possum went with peter rabbit to the laughing brook where they hid underneath the alders     xv   peter rabbit and unc billy possum keep watch  now said peter rabbit as they settled themselves to watch well see for ourselves whether sammy jay and stickytoes have been telling the truth or if they have been dreaming if we hear sammy jays voice down here in the alders tonight we ought to be able to see who is using it for pretty soon the moon will be up and then we can see easily  unc billy possum didnt say anything not a word but if peter rabbit had noticed unc billys eyes he would have seen a very knowing look there  the fact is unc billy was thinking of the time when he thought he had heard the voice of an old friend of his from way down south and he was beginning to suspect that he had been right and that his old friend really was somewhere in the green forest  ah reckon he sholy is and hes plumb full of his ol tricks just like he used to be muttered unc billy  whats that asked peter pricking up his ears  nothing nothing brer rabbit nothing at all ah has a habit of just talking foolishness to mahself replied unc billy  peter looked at him sharply but unc billys shrewd little face looked so innocent that peter was ashamed to doubt what unc billy said  i guess that we better not talk any more for fear we might be heard and have our watch for nothing said peter  unc billy agreed and side by side they sat as still as if they were made of wood or stone the black shadows came early to the alders beside the laughing brook and soon it was very dark so dark that peter and unc billy whose eyes are meant for seeing in the dark as well as in the light had hard work to make out much it grew later and later and still there was not a sound of the voice of either sammy jay or stickytoes the tree toad peter began to get hungry the more he thought about it the hungrier he grew he was just about ready to give it up when the moonbeams began to creep in among the alder trees just as they had crept through the green forest the night that sammy jay kept awake all night  the moonbeams crept farther and farther into the thicket of alder trees and bushes where peter rabbit and unc billy possum were hiding then it was that they heard the voice of stickytoes the tree toad at any rate peter was sure that it was the voice of stickytoes until a fierce angry whisper came down to him from the branch of an alder just over his head peter looked up there sat stickytoes himself but his voice was coming from an alder on the other side of the laughing brook  do you hear that do you hear that theres my voice over there and here i am here what do you make of it whispered stickytoes  peter didnt know what to make of it all he could do was to gaze at stickytoes as if he thought stickytoes was a ghost just then the voice of sammy jay or what sounded for all the world like sammys voice screamed thief thief thief from the very spot where they had just heard the voice of stickytoes  peter turned to ask unc billy possum what he thought but unc billy wasnt there     xvi   unc billy possum does a little surprising himself  when unc billy possum first heard what sounded like the voice of stickytoes the tree toad he had thought just as peter rabbit did that stickytoes was over in an alder tree on the other side of the laughing brook but when he heard a whisper right over their heads and looked up to see stickytoes himself unc billy almost chuckled out loud    yo cant fool uncle billy     so dont go fo to try   ah knows yo yes ah knows yo     ah knows yo mistah sly  he said that to himself and quite under his breath for all the time that peter rabbit and stickytoes the tree toad were whispering together unc billy possum was stealing away under the alder bushes unc billy is very softfooted oh very softfooted indeed when he wants to be you see one must needs be very softfooted to steal eggs in farmer browns henhouse so unc billy stole away without making a sound and when peter rabbit turned to speak to him there was no unc billy there  peter rubbed his eyes and stared all around this way and that way but no sign of unc billy could he see this so surprised peter rabbit that he felt queer all over first there was the voice of stickytoes over on the other side of the laughing brook when all the time stickytoes wasnt there at all now here unc billy possum had disappeared just as if the earth had swallowed him up  this isnt any place for me said peter rabbit and off he started for the green meadows as fast as he could go lippertylippertylip  all this time unc billy possum had been crawling along without the tiniest sound when he came to the laughing brook he went up a way until he found a big tree with a branch stretching clear across of course unc billy could have swum across but he didnt feel like swimming that night so he climbed up the big tree ran out along the branch let himself down by the tail and then dropped he was across the laughing brook without even wetting his feet  unc billy didnt waste any time just as softfooted as before he crept along in the darkest shadows until he was right under the alder tree from which the complaining voice of stickytoes the tree toad seemed to come unc billy listened and the longer he listened the broader grew the smile on unc billys shrewd face  thief thief thief  it certainly sounded for all the world like sammy jays voice and it was right over unc billys head unc billy peered up through the alders the leaves were so thick that he could not see very well but what he did see was enough it was a long tail a tail of feathers hanging down it wasnt sammy jays tail either  don yoall think that yoall have joked enough asked unc billy trying hard to keep from chuckling aloud  a cry of thief stopped right in the middle and two sharp eyes looked down in surprise at unc billy     xvii   the meeting of two old friends  why unc billy possum what are yoall doing way up here cried the owner of the long tail and sharp eyes  this is mah home now ah done moved up here replied unc billy pears to me that the question is what am yoall doing way off up here ah thought ah sholy done hear your voice the other day and ah most wore mah po feet out looking fo yo ah thought ah was mistaken but now ah reckon that ah was right after all my but ah am right smart glad to see yo  thank yo unc billy replied the owner of the long tail and the sharp eyes  ah reckon yo cant be any more glad to see me than ah am to see yo fact is ah was getting right smart lonesome ah done been lying low daytimes because yo know ahm a stranger up here and ah was afraid that strangers might not be welcome in the green forest and on the green meadows  pears like if all ah hear am true that yo havent done much lying low nights ah reckon yo done make up fo those lonesome feelings yes sah ah reckon so mah goodness man yo done set everybody to running around like they was crazy exclaimed unc billy  the owner of the long tail and sharp eyes threw back his head and laughed and his laugh was like the most beautiful music it made unc billy feel good just listening to it  sammy jay done moved away to the ol pasture since things were so unpleasant here because everybody said he screamed all night continued unc billy possum he sat up all of one night just to make sho that he didnt scream in his sleep and he didnt make a sound the whole night long the next moning everybody said that he had been screaming just the same and po sammy jay just moved away yo ought to be ashamed to play such jokes unc billy grinned as he said it  thief thief came in sammy jays voice right out of the mouth of the owner of the long tail and sharp eyes then both little rascals laughed fit to kill themselves  yo come over to my house said unc billy my ol woman sho will be right smart glad to see yo and shes gwine to be powerful surprised deed she am she done been laughing at me fo a week because ah was sho ah done hear yo that day  so off the two started to see old mrs possum and for the rest of that night stickytoes the tree toad listened in vain for the sound of his own voice when his lips were closed tight     xviii   the mischiefmakers  there was a dreadful time on the green meadows and in the green forest oh dear dear dear it really was dreadful first sammy jay had been accused of screaming in the night and keeping honest little meadow and forest people awake when they wanted to sleep and all the time sammy jay hadnt made a sound then stickytoes the tree toad had been accused of being noisy when all the time he was sitting with his mouth closed as tight as tight could be  all this was bad enough but now things were so much worse that it was getting so that no one would have anything to do with any one else those who had been the very best of friends would pass without speaking you see everybody on the green meadows and in the green forest knows everybody else by their voice so when jimmy skunk happening along near the smiling pool heard mrs redwings voice he didnt waste any time trying to see mrs redwing instead he went straight over and told johnny chuck the unkind things that he had overheard mrs redwing saying about johnny  in the same way bobby coon heard the voice of blacky the crow in farmer browns cornfield and when bobby listened he heard some things not at all nice about himself and so it was all over the green meadows and through the green forest it seemed as if almost everybody was heard talking about some one else and never saying nice things  the only one who still managed to keep on good terms with everybody was unc billy possum no one had ever heard him saying unkind things about others and so because now there were so few others to talk to everybody was glad to see unc billy coming and he soon was the best liked of all the little meadow and forest people he went about trying to smooth out the troubles and to see him you never never would have guessed that he had anything to do with making them my my no indeed  but every night when the moon was up unc billy would have a caller who would come and sit just outside the doorway of unc billys house and scream thief thief thief then out would pop unc billys sharp little face and then his fat little body would follow and he and his friend with the long tail and the sharp eyes for of course you have guessed that is who it was would put their heads together and laugh and chuckle as if they were enjoying the best joke ever was then they would whisper and sometimes talk right out loud when they felt sure that no one was near to hear  what were they talking about why about the trouble on the green meadows and in the green forest and what a joke it all was and what was the best way to keep it up you see the reason that no one heard unc billy saying mean things or heard any mean things said about unc billy was because it was unc billy himself and his friend with the long tail and the sharp eyes who were making all the trouble yes sir they were the mischiefmakers it was great fun to fool everybody so they never once stopped to think how very very uncomfortable it kept everybody feeling     xix   bobby coon makes a discovery  bobby coon had overslept usually bobby is astir shortly after jolly round red mr sun has gone to bed behind the purple hills but bobby is very irregular in his habits he is very fond of traveling about in the night is bobby coon and when he does that he sleeps the greater part of the day but once in a while he takes a notion to travel about by daylight and when he does that why of course he has to sleep part of the night anyway bobby coon is a very lucky chap very lucky indeed for he can see in the dark and yet unlike hooty the owl he has no trouble in seeing in the broad daylight as well  this night bobby coon had overslept because he had not gone to bed until the middle of the day he had been prowling about and getting into mischief all of the night before and had not started for home until jolly round mr sun was smiling down from right overhead by this time bobby coon had sticks in his eyes he was so sleepy that it seemed to him that he never never could get home he was stumbling along through the green forest when he came to a hollow log what do you think he did why he crawled in there and in two minutes was fast asleep just as comfortable as if he had been in his own hollow tree  there bobby slept all the rest of the day and until long after mr sun had pulled on his rosy nightcap perhaps he would have slept there all night if he hadnt been waked up it was the cry of thief thief thief that waked him it seemed to come from right over his head  sammy jay ought to be ashamed of himself waking honest people like this muttered bobby coon as he yawned and stretched at first he couldnt think where he was then he remembered he was just getting ready to crawl out of the hollow log when he heard something which made him stop and try to sit up so suddenly that he bumped his head what he heard was the voice of unc billy possum and he knew by the sound that unc billy was sitting on the very log in which he himself was hiding  this is the greatest joke that ever was said unc billy pretty soon nobody on the green meadows or in the green forest will speak to anybody else excepting me yo certnly have got all your ol tricks with yo  yes replied a voice which bobby coon had never heard before but which he knew right away must belong to some one who had come from way down south where unc billy possum and ol mistah buzzard had come from yes said the voice ah done got all mah ol tricks and some more but its easy unc billy its easy to fool your new friends because ah reckon they never have been fooled this way before don yo think it is most time to stop ah dont want to show mahself in daylight besides if ahm found out nobody aint gwine to have anything to do with me  dont yo worry nobodys gwine to find yo out well keep it up just a day or two longer yo certnly am powerful good at imitating other peoples voices ah wonder that ol mistah buzzard hasnt got his eye on yo before now said unc billy possum  bobby coon had become wide awake as he listened he tried hard to get a peep at the stranger with unc billy but all he could see was a long tail of feathers bobby waited until unc billy and his friend had left then he crawled out of the hollow log and he was chuckling to himself  ill just have a little talk with ol mistah buzzard said bobby to himself     xx   bobby coon and ol mistah buzzard have a talk  bobby coon had spent the largest part of the forenoon sitting at the foot of the tall dead tree on which ol mistah buzzard likes to roost all the time ol mistah buzzard had been sailing round and round in circles way up in the blue blue sky sometimes so high that to bobby he looked like just a tiny speck bobby had watched him until his own neck ached mistah buzzard hardly ever moved his wings he just sailed and sailed and sailed up and down and round and round just as if it was no work at all but pure fun as indeed it was  bobby coon had waited so long that it was almost more than he could do to be patient any longer but if you really want a thing it is worth waiting for and so bobby gave a great sigh and tried to make himself more comfortable at last mistah buzzard came sailing down straight for the tall dead tree with two or three flaps of his great wings he settled down on his favorite perch and looked down at bobby coon  good moning brer coon said ol mistah buzzard  good morning mistah buzzard i hope you are feeling very well this morning replied bobby coon as politely as he knew how  fair to middling well said ol mistah buzzard with a twinkle in his eyes what can ah do fo yoall  if you please mistah buzzard you can tell me if there is anybody way down south where you come from who can make his voice sound just like the voices of other people is there bobby was using his very politest manner  certnly certnly chuckled ol mistah buzzard its mistah mockah the mockingbird why that bird just likes to go around making trouble he just naturally likes to he just goes around mocking everything and everybody he hears until sometimes it seems like yo couldnt be sure of yo own voice when yo hear it why do yo ask brer coon  because he is right here in the green forest now replied bobby coon  whats that yo am asaying brer coon whats that cried ol mistah buzzard growing very excited  then bobby coon told ol mistah buzzard all about the trouble on the green meadows and in the green forest how sammy jay had moved away to the old pasture so that no one could say that he screamed in the night and yet how his voice was still heard how stickytoes the tree toad was almost crazy because his neighbors said he was noisy when all the time he was sitting with his mouth tight closed and finally how all the little meadow and forest people refused to speak to one another because of the many unkind things which had been overheard and bobby told what he had overheard the night before when unc billy possum and a stranger had sat on the very log in which bobby had been taking a nap ol mistah buzzard chuckled  yo might have known unc billy was behind all that trouble said he yes sah yo might have known that ol rascal was behind it when unc billy possum and mockah get their haids together there sholy is gwine to be something doing     xxi   bobby coon has a busy day  bobby coon had left ol mistah buzzard sitting on his favorite dead tree every few minutes ol mistah buzzard would chuckle brer coon is right smart and ah reckon unc billy possum is gwine to get a taste of his own medicine yes sah ah reckon he is said ol mistah buzzard then he chuckled and chuckled as he spread his broad wings and said ah reckon ah better be up in the blue blue sky where ah can look right down and see all the fun  in the meantime bobby coon was hurrying back and forth across the green meadows and through the green forest calling on all the little people who live there he whispered a few words in the ear of one and then hurried on to whisper to the next one when bobby would first begin to whisper the one to whom he was whispering would shake his head and look as if he didnt believe a word of what bobby was saying then bobby would point to ol mistah buzzard sailing round and round high up in the blue blue sky where everybody could see him and whisper some more when he got through he always carried away with him a promise that just what he had asked should be done  bobby coon had thought of a plan to turn the joke on unc billy possum and this was why he was hurrying back and forth whispering in the ears of every one who lived on the green meadows and in the green forest that is everybody excepting unc billy possum and his family it was the busiest day that bobby coon could remember  it was the very next morning that unc billy possum was trotting along the crooked little path down the hill he was just starting out on his daily round of calls and he was grinning as only unc billy possum can grin    mah name is billy possum and mah homes a hollow tree   by day or night ah wander forthits all the same to me   ah fill mah stomach with an egg or sometimes it is fish   in fact ah always helps mahself to anything ah wish   fo mah name is billy possum and mah other name is smart   to catch yo uncle billy yo must make an early start  unc billy was singing this to himself as he trotted along the crooked little path and all the time he was thinking of the great joke that he and his old friend mr mocker from way down south were playing on the little people of the green meadows and the green forest  this morning he was on his way to call first on johnny chuck halfway down the hill he met bobby coon unc billy stopped and held out one hand as he said good moning brer coon how do yoall do this fine moning  bobby coon walked right past as if he didnt see unc billy at all he didnt even look at him  whats the matter with yo this moning brer coon shouted unc billy bobby coon kept right on without so much as turning his head unc billy watched him and there was a puzzled look on unc billys face must be that brer coon has something powerful impotant on his mind muttered unc billy as he started on  pretty soon he met jimmy skunk who had always been one of unc billys best friends jimmy was looking under every stick and stone for beetles for his breakfast  good moning neighbor skunk said unc billy in his heartiest voice  jimmy skunk who never hurries kept right on pulling over sticks and stones just as if he didnt see or hear unc billy at all in fact when he pulled over one stone he dropped it right on unc billys tail and didnt seem to hear unc billys ouch as he pulled his tail from under the stone jimmy just went right on about his business  unc billy sat down and scratched his head his face had lost the cheerful grin with which he had started out pretty soon he started on but every few minutes he would stop and scratch his head thoughtfully he didnt know what to make of bobby coon and jimmy skunk  he was so surprised that he hadnt known whether to be angry or not  ah must find out what brer chuck knows about it thought unc billy as he trotted on     xxii   unc billy possum sees many backs  unc billy possum was very sober as he hurried down the lone little path to johnny chucks house he was very sober indeed and that is very unusual for unc billy possum it was very plain to see that something was bothering him johnny chuck was sitting on his doorstep when unc billy possum came in sight trotting down the lone little path as soon as johnny saw him he turned his back squarely towards unc billy and pretended to be very much interested in something way off in the other direction unc billy came to a stop about two feet behind johnny chuck  ahem said unc billy  johnny chuck sat there without moving just as if he hadnt heard  its a fine moning said unc billy in his pleasantest voice  instead of replying johnny chuck suddenly kicked up his heels and disappeared inside his house unc billy scratched his head with one hand and then with the other and all the time his face grew more and more puzzledlooking after a while he started on pretty soon he came to where danny meadow mouse was playing all by himself he didnt know that unc billy was about until unc billy said good moning brer meadow mouse  now danny had always been delighted to see unc billy possum and to have a chat with him whenever unc billy would stop but this morning no sooner did danny hear unc billys voice than he turned his back to unc billy this was more than unc billy could stand he reached out to take danny meadow mouse by the ear to turn him around but somehow danny must have guessed what unc billy meant to do for without a word he ducked out of sight under the long grass and hunt as he would unc billy couldnt find him  so unc billy possum gave it up and went on down to the smiling pool there little joe otter and billy mink and jerry muskrat were at play they saw unc billy coming and when he reached the bank of the smiling pool there sat the three little scamps on the big rock but all he could see was their backs  hello yoalls shouted unc billy  splash all three had dived into the smiling pool and though unc billy waited and waited he didnt see one of them again even grandfather frog turned his back to him and seemed very deaf that morning though unc billy tried and tried to make him hear  all day long wherever he went unc billy saw only the backs of his friends and none of them seemed to see him at all so he went home to his hollow tree in the green forest early that day to try and study out what it all meant     xxiii   unc billy possum consults ol mistah buzzard  ol mistah buzzard has very sharp eyes nobody has sharper eyes than he swinging round and round and round and round in great circles way up in the blue blue sky so high that sometimes he looks like nothing but a little speck he looks down and sees everything going on in the green meadows and a great deal that goes on in the green forest there is very little that ol mistah buzzard misses so all the day that unc billy possum had been tramping over the green meadows and through the green forest and finding everybodys back turned to him ol mistah buzzard had been watching and laughing fit to kill himself you see he knew all about bobby coons visit to all the little meadow and forest people and how bobby had whispered in the ear of each that unc billy possum was partly to blame for all the trouble they had had lately  ol mistah buzzard watched unc billy go home and sit down with his chin in his hands and study and study just as if he had something on his mind by and by unc billy looked up in the sky where ol mistah buzzard was sailing round and round then unc billy hopped up mighty spry  ah reckon unc billy lows hell make me a visit said ol mistah buzzard with a chuckle as he slid down down out of the sky to the tall dead tree in the green forest which is his favorite roostingplace he hadnt been there long when unc billy possum came shuffling along just as if he was out walking for his health  howdy mistah buzzard ah certnly hopes yoall feel right smart said unc billy  ol mistah buzzards eyes twinkled as he replied ah feel right pert brer possum thank yo ah hopes yo feel the same yo look like nothing ever bothers yo  unc billy grinned but at the same time he looked a little foolish as he said thats right mistah buzzard thats right nothing ever does bother me and all the time he was wondering however he should ask for ol mistah buzzards advice and not let him know that something really was bothering him a great deal  ah watched yo take a long walk this moning brer possum said ol mistah buzzard  did yo indeed yo have keen eyes mistah buzzard replied unc billy  ah saw yo meet a lot of yo friends its fine to have a lot of friends isnt it brer possum said ol mistah buzzard  unc billy looked at ol mistah buzzard sharply he wondered if mistah buzzard had noticed that all those friends had turned their backs on unc billy that morning but mistah buzzard looked as sober and solemn as a judge all at once ol mistah buzzard hopped up and turned around so that all unc billy could see of him was his back unc billy stared and for a minute he couldnt find his tongue then he heard a noise that sounded very much like a chuckle in a few minutes it was a laugh finally unc billy began to laugh too  yo take mah advice and bring mah ol friend mockah out of his hidingplace and introduce him to the green meadows and the green forest said ol mistah buzzard  unc billy shook his head doubtfully he was afraid that they might not forgive the tricks that mr mocker had played on them and then of course he couldnt stay in the green forest so unc billy scratched his head and thought and thought of how he could get mr mocker out of the trouble he had got him into finally he went home and told all his troubles to old mrs possum and asked her advice as he should have done in the first place  serves yoalls right it certnly does serve yoalls right grunted mrs possum who was so busy looking after her eight lively babies that she had little time for fooling  ah know it it certnly does replied unc billy meekly    mischief always trots ahead of grim ol mistah trouble   they look and act enough alike to be each others double   whoever fools with mischiefs gwine to wake some day or other   and find that troubles just the same as mischiefs own twin brother  unc billy possum listened to this just as if he had never heard it before and nodded his head as if he agreed with every word of it old mrs possum grumbled and scolded but all the time she was thinking and unc billy knew that she was finally she finished sweeping the doorsteps and looked thoughtfully at unc billy  why dont yo give a party fo mistah mockingbird she inquired  the very thing cried unc billy and like a flash back came his oldtime grin     xxiv   unc billy possum gives a party  unc billy possums party was the greatest event in the green forest since the famous surprise party which peter rabbit gave when unc billys family arrived from way down in ol virginny at first unc billy had been afraid that no one would come you see he had been the cause of a lot of the trouble on the green meadows and in the green forest and he knew that now all the little meadow and forest people had found him out so he didnt dare send his invitations around by the merry little breezes of old mother west wind for fear that no one would pay any heed to them of course that meant that unc billy must take them around himself  my but that was hard work it was the hardest work that unc billy had ever done in all his life for you know unc billy is happygolucky and takes things easy but getting those invitations aroundwell as unc billy said he like to wore holes plumb through the soles of mah feet before he got all of them delivered it took him two whole days in the first place there were so many to see and then it was such hard work to deliver the invitations because when his old friends saw him they would promptly turn their backs to him and pretend they didnt see him at all then unc billy would take off his hat and make a sweeping bow just as if the one he was talking to was facing instead of back to him and he would say    ah begs yo pardon deed ah do   fo all the trouble ahve caused yo   and hopes that ah may sholy choke   if it was meant fo moren a joke   so please fogive ol uncle bill   and show yo friendship for him still   by taking this as an invite   to join with me next monday night   aroun mah famous hollow tree   and help me to full merry be   and also meet a friend of mine   ahm sho yos bound to like him fine  then unc billy would make another low bow and hurry on to the next one of course he couldnt tell whether or not any one would accept the invitation but he went right on with his plans just as if he expected everybody to be there and when the time came sure enough everybody was there even sammy jay to whom unc billy had sent a special invitation by ol mistah buzzard mistah buzzard had found sammy jay in the faraway old pasture and sammy had moved back to the green forest that very day  such a good time as everybody did have there were heaps and heaps of good things to eat they danced and played hide and seek finally unc billy climbed up on a stump he was dressed in his finest suit and he wore his broadest grin everybody crowded around to hear what unc billy was about to say  mah friends and neighbors said unc billy ah have a great surprise fo yoalls  then he stepped down and everybody began to wonder and to guess what the surprise could be     xxv   unc billy possums surprise  everybody was asking everybody else what the surprise could be which unc billy had said he had for them after he had made his speech he had scurried out of sight and no one could find him just about that time billy mink remembered that the party had been given to meet a friend of unc billy possum but no friend had appeared  billy mink spoke of the matter to little joe otter and little joe otter spoke of the matter to jerry muskrat and jerry muskrat spoke of the matter to sammy jay and right while he was speaking there came a shrill scream of thief thief thief from a thick hemlocktree near by and the voice was just like the voice of sammy jay  sammy jay became greatly excited there he cried you heard that when you was standing right in front of me and talking to me jerry muskrat you know that i wasnt making a sound i told you that i hadnt been screaming in the night and this proves it  jerry muskrat looked as if he couldnt believe his own ears just then the voice of stickytoes the tree toad began to croak its going to rain its going to rain its going to rain the voice seemed to come out of that very same hemlocktree everybody noticed it and looked up at the tree and while they were all trying to see stickytoes something dropped plop right into their midst it was stickytoes himself and he had dropped from another tree altogether  you hear it he shrieked dancing up and down he was so angry you hear it it isnt me is it thats my voice yet it isnt mine because im right here how can i be here and over there too tell me that  no one could tell him and stickytoes continued to scold and sputter and swell himself up with anger but everybody forgot stickytoes when they heard the voice of blacky the crow calling caw caw caw from the very same hemlocktree now no one knew that blacky the crow had come to the party for blacky never goes abroad at night  come out blacky they all shouted but no blacky appeared instead out of that magic hemlocktree poured a beautiful song so beautiful that when it ended everybody clapped their hands after that there was a perfect flood of music as if all the singers of the green forest and the green meadows were in that hemlocktree there was the song of mr redwing and the song of jenny wren and the sweet notes of carol the meadowlark and the beautiful happy song of little friend the song sparrow no one had ever heard anything like it and when it ended every one shouted for more even stickytoes the tree toad forgot his ill temper  instead of more music out from the hemlocktree flew a stranger he was about the size of sammy jay and wore a modest gray suit with white trimmings he flew over to a tall stump in the moonlight and no sooner had he alighted than up beside him scrambled unc billy possum unc billy wore his broadest grin  mah friends of the green forest and the green meadows ah wants yoalls to know mah friend mistah mockingbird who has come up from mah ol home way down in ol virginny he has the most wonderful voice in all the world and when he wants to he can make it sound just like the voice of any one of yoalls we uns is right sorry fo the trouble we uns have made it was all a joke and now we asks yo pardon mah friend mistah mockah would like to stay here and live if yoalls is willing said unc billy     xxvi   mr mocker makes himself at home  at first when the little meadow and forest people were asked to pardon the tricks that mr mocker and unc billy possum had played a few were inclined not to while they were talking the matter over mr mocker began to sing again that wonderful song of his it was so beautiful that by the time it was ended every one was ready to grant the pardon they crowded around him and because he is goodnatured he made his voice sound just like the voice of each one who spoke to him of course they thought that was great fun and by the time unc billy possums moonlight party broke up mr mocker knew that he had made so many friends that he could stay in the green forest as long as he pleased  but there were a lot of little people who were not at unc billy possums party because they go to bed instead of going out nights of course they heard all about the party the next morning and were very anxious indeed to see the stranger with the wonderful voice so mr mocker went calling with ol mistah buzzard and they visited all the little meadow and forest people who had not been at the party of course mr mocker had to show off his wonderful voice to each one when he had finished he was tuckered put was mr mocker but he was happy for now he had made friends and could live on the edge of the green forest with his old friends unc billy possum and ol mistah buzzard  so he soon made himself at home and because he was happy he would sing all day long and sometimes when the moon was shining he woke up in the night and would sing for very joy now peter rabbit thought the newcomers voice such a wonderful thing that he used to follow him around just to hear him fool others by making his voice sound like theirs it was great fun peter and mocker became great friends and so when peter heard it whispered around that mr mockingbird had not come by his wonderful voice honestly he didnt believe a word of it and was very indignant of course he couldnt go to mr mocker himself and ask him for he didnt want mr mocker to know that such unkind things were being said finally he thought of grandfather frog who is very old and very wise hell know said peter as off he posted to the smiling pool  if you please grandfather frog how does it happen that mr mocker has such a wonderful voice and can make it sound like the voice of any one whom he hears asked peter  now grandfather frog was feeling out of sorts that morning he hadnt heard the whisper that mr mocker had not come by his voice honestly and he thought that peter rabbit was asking just to hear a story  chugarum replied grandfather frog crossly go ask mr buzzard and that was all that peter could get out of him so not knowing what else to do off started peter rabbit to ask ol mistah buzzard where his friend mr mockingbird got such a wonderful voice  ol mistah buzzard laughed when he heard that some folks said that mr mocker had not come by his voice honestly  there isnt a word of truth in it brer rabbit he declared yo go tell all your friends that mistah mockah is the best loved of all the birds way down souf  and this is all for the present about the adventures of mr mocker the mockingbird but others have had adventures and one is jerry muskrat the next book will tell all about them   the end
