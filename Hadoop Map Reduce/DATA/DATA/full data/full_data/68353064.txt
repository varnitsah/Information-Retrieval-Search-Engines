68353064	a waif of the plains  by bret harte     chapter i   a long level of dull gray that further away became a faint blue with here and there darker patches that looked like water at times an open space blackened and burnt in an irregular circle with a shred of newspaper an old rag or broken tin can lying in the ashes beyond these always a low dark line that seemed to sink into the ground at night and rose again in the morning with the first light but never otherwise changed its height and distance a sense of always moving with some indefinite purpose but of always returning at night to the same placewith the same surroundings the same people the same bedclothes and the same awful black canopy dropped down from above a chalky taste of dust on the mouth and lips a gritty sense of earth on the fingers and an allpervading heat and smell of cattle  this was the great plains as they seemed to two children from the hooded depth of an emigrant wagon above the swaying heads of toiling oxen in the summer of 1852  it had appeared so to them for two weeks always the same and always without the least sense to them of wonder or monotony when they viewed it from the road walking beside the wagon there was only the team itself added to the unvarying picture one of the wagons bore on its canvas hood the inscription in large black letters off to california on the other root hog or die but neither of them awoke in the minds of the children the faintest idea of playfulness or jocularity perhaps it was difficult to connect the serious men who occasionally walked beside them and seemed to grow more taciturn and depressed as the day wore on with this past effusive pleasantry  yet the impressions of the two children differed slightly the eldest a boy of eleven was apparently new to the domestic habits and customs of a life to which the younger a girl of seven was evidently native and familiar the food was coarse and less skillfully prepared than that to which he had been accustomed there was a certain freedom and roughness in their intercourse a simplicity that bordered almost on rudeness in their domestic arrangements and a speech that was at times almost untranslatable to him he slept in his clothes wrapped up in blankets he was conscious that in the matter of cleanliness he was left to himself to overcome the difficulties of finding water and towels but it is doubtful if in his youthfulness it affected him more than a novelty he ate and slept well and found his life amusing only at times the rudeness of his companions or worse an indifference that made him feel his dependency upon them awoke a vague sense of some wrong that had been done to him which while it was voiceless to all others and even uneasily put aside by himself was still always slumbering in his childish consciousness  to the party he was known as an orphan put on the train at st jo by some relative of his stepmother to be delivered to another relative at sacramento as his stepmother had not even taken leave of him but had entrusted his departure to the relative with whom he had been lately living it was considered as an act of riddance and accepted as such by her party and even vaguely acquiesced in by the boy himself what consideration had been offered for his passage he did not know he only remembered that he had been told to make himself handy this he had done cheerfully if at times with the unskillfulness of a novice but it was not a peculiar or a menial task in a company where all took part in manual labor and where existence seemed to him to bear the charm of a prolonged picnic neither was he subjected to any difference of affection or treatment from mrs silsbee the mother of his little companion and the wife of the leader of the train prematurely old of illhealth and harassed with cares she had no time to waste in discriminating maternal tenderness for her daughter but treated the children with equal and unbiased querulousness  the rear wagon creaked swayed and rolled on slowly and heavily the hoofs of the draftoxen occasionally striking in the dust with a dull report sent little puffs like smoke on either side of the track within the children were playing keeping store the little girl as an opulent and extravagant customer was purchasing of the boy who sat behind a counter improvised from a nailkeg and the front seat most of the available contents of the wagon either under their own names or an imaginary one as the moment suggested and paying for them in the easy and liberal currency of dried beans and bits of paper change was given by the expeditious method of tearing the paper into smaller fragments the diminution of stock was remedied by buying the same article over again under a different name nevertheless in spite of these favorable commercial conditions the market seemed dull  i can show you a fine quality of sheeting at four cents a yard double width said the boy rising and leaning on his fingers on the counter as he had seen the shopmen do all wool and will wash he added with easy gravity  i can buy it cheaper at jacksons said the girl with the intuitive duplicity of her bargaining sex  very well said the boy i wont play any more  who cares said the girl indifferently the boy here promptly upset the counter the rolledup blanket which had deceitfully represented the desirable sheeting falling on the wagon floor it apparently suggested a new idea to the former salesman i say lets play damaged stock see ill tumble all the things down here right on top o the others and sell em for less than cost  the girl looked up the suggestion was bold bad and momentarily attractive but she only said no apparently from habit picked up her doll and the boy clambered to the front of the wagon the incomplete episode terminated at once with that perfect forgetfulness indifference and irresponsibility common to all young animals if either could have flown away or bounded off finally at that moment they would have done so with no more concern for preliminary detail than a bird or squirrel the wagon rolled steadily on the boy could see that one of the teamsters had climbed up on the tailboard of the preceding vehicle the other seemed to be walking in a dusty sleep  klauns said the girl  the boy without turning his head responded susy  wot are you going to be said the girl  goin to be repeated clarence  when you is growed explained susy  clarence hesitated his settled determination had been to become a pirate merciless yet discriminating but reading in a bethumbed guide to the plains that morning of fort lamarie and kit carson he had decided upon the career of a scout as being more accessible and requiring less water yet out of compassion for susys possible ignorance he said neither and responded with the american boys modest conventionality president it was safe required no embarrassing description and had been approved by benevolent old gentlemen with their hands on his head  im goin to be a parsons wife said susy and keep hens and have things giv to me baby clothes and apples and apple sassand melasses and more baby clothes and pork when you kill  she had thrown herself at the bottom of the wagon with her back towards him and her doll in her lap he could see the curve of her curly head and beyond her bare dimpled knees which were raised and over which she was trying to fold the hem of her brief skirt  i wouldnt be a presidents wife she said presently  you couldnt  could if i wanted to  couldnt  could now  couldnt  why  finding it difficult to explain his convictions of her ineligibility clarence thought it equally crushing not to give any there was a long silence it was very hot and dusty the wagon scarcely seemed to move clarence gazed at the vignette of the track behind them formed by the hood of the rear presently he rose and walked past her to the tailboard goin to get down he said putting his legs over  maw says no said susy  clarence did not reply but dropped to the ground beside the slowly turning wheels without quickening his pace he could easily keep his hand on the tailboard  klauns  he looked up  take me  she had already clapped on her sunbonnet and was standing at the edge of the tailboard her little arms extended in such perfect confidence of being caught that the boy could not resist he caught her cleverly they halted a moment and let the lumbering vehicle move away from them as it swayed from side to side as if laboring in a heavy sea they remained motionless until it had reached nearly a hundred yards and then with a sudden halfreal halfassumed but altogether delightful trepidation ran forward and caught up with it again this they repeated two or three times until both themselves and the excitement were exhausted and they again plodded on hand in hand presently clarence uttered a cry  my susylook there  the rear wagon had once more slipped away from them a considerable distance between it and them crossing its track a most extraordinary creature had halted  at first glance it seemed a doga discomfited shameless ownerless outcast of streets and byways rather than an honest stray of some drovers train it was so gaunt so dusty so greasy so slouching and so lazy but as they looked at it more intently they saw that the grayish hair of its back had a bristly ridge and there were great poisonouslooking dark blotches on its flanks and that the slouch of its haunches was a peculiarity of its figure and not the cowering of fear as it lifted its suspicious head towards them they could see that its thin lips too short to cover its white teeth were curled in a perpetual sneer  here doggie said clarence excitedly good dog come  susy burst into a triumphant laugh et taint no dog silly its er coyote  clarence blushed it wasnt the first time the pioneers daughter had shown her superior knowledge he said quickly to hide his discomfiture ill ketch him any way hes nothin morn a ki yi  ye cant tho said susy shaking her sunbonnet hes faster nor a hoss  nevertheless clarence ran towards him followed by susy when they had come within twenty feet of him the lazy creature without apparently the least effort took two or three limping bounds to one side and remained at the same distance as before they repeated this onset three or four times with more or less excitement and hilarity the animal evading them to one side but never actually retreating before them finally it occurred to them both that although they were not catching him they were not driving him away the consequences of that thought were put into shape by susy with roundeyed significance  klauns he bites  clarence picked up a hard sunbaked clod and running forward threw it at the coyote it was a clever shot and struck him on his slouching haunches he snapped and gave a short snarling yelp and vanished clarence returned with a victorious air to his companion but she was gazing intently in the opposite direction and for the first time he discovered that the coyote had been leading them half round a circle  klauns said susy with a hysterical little laugh  well  the wagons gone  clarence started it was true not only their wagon but the whole train of oxen and teamsters had utterly disappeared vanishing as completely as if they had been caught up in a whirlwind or engulfed in the earth even the low cloud of dust that usually marked their distant course by day was nowhere to be seen the long level plain stretched before them to the setting sun without a sign or trace of moving life or animation that great blue crystal bowl filled with dust and fire by day with stars and darkness by night which had always seemed to drop its rim round them everywhere and shut them in seemed to them now to have been lifted to let the train pass out and then closed down upon them forever     chapter ii   their first sensation was one of purely animal freedom  they looked at each other with sparkling eyes and long silent breaths but this spontaneous outburst of savage nature soon passed susys little hand presently reached forward and clutched clarences jacket the boy understood it and said quickly  they aint gone far and theyll stop as soon as they find us gone  they trotted on a little faster the sun they had followed every day and the fresh wagon tracks being their unfailing guides the keen cool air of the plains taking the place of that allpervading dust and smell of the perspiring oxen invigorating them with its breath  we aint skeered a bit are we said susy  whats there to be afraid of said clarence scornfully he said this none the less strongly because he suddenly remembered that they had been often left alone in the wagon for hours without being looked after and that their absence might not be noticed until the train stopped to encamp at dusk two hours later they were not running very fast yet either they were more tired than they knew or the air was thinner for they both seemed to breathe quickly suddenly clarence stopped  there they are now  he was pointing to a light cloud of dust in the faroff horizon from which the black hulk of a wagon emerged for a moment and was lost but even as they gazed the cloud seemed to sink like a fairy mirage to the earth again the whole train disappeared and only the empty stretching track returned they did not know that this seemingly flat and level plain was really undulatory and that the vanished train had simply dipped below their view on some further slope even as it had once before but they knew they were disappointed and that disappointment revealed to them the fact that they had concealed it from each other the girl was the first to succumb and burst into a quick spasm of angry tears that single act of weakness called out the boys pride and strength there was no longer an equality of suffering he had become her protector he felt himself responsible for both considering her no longer his equal he was no longer frank with her  theres nothin to booboo for he said with a halfaffected brusqueness so quit now theyll stop in a minit and send some one back for us shouldnt wonder if theyre doin it now  but susy with feminine discrimination detecting the hollow ring in his voice here threw herself upon him and began to beat him violently with her little fists they aint they aint they aint you know it how dare you then exhausted with her struggles she suddenly threw herself flat on the dry grass shut her eyes tightly and clutched at the stubble  get up said the boy with a pale determined face that seemed to have got much older  you leave me be said susy  do you want me to go away and leave you asked the boy  susy opened one blue eye furtively in the secure depths of her sunbonnet and gazed at his changed face  yees  he pretended to turn away but really to look at the height of the sinking sun  klauns  well  take me  she was holding up her hands he lifted her gently in his arms dropping her head over his shoulder now he said cheerfully you keep a good lookout that way and i this and well soon be there  the idea seemed to please her after clarence had stumbled on for a few moments she said do you see anything klauns  not yet  no more dont i this equality of perception apparently satisfied her presently she lay more limp in his arms she was asleep  the sun was sinking lower it had already touched the edge of the horizon and was level with his dazzled and straining eyes at times it seemed to impede his eager search and task his vision haze and black spots floated across the horizon and round wafers like duplicates of the sun glittered back from the dull surface of the plains then he resolved to look no more until he had counted fifty a hundred but always with the same result the return of the empty unending plainsthe disk growing redder as it neared the horizon the fire it seemed to kindle as it sank but nothing more  staggering under his burden he tried to distract himself by fancying how the discovery of their absence would be made he heard the listless halfquerulous discussion about the locality that regularly pervaded the nightly camp he heard the discontented voice of jake silsbee as he halted beside the wagon and said come out o that now you two and mighty quick about it he heard the command harshly repeated he saw the look of irritation on silsbees dusty bearded face that followed his hurried glance into the empty wagon he heard the query whats gone o them limbs now handed from wagon to wagon he heard a few oaths mrs silsbees high rasping voice abuse of himself the hurried and discontented detachment of a search party silsbee and one of the hired men and vociferation and blame blame always for himself the elder who might have known better a little fear perhaps but he could not fancy either pity or commiseration perhaps the thought upheld his pride under the prospect of sympathy he might have broken down  at last he stumbled and stopped to keep himself from falling forward on his face he could go no further his breath was spent he was dripping with perspiration his legs were trembling under him there was a roaring in his ears round red disks of the sun were scattered everywhere around him like spots of blood to the right of the trail there seemed to be a slight mound where he could rest awhile and yet keep his watchful survey of the horizon but on reaching it he found that it was only a tangle of taller mesquite grass into which he sank with his burden nevertheless if useless as a point of vantage it offered a soft couch for susy who seemed to have fallen quite naturally into her usual afternoon siesta and in a measure it shielded her from a cold breeze that had sprung up from the west utterly exhausted himself but not daring to yield to the torpor that seemed to be creeping over him clarence half sat half knelt down beside her supporting himself with one hand and partly hidden in the long grass kept his straining eyes fixed on the lonely track  the red disk was sinking lower it seemed to have already crumbled away a part of the distance with its eating fires as it sank still lower it shot out long luminous rays diverging fanlike across the plain as if in the boys excited fancy it too were searching for the lost estrays and as one long beam seemed to linger over his hidingplace he even thought that it might serve as a guide to silsbee and the other seekers and was constrained to stagger to his feet erect in its light but it soon sank and with it clarence dropped back again to his crouching watch yet he knew that the daylight was still good for an hour and with the withdrawal of that mystic sunset glory objects became even more distinct and sharply defined than at any other time and with the merciful sheathing of that flaming sword which seemed to have swayed between him and the vanished train his eyes already felt a blessed relief     chapter iii   with the setting of the sun an ominous silence fell he could hear the low breathing of susy and even fancied he could hear the beating of his own heart in that oppressive hush of all nature for the days march had always been accompanied by the monotonous creaking of wheels and axles and even the quiet of the night encampment had been always more or less broken by the movement of unquiet sleepers on the wagon beds or the breathing of the cattle but here there was neither sound nor motion susys prattle and even the sound of his own voice would have broken the benumbing spell but it was a part of his growing selfdenial now that he refrained from waking her even by a whisper she would awaken soon enough to thirst and hunger perhaps and then what was he to do if that lookedfor help would only come nowwhile she still slept for it was part of his boyish fancy that if he could deliver her asleep and undemonstrative of fear and suffering he would be less blameful and she less mindful of her trouble if it did not comebut he would not think of that yet if she was thirsty meantimewell it might rain and there was always the dew which they used to brush off the morning grass he would take off his shirt and catch it in that like a shipwrecked mariner it would be funny and make her laugh for himself he would not laugh he felt he was getting very old and grown up in this loneliness  it was getting darkerthey should be looking into the wagons now a new doubt began to assail him ought he not now that he was rested make the most of the remaining moments of daylight and before the glow faded from the west when he would no longer have any bearings to guide him but there was always the risk of waking herto what the fear of being confronted again with her fear and of being unable to pacify her at last decided him to remain but he crept softly through the grass and in the dust of the track traced the four points of the compass as he could still determine them by the sunset light with a large printed w to indicate the west this boyish contrivance particularly pleased him if he had only had a pole a stick or even a twig on which to tie his handkerchief and erect it above the clump of mesquite as a signal to the searchers in case they should be overcome by fatigue or sleep he would have been happy but the plain was barren of brush or timber he did not dream that this omission and the very unobtrusiveness of his hidingplace would be his salvation from a greater danger  with the coming darkness the wind arose and swept the plain with a longdrawn sigh this increased to a murmur till presently the whole expansebefore sunk in awful silenceseemed to awake with vague complaints incessant sounds and low moanings at times he thought he heard the halloaing of distant voices at times it seemed as a whisper in his own ear in the silence that followed each blast he fancied he could detect the creaking of the wagon the dull thud of the oxens hoofs or broken fragments of speech blown and scattered even as he strained his ears to listen by the next gust this tension of the ear began to confuse his brain as his eyes had been previously dazzled by the sunlight and a strange torpor began to steal over his faculties once or twice his head dropped  he awoke with a start a moving figure had suddenly uplifted itself between him and the horizon it was not twenty yards away so clearly outlined against the still luminous sky that it seemed even nearer a human figure but so disheveled so fantastic and yet so mean and puerile in its extravagance that it seemed the outcome of a childish dream it was a mounted figure but so ludicrously disproportionate to the pony it bestrode whose slim legs were stiffly buried in the dust in a breathless halt that it might have been a straggler from some vulgar wandering circus a tall hat crownless and rimless a castaway of civilization surmounted by a turkeys feather was on its head over its shoulders hung a dirty tattered blanket that scarcely covered the two painted legs which seemed clothed in soiled yellow hose in one hand it held a gun the other was bent above its eyes in eager scrutiny of some distant point beyond and east of the spot where the children lay concealed presently with a dozen quick noiseless strides of the ponys legs the apparition moved to the right its gaze still fixed on that mysterious part of the horizon there was no mistaking it now the painted hebraic face the large curved nose the bony cheek the broad mouth the shadowed eyes the straight long matted locks it was an indian not the picturesque creature of clarences imagination but still an indian the boy was uneasy suspicious antagonistic but not afraid he looked at the heavy animal face with the superiority of intelligence at the halfnaked figure with the conscious supremacy of dress at the lower individuality with the contempt of a higher race yet a moment after when the figure wheeled and disappeared towards the undulating west a strange chill crept over him yet he did not know that in this puerile phantom and painted pigmy the awful majesty of death had passed him by  mamma  it was susys voice struggling into consciousness perhaps she had been instinctively conscious of the boys sudden fears  hush  he had just turned to the objective point of the indians gaze there was something a dark line was moving along with the gathering darkness for a moment he hardly dared to voice his thoughts even to himself it was a following train overtaking them from the rear and from the rapidity of its movements a train with horses hurrying forward to evening camp he had never dreamt of help from that quarter this was what the indians keen eyes had been watching and why he had so precipitately fled  the strange train was now coming up at a round trot it was evidently well appointed with five or six large wagons and several outriders in half an hour it would be here yet he refrained from waking susy who had fallen asleep again his old superstition of securing her safety first being still uppermost he took off his jacket to cover her shoulders and rearranged her nest then he glanced again at the coming train but for some unaccountable reason it had changed its direction and instead of following the track that should have brought it to his side it had turned off to the left in ten minutes it would pass abreast of him a mile and a half away if he woke susy now he knew she would be helpless in her terror and he could not carry her half that distance he might rush to the train himself and return with help but he would never leave her alonein the darkness never if she woke she would die of fright perhaps or wander blindly and aimlessly away no the train would pass and with it that hope of rescue something was in his throat but he gulped it down and was quiet again albeit he shivered in the night wind  the train was nearly abreast of him now he ran out of the tall grass waving his straw hat above his head in the faint hope of attracting attention but he did not go far for he found to his alarm that when he turned back again the clump of mesquite was scarcely distinguishable from the rest of the plain this settled all question of his going even if he reached the train and returned with some one how would he ever find her again in this desolate expanse  he watched the train slowly passstill mechanically almost hopelessly waving his hat as he ran up and down before the mesquite as if he were waving a last farewell to his departing hope suddenly it appeared to him that three of the outriders who were preceding the first wagon had changed their shape they were no longer sharp oblong black blocks against the horizon but had become at first blurred and indistinct then taller and narrower until at last they stood out like exclamation points against the sky he continued to wave his hat they continued to grow taller and narrower he understood it nowthe three transformed blocks were the outriders coming towards him  this is what he had seen  drawing of three black blocks  this is what he saw now      he ran back to susy to see if she still slept for his foolish desire to have her saved unconsciously was stronger than ever now that safety seemed so near she was still sleeping although she had moved slightly he ran to the front again  the outriders had apparently halted what were they doing why wouldnt they come on  suddenly a blinding flash of light seemed to burst from one of them away over his head something whistled like a rushing bird and sped off invisible they had fired a gun they were signaling to himclarencelike a grownup man he would have given his life at that moment to have had a gun but he could only wave his hat frantically  one of the figures here bore away and impetuously darted forward again he was coming nearer powerful gigantic formidable as he loomed through the darkness all at once he threw up his arm with a wild gesture to the others and his voice manly frank and assuring came ringing before him  hold up good god its no injunits a child  in another moment he had reined up beside clarence and leaned over him bearded handsome powerful and protecting  hallo whats all this what are you doing here  lost from mr silsbees train said clarence pointing to the darkened west  losthow long  about three hours i thought theyd come back for us said clarence apologetically to this big kindly man  and you kalkilated to wait here for em  yes yesi didtill i saw you  then why in thunder didnt you light out straight for us instead of hanging round here and drawing us out  the boy hung his head he knew his reasons were unchanged but all at once they seemed very foolish and unmanly to speak out  only that we were on the keen jump for injins continued the stranger we wouldnt have seen you at all and might hev shot you when we did what possessed you to stay here  the boy was still silent klauns said a faint sleepy voice from the mesquite take me the rifleshot had awakened susy  the stranger turned quickly towards the sound clarence started and recalled himself there he said bitterly youve done it now youve wakened her thats why i stayed i couldnt carry her over there to you i couldnt let her walk for shed be frightened i wouldnt wake her up for shed be frightened and i mightnt find her again there he had made up his mind to be abused but he was reckless now that she was safe  the men glanced at each other then said the spokesman quietly you didnt strike out for us on account of your sister  she aint my sister said clarence quickly shes a little girl shes mrs silsbees little girl we were in the wagon and got down its my fault i helped her down  the three men reined their horses closely round him leaning forward from their saddles with their hands on their knees and their heads on one side then said the spokesman gravely you just reckoned to stay here old man and take your chances with her rather than run the risk of frightening or leaving herthough it was your one chance of life  yes said the boy scornful of this feeble grownup repetition  come here  the boy came doggedly forward the man pushed back the wellworn straw hat from clarences forehead and looked into his lowering face with his hand still on the boys head he turned him round to the others and said quietly  suthin of a pup eh  you bet they responded  the voice was not unkindly although the speaker had thrown his lower jaw forward as if to pronounce the word pup with a humorous suggestion of a mastiff before clarence could make up his mind if the epithet was insulting or not the man put out his stirruped foot and with a gesture of invitation said jump up  but susy said clarence drawing back  look shes making up to phil already  clarence looked susy had crawled out of the mesquite and with her sunbonnet hanging down her back her curls tossed around her face still flushed with sleep and clarences jacket over her shoulders was gazing up with grave satisfaction in the laughing eyes of one of the men who was with outstretched hands bending over her could he believe his senses the terrorstricken willful unmanageable susy whom he would have translated unconsciously to safety without this terrible ordeal of being awakened to the loss of her home and parents at any sacrifice to himselfthis ingenuous infant was absolutely throwing herself with every appearance of forgetfulness into the arms of the first newcomer yet his perception of this fact was accompanied by no sense of ingratitude for her sake he felt relieved and with a boyish smile of satisfaction and encouragement vaulted into the saddle before the stranger     chapter iv   the dash forward to the train securely held in the saddle by the arms of their deliverers was a secret joy to the children that seemed only too quickly over the resistless gallop of the fiery mustangs the rush of the night wind the gathering darkness in which the distant wagons now halted and facing them looked like domed huts in the horizonall these seemed but a delightful and fitting climax to the events of the day in the sublime forgetfulness of youth all they had gone through had left no embarrassing record behind it they were willing to repeat their experiences on the morrow confident of some equally happy end and when clarence timidly reaching his hand towards the horsehair reins lightly held by his companion had them playfully yielded up to him by that hold and confident rider the boy felt himself indeed a man  but a greater surprise was in store for them as they neared the wagons now formed into a circle with a certain degree of military formality they could see that the appointments of the strange party were larger and more liberal than their own or indeed anything they had ever known of the kind forty or fifty horses were tethered within the circle and the camp fires were already blazing before one of them a large tent was erected and through the parted flaps could be seen a table actually spread with a white cloth was it a school feast or was this their ordinary household arrangement clarence and susy thought of their own dinners usually laid on bare boards beneath the sky or under the low hood of the wagon in rainy weather and marveled and when they finally halted and were lifted from their horses and passed one wagon fitted up as a bedroom and another as a kitchen they could only nudge each other with silent appreciation but here again the difference already noted in the quality of the sensations of the two children was observable both were equally and agreeably surprised but susys wonder was merely the sense of novelty and inexperience and a slight disbelief in the actual necessity of what she saw while clarence whether from some previous general experience or peculiar temperament had the conviction that what he saw here was the usual custom and what he had known with the silsbees was the novelty the feeling was attended with a slight sense of wounded pride for susy as if her enthusiasm had exposed her to ridicule  the man who had carried him and seemed to be the head of the party had already preceded them to the tent and presently reappeared with a lady with whom he had exchanged a dozen hurried words they seemed to refer to him and susy but clarence was too much preoccupied with the fact that the lady was pretty that her clothes were neat and thoroughly clean that her hair was tidy and not rumpled and that although she wore an apron it was as clean as her gown and even had ribbons on it to listen to what was said and when she ran eagerly forward and with a fascinating smile lifted the astonished susy in her arms clarence in his delight for his young charge quite forgot that she had not noticed him the bearded man who seemed to be the ladys husband evidently pointed out the omission with some additions that clarence could not catch for after saying with a pretty pout well why shouldnt he she came forward with the same dazzling smile and laid her small and clean white hand upon his shoulder  and so you took good care of the dear little thing shes such an angel isnt she and you must love her very much  clarence colored with delight it was true it had never occurred to him to look at susy in the light of a celestial visitant and i fear he was just then more struck with the fair complimenter than the compliment to his companion but he was pleased for her sake he was not yet old enough to be conscious of the sexs belief in its irresistible domination over mankind at all ages and that johnny in his check apron would be always a hopeless conquest of jeannette in her pinafore and that he ought to have been in love with susy  howbeit the lady suddenly whisked her away to the recesses of her own wagon to reappear later washed curled and beribboned like a new doll and clarence was left alone with the husband and another of the party  well my boy you havent told me your name yet  clarence sir  so susy calls you but what else  clarence brant  any relation to colonel brant asked the second man carelessly  he was my father said the boy brightening under this faint prospect of recognition in his loneliness  the two men glanced at each other the leader looked at the boy curiously and said  are you the son of colonel brant of louisville  yes sir said the boy with a dim stirring of uneasiness in his heart but hes dead now he added finally  ah when did he die said the man quickly  oh a long time ago i dont remember him much i was very little said the boy half apologetically  ah you dont remember him  no said clarence shortly he was beginning to fall back upon that certain dogged repetition which in sensitive children arises from their hopeless inability to express their deeper feelings he also had an instinctive consciousness that this want of a knowledge of his father was part of that vague wrong that had been done him it did not help his uneasiness that he could see that one of the two men who turned away with a halflaugh misunderstood or did not believe him  how did you come with the silsbees asked the first man  clarence repeated mechanically with a childs distaste of practical details how he had lived with an aunt at st jo and how his stepmother had procured his passage with the silsbees to california where he was to meet his cousin all this with a lack of interest and abstraction that he was miserably conscious told against him but he was yet helpless to resist  the first man remained thoughtful and then glanced at clarences sunburnt hands presently his large goodhumored smile returned  well i suppose you are hungry  yes said clarence shyly but  but what  i should like to wash myself a little he returned hesitatingly thinking of the clean tent the clean lady and susys ribbons  certainly said his friend with a pleased look come with me instead of leading clarence to the battered tin basin and bar of yellow soap which had formed the toilet service of the silsbee party he brought the boy into one of the wagons where there was a washstand a china basin and a cake of scented soap standing beside clarence he watched him perform his ablutions with an approving air which rather embarrassed his protege presently he said almost abruptly  do you remember your fathers house at louisville  yes sir but it was a long time ago  clarence remembered it as being very different from his home at st josephs but from some innate feeling of diffidence he would have shrunk from describing it in that way he however said he thought it was a large house yet the modest answer only made his new friend look at him the more keenly  your father was colonel hamilton brant of louisville wasnt he he said halfconfidentially  yes said clarence hopelessly  well said his friend cheerfully as if dismissing an abstruse problem from his mind lets go to supper  when they reached the tent again clarence noticed that the supper was laid only for his host and wife and the second manwho was familiarly called harry but who spoke of the former always as mr and mrs peytonwhile the remainder of the party a dozen men were at a second camp fire and evidently enjoying themselves in a picturesque fashion had the boy been allowed to choose he would have joined them partly because it seemed more manly and partly that he dreaded a renewal of the questioning  but here susy sitting bolt upright on an extemporized high stool happily diverted his attention by pointing to the empty chair beside her  klauns she said suddenly with her usual clear and appalling frankness they is chickens and hamanaigs and hot biksquits and lasses and mister peyton says i kin have em all  clarence who had begun suddenly to feel that he was responsible for susys deportment and was balefully conscious that she was holding her plated fork in her chubby fist by its middle and from his previous knowledge of her was likely at any moment to plunge it into the dish before her said softly  hush  yes you shall dear said mrs peyton with tenderly beaming assurance to susy and a halfreproachful glance at the boy eat what you like darling  its a fork whispered the still uneasy clarence as susy now seemed inclined to stir her bowl of milk with it  taint now klauns its only a split spoon said susy  but mrs peyton in her rapt admiration took small note of these irregularities plying the child with food forgetting her own meal and only stopping at times to lift back the forward straying curls on susys shoulders mr peyton looked on gravely and contentedly suddenly the eyes of husband and wife met  shed have been nearly as old as this john said mrs peyton in a faint voice  john peyton nodded without speaking and turned his eyes away into the gathering darkness the man harry also looked abstractedly at his plate as if he was saying grace clarence wondered who she was and why two little tears dropped from mrs peytons lashes into susys milk and whether susy might not violently object to it he did not know until later that the peytons had lost their only child and susy comfortably drained this mingled cup of a mothers grief and tenderness without suspicion  i suppose well come up with their train early tomorrow if some of them dont find us tonight said mrs peyton with a long sigh and a regretful glance at susy perhaps we might travel together for a little while she added timidly  harry laughed and mr peyton replied gravely i am afraid we wouldnt travel with them even for companys sake and he added in a lower and graver voice its rather odd the search party hasnt come upon us yet though im keeping pete and hank patrolling the trail to meet them  its heartlessso it is said mrs peyton with sudden indignation it would be all very well if it was only this boy who can take care of himself but to be so careless of a mere baby like this its shameful  for the first time clarence tasted the cruelty of discrimination all the more keenly that he was beginning to worship after his boyish fashion this sweetfaced clean and tenderhearted woman perhaps mr peyton noticed it for he came quietly to his aid  maybe they knew better than we in what careful hands they had left her he said with a cheerful nod towards clarence and again they may have been fooled as we were by injin signs and left the straight road  this suggestion instantly recalled to clarence his vision in the mesquite should he dare tell them would they believe him or would they laugh at him before her he hesitated and at last resolved to tell it privately to the husband when the meal was ended and he was made happy by mrs peytons laughing acceptance of his offer to help her clear the table and wash the dishes they all gathered comfortably in front of the tent before the large camp fire at the other fire the rest of the party were playing cards and laughing but clarence no longer cared to join them he was quite tranquil in the maternal propinquity of his hostess albeit a little uneasy as to his reticence about the indian  klauns said susy relieving a momentary pause in her highest voice knows how to speak speak klauns  it appearing from clarences blushing explanation that this gift was not the ordinary faculty of speech but a capacity to recite verse he was politely pressed by the company for a performance  speak em klauns the boy what stood unto the burnin deck and said the boy oh where was he said susy comfortably lying down on mrs peytons lap and contemplating her bare knees in the air its bout a boy she added confidentially to mrs peyton whose father wouldnt never never stay with him on a burnin ship though he said stay father stay ever so much  with this clear lucid and perfectly satisfactory explanation of mrs hemanss casabianca clarence began unfortunately his actual rendering of this popular school performance was more an effort of memory than anything else and was illustrated by those wooden gestures which a western schoolmaster had taught him he described the flames that roared around him by indicating with his hand a perfect circle of which he was the axis he adjured his father the late admiral casabianca by clasping his hands before his chin as if wanting to be manacled in an attitude which he was miserably conscious was unlike anything he himself had ever felt or seen before he described that father faint in death below and the flag on high with one single motion yet something that the verses had kindled in his active imagination perhaps rather than an illustration of the verses themselves at times brightened his gray eyes became tremulous in his youthful voice and i fear occasionally incoherent on his lips at times when not conscious of his affected art the plain and all upon it seemed to him to slip away into the night the blazing camp fire at his feet to wrap him in a fateful glory and a vague devotion to somethinghe knew not whatso possessed him that he communicated it and probably some of his own youthful delight in extravagant voice to his hearers until when he ceased with a glowing face he was surprised to find that the card players had deserted their camp fires and gathered round the tent     chapter v   you didnt say stay father stay enough klauns said susy critically then suddenly starting upright in mrs peytons lap she continued rapidly i kin dance and sing i kin dance high jambooree  whats high jambooree dear asked mrs peyton  youll see lemme down and susy slipped to the ground  the dance of high jambooree evidently of remote mystical african origin appeared to consist of three small skips to the right and then to the left accompanied by the holding up of very short skirts incessant teetering on the toes of small feet the exhibition of much bare knee and stocking and a gurgling accompaniment of childish laughter vehemently applauded it left the little performer breathless but invincible and ready for fresh conquest  i kin sing too she gasped hurriedly as if unwilling that the applause should lapse i kin sing oh dear klauns piteously what is it i sing  ben bolt suggested clarence  oh yes oh dont you remember sweet alers ben bolt began susy in the same breath and the wrong key sweet alers with hair so brown who wept with delight when you givd her a smile and with knitted brows and appealing recitative whats er rest of it klauns  who trembled with fear at your frown prompted clarence  who trembled with fear at my frown shrilled susy i forget er rest wait i kin sing  praise god suggested clarence  yes here susy a regular attendant in camp and prayermeetings was on firmer ground  promptly lifting her high treble yet with a certain acquired deliberation she began praise god from whom all blessings flow at the end of the second line the whispering and laughing ceased a deep voice to the right that of the champion poker player suddenly rose on the swell of the third line he was instantly followed by a dozen ringing voices and by the time the last line was reached it was given with a full chorus in which the dull chant of teamsters and drivers mingled with the soprano of mrs peyton and susys childish treble again and again it was repeated with forgetful eyes and abstracted faces rising and falling with the night wind and the leap and gleam of the camp fires and fading again like them in the immeasurable mystery of the darkened plain  in the deep and embarrassing silence that followed at last the party hesitatingly broke up mrs peyton retiring with susy after offering the child to clarence for a perfunctory goodnight kiss an unusual proceeding which somewhat astonished them bothand clarence found himself near mr peyton  i think said clarence timidly i saw an injin today  mr peyton bent down towards him an injinwhere he asked quickly with the same look of doubting interrogatory with which he had received clarences name and parentage  the boy for a moment regretted having spoken but with his old doggedness he particularized his statement fortunately being gifted with a keen perception he was able to describe the stranger accurately and to impart with his description that contempt for its subject which he had felt and which to his frontier auditor established its truthfulness peyton turned abruptly away but presently returned with harry and another man  you are sure of this said peyton halfencouragingly  yes sir  as sure as you are that your father is colonel brant and is dead said harry with a light laugh  tears sprang into the boys lowering eyes i dont lie he said doggedly  i believe you clarence said peyton quietly but why didnt you say it before  i didnt like to say it before susy andher stammered the boy  her  yes sirmrs peyton said clarence blushingly  oh said harry sarcastically how blessed polite we are  thatll do let up on him will you said peyton roughly to his subordinate the boy knows what hes about but he continued addressing clarence how was it the injin didnt see you  i was very still on account of not waking susy said clarence and he hesitated  and what  he seemed more keen watching what you were doing said the boy boldly  thats so broke in the second man who happened to be experienced and as he was to windard o the boy he was off his scent and bearings he was one of their rear scouts the rest o thems ahead crossing our track to cut us off ye didnt see anything else  i saw a coyote first said clarence greatly encouraged  hold on said the expert as harry turned away with a sneer thats a sign too wolf dont go where wolf hez been and coyote dont foller injinstheres no pickins how long afore did you see the coyote  just after we left the wagon said clarence  thats it said the man thoughtfully he was driven on ahead or hanging on their flanks these injins are betwixt us and that ar train or following it  peyton made a hurried gesture of warning as if reminding the speaker of clarences presencea gesture which the boy noticed and wondered at then the conversation of the three men took a lower tone although clarence distinctly heard the concluding opinion of the expert  it aint no good now mr peyton and youd be only exposing yourself on their ground by breakin camp agin tonight and you dont know that it aint us theyre watchin you see if we hadnt turned off the straight road when we got that first scare from these yer lost children we might hev gone on and walked plump into some cursed trap of those devils to my mind were just in nigger luck and with a good watch and my patrol were all right to be fixed where we be till daylight  mr peyton presently turned away taking clarence with him as well be up early and on the track of your train tomorrow my boy you had better turn in now ive put you up in my wagon and as i expect to be in the saddle most of the night i reckon i wont trouble you much he led the way to a second wagondrawn up beside the one where susy and mrs peyton had retiredwhich clarence was surprised to find fitted with a writing table and desk a chair and even a bookshelf containing some volumes a long locker fitted like a lounge had been made up as a couch for him with the unwonted luxury of clean white sheets and pillowcases a soft matting covered the floor of the heavy wagon bed which mr peyton explained was hung on centre springs to prevent jarring the sides and roof of the vehicle were of lightly paneled wood instead of the usual hooked canvas frame of the ordinary emigrant wagon and fitted with a glazed door and movable window for light and air clarence wondered why the big powerful man who seemed at home on horseback should ever care to sit in this office like a merchant or a lawyer and if this train sold things to the other trains or took goods like the peddlers to towns on the route but there seemed to be nothing to sell and the other wagons were filled with only the goods required by the party he would have liked to ask mr peyton who he was and have questioned him as freely as he himself had been questioned but as the average adult man never takes into consideration the injustice of denying to the natural and even necessary curiosity of childhood that questioning which he himself is so apt to assume without right and almost always without delicacy clarence had no recourse yet the boy like all children was conscious that if he had been afterwards questioned about this inexplicable experience he would have been blamed for his ignorance concerning it left to himself presently and ensconced between the sheets he lay for some moments staring about him the unwonted comfort of his couch so different from the stuffy blanket in the hard wagon bed which he had shared with one of the teamsters and the novelty order and cleanliness of his surroundings while they were grateful to his instincts began in some vague way to depress him to his loyal nature it seemed a tacit infidelity to his former rough companions to be lying here he had a dim idea that he had lost that independence which equal discomfort and equal pleasure among them had given him there seemed a sense of servitude in accepting this luxury which was not his this set him endeavoring to remember something of his fathers house of the large rooms drafty staircases and faroff ceilings and the cold formality of a life that seemed made up of strange faces some strangerhis parents some kinderthe servants particularly the black nurse who had him in charge why did mr peyton ask him about it why if it were so important to strangers had not his mother told him more of it and why was she not like this good woman with the gentle voice who was so kind toto susy and what did they mean by making him so miserable something rose in his throat but with an effort he choked it back and creeping from the lounge went softly to the window opened it to see if it would work and looked out the shrouded camp fires the stars that glittered but gave no light the dim moving bulk of a patrol beyond the circle all seemed to intensify the darkness and changed the current of his thoughts he remembered what mr peyton had said of him when they first met suthin of a pup aint he surely that meant something that was not bad he crept back to the couch again  lying there still awake he reflected that he wouldnt be a scout when he grew up but would be something like mr peyton and have a train like this and invite the silsbees and susy to accompany him for this purpose he and susy early tomorrow morning would get permission to come in here and play at that game this would familiarize him with the details so that he would be able at any time to take charge of it he was already an authority on the subject of indians he had once been fired atas an indian he would always carry a rifle like that hanging from the hooks at the end of the wagon before him and would eventually slay many indians and keep an account of them in a big book like that on the desk susy would help him having grown up a lady and they would both together issue provisions and rations from the door of the wagon to the gathered crowds he would be known as the white chief his indian name being suthin of a pup he would have a circus van attached to the train in which he would occasionally perform he would also have artillery for protection there would be a terrific engagement and he would rush into the wagon heated and blackened with gunpowder and susy would put down an account of it in a book and mrs peytonfor she would be there in some vague capacitywould say really now i dont see but what we were very lucky in having such a boy as clarence with us i begin to understand him better and harry who for purposes of vague poetical retaliation would also drop in at that moment would mutter and say he is certainly the son of colonel brant dear me and apologize and his mother would come in also in her coldest and most indifferent manner in a white ball dress and start and say good gracious how that boy has grown i am sorry i did not see more of him when he was young yet even in the midst of this came a confusing numbness and then the side of the wagon seemed to melt away and he drifted out again alone into the empty desolate plain from which even the sleeping susy had vanished and he was left deserted and forgotten then all was quiet in the wagon and only the night wind moving round it but lo the lashes of the sleeping white chiefthe dauntless leader the ruthless destroyer of indianswere wet with glittering tears  yet it seemed only a moment afterwards that he awoke with a faint consciousness of some arrested motion to his utter consternation the sun three hours high was shining in the wagon already hot and stifling in its beams there was the familiar smell and taste of the dirty road in the air about him there was a faint creaking of boards and springs a slight oscillation and beyond the audible rattle of harness as if the train had been under way the wagon moving and then there had been a sudden halt they had probably come up with the silsbee train in a few moments the change would be effected and all of his strange experience would be over he must get up now yet with the morning laziness of the healthy young animal he curled up a moment longer in his luxurious couch  how quiet it was there were faroff voices but they seemed suppressed and hurried through the window he saw one of the teamsters run rapidly past him with a strange breathless preoccupied face halt a moment at one of the following wagons and then run back again to the front  then two of the voices came nearer with the dull beating of hoofs in the dust  rout out the boy and ask him said a halfsuppressed impatient voice which clarence at once recognized as the man harrys  hold on till peyton comes up said the second voice in a low tone leave it to him  better find out what they were like at once grumbled harry  wait stand back said peytons voice joining the others ill ask him  clarence looked wonderingly at the door it opened on mr peyton dusty and dismounted with a strange abstracted look in his face  how many wagons are in your train clarence  three sir  any marks on them  yes sir said clarence eagerly off to california and root hog or die  mr peytons eye seemed to leap up and hold clarences with a sudden strange significance and then looked down  how many were you in all he continued  five and there was mrs silsbee  no other woman  no  get up and dress yourself he said gravely and wait here till i come back keep cool and have your wits about you he dropped his voice slightly perhaps somethings happened that youll have to show yourself a little man again for clarence  the door closed and the boy heard the same muffled hoofs and voices die away towards the front he began to dress himself mechanically almost vacantly yet conscious always of a vague undercurrent of thrilling excitement when he had finished he waited almost breathlessly feeling the same beating of his heart that he had felt when he was following the vanished train the day before at last he could stand the suspense no longer and opened the door everything was still in the motionless caravan exceptit struck him oddly even thenthe unconcerned prattling voice of susy from one of the nearer wagons perhaps a sudden feeling that this was something that concerned her perhaps an irresistible impulse overcame him but the next moment he had leaped to the ground faced about and was running feverishly to the front  the first thing that met his eyes was the helpless and desolate bulk of one of the silsbee wagons a hundred rods away bereft of oxen and pole standing alone and motionless against the dazzling sky near it was the broken frame of another wagon its fore wheels and axles gone pitched forward on its knees like an ox under the butchers sledge not far away there were the burnt and blackened ruins of a third around which the whole party on foot and horseback seemed to be gathered as the boy ran violently on the group opened to make way for two men carrying some helpless but awful object between them a terrible instinct made clarence swerve from it in his headlong course but he was at the same moment discovered by the others and a cry arose of go back stop keep him back heeding it no more than the wind that whistled by him clarence made directly for the foremost wagonthe one in which he and susy had played a powerful hand caught his shoulder it was mr peytons  mrs silsbees wagon said the boy with white lips pointing to it where is she  shes missing said peyton and one otherthe rest are dead  she must be there said the boy struggling and pointing to the wagon let me go  clarence said peyton sternly accenting his grasp upon the boys arm be a man look around you try and tell us who these are  there seemed to be one or two heaps of old clothes lying on the ground and further on where the men at a command from peyton had laid down their burden another in those ragged dusty heaps of clothes from which all the majesty of life seemed to have been ruthlessly stamped out only what was ignoble and grotesque appeared to be left there was nothing terrible in this the boy moved slowly towards them and incredible even to himself the overpowering fear of them that a moment before had overcome him left him as suddenly he walked from the one to the other recognizing them by certain marks and signs and mentioning name after name the groups gazed at him curiously he was conscious that he scarcely understood himself still less the same quiet purpose that made him turn towards the furthest wagon  theres nothing there said peyton weve searched it but the boy without replying continued his way and the crowd followed him  the deserted wagon more rude disorderly and slovenly than it had ever seemed to him before was now heaped and tumbled with broken bones cans scattered provisions pots pans blankets and clothing in the foul confusion of a dustheap but in this heterogeneous mingling the boys quick eye caught sight of a draggled edge of calico  thats mrs silsbees dress he cried and leapt into the wagon  at first the men stared at each other but an instant later a dozen hands were helping him nervously digging and clearing away the rubbish then one man uttered a sudden cry and fell back with frantic but furious eyes uplifted against the pitiless smiling sky above him  great god look here  it was the yellowish waxen face of mrs silsbee that had been uncovered but to the fancy of the boy it had changed the old familiar lines of worry care and querulousness had given way to a look of remote peace and statuelike repose he had often vexed her in her aggressive life he was touched with remorse at her cold passionless apathy now and pressed timidly forward even as he did so the man with a quick but warning gesture hurriedly threw his handkerchief over the matted locks as if to shut out something awful from his view clarence felt himself drawn back but not before the white lips of a bystander had whispered a single word  scalped too by god     chapter vi   then followed days and weeks that seemed to clarence as a dream at first an interval of hushed and awed restraint when he and susy were kept apart a strange and artificial interest taken little note of by him but afterwards remembered when others had forgotten it the burial of mrs silsbee beneath a cairn of stones with some ceremonies that simple though they were seemed to usurp the sacred rights of grief from him and susy and leave them cold and frightened days of frequent and incoherent childish outbursts from susy growing fainter and rarer as time went on until they ceased he knew not when the haunting by night of that morning vision of the three or four heaps of ragged clothes on the ground and a half regret that he had not examined them more closely a recollection of the awful loneliness and desolation of the broken and abandoned wagon left behind on its knees as if praying mutely when the train went on and left it the trundling behind of the fateful wagon in which mrs silsbees body had been found superstitiously shunned by every one and when at last turned over to the authorities at an outpost garrison seeming to drop the last link from the dragging chain of the past the revelation to the children of a new experience in that brief glimpse of the frontier garrison the handsome officer in uniform and belted sword an heroic vengeful figure to be admired and imitated hereafter the sudden importance and respect given to susy and himself as survivors the sympathetic questioning and kindly exaggerations of their experiences quickly accepted by susyall these looking back upon them afterwards seemed to have passed in a dream  no less strange and visionary to them seemed the real transitions they noted from the moving train how one morning they missed the changeless motionless low dark line along the horizon and before noon found themselves among the rocks and trees and a swiftly rushing river how there suddenly appeared beside them a few days later a great gray cloudcovered ridge of mountains that they were convinced was that same dark line that they had seen so often how the men laughed at them and said that for the last three days they had been crossing that dark line and that it was higher than the great grayclouded range before them which it had always hidden from their view how susy firmly believed that these changes took place in her sleep when she always kinder felt they were crawlin up and how clarence in the happy depreciation of extreme youth expressed his conviction that they werent a bit high after all how the weather became cold though it was already summer and at night the camp fire was a necessity and there was a stove in the tent with susy and yet how all this faded away and they were again upon a dazzling burnt and sundried plain but always as in a dream  more real were the persons who composed the partywhom they seemed to have always knownand who in the innocent caprice of children had become to them more actual than the dead had even been there was mr peyton who they now knew owned the train and who was so rich that he neednt go to california if he didnt want to and was going to buy a great deal of it if he liked it and who was also a lawyer and policemanwhich was susys rendering of politicianand was called squire and judge at the frontier outpost and could order anybody to be took up if he wanted to and who knew everybody by their christian names and mrs peyton who had been delicate and was ordered by the doctor to live in the open air for six months and never go into a house or a town agin and who was going to adopt susy as soon as her husband could arrange with susys relatives and draw up the papers how harry was henry benham mrs peytons brother and a kind of partner of mr peyton and how the scouts name was gus gildersleeve or the white crow and how through his recognized intrepidity an attack upon their train was no doubt averted then there was bill the stock herder and texas jim the vaquerothe latter marvelous and unprecedented in horsemanship such were their companions as appeared through the gossip of the train and their own inexperienced consciousness to them they were all astounding and important personages but either from boyish curiosity or some sense of being misunderstood clarence was more attracted by the two individuals of the party who were least kind to himnamely mrs peyton and her brother harry i fear that after the fashion of most children and some grownup people he thought less of the steady kindness of mr peyton and the others than of the rare tolerance of harry or the polite concessions of his sister miserably conscious of this at times he quite convinced himself that if he could only win a word of approbation from harry or a smile from mrs peyton he would afterwards revenge himself by running away whether he would or not i cannot say i am writing of a foolish growing impressionable boy of eleven of whose sentiments nothing could be safely predicted but uncertainty  it was at this time that he became fascinated by another member of the party whose position had been too humble and unimportant to be included in the group already noted of the same appearance as the other teamsters in size habits and apparel he had not at first exhibited to clarence any claim to sympathy but it appeared that he was actually a youth of only sixteena hopeless incorrigible of st joseph whose parents had prevailed on peyton to allow him to join the party by way of removing him from evil associations and as a method of reform of this clarence was at first ignorant not from any want of frankness on the part of the youth for that ingenious young gentleman later informed him that he had killed three men in st louis two in st jo and that the officers of justice were after him but it was evident that to precocious habits of drinking smoking chewing and cardplaying this overgrown youth added a strong tendency to exaggeration of statement indeed he was known as lying jim hooker and his various qualities presented a problem to clarence that was attractive and inspiring doubtful but always fascinating with the hoarse voice of early wickedness and a contempt for ordinary courtesy he had a round perfectly goodhumored face and a disposition that when not called upon to act up to his selfimposed role of reckless wickedness was not unkindly  it was only a few days after the massacre and while the children were still wrapped in the gloomy interest and frightened reticence which followed it that jim hooker first characteristically flashed upon clarences perceptions hanging half on and half off the saddle of an indian pony the lank jim suddenly made his appearance dashing violently up and down the track and around the wagon in which clarence was sitting tugging desperately at the reins with every indication of being furiously run away with and retaining his seat only with the most dauntless courage and skill round and round they went the helpless rider at times hanging by a single stirrup near the ground and again recovering himself byas it seemed to clarencealmost superhuman effort clarence sat openmouthed with anxiety and excitement and yet a few of the other teamsters laughed then the voice of mr peyton from the window of his car said quietly  there that will do jim quit it  the furious horse and rider instantly disappeared a few moments after the bewildered clarence saw the redoubted horseman trotting along quietly in the dust of the rear on the same fiery steed who in that prosaic light bore an astounding resemblance to an ordinary team horse later in the day he sought an explanation from the rider  you see answered jim gloomily thar aint a galoot in this yer crowd ez knows jist whats in that hoss and them ez suspecks darent say it wouldnt do for to hev it let out that the judge hez a morganmexican plug thats killed two men afore he got him and is bound to kill another afore he gets through why ony the week afore we kem up to you that thar hoss bolted with me at camping bucked and throwed me but i kept my holt o the stirrups with my footso dragged me a matter of two miles head down and me keepin away rocks with my handso  why didnt you loose your foot and let go asked clarence breathlessly  you might said jim with deep scorn that aint my style i just laid low till we kem to a steep pitched hill and goin down when the hoss was so to speak kinder below me i just turned a hand spring so and that landed me onter his back again  this action though vividly illustrated by jims throwing his hands down like feet beneath him and indicating the parabola of a spring in the air proving altogether too much for clarences mind to grasp he timidly turned to a less difficult detail  what made the horse bolt first mr hooker  smelt injins said jim carelessly expectorating tobacco juice in a curving jet from the side of his moutha singularly fascinating accomplishment peculiarly his own n likely your injins  but argued clarence hesitatingly you said it was a week beforeand  er mexican plug kin smell injins fifty yes a hundred miles away said jim with scornful deliberation n if judge peyton had took my advice and hadnt been so mighty feared about the character of his hoss gettin out hed hev played roots on them injins afore they tetched ye but he added with gloomy dejection there aint no sand in this yer crowd thar aint no vim thar aint nothin and thar kant be ez long ez thars women and babies and women and baby fixins mixed up with it id hev cut the whole blamed gang ef it werent for one or two things he added darkly  clarence impressed by jims mysterious manner for the moment forgot his contemptuous allusion to mr peyton and the evident implication of susy and himself and asked hurriedly what things  jim as if forgetful of the boys presence in his fitful mood abstractedly half drew a glittering bowie knife from his bootleg and then slowly put it back again thars one or two old scores he continued in a low voice although no one was in hearing distance of them one or two private accounts he went on tragically averting his eyes as if watched by some one thet hev to be wiped out with blood afore i leave thars one or two men too many alive and breathin in this yer crowd mebbee its gus gildersleeve mebbee its harry benham mebbee he added with a dark yet noble disinterestedness its me  oh no said clarence with polite deprecation  far from placating the gloomy jim this seemed only to awake his suspicions mebbee he said dancing suddenly away from clarence mebbee you think im lyin mebbee you think because youre colonel brants son yer kin run me with this yer train mebbee he continued dancing violently back again ye kalkilate because ye run offn stampeded a baby ye kin tote me round too sonny mebbee he went on executing a double shuffle in the dust and alternately striking his hands on the sides of his boots mebbee youre spyin round and reportin to the judge  firmly convinced that jim was working himself up by an indian wardance to some desperate assault on himself but resenting the last unjust accusation clarence had recourse to one of his old dogged silences happily at this moment an authoritative voice called out now then you jim hooker and the desperate hooker as usual vanished instantly nevertheless he appeared an hour or two later beside the wagon in which susy and clarence were seated with an expression of satiated vengeance and remorseful bloodguiltiness in his face and his hair combed indian fashion over his eyes as he generously contented himself with only passing a gloomy and disparaging criticism on the game of cards that the children were playing it struck clarence for the first time that a great deal of his real wickedness resided in his hair this set him to thinking that it was strange that mr peyton did not try to reform him with a pair of scissors but not until clarence himself had for at least four days attempted to imitate jim by combing his own hair in that fashion  a few days later jim again casually favored him with a confidential interview clarence had been allowed to bestride one of the team leaders postillionwise and was correspondingly elevated when jim joined him on the mexican plug which appearedno doubt a part of its wicked artheavily docile and even slightly lame  how much said jim in a tone of gloomy confidencehow much did you reckon to make by stealin that galbaby sonny  nothing replied clarence with a smile perhaps it was an evidence of the marked influence that jim was beginning to exert over him that he already did not attempt to resent this fascinating implication of grownup guilt  it orter bin a good job if it warnt revenge continued jim moodily  no it wasnt revenge said clarence hurriedly  then ye kalkilated ter get er hundred dollars reward ef the old man and old woman hadnt bin scelped afore yet got up to em said jim thats your blamed dodgasted luck eh enyhow youll make mrs peyton plank down suthin if she adopts the babby look yer young feller he said starting suddenly and throwing his face forward glaring fiendishly through his matted sidelocks dye mean ter tell me it wasnt a planta skin gamethe hull thing  a what said clarence  dye mean to sayit was wonderful how gratuitously husky his voice became at this momentdye mean ter tell me ye didnt set on them injins to wipe out the silsbees so that ye could hev an outanout gal orfen on hand fer mrs peyton ter adopteh  but here clarence was forced to protest and strongly although jim contemptuously ignored it dont lie ter me he repeated mysteriously im fly im dark young fel were cahoots in this thing and with this artful suggestion of being in possession of clarences guilty secret he departed in time to elude the usual objurgation of his superior phil the head teamster  nor was his baleful fascination exercised entirely on clarence in spite of mrs peytons jealously affectionate care clarences frequent companionship and the little circle of admiring courtiers that always surrounded susy it became evident that this small eve had been secretly approached and tempted by the satanic jim she was found one day to have a few herons feathers in her possession with which she adorned her curls and at another time was discovered to have rubbed her face and arms with yellow and red ochre confessedly the free gift of jim hooker it was to clarence alone that she admitted the significance and purport of these offerings jim gived em to me she said and jims a kind of injin hisself that wont hurt me and when bad injins come theyll think im his injin baby and run away and jim said if id just told the injins when they came to kill papa and mamma that i blonged to him theyd hev runned away  but said the practical clarence you could not you know you were with mrs peyton all the time  klauns said susy shaking her head and fixing her round blue eyes with calm mendacity on the boy dont you tell me i was there  clarence started back and nearly fell over the wagon in hopeless dismay at this dreadful revelation of susys powers of exaggeration but he gasped you know susy you and me left before  klauns said susy calmly making a little pleat in the skirt of her dress with her small thumb and fingers dont you talk to me i was there ise a seriver the men at the fort said so the serivers is allus allus there and allus allus knows everythin  clarence was too dumfounded to reply he had a vague recollection of having noticed before that susy was very much fascinated by the reputation given to her at fort ridge as a survivor and was trying in an infantile way to live up to it this the wicked jim had evidently encouraged for a day or two clarence felt a little afraid of her and more lonely than ever  it was in this state and while he was doggedly conscious that his association with jim did not prepossess mrs peyton or her brother in his favor and that the former even believed him responsible for susys unhallowed acquaintance with jim that he drifted into one of those youthful escapades on which elders are apt to sit in severe but not always considerate judgment believing like many other children that nobody cared particularly for him except to restrain him discovering as children do much sooner than we complacently imagine that love and preference have no logical connection with desert or character clarence became boyishly reckless but when one day it was rumored that a herd of buffalo was in the vicinity and that the train would be delayed the next morning in order that a hunt might be organized by gildersleeve benham and a few others clarence listened willingly to jims proposition that they should secretly follow it  to effect their unhallowed purpose required boldness and duplicity it was arranged that shortly after the departure of the hunting party clarence should ask permission to mount and exercise one of the team horsesa favor that had been frequently granted him that in the outskirts of the camp he should pretend that the horse ran away with him and jim would start in pursuit the absence of the shooting party with so large a contingent of horses and men would preclude any further detachment from the camp to assist them once clear they would follow the track of the hunters and if discovered by them would offer the same excuse with the addition that they had lost their way to the camp the plan was successful the details were carried out with almost too perfect effect as it appeared that jim in order to give dramatic intensity to the fractiousness of clarences horse had inserted a thorn apple under the neck of his saddle which clarence only discovered in time to prevent himself from being unseated urged forward by ostentatious whoas and surreptitious cuts in the rear from jim pursuer and pursued presently found themselves safely beyond the halfdry stream and fringe of alder bushes that skirted the camp they were not followed whether the teamsters suspected and winked at this design or believed that the boys could take care of themselves and ran no risk of being lost in the proximity of the hunting party there was no general alarm  thus reassured and having a general idea of the direction of the hunt the boys pushed hilariously forward before them opened a vast expanse of bottom land slightly sloping on the right to a distant halffilled lagoon formed by the main river overflow on whose tributary they had encamped the lagoon was partly hidden by straggling timber and brush and beyond that again stretched the unlimitable plainsthe pasture of their mighty game hither jim hoarsely informed his companion the buffaloes came to water a few rods further on he started dramatically and alighting proceeded to slowly examine the ground it seemed to be scattered over with halfcircular patches which he pointed out mysteriously as buffalo chip to clarences inexperienced perception the plain bore a singular resemblance to the surface of an ordinary unromantic cattle pasture that somewhat chilled his heroic fancy however the two companions halted and professionally examined their arms and equipments  these i grieve to say though varied were scarcely full or satisfactory the necessities of their flight had restricted jim to an old doublebarreled fowlingpiece which he usually carried slung across his shoulders an oldfashioned sixshooter whose barrels revolved occasionally and unexpectedly known as allens pepper box on account of its culinary resemblance and a bowieknife clarence carried an indian bow and arrow with which he had been exercising and a hatchet which he had concealed under the flanks of his saddle to this jim generously added the sixshooter taking the hatchet in exchangea transfer that at first delighted clarence until seeing the warlike and picturesque effect of the hatchet in jims belt he regretted the transfer the gun jim meantime explained extry charged chuck up to the middle with slugs and revolver bullets could only be fired by himself and even then he darkly added not without danger this poverty of equipment was however compensated by opposite statements from jim of the extraordinary results obtained by these simple weapons from fellers i knew how he himself had once brought down a bull by a bold shot with a revolver through its open bellowing mouth that pierced his innards how a friend of hisan intimate in factnow in jail at louisville for killing a sheriffs deputy had once found himself alone and dismounted with a simple claspknife and a lariat among a herd of buffaloes how leaping calmly upon the shaggy shoulders of the biggest bull he lashed himself with the lariat firmly to its horns goading it onward with his claspknife and subsisting for days upon the flesh cut from its living body until abandoned by its fellows and exhausted by the loss of blood it finally succumbed to its victor at the very outskirts of the camp to which he had artfully driven it it must be confessed that this recital somewhat took away clarences breath and he would have liked to ask a few questions but they were alone on the prairie and linked by a common transgression the glorious sun was coming up victoriously the pure crisp air was intoxicating their nerves in the bright forecast of youth everything was possible  the surface of the bottom land that they were crossing was here and there broken up by fissures and potholes and some circumspection in their progress became necessary in one of these halts clarence was struck by a dull monotonous jarring that sounded like the heavy regular fall of water over a dam each time that they slackened their pace the sound would become more audible and was at last accompanied by that slight but unmistakable tremor of the earth that betrayed the vicinity of a waterfall hesitating over the phenomenon which seemed to imply that their topography was wrong and that they had blundered from the track they were presently startled by the fact that the sound was actually approaching them with a sudden instinct they both galloped towards the lagoon as the timber opened before them jim uttered a long ecstatic shout why its them  at a first glance it seemed to clarence as if the whole plain beyond was broken up and rolling in tumbling waves or furrows towards them a second glance showed the tossing fronts of a vast herd of buffaloes and here and there darting in and out and among them or emerging from the cloud of dust behind wild figures and flashes of fire with the idea of water still in his mind it seemed as if some tumultuous tidal wave were sweeping unseen towards the lagoon carrying everything before it he turned with eager eyes in speechless expectancy to his companion  alack that redoubtable hero and mighty hunter was to all appearances equally speechless and astonished it was true that he remained rooted to the saddle a lank still heroic figure alternately grasping his hatchet and gun with a kind of spasmodic regularity how long he would have continued this would never be known for the next moment with a deafening crash the herd broke through the brush and swerving at the right of the lagoon bore down directly upon them all further doubt or hesitation on their part was stopped the farseeing sagacious mexican plug with a terrific snort wheeled and fled furiously with his rider moved no doubt by touching fidelity clarences humbler teamhorse instantly followed in a few moments those devoted animals struggled neck to neck in noble emulation  what are we goin off this way for gasped the simple clarence  peyton and gildersleeve are back thereand theyll see us gasped jim in reply it struck clarence that the buffaloes were much nearer them than the hunting party and that the trampling hoofs of a dozen bulls were close behind them but with another gasp he shouted  when are we going to hunt em  hunt them screamed jim with a hysterical outburst of truth why theyre huntin usdash it  indeed there was no doubt that their frenzied horses were flying before the equally frenzied herd behind them they gained a momentary advantage by riding into one of the fissures and out again on the other side while their pursuers were obliged to make a detour but in a few minutes they were overtaken by that part of the herd who had taken the other and nearer side of the lagoon and were now fairly in the midst of them the ground shook with their trampling hoofs their steaming breath mingling with the stinging dust that filled the air half choked and blinded clarence he was dimly conscious that jim had wildly thrown his hatchet at a cow buffalo pressing close upon his flanks as they swept down into another gully he saw him raise his fateful gun with utter desperation clarence crouched low on his horses outstretched neck there was a blinding flash a single stunning report of both barrels jim reeled in one way half out of the saddle while the smoking gun seemed to leap in another over his head and then rider and horse vanished in a choking cloud of dust and gunpowder a moment after clarences horse stopped with a sudden check and the boy felt himself hurled over its head into the gully alighting on something that seemed to be a bounding cushion of curled and twisted hair it was the shaggy shoulder of an enormous buffalo for jims desperate random shot and double charge had taken effect on the near hind leg of a preceding bull tearing away the flesh and hamstringing the animal who had dropped in the gully just in front of clarences horse  dazed but unhurt the boy rolled from the lifted fore quarters of the struggling brute to the ground when he staggered to his feet again not only his horse was gone but the whole herd of buffaloes seemed to have passed too and he could hear the shouts of unseen hunters now ahead of him they had evidently overlooked his fall and the gully had concealed him the sides before him were too steep for his aching limbs to climb the slope by which he and the bull had descended when the collision occurred was behind the wounded animal clarence was staggering towards it when the bull by a supreme effort lifted itself on three legs half turned and faced him  these events had passed too quickly for the inexperienced boy to have felt any active fear or indeed anything but wild excitement and confusion but the spectacle of that shaggy and enormous front that seemed to fill the whole gully rising with awful deliberation between him and escape sent a thrill of terror through his frame the great dull bloodshot eyes glared at him with a dumb wondering fury the large wet nostrils were so near that their first snort of inarticulate rage made him reel backwards as from a blow the gully was only a narrow and short fissure or subsidence of the plain a few paces more of retreat and he would be at its end against an almost perpendicular bank fifteen feet high if he attempted to climb its crumbling sides and fell there would be those short but terrible horns waiting to impale him it seemed too terrible too cruel he was so small beside this overgrown monster it wasnt fair the tears started to his eyes and then in a rage at the injustice of fate he stood doggedly still with clenched fists he fixed his gaze with halfhysterical childish fury on those lurid eyes he did not know that owing to the strange magnifying power of the bulls convex pupils he clarence appeared much bigger than he really was to the brutes heavy consciousness the distance from him most deceptive and that it was to this fact that hunters so often owed their escape he only thought of some desperate means of attack ah the sixshooter it was still in his pocket he drew it nervously hopelesslyit looked so small compared with his large enemy  he presented it with flashing eyes and pulled the trigger a feeble click followed another and again even this had mocked him he pulled the trigger once more wildly there was a sudden explosion and another he stepped back the balls had apparently flattened themselves harmlessly on the bulls forehead he pulled again hopelessly there was another report a sudden furious bellow and the enormous brute threw his head savagely to one side burying his left horn deep in the crumbling bank beside him again and again he charged the bank driving his left horn home and bringing down the stones and earth in showers it was some seconds before clarence saw in a single glimpse of that wildly tossing crest the reason of this fury the blood was pouring from his left eye penetrated by the last bullet the bull was blinded a terrible revulsion of feeling a sudden sense of remorse that was for the moment more awful than even his previous fear overcame him he had done that thing as much to fly from the dreadful spectacle as any instinct of selfpreservation he took advantage of the next mad paroxysms of pain and blindness that always impelled the suffering beast towards the left to slip past him on the right reach the incline and scramble wildly up to the plain again here he ran confusedly forward not knowing whitheronly caring to escape that agonized bellowing to shut out forever the accusing look of that huge bloodweltering eye  suddenly he heard a distant angry shout to his first hurried glance the plain had seemed empty but looking up he saw two horsemen rapidly advancing with a led horse behind themhis own with the blessed sense of relief that overtook him now came the fevered desire for sympathy and to tell them all but as they came nearer he saw that they were gildersleeve the scout and henry benham and that far from sharing any delight in his deliverance their faces only exhibited irascible impatience overcome by this new defeat the boy stopped again dumb and dogged  now then blank it all will you get up and come along or do you reckon to keep the train waiting another hour over your blanked foolishness said gildersleeve savagely  the boy hesitated and then mounted mechanically without a word  twould have served em right to have gone and left em muttered benham vindictively  for one wild instant clarence thought of throwing himself from his horse and bidding them go on and leave him but before he could put his thought into action the two men were galloping forward with his horse led by a lariat fastened to the horn of gildersleeves saddle  in two hours more they had overtaken the train already on the march and were in the midst of the group of outriders judge peytons face albeit a trifle perplexed turned towards clarence with a kindly halftolerant look of welcome the boys heart instantly melted with forgiveness  well my boy lets hear your story what happened  clarence cast a hurried glance around and saw jim with face averted riding gloomily behind then nervously and hurriedly he told how he had been thrown into the gully on the back of the wounded buffalo and the manner of his escape an audible titter ran through the cavalcade mr peyton regarded him gravely but how did the buffalo get so conveniently into the gully he asked  jim hooker lamed him with a shotgun and he fell over said clarence timidly  a roar of homeric laughter went up from the party clarence looked up stung and startled but caught a single glimpse of jim hookers face that made him forget his own mortification in its hopeless heartsick and utterly beaten dejectionthe first and only real expression he had seen on ithe read the dreadful truth jims reputation had ruined him the one genuine and striking episode of his life the one trustworthy account he had given of it had been unanimously accepted as the biggest and most consummate lie of his record     chapter vii   with this incident of the hunt closed to clarence the last remembered episode of his journey but he did not know until long after that it had also closed to him what might have been the opening of a new career for it had been judge peytons intention in adopting susy to include a certain guardianship and protection of the boy provided he could get the consent of that vague relation to whom he was consigned but it had been pointed out by mrs peyton and her brother that clarences association with jim hooker had made him a doubtful companion for susy and even the judge himself was forced to admit that the boys apparent taste for evil company was inconsistent with his alleged birth and breeding unfortunately clarence in the conviction of being hopelessly misunderstood and that dogged acquiescence to fate which was one of his characteristics was too proud to correct the impression by any of the hypocracies of childhood he had also a cloudy instinct of loyalty to jim in his disgrace without however experiencing either the sympathy of an equal or the zeal of a partisan but ratherif it could be said of a boy of his yearswith the patronage and protection of a superior so he accepted without demur the intimation that when the train reached california he would be forwarded from stockton with an outfit and a letter of explanation to sacramento it being understood that in the event of not finding his relative he would return to the peytons in one of the southern valleys where they elected to purchase a tract of land  with this outlook and the prospect of change independence and all the rich possibilities that to the imagination of youth are included in them clarence had found the days dragging the halt at salt lake the transit of the dreary alkali desert even the wild passage of the sierras were but a blurred picture in his memory the sight of eternal snows and the rolling of endless ranks of pines the first glimpse of a hillside of wild oats the spectacle of a rushing yellow river that to his fancy seemed tinged with gold were momentary excitements quickly forgotten but when one morning halting at the outskirts of a struggling settlement he found the entire party eagerly gathered around a passing stranger who had taken from his saddlebags a small buckskin pouch to show them a double handful of shining scales of metal clarence felt the first feverish and overmastering thrill of the goldseekers breathlessly he followed the breathless questions and careless replies the gold had been dug out of a placer only thirty miles away it might be worth say a hundred and fifty dollars it was only his share of a weeks work with two partners it was not much the country was getting played out with fresh arrivals and greenhorns all this falling carelessly from the unshaven lips of a dusty roughly dressed man with a longhandled shovel and pickaxe strapped on his back and a fryingpan depending from his saddle but no panoplied or armed knight ever seemed so heroic or independent a figure to clarence what could be finer than the noble scorn conveyed in his critical survey of the train with its comfortable covered wagons and appliances of civilization yell hev to get rid of them ther fixins if yer goin in for placer diggin what a corroboration of clarences real thoughts what a picture of independence was this the picturesque scout the allpowerful judge peyton the daring young officer all crumbled on their clayey pedestals before this hero in a red flannel shirt and hightopped boots to stroll around in the open air all day and pick up those shining bits of metal without study without method or routinethis was really life to some day come upon that large nugget you couldnt lift that was worth as much as the train and horsessuch a one as the stranger said was found the other day at sawyers barthis was worth giving up everything for that rough man with his smile of careless superiority was the living link between clarence and the thousand and one nights in him were aladdin and sindbad incarnate  two days later they reached stockton here clarence whose single suit of clothes had been reinforced by patching odds and ends from peytons stores and an extraordinary costume of army cloth got up by the regimental tailor at fort ridge was taken to be refitted at a general furnishing emporium but alas in the selection of the clothing for that adult locality scant provision seemed to have been made for a boy of clarences years and he was with difficulty fitted from an old condemned government stores with a boys seaman suit and a brassbuttoned peajacket to this outfit mr peyton added a small sum of money for his expenses and a letter of explanation to his cousin the stagecoach was to start at noon it only remained for clarence to take leave of the party the final parting with susy had been discounted on the two previous days with some tears small frights and clingings and the expressed determination on the childs part to go with him but in the excitement of the arrival at stockton it was still further mitigated and under the influence of a little present from clarencehis first disbursement of his small capitalhad at last taken the form and promise of merely temporary separation nevertheless when the boys scanty pack was deposited under the stagecoach seat and he had been left alone he ran rapidly back to the train for one moment more with susy panting and a little frightened he reached mrs peytons car  goodness youre not gone yet said mrs peyton sharply do you want to lose the stage  an instant before in his loneliness he might have answered yes but under the cruel sting of mrs peytons evident annoyance at his reappearance he felt his legs suddenly tremble and his voice left him he did not dare to look at susy but her voice rose comfortably from the depths of the wagon where she was sitting  the stage will be gone away klauns  she too shame at his foolish weakness sent the yearning blood that had settled round his heart flying back into his face  i was looking forforfor jim maam he said at last boldly  he saw a look of disgust pass over mrs peytons face and felt a malicious satisfaction as he turned and ran back to the stage but here to his surprise he actually found jim whom he really hadnt thought of darkly watching the last strapping of luggage with a manner calculated to convey the impression to the other passengers that he was parting from a brother criminal probably on his way to a state prison jim shook hands gloomily with clarence and eyed the other passengers furtively between his mated locks  ef ye hear o anythin happenin yell know whats up he said in a low hoarse but perfectly audible whisper me and thems bound to part company afore long tell the fellows at deadmans gulch to look out for me at any time  although clarence was not going to deadmans gulch knew nothing of it and had a faint suspicion that jim was equally ignorant yet as one or two of the passengers glanced anxiously at the demure grayeyed boy who seemed booked for such a baleful destination he really felt the halfdelighted halffrightened consciousness that he was starting in life under fascinating immoral pretenses but the forward spring of the finespirited horses the quickened motion the glittering sunlight and the thought that he really was leaving behind him all the shackles of dependence and custom and plunging into a life of freedom drove all else from his mind he turned at last from this hopeful blissful future and began to examine his fellow passengers with boyish curiosity wedged in between two silent men on the front seat one of whom seemed a farmer and the other by his black attire a professional man clarence was finally attracted by a blackmantled darkhaired bonnetless woman on the back seat whose attention seemed to be monopolized by the jocular gallantries of her companions and the two men before her in the middle seat from her position he could see little more than her dark eyes which occasionally seemed to meet his frank curiosity in an amused sort of way but he was chiefly struck by the pretty foreign sound of her musical voice which was unlike anything he had ever heard before andalas for the inconstancy of youthmuch finer than mrs peytons presently his farmer companion casting a patronizing glance on clarences peajacket and brass buttons said cheerily  jest off a voyage sonny  no sir stammered clarence i came across the plains  then i reckon thats the rigout for the crew of a prairie schooner eh there was a laugh at this which perplexed clarence observing it the humorist kindly condescended to explain that prairie schooner was the current slang for an emigrant wagon  i couldnt explained clarence naively looking at the dark eyes on the back seat get any clothes at stockton but these i suppose the folks didnt think thered ever be boys in california  the simplicity of this speech evidently impressed the others for the two men in the middle seats turned at a whisper from the lady and regarded him curiously clarence blushed slightly and became silent presently the vehicle began to slacken its speed they were ascending a hill on either bank grew huge cottonwoods from which occasionally depended a beautiful scarlet vine  ah eet ees pretty said the lady nodding her blackveiled head towards it eet is good in ze hair  one of the men made an awkward attempt to clutch a spray from the window a brilliant inspiration flashed upon clarence when the stage began the ascent of the next hill following the example of an outside passenger he jumped down to walk at the top of the hill he rejoined the stage flushed and panting but carrying a small branch of the vine in his scratched hands handing it to the man on the middle seat he said with grave boyish politenesspleasefor the lady  a slight smile passed over the face of clarences neighbors the bonnetless woman nodded a pleasant acknowledgment and coquettishly wound the vine in her glossy hair the dark man at his side who hadnt spoken yet turned to clarence dryly  if youre goin to keep up this gait sonny i reckon ye wont find much trouble gettin a mans suit to fit you by the time you reach sacramento  clarence didnt quite understand him but noticed that a singular gravity seemed to overtake the two jocular men on the middle seat and the lady looked out of the window he came to the conclusion that he had made a mistake about alluding to his clothes and his size he must try and behave more manly that opportunity seemed to be offered two hours later when the stage stopped at a wayside hotel or restaurant  two or three passengers had got down to refresh themselves at the bar his right and left hand neighbors were however engaged in a drawling conversation on the comparative merits of san francisco sandhill and water lots the jocular occupants of the middle seat were still engrossed with the lady clarence slipped out of the stage and entered the barroom with some ostentation the complete ignoring of his person by the barkeeper and his customers however somewhat disconcerted him he hesitated a moment and then returned gravely to the stage door and opened it  would you mind taking a drink with me sir said clarence politely addressing the farmerlooking passenger who had been most civil to him a dead silence followed the two men on the middle seat faced entirely around to gaze at him  the commodore asks if youll take a drink with him explained one of the men to clarences friend with the greatest seriousness  eh oh yes certainly returned that gentleman changing his astonished expression to one of the deepest gravity seeing its the commodore  and perhaps you and your friend will join too said clarence timidly to the passenger who had explained and you too sir he added to the dark man  really gentlemen i dont see how we can refuse said the latter with the greatest formality and appealing to the others a compliment of this kind from our distinguished friend is not to be taken lightly  i have observed sir that the commodores head is level returned the other man with equal gravity  clarence could have wished they had not treated his first hospitable effort quite so formally but as they stepped from the coach with unbending faces he led them a little frightened into the barroom here unfortunately as he was barely able to reach over the counter the barkeeper would have again overlooked him but for a quick glance from the dark man which seemed to change even the barkeepers perfunctory smiling face into supernatural gravity  the commodore is standing treat said the dark man with unbroken seriousness indicating clarence and leaning back with an air of respectful formality i will take straight whiskey the commodore on account of just changing climate will i believe for the present content himself with lemon soda  clarence had previously resolved to take whiskey like the others but a little doubtful of the politeness of countermanding his guests order and perhaps slightly embarrassed by the fact that all the other customers seemed to have gathered round him and his party with equally immovable faces he said hurriedly  lemon soda for me please  the commodore said the barkeeper with impassive features as he bent forward and wiped the counter with professional deliberation is right no matter how much a man may be accustomed all his life to liquor when he is changing climate gentlemen he says lemon soda for me all the time  perhaps said clarence brightening you will join too  i shall be proud on this occasion sir  i think said the tall man still as ceremoniously unbending as before that there can be but one toast here gentlemen i give you the health of the commodore may his shadow never be less  the health was drunk solemnly clarence felt his cheeks tingle and in his excitement drank his own health with the others yet he was disappointed that there was not more joviality he wondered if men always drank together so stiffly and it occurred to him that it would be expensive nevertheless he had his purse all ready ostentatiously in his hand in fact the paying for it out of his own money was not the least manly and independent pleasure he had promised himself how much he asked with an affectation of carelessness  the barkeeper cast his eye professionally over the barroom i think you said treats for the crowd call it twenty dollars to make even change  clarences heart sank he had heard already of the exaggeration of california prices twenty dollars it was half his fortune nevertheless with an heroic effort he controlled himself and with slightly nervous fingers counted out the money it struck him however as curious not to say ungentlemanly that the bystanders craned their necks over his shoulder to look at the contents of his purse although some slight explanation was offered by the tall man  the commodores purse gentlemen is really a singular one permit me he said taking it from clarences hand with great politeness it is one of the new pattern you observe quite worthy of inspection he handed it to a man behind him who in turn handed it to another while a chorus of suthin quite new the latest style followed it in its passage round the room and indicated to clarence its whereabouts it was presently handed back to the barkeeper who had begged also to inspect it and who with an air of scrupulous ceremony insisted upon placing it himself in clarences side pocket as if it were an important part of his function the driver here called all aboard the passengers hurriedly reseated themselves and the episode abruptly ended for to clarences surprise these attentive friends of a moment ago at once became interested in the views of a new passenger concerning the local politics of san francisco and he found himself utterly forgotten the bonnetless woman had changed her position and her head was no longer visible the disillusion and depression that overcame him suddenly were as complete as his previous expectations and hopefulness had been extravagant for the first time his utter unimportance in the world and his inadequacy to this new life around him came upon him crushingly  the heat and jolting of the stage caused him to fall into a slight slumber and when he awoke he found his two neighbors had just got out at a wayside station they had evidently not cared to waken him to say goodby from the conversation of the other passengers he learned that the tall man was a wellknown gambler and the one who looked like a farmer was a ship captain who had become a wealthy merchant clarence thought he understood now why the latter had asked him if he came off a voyage and that the nickname of commodore given to him clarence was some joke intended for the captains understanding he missed them for he wanted to talk to them about his relative at sacramento whom he was now so soon to see at last between sleeping and waking the end of his journey was unexpectedly reached it was dark but being steamer night the shops and business places were still open and mr peyton had arranged that the stagedriver should deliver clarence at the address of his relative in j streetan address which clarence had luckily remembered but the boy was somewhat discomfited to find that it was a large office or bankinghouse he however descended from the stage and with his small pack in his hand entered the building as the stage drove off and addressing one of the busy clerks asked for mr jackson brant  there was no such person in the office there never had been any such person the bank had always occupied that building was there not some mistake in the number no the name number and street had been deeply engrafted in the boys recollection stop it might be the name of a customer who had given his address at the bank the clerk who made this suggestion disappeared promptly to make inquiries in the countingroom clarence with a rapidly beating heart awaited him the clerk returned there was no such name on the books jackson brant was utterly unknown to every one in the establishment  for an instant the counter against which the boy was leaning seemed to yield with his weight he was obliged to steady himself with both hands to keep from falling it was not his disappointment which was terrible it was not a thought of his future which seemed hopeless it was not his injured pride at appearing to have willfully deceived mr peyton which was more dreadful than all else but it was the sudden sickening sense that he himself had been deceived tricked and fooled for it flashed upon him for the first time that the vague sense of wrong which had always haunted him was thisthat this was the vile culmination of a plan to get rid of him and that he had been deliberately lost and led astray by his relatives as helplessly and completely as a useless cat or dog  perhaps there was something of this in his face for the clerk staring at him bade him sit down for a moment and again vanished into the mysterious interior clarence had no conception how long he was absent or indeed anything but his own breathless thoughts for he was conscious of wondering afterwards why the clerk was leading him through a door in the counter into an inner room of many desks and again through a glass door into a smaller office where a preternaturally busylooking man sat writing at a desk without looking up but pausing only to apply a blottingpad to the paper before him the man said crisply  so youve been consigned to some one who dont seem to turn up and cant be found eh never mind that as clarence laid peytons letter before him cant read it now well i suppose you want to be shipped back to stockton  no said the boy recovering his voice with an effort  eh thats business though know anybody here  not a living soul thats why they sent me said the boy in sudden reckless desperation he was the more furious that he knew the tears were standing in his eyes  the idea seemed to strike the man amusingly looks a little like it dont it he said smiling grimly at the paper before him got any money  a little  how much  about twenty dollars said clarence hesitatingly the man opened a drawer at his side mechanically for he did not raise his eyes and took out two tendollar gold pieces ill go twenty better he said laying them down on the desk thatll give you a chance to look around come back here if you dont see your way clear he dipped his pen into the ink with a significant gesture as if closing the interview  clarence pushed back the coin im not a beggar he said doggedly  the man this time raised his head and surveyed the boy with two keen eyes youre not hey well do i look like one  no stammered clarence as he glanced into the mans haughty eyes  yet if i were in your fix id take that money and be glad to get it  if youll let me pay you back again said clarence a little ashamed and considerably frightened at his implied accusation of the man before him  you can said the man bending over his desk again  clarence took up the money and awkwardly drew out his purse but it was the first time he had touched it since it was returned to him in the barroom and it struck him that it was heavy and fullindeed so full that on opening it a few coins rolled out on to the floor the man looked up abruptly  i thought you said you had only twenty dollars he remarked grimly  mr peyton gave me forty returned clarence stupefied and blushing i spent twenty dollars for drinks at the barand he stammered iii dont know how the rest came here  you spent twenty dollars for drinks said the man laying down his pen and leaning back in his chair to gaze at the boy  yesthat isi treated some gentlemen of the stage sir at davidsons crossing  did you treat the whole stage company  no sir only about four or fiveand the barkeeper but everythings so dear in california i know that  evidently but it dont seem to make much difference with you said the man glancing at the purse  they wanted my purse to look at said clarence hurriedly and thats how the thing happened somebody put his own money back into my purse by accident  of course said the man grimly  yes thats the reason said clarence a little relieved but somewhat embarrassed by the mans persistent eyes  then of course said the other quietly you dont require my twenty dollars now  but returned clarence hesitatingly this isnt my money i must find out who it belongs to and give it back again perhaps he added timidly i might leave it here with you and call for it when i find the man or send him here  with the greatest gravity he here separated the surplus from what was left of peytons gift and the twenty dollars he had just received the balance unaccounted for was forty dollars he laid it on the desk before the man who still looking at him rose and opened the door  mr reed  the clerk who had shown clarence in appeared  open an account with he stopped and turned interrogatively to clarence  clarence brant said clarence coloring with excitement  with clarence brant take that depositpointing to the moneyand give him a receipt he paused as the clerk retired with a wondering gaze at the money looked again at clarence said i think youll do and reentered the private office closing the door behind him  i hope it will not be deemed inconceivable that clarence only a few moments before crushed with bitter disappointment and the hopeless revelation of his abandonment by his relatives now felt himself lifted up suddenly into an imaginary height of independence and manhood he was leaving the bank in which he stood a minute before a friendless boy not as a successful beggar for this important man had disclaimed the idea but absolutely as a customer a depositor a business man like the grownup clients who were thronging the outer office and before the eyes of the clerk who had pitied him and he clarence had been spoken to by this man whose name he now recognized as the one that was on the door of the buildinga man of whom his fellowpassengers had spoken with admiring envya banker famous in all california will it be deemed incredible that this imaginative and hopeful boy forgetting all else the object of his visit and even the fact that he considered this money was not his own actually put his hat a little on one side as he strolled out on his way to the streets and prospective fortune  two hours later the banker had another visitor it chanced to be the farmerlooking man who had been clarences fellowpassenger evidently a privileged person he was at once ushered as captain stevens into the presence of the banker at the end of a familiar business interview the captain asked carelessly  any letters for me  the busy banker pointed with his pen to the letter s in a row of alphabetically labeled pigeonholes against the wall the captain having selected his correspondence paused with a letter in his hand  look here carden there are letters here for some chap called john silsbee they were here when i called ten weeks ago  well  thats the name of that pike county man who was killed by injins in the plains the frisco papers had all the particulars last night may be its for that fellow it hasnt got a postmark who left it here  mr carden summoned a clerk it appeared that the letter had been left by a certain brant fauquier to be called for  captain stevens smiled brants been too busy dealin faro to think of em agin and since that shootin affair at angels i hear hes skipped to the southern coast somewhere cal johnson his old chum was in the up stage from stockton this afternoon  did you come by the up stage from stockton this afternoon said carden looking up  yes as far as tenmile stationrode the rest of the way here  did you notice a queer little oldfashioned kidabout so highlike a runaway schoolboy  did i by gd sir he treated me to drinks  carden jumped from his chair then he wasnt lying  no we let him do it but we made it good for the little chap afterwards hello whats up  but mr carden was already in the outer office beside the clerk who had admitted clarence  you remember that boy brant who was here  yes sir  where did he go  dont know sir  go and find him somewhere and somehow go to all the hotels restaurants and ginmills near here and hunt him up take some one with you if you cant do it alone bring him back here quick  it was nearly midnight when the clerk fruitlessly returned it was the fierce high noon of steamer nights light flashed brilliantly from shops countinghouses drinkingsaloons and gamblinghells the streets were yet full of eager hurrying feetswift of fortune ambition pleasure or crime but from among these deeper harsher footfalls the echo of the homeless boys light innocent tread seemed to have died out forever     chapter viii   when clarence was once more in the busy street before the bank it seemed clear to his boyish mind that being now cast adrift upon the world and responsible to no one there was no reason why he should not at once proceed to the nearest gold mines the idea of returning to mr peyton and susy as a disowned and abandoned outcast was not to be thought of he would purchase some kind of an outfit such as he had seen the miners carry and start off as soon as he had got his supper but although one of his most delightful anticipations had been the unfettered freedom of ordering a meal at a restaurant on entering the first one he found himself the object of so much curiosity partly from his size and partly from his dress which the unfortunate boy was beginning to suspect was really preposterous and he turned away with a stammered excuse and did not try another further on he found a bakers shop where he refreshed himself with some gingerbread and lemon soda at an adjacent grocery he purchased some herrings smoked beef and biscuits as future provisions for his pack or kit then began his real quest for an outfit in an hour he had securedostensibly for some friend to avoid curious inquirya pan a blanket a shovel and pick all of which he deposited at the bakers his unostentatious headquarters with the exception of a pair of disguising high boots that half hid his sailor trousers which he kept to put on at the last even to his inexperience the cost of these articles seemed enormous when his purchases were complete of his entire capital scarcely four dollars remained yet in the fond illusions of boyhood these rude appointments seemed possessed of far more value than the gold he had given in exchange for them and he had enjoyed a childs delight in testing the transforming magic of money  meanwhile the feverish contact of the crowded street had strange to say increased his loneliness while the ruder joviality of its dissipations began to fill him with vague uneasiness the passing glimpse of dancing halls and gaudily whirled figures that seemed only feminine in their apparel the shouts and boisterous choruses from concert rooms the groups of drunken roisterers that congregated around the doors of saloons or hilariously charging down the streets elbowed him against the wall or humorously insisted on his company discomposed and frightened him he had known rude companionship before but it was serious practical and under control there was something in this vulgar degradation of intellect and powerqualities that clarence had always boyishly worshipedwhich sickened and disillusioned him later on a pistol shot in a crowd beyond the rush of eager men past him the disclosure of a limp and helpless figure against the wall the closing of the crowd again around it although it stirred him with a fearful curiosity actually shocked him less hopelessly than their brutish enjoyments and abandonment  it was in one of these rushes that he had been crushed against a swinging door which giving way to his pressure disclosed to his wondering eyes a long glitteringly adorned and brightly lit room densely filled with a silent attentive throng in attitudes of decorous abstraction and preoccupation that even the shouts and tumult at its very doors could not disturb men of all ranks and conditions plainly or elaborately clad were grouped together under this magic spell of silence and attention the tables before them were covered with cards and loose heaps of gold and silver a clicking the rattling of an ivory ball and the frequent formal lazy reiteration of some unintelligible sentence was all that he heard but by a sudden instinct he understood it all it was a gambling saloon  encouraged by the decorous stillness and the fact that everybody appeared too much engaged to notice him the boy drew timidly beside one of the tables it was covered with a number of cards on which were placed certain sums of money looking down clarence saw that he was standing before a card that as yet had nothing on it a single player at his side looked up glanced at clarence curiously and then placed half a dozen gold pieces on the vacant card absorbed in the general aspect of the room and the players clarence did not notice that his neighbor won twice and even thrice upon that card becoming aware however that the player while gathering in his gains was smilingly regarding him he moved in some embarrassment to the other end of the table where there seemed another gap in the crowd it so chanced that there was also another vacant card the previous neighbor of clarence instantly shoved a sum of money across the table on the vacant card and won at this the other players began to regard clarence singularly one or two of the spectators smiled and the boy coloring moved awkwardly away but his sleeve was caught by the successful player who detaining him gently put three gold pieces into his hand  thats your share sonny he whispered  sharefor what stammered the astounded clarence  for bringing me the luck said the man  clarence stared am itoto play with it he said glancing at the coins and then at the table in ignorance of the strangers meaning  no no said the man hurriedly dont do that youll lose it sonny sure dont you see you bring the luck to others not to yourself keep it old man and run home  i dont want it i wont have it said clarence with a swift recollection of the manipulation of his purse that morning and a sudden distrust of all mankind  there he turned back to the table and laid the money on the first vacant card he saw in another moment as it seemed to him it was raked away by the dealer a sense of relief came over him  there said the man with an awed voice and a strange fatuous look in his eye what did i tell you you see its allus so now he added roughly get up and get out o this afore you lose the boots and shirt off ye  clarence did not wait for a second command with another glance round the room he began to make his way through the crowd towards the front but in that parting glance he caught a glimpse of a woman presiding over a wheel of fortune in a corner whose face seemed familiar he looked again timidly in spite of an extraordinary headdress or crown that she wore as the goddess of fortune he recognized twisted in its tinsel a certain scarlet vine which he had seen before in spite of the hoarse formula which she was continually repeating he recognized the foreign accent it was the woman of the stagecoach with a sudden dread that she might recognize him and likewise demand his services for luck he turned and fled  once more in the open air there came upon him a vague loathing and horror of the restless madness and feverish distraction of this halfcivilized city it was the more powerful that it was vague and the outcome of some inward instinct he found himself longing for the pure air and sympathetic loneliness of the plains and wilderness he began to yearn for the companionship of his humble associatesthe teamster the scout gildersleeve and even jim hooker but above all and before all was the wild desire to get away from these maddening streets and their bewildering occupants he ran back to the bakers gathered his purchases together took advantage of a friendly doorway to strap them on his boyish shoulders slipped into a side street and struck out at once for the outskirts  it had been his first intention to take stage to the nearest mining district but the diminution of his small capital forbade that outlay and he decided to walk there by the highroad of whose general direction he had informed himself in half an hour the lights of the flat struggling city and their reflection in the shallow turbid river before it had sunk well behind him the air was cool and soft a yellow moon swam in the slight haze that rose above the tules in the distance a few scattered cottonwoods and sycamores marked like sentinels the road when he had walked some distance he sat down beneath one of them to make a frugal supper from the dry rations in his pack but in the absence of any spring he was forced to quench his thirst with a glass of water in a wayside tavern here he was goodhumoredly offered something stronger which he declined and replied to certain curious interrogations by saying that he expected to overtake his friends in a wagon further on a new distrust of mankind had begun to make the boy an adept in innocent falsehood the more deceptive as his careless cheerful manner the result of his relief at leaving the city and his perfect ease in the loving companionship of night and nature certainly gave no indication of his homelessness and poverty  it was long past midnight when weary in body but still hopeful and happy in mind he turned off the dusty road into a vast rolling expanse of wild oats with the same sense of security of rest as a traveler to his inn here completely screened from view by the tall stalks of grain that rose thickly around him to the height of a mans shoulder he beat down a few of them for a bed on which he deposited his blanket placing his pack for a pillow he curled himself up in his blanket and speedily fell asleep  he awoke at sunrise refreshed invigorated and hungry but he was forced to defer his first selfprepared breakfast until he had reached water and a less dangerous place than the wildoat field to build his first camp fire this he found a mile further on near some dwarf willows on the bank of a halfdry stream of his various efforts to prepare his first meal the fire was the most successful the coffee was somewhat too substantially thick and the bacon and herring lacked definiteness of quality from having been cooked in the same vessel in this boyish picnic he missed susy and recalled perhaps a little bitterly her coldness at parting but the novelty of his situation the brilliant sunshine and sense of freedom and the road already awakening to dusty life with passing teams dismissed everything but the future from his mind readjusting his pack he stepped on cheerily at noon he was overtaken by a teamster who in return for a match to light his pipe gave him a lift of a dozen miles it is to be feared that clarences account of himself was equally fanciful with his previous story and that the teamster parted from him with a genuine regret and a hope that he would soon be overtaken by his friends along the road and mind that you aint such a fool agin to let em make you tote their dodblasted tools fur them he added unsuspectingly pointing to clarences mining outfit thus saved the heaviest part of the days journey for the road was continually rising from the plains during the last six miles clarence was yet able to cover a considerable distance on foot before he halted for supper here he was again fortunate an empty lumber team watering at the same spring its driver offered to take clarences purchasesfor the boy had profited by his late friends suggestion to personally detach himself from his equipmentto buckeye mills for a dollar which would also include a shakedown passage for himself on the floor of the wagon i reckon youve been foolin away in sacramento the money yer parents give yer for return stage fare eh dont lie sonny he added grimly as the now artful clarence smiled diplomatically ive been thar myself luckily the excuse that he was tired and sleepy prevented further dangerous questioning and the boy was soon really in deep slumber on the wagon floor  he awoke betimes to find himself already in the mountains buckeye mills was a straggling settlement and clarence prudently stopped any embarrassing inquiry from his friend by dropping off the wagon with his equipment as they entered it and hurriedly saying goodby from a crossroad through the woods he had learned that the nearest mining camp was five miles away and its direction was indicated by a long wooden flume or waterway that alternately appeared and disappeared on the flank of the mountain opposite the cooler and drier air the grateful shadow of pine and bay and the spicy balsamic odors that everywhere greeted him thrilled and exhilarated him the trail plunging sometimes into an undisturbed forest he started the birds before him like a flight of arrows through its dim recesses at times he hung breathlessly over the blue depths of canyons where the same forests were repeated a thousand feet below towards noon he struck into a rude roadevidently the thoroughfare of the localityand was surprised to find that it as well as the adjacent soil wherever disturbed was a deep indian red everywhere along its sides powdering the banks and boles of trees with its ruddy stain in mounds and hillocks of piled dirt on the road or in liquid paintlike pools when a trickling stream had formed a gutter across it there was always the same deep sanguinary color once or twice it became more vivid in contrast with the white teeth of quartz that peeped through it from the hillside or crossed the road in crumbled strata one of those pieces clarence picked up with a quickening pulse it was veined and streaked with shining mica and tiny glittering cubes of mineral that looked like gold  the road now began to descend towards a winding stream shrunken by drought and ditching that glared dazzingly in the sunlight from its white bars of sand or glistened in shining sheets and channels along its banks and even encroaching upon its bed were scattered a few mud cabins strangelooking wooden troughs and gutters and here and there glancing through the leaves the white canvas of tents the stumps of felled trees and blackened spaces as of recent fires marked the stream on either side a sudden sense of disappointment overcame clarence it looked vulgar common and worse than allfamiliar it was like the unlovely outskirts of a dozen other prosaic settlements he had seen in less romantic localities in that muddy red stream pouring out of a wooden gutter in which three or four bearded slouching halfnaked figures were raking like chiffonniers there was nothing to suggest the royal metal yet he was so absorbed in gazing at the scene and had walked so rapidly during the past few minutes that he was startled on turning a sharp corner of the road to come abruptly upon an outlying dwelling  it was a nondescript building half canvas and half boards the interior seen through the open door was fitted up with side shelves a counter carelessly piled with provisions groceries clothing and hardwarewith no attempt at display or even ordinary selectionand a table on which stood a demijohn and three or four dirty glasses two roughly dressed men whose long matted beards and hair left only their eyes and lips visible in the tangled hirsute wilderness below their slouched hats were leaning against the opposite sides of the doorway smoking almost thrown against them in the rapid momentum of his descent clarence halted violently  well sonny you neednt capsize the shanty said the first man without taking his pipe from his lips  if yer looking fur yer ma she and yer aunt jane hev jest gone over to parson doolittles to take tea observed the second man lazily she allowed that youd wait  imimgoing toto the mines explained clarence with some hesitation i suppose this is the way  the two men took their pipes from their lips looked at each other completely wiped every vestige of expression from their faces with the back of their hands turned their eyes into the interior of the cabin and said will yer come yer now will yer thus adjured half a dozen men also bearded and carrying pipes in their mouths straggled out of the shanty and filing in front of it squatted down with their backs against the boards and gazed comfortably at the boy clarence began to feel uneasy  ill give said one taking out his pipe and grimly eying clarence a hundred dollars for him as he stands  and seein as hes got that brannew rigout o tools said another ill give a hundred and fiftyand the drinks ive been he added apologetically wantin sunthin like this a long time  well genlemen said the man who had first spoken to him lookin at him by and large takin in so to speak the ginral gait of him in single harness bearin in mind the perfect freshness of him and the coolness and size of his cheekthe easy downyness previousness and utter dontcareadamnativeness of his coming yer i think two hundred aint too much for him and well call it a bargain  clarences previous experience of this grim smileless californian chaff was not calculated to restore his confidence he drew away from the cabin and repeated doggedly i asked you if this was the way to the mines  it are the mines and these yere are the miners said the first speaker gravely permit me to interdoose em this yeres shasta jim this yeres shotcard billy this is nasty bob and this slumgullion dick this yeres the dook o chatham street the livin skeleton and me  may we ask fair young sir said the living skeleton who however seemed in fairly robust condition whence came ye on the wings of the morning and whose marble halls ye hev left desolate  i came across the plains and got into stockton two days ago on mr peytons train said clarence indignantly seeing no reason now to conceal anything i came to sacramento to find my cousin who isnt living there any more i dont see anything funny in that i came here to the mines to dig goldbecausebecause mr silsbee the man who was to bring me here and might have found my cousin for me was killed by indians  hold up sonny let me help ye said the first speaker rising to his feet you didnt get killed by injins because you got lost out of a train with silsbees infant darter peyton picked you up while you was takin care of her and two days arter you kem up to the brokendown silsbee wagons with all the folks lyin there slartered  yes sir said clarence breathlessly with astonishment  and continued the man putting his hand gravely to his head as if to assist his memory when you was all alone on the plains with that little child you saw one of those redskins as near to you as i be watchin the train and you didnt breathe or move while he was there  yes sir said clarence eagerly  and you was shot at by peyton he thinkin you was an injun in the mesquite grass and you once shot a buffalo that had been pitched with you down a gullyall by yourself  yes said clarence crimson with wonder and pleasure you know me then  well yeees said the man gravely parting his mustache with his fingers you see youve been here before  before me repeated the astounded clarence  yes before last night you was taller then and hadnt cut your hair you cursed a good deal more than you do now you drank a mans share of whiskey and you borrowed fifty dollars to get to sacramento with i reckon you havent got it about you now eh  clarences brain reeled in utter confusion and hopeless terror  was he going crazy or had these cruel men learned his story from his faithless friends and this was a part of the plot he staggered forward but the men had risen and quickly encircled him as if to prevent his escape in vague and helpless desperation he gasped  what place is this  folks call it deadmans gulch  deadmans gulch a flash of intelligence lit up the boys blind confusion deadmans gulch could it have been jim hooker who had really run away and had taken his name he turned halfimploringly to the first speaker  wasnt he older than me and bigger didnt he have a smooth round face and little eyes didnt he talk hoarse didnt he he stopped hopelessly  yes oh he wasnt a bit like you said the man musingly ye see thats the hll of it youre altogether too many and too various fur this camp  i dont know whos been here before or what they have said said clarence desperately yet even in that desperation retaining the dogged loyalty to his old playmate which was part of his nature i dont know and i dont carethere im clarence brant of kentucky i started in silsbees train from st jo and im going to the mines and you cant stop me  the man who had first spoken started looked keenly at clarence and then turned to the others the gentleman known as the living skeleton had obtruded his huge bulk in front of the boy and gazing at him said reflectively darned if it dont look like one of brants pupssure  air ye any relation to kernel hamilton brant of looeyville asked the first speaker  again that old question poor clarence hesitated despairingly was he to go through the same crossexamination he had undergone with the peytons yes he said doggedly i ambut hes dead and you know it  deadof course sartin hes dead the kernels planted said the men in chorus  well yes reflected the living skeleton ostentatiously as one who spoke from experience ham brants about as bony now as they make em  you bet about the dustiest deadest corpse you kin turn out corroborated slumgullion dick nodding his head gloomily to the others in point o fack es a corpse about the last one i should keer to go huntin fur  the kernels tech ud be cold and clammy concluded the duke of chatham street who had not yet spoken sure but what did yer mammy say about it is she gettin married agin did she send ye here  it seemed to clarence that the duke of chatham street here received a kick from his companions but the boy repeated doggedly  i came to sacramento to find my cousin jackson brant but he wasnt there  jackson brant echoed the first speaker glancing at the others did your mother say he was your cousin  yes said clarence wearily goodby  hullo sonny where are you going  to dig gold said the boy and you know you cant prevent me if it isnt on your claim i know the law he had heard mr peyton discuss it at stockton and he fancied that the men who were whispering among themselves looked kinder than before and as if they were no longer acting to him the first speaker laid his hand on his shoulder and said all right come with me and ill show you where to dig  who are you said clarence you called yourself only me  well you can call me flynntom flynn  and youll show me where i can digmyself  i will  do you know said clarence timidly yet with a halfconscious smile that ii kinder bring luck  the man looked down upon him and said gravely but as it struck clarence with a new kind of gravity i believe you  yes said clarence eagerly as they walked along together i brought luck to a man in sacramento the other day and he related with great earnestness his experience in the gambling saloon not content with thatthe sealed fountains of his childish deep being broken up by some mysterious sympathyhe spoke of his hospitable exploit with the passengers at the wayside bar of the finding of his fortunatus purse and his deposit at the bank whether that characteristic oldfashioned reticence which had been such an important factor for good or ill in his future had suddenly deserted him or whether some extraordinary prepossession in his companion had affected him he did not know but by the time the pair had reached the hillside flynn was in possession of all the boys history on one point only was his reserve unshaken conscious although he was of jim hookers duplicity he affected to treat it as a comrades joke  they halted at last in the middle of an apparently fertile hillside clarence shifted his shovel from his shoulders unslung his pan and looked at flynn dig anywhere here where you like said his companion carelessly and youll be sure to find the color fill your pan with the dirt go to that sluice and let the water run in on the top of the panworkin it round so he added illustrating a rotary motion with the vessel keep doing that until all the soil is washed out of it and you have only the black sand at the bottom then work that the same way until you see the color dont be afraid of washing the gold out of the panyou couldnt do it if you tried there ill leave you here and you wait till i come back with another grave nod and something like a smile in the only visible part of his bearded facehis eyeshe strode rapidly away  clarence did not lose time selecting a spot where the grass was less thick he broke through the soil and turned up two or three spadefuls of red soil when he had filled the pan and raised it to his shoulder he was astounded at its weight he did not know that it was due to the red precipitate of iron that gave it its color staggering along with his burden to the running sluice which looked like an open wooden gutter at the foot of the hill he began to carefully carry out flynns direction the first dip of the pan in the running water carried off half the contents of the pan in liquid paintlike ooze for a moment he gave way to boyish satisfaction in the sight and touch of this unctuous solution and dabbled his fingers in it a few moments more of rinsing and he came to the sediment of fine black sand that was beneath it another plunge and swilling of water in the pan andcould he believe his eyesa few yellow tiny scales scarcely larger than pins heads glittered among the sand he poured it off but his companion was right the lighter sand shifted from side to side with the water but the glittering points remained adhering by their own tiny specific gravity to the smooth surface of the bottom it was the colorgold  clarences heart seemed to give a great leap within him a vision of wealth of independence of power sprang before his dazzled eyes anda hand lightly touched him on the shoulder  he started in his complete preoccupation and excitement he had not heard the clatter of horsehoofs and to his amazement flynn was already beside him mounted and leading a second horse  you kin ride he said shortly  yes stammered clarence but  butweve only got two hours to reach buckeye mills in time to catch the down stage drop all that jump up and come with me  but ive just found gold said the boy excitedly  and ive just found yourcousin come  he spurred his horse across clarences scattered implements half helped half lifted the boy into the saddle of the second horse and with a cut of his riata over the animals haunches the next moment they were both galloping furiously away     chapter ix   torn suddenly from his prospective future but too much dominated by the man beside him to protest clarence was silent until a rise in the road a few minutes later partly abated their headlong speed and gave him chance to recover his breath and courage  where is my cousin he asked  in the southern county two hundred miles from here  are we going to him  yes  they rode furiously forward again it was nearly half an hour before they came to a longer ascent clarence could see that flynn was from time to time examining him curiously under his slouched hat this somewhat embarrassed him but in his singular confidence in the man no distrust mingled with it  ye never saw yourcousin he asked  no said clarence nor he me i dont think he knew me much any way  how old mout ye be clarence  eleven  well as youre suthin of a pupclarence started and recalled peytons first criticism of himi reckon to tell ye suthin ye aint goin to be skeert or afeard or lose yer sand i kalkilate for skunkin aint in your breed well wot ef i told ye that thish yerthish yercousin o yours was the biggest devil onhung that hed just killed a man and had to lite out elsewhere and thets why he didnt show up in sacramentowhat if i told you that  clarence felt that this was somehow a little too much he was perfectly truthful and lifting his frank eyes to flynn he said  i should think you were talking a good deal like jim hooker  his companion stared and suddenly reined up his horse then bursting into a shout of laughter he galloped ahead from time to time shaking his head slapping his legs and making the dim woods ring with his boisterous mirth then as suddenly becoming thoughtful again he rode on rapidly for half an hour only speaking to clarence to urge him forward and assisting his progress by lashing the haunches of his horse luckily the boy was a good ridera fact which flynn seemed to thoroughly appreciateor he would have been unseated a dozen times  at last the straggling sheds of buckeye mills came into softer purple view on the opposite mountain then laying his hand on clarences shoulder as he reined in at his side flynn broke the silence  there boy he said wiping the mirthful tears from his eyes i was only foolinonly tryin yer grit this yer cousin im taking you to be as quiet and softspoken and as oldfashioned ez you be why hes that wrapped up in books and study that he lives alone in a big adobe rancherie among a lot o spanish and he dont keer to see his own countrymen why hes even changed his name and calles himself don juan robinson but hes very rich he owns three leagues of land and heaps of cattle and horses and glancing approvingly at clarences seat in the saddle i reckon youll hev plenty of fun thar  but hesitated clarence to whom this proposal seemed only a repetition of peytons charitable offer i think id better stay here and dig goldwith you  and i think youd better not said the man with a gravity that was very like a settled determination  but my cousin never came for me to sacramentonor sent nor even wrote persisted clarence indignantly  not to you boy but he wrote to the man whom he reckoned would bring you therejack silsbeeand left it in the care of the bank and silsbee being dead didnt come for the letter and as you didnt ask for it when you came and didnt even mention silsbees name that same letter was sent back to your cousin through me because the bank thought we knew his whereabouts it came to the gulch by an express rider whilst you were prospectin on the hillside rememberin your story i took the liberty of opening it and found out that your cousin had told silsbee to bring you straight to him so im only doin now what silsbee would have done  any momentary doubt or suspicion that might have risen in clarences mind vanished as he met his companions steady and masterful eye even his disappointment was forgotten in the charm of this newfound friendship and protection and as its outset had been marked by an unusual burst of confidence on clarences part the boy in his gratitude now felt something of the timid shyness of a deeper feeling and once more became reticent  they were in time to snatch a hasty meal at buckeye mills before the stage arrived and clarence noticed that his friend despite his rough dress and lawless aspect provoked a marked degree of respect from those he metin which perhaps a wholesome fear was mingled it is certain that the two best places in the stage were given up to them without protest and that a careless almost supercilious invitation to drink from flynn was responded to with singular alacrity by all including even two fastidiously dressed and previously reserved passengers i am afraid that clarence enjoyed this proof of his friends singular dominance with a boyish pride and conscious of the curious eyes of the passengers directed occasionally to himself was somewhat ostentatious in his familiarity with this bearded autocrat  at noon the next day they left the stage at a wayside road station and flynn briefly informed clarence that they must again take horses this at first seemed difficult in that outoftheway settlement where they alone had stopped but a whisper from the driver in the ear of the stationmaster produced a couple of fiery mustangs with the same accompaniment of cautious awe and mystery for the next two days they traveled on horseback resting by night at the lodgings of one or other of flynns friends in the outskirts of a large town where they arrived in the darkness and left before day to any one more experienced than the simpleminded boy it would have been evident that flynn was purposely avoiding the more traveled roads and conveyances and when they changed horses again the next days ride was through an apparently unbroken wilderness of scattered wood and rolling plain yet to clarence with his pantheistic reliance and joyous sympathy with nature the change was filled with exhilarating pleasure the vast seas of tossing wild oats the hillside still variegated with strange flowers the virgin freshness of untrodden woods and leafy aisles whose floors of moss or bark were undisturbed by human footprint were a keen delight and novelty more than this his quick eye trained perceptions and frontier knowledge now stood him in good stead his intuitive sense of distance instincts of woodcraft and his unerring detection of those signs landmarks and guideposts of nature undistinguishable to aught but birds and beasts and some children were now of the greatest service to his less favored companion in this part of their strange pilgrimage it was the boy who took the lead flynn who during the past two days seemed to have fallen into a mood of watchful reserve nodded his approbation this sort of things yer best holt boy he said men and cities aint your little game  at the next stoppingplace clarence had a surprise they had again entered a town at nightfall and lodged with another friend of flynns in rooms which from vague sounds appeared to be over a gambling saloon clarence woke late in the morning and descending into the street to mount for the days journey was startled to find that flynn was not on the other horse but that a welldressed and handsome stranger had taken his place but a laugh and the familiar command jump up boy made him look again it was flynn but completely shaven of beard and mustache closely clipped of hair and in a fastidiously cut suit of black  then you didnt know me said flynn  not till you spoke replied clarence  so much the better said his friend sententiously as he put spurs to his horse but as they cantered through the street clarence who had already become accustomed to the strangers hirsute adornment felt a little more awe of him the profile of the mouth and chin now exposed to his sidelong glance was hard and stern and slightly saturnine although unable at the time to identify it with anybody he had ever known it seemed to the imaginative boy to be vaguely connected with some sad experience but the eyes were thoughtful and kindly and the boy later believed that if he had been more familiar with the face he would have loved it better for it was the last and only day he was to see it as late that afternoon after a dusty ride along more traveled highways they reached their journeys end  it was a lowwalled house with redtiled roofs showing against the dark green of venerable pear and fig trees and a square courtyard in the centre where they had dismounted a few words in spanish from flynn to one of the lounging peons admitted them to a wooden corridor and thence to a long low room which to clarences eyes seemed literally piled with books and engravings here flynn hurriedly bade him stay while he sought the host in another part of the building but clarence did not miss him indeed it may be feared he forgot even the object of their journey in the new sensations that suddenly thronged upon him and the boyish vista of the future that they seemed to open he was dazed and intoxicated he had never seen so many books before he had never conceived of such lovely pictures and yet in some vague way he thought he must have dreamt of them at some time he had mounted a chair and was gazing spellbound at an engraving of a seafight when he heard flynns voice  his friend had quietly reentered the room in company with an oldish halfforeignlooking man evidently his relation with no helping recollection with no means of comparison beyond a vague idea that his cousin might look like himself clarence stood hopelessly before him he had already made up his mind that he would have to go through the usual crossquestioning in regard to his father and family he had even forlornly thought of inventing some innocent details to fill out his imperfect and unsatisfactory recollection but glancing up he was surprised to find that his elderly cousin was as embarrassed as he was flynn as usual masterfully interposed  of course ye dont remember each other and thar aint much that either of you knows about family matters i reckon he said grimly and as your cousin calls himself don juan robinson he added to clarence its just as well that you let jackson brant slide i know him better than you but youll get used to him and he to you soon enough at least youd better he concluded with his singular gravity  as he turned as if to leave the room with clarences embarrassed relativemuch to that gentlemans apparent reliefthe boy looked up at the latter and said timidly  may i look at those books  his cousin stopped and glanced at him with the first expression of interest he had shown  ah you read you like books  yes said clarence as his cousin remained still looking at him thoughtfully he added my hands are pretty clean but i can wash them first if you like  you may look at them said don juan smilingly and as they are old books you can wash your hands afterwards and turning to flynn suddenly with an air of relief i tell you what ill doill teach him spanish  they left the room together and clarence turned eagerly to the shelves they were old books some indeed very old queerly bound and wormeaten some were in foreign languages but others in clear bold english type with quaint woodcuts and illustrations one seemed to be a chronicle of battles and sieges with pictured representations of combatants spitted with arrows cleanly lopped off in limb or toppled over distinctly by visible cannonshot he was deep in its perusal when he heard the clatter of a horses hoofs in the courtyard and the voice of flynn he ran to the window and was astonished to see his friend already on horseback taking leave of his host  for one instant clarence felt one of those sudden revulsions of feeling common to his age but which he had always timidly hidden under dogged demeanor flynn his only friend flynn his only boyish confidant flynn his latest hero was going away and forsaking him without a word of parting it was true that he had only agreed to take him to his guardian but still flynn need not have left him without a word of hope or encouragement with any one else clarence would probably have taken refuge in his usual indian stoicism but the same feeling that had impelled him to offer flynn his boyish confidences on their first meeting now overpowered him he dropped his book ran out into the corridor and made his way to the courtyard just as flynn galloped out from the arch  but the boy uttered a despairing shout that reached the rider he drew rein wheeled halted and sat facing clarence impatiently to add to clarences embarrassment his cousin had lingered in the corridor attracted by the interruption and a peon lounging in the archway obsequiously approached flynns bridlerein but the rider waved him off and turning sternly to clarence said  whats the matter now  nothing said clarence striving to keep back the hot tears that rose in his eyes but you were going away without saying goodby youve been very kind to me andandi want to thank you  a deep flush crossed flynns face then glancing suspiciously towards the corridor he said hurriedly  did he send you  no i came myself i heard you going  all right goodby he leaned forward as if about to take clarences outstretched hand checked himself suddenly with a grim smile and taking from his pocket a gold coin handed it to the boy  clarence took it tossed it with a proud gesture to the waiting peon who caught it thankfully drew back a step from flynn and saying with white cheeks i only wanted to say goodby dropped his hot eyes to the ground but it did not seem to be his own voice that had spoken nor his own self that had prompted the act  there was a quick interchange of glances between the departing guest and his late host in which flynns eyes flashed with an odd admiring fire but when clarence raised his head again he was gone and as the boy turned back with a broken heart towards the corridor his cousin laid his hand upon his shoulder  muy hidalgamente clarence he said pleasantly yes we shall make something of you     chapter x   then followed to clarence three uneventful years during that interval he learnt that jackson brant or don juan robinsonfor the tie of kinship was the least factor in their relations to each other and after the departure of flynn was tacitly ignored by bothwas more spanish than american an early residence in lower california marriage with a rich mexican widow whose dying childless left him sole heir and some strange restraining idiosyncrasy of temperament had quite denationalized him a bookish recluse somewhat superfastidious towards his own countrymen the more clarence knew him the more singular appeared his acquaintance with flynn but as he did not exhibit more communicativeness on this point than upon their own kinship clarence finally concluded that it was due to the dominant character of his former friend and thought no more about it he entered upon the new life at el refugio with no disturbing past quickly adapting himself to the lazy freedom of this hacienda existence he spent the mornings on horseback ranging the hills among his cousins cattle and the afternoons and evenings busied among his cousins books with equally lawless and undisciplined independence the easygoing don juan it is true attempted to make good his rash promise to teach the boy spanish and actually set him a few tasks but in a few weeks the quickwitted clarence acquired such a colloquial proficiency from his casual acquaintance with vaqueros and small traders that he was glad to leave the matter in his young kinsmans hands again by one of those illogical sequences which make a lifelong reputation depend upon a single trivial act clarences social status was settled forever at el refugio rancho by his picturesque diversion of flynns parting gift the grateful peon to whom the boy had scornfully tossed the coin repeated the act gesture and spirit of the scene to his companion and don juans unknown and youthful relation was at once recognized as hijo de la familia and undeniably a hidalgo born and bred but in the more vivid imagination of feminine el refugio the incident reached its highest poetic form it is true mother of god said chucha of the mill it was domingo who himself relates it as it were the creed when the american escort had arrived with the young gentleman this escort look you being not of the same quality he is departing again without a word of permission comes to him at this moment my little hidalgo you have yourself forgotten to take from me your demission he said this escort thinking to make his peace with a mere muchacho gives to him a gold piece of twenty pesos the little hidalgo has taken it so and with the words ah you would make of me your almoner to my cousins people has given it at the moment to domingo and with a grace and fire admirable but it is certain that clarences singular simplicity and truthfulness a faculty of being picturesquely indolent in a way that suggested a dreamy abstraction of mind rather than any vulgar tendency to bodily ease and comfort and possibly the fact that he was a good horseman made him a popular hero at el refugio at the end of three years don juan found that this inexperienced and apparently idle boy of fourteen knew more of the practical ruling of the rancho than he did himself also that this unlettered young rustic had devoured nearly all the books in his library with boyish recklessness of digestion he found too that in spite of his singular independence of action clarence was possessed of an invincible loyalty of principle and that asking no sentimental affection and indeed yielding none he was without presuming on his relationship devoted to his cousins interest it seemed that from being a glancing ray of sunshine in the house evasive but never obtrusive he had become a daily necessity of comfort and security to his benefactor  clarence was however astonished when one morning don juan with the same embarrassed manner he had shown at their first meeting suddenly asked him what business he expected to follow it seemed the more singular as the speaker like most abstracted men had hitherto always studiously ignored the future in their daily intercourse yet this might have been either the habit of security or the caution of doubt whatever it was it was some sudden disturbance of don juans equanimity as disconcerting to himself as it was to clarence so conscious was the boy of this that without replying to his cousins question but striving in vain to recall some delinquency of his own he asked with his usual boyish directness  has anything happened have i done anything wrong  no no returned don juan hurriedly but you see its time that you should think of your futureor at least prepare for it i mean you ought to have some more regular education you will have to go to school its too bad he added fretfully with a certain impatient forgetfulness of clarences presence and as if following his own thought just as you are becoming of service to me and justifying your ridiculous position hereand all this dd nonsense thats gone beforei mean of course clarence he interrupted himself catching sight of the boys whitening cheek and darkening eye i mean you knowthis ridiculousness of my keeping you from school at your age and trying to teach you myselfdont you see  you think it isridiculous repeated clarence with dogged persistency  i mean i am ridiculous said don juan hastily there there lets say no more about it tomorrow well ride over to san jose and see the father secretary at the jesuits college about your entering at once its a good school and youll always be near the rancho and so the interview ended  i am afraid that clarences first idea was to run away there are few experiences more crushing to an ingenuous nature than the sudden revelation of the aspect in which it is regarded by others the unfortunate clarence conscious only of his loyalty to his cousins interest and what he believed were the duties of his position awoke to find that position ridiculous in an afternoons gloomy ride through the lonely hills and later in the sleepless solitude of his room at night he concluded that his cousin was right he would go to school he would study hardso hard that in a little a very little while he could make a living for himself he awoke contented it was the blessing of youth that this resolve and execution seemed as one and the same thing  the next day found him installed as a pupil and boarder in the college don juans position and spanish predilections naturally made his relation acceptable to the faculty but clarence could not help perceiving that father sobriente the principal regarded him at times with a thoughtful curiosity that made him suspect that his cousin had especially bespoken that attention and that he occasionally questioned him on his antecedents in a way that made him dread a renewal of the old questioning about his progenitor for the rest he was a polished cultivated man yet in the characteristic material criticism of youth i am afraid that clarence chiefly identified him as a priest with large hands whose soft palms seemed to be cushioned with kindness and whose equally large feet encased in extraordinary shapeless shoes of undyed leather seemed to tread down noiselesslyrather than to ostentatiously crushthe obstacles that beset the path of the young student in the cloistered galleries of the courtyard clarence sometimes felt himself borne down by the protecting weight of this paternal hand in the midnight silence of the dormitory he fancied he was often conscious of the soft browsing tread and snuffly muffled breathing of his elephantinefooted mentor  his relations with his schoolfellows were at first far from pleasant whether they suspected favoritism whether they resented that old and unsympathetic manner which sprang from his habits of association with his elders or whether they rested their objections on the broader grounds of his being a stranger i do not know but they presently passed from cruel sneers to physical opposition it was then found that this gentle and reserved youth had retained certain objectionable rude direct rustic qualities of fist and foot and that violating all rules and disdaining the pomp and circumstance of schoolboy warfare of which he knew nothing he simply thrashed a few of his equals out of hand with or without ceremony as the occasion or the insult happened in this emergency one of the seniors was selected to teach this youthful savage his proper position a challenge was given and accepted by clarence with a feverish alacrity that surprised himself as much as his adversary this was a youth of eighteen his superior in size and skill  the first blow bathed clarences face in his own blood but the sanguinary chrism to the alarm of the spectators effected an instantaneous and unhallowed change in the boy instantly closing with his adversary he sprang at his throat like an animal and locking his arm around his neck began to strangle him blind to the blows that rained upon him he eventually bore his staggering enemy by sheer onset and surprise to the earth amidst the general alarm the strength of half a dozen hastily summoned teachers was necessary to unlock his hold even then he struggled to renew the conflict but his adversary had disappeared and from that day forward clarence was never again molested  seated before father sobriente in the infirmary with swollen and bandaged face and eyes that still seemed to see everything in the murky light of his own blood clarence felt the soft weight of the fathers hand upon his knee  my son said the priest gently you are not of our religion or i should claim as a right to ask a question of your own heart at this moment but as to a good friend claro a good friend he continued patting the boys knee you will tell me old father sobriente frankly and truthfully as is your habit one little thing were you not afraid  no said clarence doggedly ill lick him again tomorrow  softly my son it was not of him i speak but of something more terrible and awful were you not afraid ofof he paused and suddenly darting his clear eyes into the very depths of clarences soul addedof yourself  the boy started shuddered and burst into tears  so so said the priest gently we have found our real enemy good now by the grace of god my little warrior we shall fight him and conquer  whether clarence profited by this lesson or whether this brief exhibition of his quality prevented any repetition of the cause the episode was soon forgotten as his schoolfellows had never been his associates or confidants it mattered little to him whether they feared or respected him or were hypocritically obsequious after the fashion of the weaker his studies at all events profited by this lack of distraction already his two years of desultory and omnivorous reading had given him a facile familiarity with many things which left him utterly free of the timidity awkwardness or noninterest of a beginner his usually reserved manner which had been lack of expression rather than of conviction had deceived his tutors the audacity of a mind that had never been dominated by others and owed no allegiance to precedent made his merely superficial progress something marvelous  at the end of the first year he was a phenomenal scholar who seemed capable of anything nevertheless father sobriente had an interview with don juan and as a result clarence was slightly kept back in his studies a little more freedom from the rules was conceded to him and he was even encouraged to take some diversion of such was the privilege to visit the neighboring town of santa clara unrestricted and unattended he had always been liberally furnished with pocketmoney for which in his companionless state and spartan habits he had a singular and unboyish contempt nevertheless he always appeared dressed with scrupulous neatness and was rather distinguishedlooking in his older reserve and melancholy selfreliance  lounging one afternoon along the alameda a leafy avenue set out by the early mission fathers between the village of san jose and the convent of santa clara he saw a double file of young girls from the convent approaching on their usual promenade a view of this procession being the fondest ambition of the san jose collegian and especially interdicted and circumvented by the good fathers attending the college excursions clarence felt for it the profound indifference of a boy who in the intermediate temperate zone of fifteen years thinks that he is no longer young and romantic he was passing them with a careless glance when a pair of deep violet eyes caught his own under the broad shade of a coquettishly beribboned hat even as it had once looked at him from the depths of a calico sunbonnet susy he started and would have spoken but with a quick little gesture of caution and a meaning glance at the two nuns who walked at the head and foot of the file she indicated him to follow he did so at a respectful distance albeit wondering a little further on susy dropped her handkerchief and was obliged to dart out and run back to the end of the file to recover it but she gave another swift glance of her blue eyes as she snatched it up and demurely ran back to her place the procession passed on but when clarence reached the spot where she had paused he saw a threecornered bit of paper lying in the grass he was too discreet to pick it up while the girls were still in sight but continued on returning to it later it contained a few words in a schoolgirls hand hastily scrawled in pencil come to the south wall near the big peartree at six  delighted as clarence felt he was at the same time embarrassed he could not understand the necessity of this mysterious rendezvous he knew that if she was a scholar she was under certain conventual restraints but with the privileges of his position and friendship with his teachers he believed that father sobriente would easily procure him an interview with this old playfellow of whom he had often spoken and who was with himself the sole survivor of his tragical past and trusted as he was by sobriente there was something in this clandestine though innocent rendezvous that went against his loyalty nevertheless he kept the appointment and at the stated time was at the south wall of the convent over which the gnarled boughs of the distinguishing peartree hung hard by in the wall was a grated wicket door that seemed unused  would she appear among the boughs or on the edge of the wall either would be like the old susy but to his surprise he heard the sound of the key turning in the lock the grated door suddenly swung on its hinges and susy slipped out grasping his hand she said lets run clarence and before he could reply she started off with him at a rapid pace down the lane they flewvery much as it seemed to clarences fancy as they had flown from the old emigrant wagon on the prairie four years before he glanced at the fluttering fairylike figure beside him she had grown taller and more graceful she was dressed in exquisite taste with a minuteness of luxurious detail that bespoke the spoilt child but there was the same prodigal outburst of rippling golden hair down her back and shoulders violet eyes capricious little mouth and the same delicate hands and feet he had remembered he would have preferred a more deliberate survey but with a shake of her head and an hysteric little laugh she only said run clarence run and again darted forward arriving at the crossstreet they turned the corner and halted breathlessly  but youre not running away from school susy are you said clarence anxiously  only a little bit just enough to get ahead of the other girls she said rearranging her brown curls and tilted hat you see clarence she condescended to explain with a sudden assumption of older superiority mothers here at the hotel all this week and im allowed to go home every night like a day scholar only theres three or four other girls that go out at the same time with me and one of the sisters and today i got ahead of em just to see you  but began clarence  oh its all right the other girls knew it and helped me they dont start out for half an hour yet and theyll say ive just run ahead and when they and the sister get to the hotel ill be there alreadydont you see  yes said clarence dubiously  and well go to an icecream saloon now shant we theres a nice one near the hotel ive got some money she added quickly as clarence looked embarrassed  so have i said clarence with a faint accession of color lets go she had relinquished his hand to smooth out her frock and they were walking side by side at a more moderate pace but he continued clinging to his first idea with masculine persistence and anxious to assure his companion of his power of his position im in the college and father sobriente who knows your lady superior is a good friend of mine and gives me privileges andandwhen he knows that you and i used to play togetherwhy hell fix it that we may see each other whenever we want  oh you silly said susy whatwhen youre  when im what  the young girl shot a violet blue ray from under her broad hat whywhen were grown up now then with a certain precision why theyre very particular about young gentlemen why clarence if they suspected that you and i were another violet ray from under the hat completed this unfinished sentence  pleased and yet confused clarence looked straight ahead with deepening color why continued susy mary rogers that was walking with me thought you were ever so oldand a distinguished spaniard and i she said abruptlyhavent i grown tell me clarence with her old appealing impatience havent i grown do tell me  very much said clarence  and isnt this frock prettyits only my second bestbut ive a prettier one with lace all down in front but isnt this one pretty clarence tell me  clarence thought the frock and its fair owner perfection and said so whereat susy as if suddenly aware of the presence of passersby assumed an air of severe propriety dropped her hands by her side and with an affected conscientiousness walked on a little further from clarences side until they reached the icecream saloon  get a table near the back clarence she said in a confidential whisper where they cant see usand strawberry you know for the lemon and vanilla here are just horrid  they took their seats in a kind of rustic arbor in the rear of the shop which gave them the appearance of two youthful but somewhat overdressed and overconscious shepherds there was an interval of slight awkwardness which susy endeavored to displace there has been she remarked with easy conversational lightness quite an excitement about our french teacher being changed the girls in our class think it most disgraceful  and this was all she could say after a separation of four years clarence was desperate but as yet idealess and voiceless at last with an effort over his spoon he gasped a floating recollection do you still like flapjacks susy  oh yes with a laugh but we dont have them now  and mose a black pointer who used to yelp when susy sang does he still sing with you  oh hes been lost ever so long said susy composedly but ive got a newfoundland and a spaniel and a black pony and here with a rapid inventory of her other personal effects she drifted into some desultory details of the devotion of her adopted parents whom she now readily spoke of as papa and mamma with evidently no disturbing recollection of the dead from which it appeared that the peytons were very rich and in addition to their possessions in the lower country owned a rancho in santa clara and a house in san francisco like all children her strongest impressions were the most recent in the vain hope to lead her back to this material yesterday he said  you remember jim hooker  oh he ran away when you left but just think of it the other day when papa and i went into a big restaurant in san francisco who should be there waiting on the tableyes clarence a real waiterbut jim hooker papa spoke to him but of course with a slight elevation of her pretty chin i couldnt you know fancya waiter  the story of how jim hooker had personated him stopped short upon clarences lips he could not bring himself now to add that revelation to the contempt of his small companion which in spite of its naivete somewhat grated on his sensibilities  clarence she said suddenly turning towards him mysteriously and indicating the shopman and his assistants i really believe these people suspect us  of what said the practical clarence  dont be silly dont you see how they are staring  clarence was really unable to detect the least curiosity on the part of the shopman or that any one exhibited the slightest concern in him or his companion but he felt a return of the embarrassed pleasure he was conscious of a moment before  then youre living with your father said susy changing the subject  you mean my cousin said clarence smiling you know my father died long before i ever knew you  yes thats what you used to say clarence but papa says it isnt so but seeing the boys wondering eyes fixed on her with a troubled expression she added quickly oh then he is your cousin  well i think i ought to know said clarence with a smile that was however far from comfortable and a quick return of his old unpleasant recollections of the peytons why i was brought to him by one of his friends and clarence gave a rapid boyish summary of his journey from sacramento and flynns discovery of the letter addressed to silsbee but before he had concluded he was conscious that susy was by no means interested in these details nor in the least affected by the passing allusion to her dead father and his relation to clarences misadventures with her rounded chin in her hand she was slowly examining his face with a certain mischievous yet demure abstraction i tell you what clarence she said when he had finished you ought to make your cousin get you one of those sombreros and a nice goldbraided serape theyd just suit you and thenthen you could ride up and down the alameda when we are going by  but im coming to see you atat your house and at the convent he said eagerly father sobriente and my cousin will fix it all right  but susy shook her head with superior wisdom no they must never know our secretneither papa nor mamma especially mamma and they mustnt know that weve met againafter these years it is impossible to describe the deep significance which susys blue eyes gave to this expression after a pause she went on  no we must never meet again clarence unless mary rogers helps she is my best my onliest friend and older than i having had trouble herself and being expressly forbidden to see him again you can speak to her about suzettethats my name now i was rechristened suzette alexandra peyton by mamma and now clarence dropping her voice and glancing shyly around the saloon you may kiss me just once under my hat for goodby she adroitly slanted her broadbrimmed hat towards the front of the shop and in its shadow advanced her fresh young cheek to clarence  coloring and laughing the boy pressed his lips to it twice then susy arose with the faintest affectation of a sigh shook out her skirt drew on her gloves with the greatest gravity and saying dont follow me further than the doortheyre coming now walked with supercilious dignity past the preoccupied proprietor and waiters to the entrance here she said with marked civility goodafternoon mr brant and tripped away towards the hotel clarence lingered for a moment to look after the lithe and elegant little figure with its shining undulations of hair that fell over the back and shoulders of her white frock like a golden mantle and then turned away in the opposite direction  he walked home in a state as it seemed to him of absurd perplexity there were many reasons why his encounter with susy should have been of unmixed pleasure she had remembered him of her own free will and in spite of the change in her fortune had made the first advances her doubts about her future interviews had affected him but little still less i fear did he think of the other changes in her character and disposition for he was of that age when they added only a piquancy and fascination to heras of one who in spite of her weakness of nature was still devoted to him but he was painfully conscious that this meeting had revived in him all the fears vague uneasiness and sense of wrong that had haunted his first boyhood and which he thought he had buried at el refugio four years ago susys allusion to his father and the reiteration of peytons skepticism awoke in his older intellect the first feeling of suspicion that was compatible with his open nature was this recurring reticence and mystery due to any act of his fathers but looking back upon it in afteryears he concluded that the incident of that day was a premonition rather than a recollection     chapter xi   when he reached the college the angelus had long since rung in the corridor he met one of the fathers who instead of questioning him returned his salutation with a grave gentleness that struck him he had turned into father sobrientes quiet study with the intention of reporting himself when he was disturbed to find him in consultation with three or four of the faculty who seemed to be thrown into some slight confusion by his entrance clarence was about to retire hurriedly when father sobriente breaking up the council with a significant glance at the others called him back confused and embarrassed with a dread of something impending the boy tried to avert it by a hurried account of his meeting with susy and his hopes of father sobrientes counsel and assistance taking upon himself the idea of suggesting susys escapade he confessed the fault the old man gazed into his frank eyes with a thoughtful halfcompassionate smile i was just thinking of giving you a holiday withwith don juan robinson the unusual substitution of this final title for the habitual your cousin struck clarence uneasily but we will speak of that later sit down my son i am not busy we shall talk a little father pedro says you are getting on fluently with your translations that is excellent my son excellent  clarences face beamed with relief and pleasure his vague fears began to dissipate  and you translate even from dictation good we have an hour to spare and you shall give to me a specimen of your skill eh good i will walk here and dictate to you in my poor english and you shall sit there and render it to me in your good spanish eh so we shall amuse and instruct ourselves  clarence smiled these sporadic moments of instruction and admonition were not unusual to the good father he cheerfully seated himself at the padres table before a blank sheet of paper with a pen in his hand father sobriente paced the apartment with his usual heavy but noiseless tread to his surprise the good priest after an exhaustive pinch of snuff blew his nose and began in his most lugubrious style of pulpit exhortation  it has been written that the sins of the father shall be visited upon the children and the unthinking and worldly have sought refuge from this law by declaring it harsh and cruel miserable and blind for do we not see that the wicked man who in the pride of his power and vainglory is willing to risk punishment to himselfand believes it to be couragemust pause before the awful mandate that condemns an equal suffering to those he loves which he cannot withhold or suffer for in the spectacle of these innocents struggling against disgrace perhaps disease poverty or desertion what avails his haughty alldefying spirit let us imagine clarence  sir said the literal clarence pausing in his exercise  i mean continued the priest with a slight cough let the thoughtful man picture a father a desperate selfwilled man who scorned the laws of god and societykeeping only faith with a miserable subterfuge he called honor and relying only on his own courage and his knowledge of human weakness imagine him cruel and bloodya gambler by profession an outlaw among men an outcast from the church voluntarily abandoning friends and familythe wife he should have cherished the son he should have reared and educatedfor the gratification of his deadly passions yet imagine that man suddenly confronted with the thought of that heritage of shame and disgust which he had brought upon his innocent offspringto whom he cannot give even his own desperate recklessness to sustain its vicarious suffering what must be the feelings of a parent  father sobriente said clarence softly  to the boys surprise scarcely had he spoken when the soft protecting palm of the priest was already upon his shoulder and the snuffy but kindly upper lip trembling with some strange emotion close beside his cheek  what is it clarence he said hurriedly speak my son without fear you would ask  i only wanted to know if padre takes a masculine verb here replied clarence naively  father sobriente blew his nose violently trulythough used for either gender by the context masculine he responded gravely ah he added leaning over clarence and scanning his work hastily good very good and now possibly he continued passing his hand like a damp sponge over his heated brow we shall reverse our exercise i shall deliver to you in spanish what you shall render back in english eh andlet us considerwe shall make something more familiar and narrative eh  to this clarence somewhat bored by these present solemn abstractions assented gladly and took up his pen father sobriente resuming his noiseless pacing began  on the fertile plains of guadalajara lived a certain caballero possessed of flocks and lands and a wife and son but being also possessed of a fiery and roving nature he did not value them as he did perilous adventure feats of arms and sanguinary encounters to this may be added riotous excesses gambling and drunkenness which in time decreased his patrimony even as his rebellious and quarrelsome spirit had alienated his family and neighbors his wife borne down by shame and sorrow died while her son was still an infant in a fit of equal remorse and recklessness the caballero married again within the year but the new wife was of a temper and bearing as bitter as her consort violent quarrels ensued between them ending in the husband abandoning his wife and son and leaving st louisi should say guadalajarafor ever joining some adventurers in a foreign land under an assumed name he pursued his reckless course until by one or two acts of outlawry he made his return to civilization impossible the deserted wife and stepmother of his child coldly accepted the situation forbidding his name to be spoken again in her presence announced that he was dead and kept the knowledge of his existence from his own son whom she placed under the charge of her sister but the sister managed to secretly communicate with the outlawed father and under a pretext arranged between them of sending the boy to another relation actually dispatched the innocent child to his unworthy parent perhaps stirred by remorse the infamous man  stop said clarence suddenly  he had thrown down his pen and was standing erect and rigid before the father  you are trying to tell me something father sobriente he said with an effort speak out i implore you i can stand anything but this mystery i am no longer a child i have a right to know all this that you are telling me is no fablei see it in your face father sobriente it is the story ofof  your father clarence said the priest in a trembling voice  the boy drew back with a white face my father he repeated living or dead  living when you first left your home said the old man hurriedly seizing clarences hand for it was he who in the name of your cousin sent for you livingyes while you were here for it was he who for the past three years stood in the shadow of this assumed cousin don juan and at last sent you to this school living clarence yes but living under a name and reputation that would have blasted you and now deaddead in mexico shot as an insurgent and in a still desperate career may god have mercy on his soul  dead repeated clarence trembling only now  the news of the insurrection and his fate came only an hour since continued the padre quickly his complicity with it and his identity were known only to don juan he would have spared you any knowledge of the truth even as this dead man would but i and my brothers thought otherwise i have broken it to you badly my son but forgive me  an hysterical laugh broke from clarence and the priest recoiled before him forgive you what was this man to me he said with boyish vehemence he never loved me he deserted me he made my life a lie he never sought me came near me or stretched a hand to me that i could take  hush hush said the priest with a horrified look laying his huge hand upon the boys shoulder and bearing him down to his seat you know not what you say thinkthink clarence was there none of all those who have befriended youwho were kind to you in your wanderingsto whom your heart turned unconsciously think clarence you yourself have spoken to me of such a one let your heart speak again for his sakefor the sake of the dead  a gentler light suffused the boys eyes and he started catching convulsively at his companions sleeve he said in an eager boyish whisper there was one a wicked desperate man whom they all fearedflynn who brought me from the mines yes i thought that he was my cousins loyal friendmore than all the rest and i told him everythingall that i never told the man i thought my cousin or anyone or even you and i think i think father i liked him best of all i thought since it was wrong he continued with a trembling smile for i was foolishly fond even of the way the others feared him he that i feared not and who was so kind to me yet he too left me without a word and when i would have followed him but the boy broke down and buried his face in his hands  no no said father sobriente with eager persistence that was his foolish pride to spare you the knowledge of your kinship with one so feared and part of the blind and mistaken penance he had laid upon himself for even at that moment of your boyish indignation he never was so fond of you as then yes my poor boy this man to whom god led your wandering feet at deadmans gulch the man who brought you here and by some secret holdi know not whaton don juans past persuaded him to assume to be your relation this man flynn this jackson brant the gambler this hamilton brant the outlawwas your father ah yes weep on my son each tear of love and forgiveness from thee hath vicarious power to wash away his sin  with a single sweep of his protecting hand he drew clarence towards his breast until the boy slowly sank upon his knees at his feet then lifting his eyes towards the ceiling he said softly in an older tongue and thou too unhappy and perturbed spirit rest        it was nearly dawn when the good padre wiped the last tears from clarences clearer eyes and now my son he said with a gentle smile as he rose to his feet let us not forget the living although your stepmother has through her own act no legal claim upon you far be it from me to indicate your attitude towards her enough that you are independent he turned and opening a drawer in his secretaire took out a bankbook and placed it in the hands of the wondering boy  it was his wish clarence that even after his death you should never have to prove your kinship to claim your rights taking advantage of the boyish deposit you had left with mr carden at the bank with his connivance and in your name he added to it month by month and year by year mr carden cheerfully accepting the trust and management of the fund the seed thus sown has produced a thousandfold clarence beyond all expectations you are not only free my son but of yourself and in whatever name you chooseyour own master  i shall keep my fathers name said the boy simply  amen said father sobriente   here closes the chronicle of clarence brants boyhood how he sustained his name and independence in after years and who of those already mentioned in these pages helped him to make or mar it may be a matter for future record
