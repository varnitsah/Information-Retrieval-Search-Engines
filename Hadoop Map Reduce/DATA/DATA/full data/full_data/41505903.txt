cumberers of the soil of mammon may be remarked an abortive little dingy cupola surmounting two large round eyes which have evidently stared over the adjacent roofs ever since the fire that began at piecorner and ended in puddinglane  strange that the like should have been esteemed the highest walk of architecture and yet honora charlecote well remembered the days when st wulstans was her boast so large so clean so light so grecian so far surpassing damp old hiltonbury church  that was at an age when her enthusiasm found indiscriminate food in whatever had a hold upon her affections the nearer her heart being of course the more admirable in itself and it would be difficult to say which she loved the most ardently her city home in woolstonelane or hiltonbury holt the old family seat where her father was a welcome guest whenever his constitution required relaxation from the severe toils of a london rector  woolstonelane was a locality that sorely tried the coachmen of mrs charlecotes west end connections situate as it was on the very banks of the thames and containing little save offices and warehouses in the midst of which stood honoras home  it was not the rectory but had been inherited from city relations and it antedated the fire so that it was one of the most perfect remnants of the glories of the merchant princes of ancient london  it had a court to itself shut in by high walls and paved with roundheaded stones with gangways of flags in mercy to the feet the front was faced with hewn squares after the pattern of somerset house with the like ponderous sashes and on a smaller scale the louis xiv pediment apparently designed for the nestingplace of swallows and sparrows  within was a hall panelled with fragrant softlytinted cedar wood festooned with exquisite garlands of fruit and flowers carved by gibbons himself with all his peculiarities of rounded form and delicate edge  the staircase and floor were of white stone tinted on sunny days with reflections from the windows three medallions of yellow and white glass where solomon in golden mantle and crowned turban commanded the division of a stout lusty child hanging by one leg superintended the erection of a temple worthy of haarlem or graciously welcomed a recoiling stumpy vrow of a queen of sheba with golden hair all down her back  the river aspect of the house had come to perfection at the elizabethan period and was sculptured in every available nook with the chevron and three arrows of the fletchers company and a merchants mark like a figure of four with a curly tail  here were the oriel windows of the best rooms looking out on a grassplat small enough in country eyes but most extensive for the situation with straight gravelled walks and low lilac and laburnum trees that came into profuse blossom long before their country cousins but which like the crocuses and snowdrops of the flower borders had better be looked at than touched by such as dreaded sooty fingers  these shrubs veiled the garden from the great river thoroughfare to which it sloped down still showing traces of the handsome stone steps and balustrade that once had formed the access of the goldchained alderman to his sumptuous barge  along those paths paced book in hand a tall wellgrown maiden of good straight features and clear pale skin with eyes and rich luxuriant hair of the same colour a peculiarly bright shade of auburn such as painters of old had loved and owen sandbrook called golden while humfrey charlecote would declare he was always glad to see honors carrots  more than thirty years ago personal teaching at a london parish school or personal visiting of the poor was less common than at present but honora had been bred up to be helpful and she had newly come in from a diligent afternoon of looking at the needlework and hearing crossmans catechism and sellons abridgment from a demurely dressed race of little girls in tall white caps bibs and tuckers and very stout indigoblue frocks  she had been working hard at the endeavour to make the little cockneys who had never seen a single ear of wheat enter into josephs dreams and was rather weary of their town sharpness coupled with their indifference and want of imagination where any nature save human nature was concerned  i will bring an ear of hiltonbury wheat home with mesome of the best girls shall see me sow it and i will take them to watch it growing upthe blade the ear the full corn in the earpoor dears if they only had a hiltonbury to give them some tastes that are not all for this hot busy eager world  if i could only see one with her lap full of bluebells but though in this land of cockaigne of ours one does not actually pick up gold and silver i am afraid they are our flowers and the only ones we esteem worth the picking and like old mr sandbrook we neither understand nor esteem those whose aims are otherwise  oh owen owen may you only not be withheld from your glorious career  may you show this hard moneygetting world that you do really as well as only in word esteem one soul to be reclaimed above all the wealth that can be laid at your feet  the nephew and heir of the great firm voluntarily surrendering consideration ease riches unbounded luxury for the sake of the heathenchoosing a wigwam instead of a west end palace parched maize rather than the banquet the backwoods instead of the luxurious park the red indian rather than the club and the theatre to be a despised minister rather than a magnate of this great city nay or to take his place among the influential men of the land  what has this worn weary old civilization to offer like the joy of sitting beneath one of the glorious aspiring pines of america gazing out on the blue waters of her limpid inland seas in her fresh pure air with the simple children of the forest round him their princely forms in attitudes of attention their dark soft liquid eyes fixed upon him as he tells them your great spirit him whom ye ignorantly worship him declare i unto you and then some glorious old chief bows his stately head and throws aside his marks of superstition i believe he says and the hearts of all bend with him and owen leads them to the lake and baptizes them and it is another st sacrament oh that is what it is to have nobleness enough truly to overcome the world truly to turn ones back upon pleasures and honourswhat are they to such as this  so mused honora charlecote and then ran indoors with bounding step to her schiller and her heroworship of max piccolomini to write notes for her mother and practise for her father the song that was to refresh him for the evening  nothing remarkable  no there was nothing remarkable in honor she was neither more nor less than an average woman of the higher type refinement and gentleness a strong appreciation of excellence and a love of duty had all been brought out by an admirable education and by a home devoted to unselfish exertion varied by intellectual pleasures other influencesdecidedly traceable in her musingshad shaped her principles and enthusiasms on those of an ardent oxonian of the early years of william iv and so bred up so led by circumstances honora with her abilities high cultivation and tolerable sense was a fair specimen of what any young lady might be appearing perhaps somewhat in advance of her contemporaries but rather from her training than from intrinsic force of character  the qualities of womanhood well developed were so entirely the staple of her composition that there is little to describe in her  was not she one made to learn to lean to admire to support to enhance every joy to soften every sorrow of the object of her devotion                                        another picture from honora charlecotes life  it is about half after six on a bright autumnal morning and rising nearly due east out of a dark pinecrowned hill the sun casts his slanting beams over an undulating country clothed in gray mist of tints differing with the distance the farther hills confounded with the sky the nearer dimly traced in purple and the valleys between indicated by the whiter woollier vapours that rise from their streams a goodly land of fertile field and rich wood cradled on the bosoms of those soft hills  nestled among the woods clothing its hollows on almost every side rises a low hill with a species of table land on the top scattered over with large thorns and scraggy oaks that cast their shadows over the pale buff bents of the short soft grass of the gravelly soil  looking southward is a low irregular oldfashioned house with two tall gable ends like eyebrows and the lesser gable of a porch between them all covered with large chequers of black timber filled up with creamcoloured cement  a straight path leads from the porch between beds of scarlet geraniums their luxuriant horseshoe leaves weighed down with wet and china asters a drop in every quilling to an oldfashioned sundial and beside that dial stands honora charlecote gazing joyously out on the bright morning and trying for the hundredth time to make the shadow of that green old finger point to the same figure as the hand of her watch  oh down down theres a good dog fly youll knock me down  vixen poor little doggie pray  look at your paws as a blue greyhound and rough black terrier came springing joyously upon her brushing away the silver dew from the shaven lawn  down down lie down dogs and with an obstreperous bound fly flew to the newcomer a young man in the robust strength of eightandtwenty of stalwart frame very broad in the chest and shoulders careless homely though perfectly gentlemanlike bearing and hale hearty sunburnt face it was such a look and such an arm as would win the most timid to his side in certainty of tenderness and protection and the fond voice gave the same sense of power and of kindness as he called out holloa honor there you are  not given up the old fashion  not till you give me up humfrey she said as she eagerly laid her neatly gloved fingers in the grasp of the great broad horny palm or at least till you take your gun  so you are not grown wiser  nor ever will be  every woman ought to learn to saddle a horse and fire off a gun  yes against the civil war squires are always expecting  you shall teach me when the time comes  youll never see that time nor any other if you go out in those thin boots  ill fetch sarahs clogs i suppose you have not a reasonable pair in the world  my boots are quite thick thank you  brown paper  and indeed they were a contrast to his mighty nailed soles and long untanned buskins nor did they greatly resemble the heavy countrymade galoshes which with an elder brothers authority he forced her to put on observing that nothing so completely evinced the londoner as her obstinacy in never having a pair of shoes that could keep anything out  and where are you going  to haywards farm  is that too far for you  he wants an abatement of his rent for some improvements and i want to judge what they may be worth  haywardsoh not a bit too far and holding up her skirts she picked her way as daintily as her weighty chaussure would permit along the narrow green footway that crossed the expanse of dewy turf in which the dogs careered getting their noses covered with flakes of thick gossamer cemented together by dew  fly scraped it off with a delicate forepaw vixen rolled over and doubly entangled it in her rugged coat  humfrey charlecote strode on before his companion with his hands in his pockets and beginning to whistle but pausing to observe over his shoulder a sweet day for getting up the roots  youre not getting wet i hope  i couldnt through this rhinoceros hide thank you  how exquisitely the mist is curling up and showing the churchspire in the valley  and i suppose you have been reading all manner of books  i think the best was a great history of france  france he repeated in a contemptuous john bull tone  ay dont be disdainful france was the centre of chivalry in the old time  better have been the centre of honesty  and so it was in the time of st louis and his crusade  do you know it humfrey  eh  that was full permission  ever since honora had been able to combine a narration humfrey had been the recipient though she seldom knew whether he attended and from her babyhood upwards had been quite contented with trotting in the wake of his long strides pouring out her ardent fancies now and then getting an answer but more often going on like a little singing bird through the midst of his avocations and quite complacent under his interruptions of calls to his dogs directions to his labourers and warnings to her to mind her feet and not her chatter  in the full stream of crusaders he led her down one of the multitude of bypaths cleared out in the hazel coppice for sporting here leading up a rising ground whence the tops of the trees might be overlooked some flecked with gold some blushing into crimson and beyond them the needle point of the village spire the vane flashing back the sun there bending into a ravine marshy at the bottom and nourishing the lady fern then again crossing glades where the rabbits darted across the path and the battle of damietta was broken into by stern orders to fly to come to heel and the eating of the nuts which humfrey pulled down from the branches and held up to his cousin with superior good nature  a mameluke rushed in with a scimitar streaming with blood and  take care do you want help over this fence  not i thank youand said he had just murdered the king  vic ah take your nose out of that  here was a crop nora  what was it  you dont mean that you dont know wheat stubble  i remember it was to be wheat  red wheat the finest we ever had in this land not a bit beaten down and the colour perfectly beautiful before harvest it used to put me in mind of your hair  a load to the acre a fair specimen of the effect of drainage  do you remember what a swamp it was  i remember the beautiful loosestrifes that used to grow in that corner  ah we have made an end of that trumpery  you savage old humfreybeauties that they were  what had they to do with my cornfields  a place for everything and everything in its placefrench kings and all  what was this one doing woolgathering in egypt  dont you understand it had become the point for the blow at the saracen power  where was i  oh the mameluke justified the murder and wanted st louis to be king but  ha a fine covey i only miss two out of them  these carrots how their leaves are turnedthat ought not to be  honora could not believe that anything ought not to be that was as beautiful as the varied rosy tints of the hectic beauty of the exquisitely shaped and delicately pinked foliage of the field carrots and with her cousins assistance she soon had a large bouquet where no two leaves were alike their hues ranging from the deepest purple or crimson to the palest yellow or clear scarlet like seaweed through every intermediate variety of purple edged with green green picked out with red or yellow or vice versa in neverending brilliancy such as humfrey almost seemed to appreciate as he said well you have something as pretty as your weeds eh honor  i cant quite give up mourning for my dear long purples  all very well by the river but theres no beauty in things out of place like your louis in egyptwell what was the end of this predicament  so humfrey had really heard and been interested  with such encouragement honora proceeded swimmingly and had nearly arrived at her heros ransom through nearly a mile of field paths only occasionally interrupted by grunts from her auditor at farming not like his own when crossing a narrow footbridge across a clear stream they stood before a farmhouse timbered and chimneyed much like the holt but with new sashes displacing the old lattice  oh humfrey how could you bring me to see such havoc  i never suspected you would allow it  it was without asking leave an attention to his bride and now they want an abatement for improvements  whew  you should fine him for the damage he has done  i cant be hard on him he is more or less of an ass and a good sort of fellow very good to his labourers he drove jem hurd to the infirmary himself when he broke his arm  no he is not a man to be hard upon  you cant be hard on any one  now that window really irritates my mind  now sarah walked down to call on the bride and came home full of admiration at the place being so lightsome and cheerful  which of you two ladies am i to believe  you ought to make it a duty to improve the general taste  why dont you build a model farmhouse and let me make the design  ay when i want one that nobody can live in  come it will be breakfast time  are not you going to have an interview  no i only wanted to take a survey of the alterations two windows smart door iron fence pulled down old barn talks of another  hm  so he will get his reduction  if he builds the barn  i shall try to see his wife she has not been brought up to farming and whether they get on or not all depends on the way she may take it up  what are you looking at  that lovely wreath of travellers joy  do you want it  no thank you it is too beautiful where it is  there is a piece going from tree to tree by the hiltonbury gate as thick as my arm i just saved it when west was going to cut it down with the copsewood  well you really are improving at last  i thought you would never let me hear the last of it besides there was a thrushs nest in it  by and by the cousins arrived at a field where humfreys portly shorthorns were coming forth after their milking under the pilotage of an old whiteheaded man bent nearly double uncovering his head as the squire touched his hat in response and shouted good morning  if you please sir said the old man trying to erect himself i wanted to speak to you  well  if you please sir chimney smokes so as a body can scarce bide in the house and the blacks come down terrible  wants sweeping roared humfrey into his deaf ears  have swep it sir old womans been up with her broom  old woman hasnt been high enough  send jack up outside with a rope and a bunch o furze and let her stand at bottom  thats it sir cried the old man with a triumphant snap of the fingers over his shoulder  thank ye  heres miss honor john and honora came forward her gravity somewhat shaken by the domestic offices of the old woman  im glad to see you still able to bring out the cows john  heres my favourite daisy as tame as ever  ay ay and he looked at his master for explanation from the stronger and more familiar voice  i be deaf you see maam  miss honor is glad to see daisy as tame as ever shouted humfrey  ay ay maundered on the old man she aint done no good of late and mr west and ius wanted to have fatted her this winter but the squire he wouldnt hear on it because miss honor was such a terrible one for her  says i when i hears em say so we shall have another dinner on the laan and the last was when the old squire was married thirtyfive years ago come michaelmas  honora was much disposed to laugh at this freak of the old mans fancy but to her surprise humfrey coloured up and looked so much out of countenance that a question darted through her mind whether he could have any such step in contemplation and she began to review the young ladies of the neighbourhood and to decide on each in turn that it would be intolerable to see her as humfreys wife more at home at the holt than herself  she had ample time for contemplation for he had become very silent and once or twice the presumptuous idea crossed her that he might be actually about to make her some confidence but when he at length spoke very near the house it was only to say honor i wanted to ask you if you think your father would wish me to ask young sandbrook here  oh thank you i am sure he would be glad  you know poor owen has nowhere to go since his uncle has behaved so shamefully  it must have been a great mortification  to owen  of course it was to be so cast off for his noble purpose  i was thinking of old mr sandbrook  old wretch  ive no patience with him  just as he has brought this nephew up and hopes to make him useful and rest some of his cares upon him in his old age to find him flying off upon this fresh course and disappointing all his hopes  but it is such a high and grand course he ought to have rejoiced in it and owen is not his son  a man of his age brought up as he has been can hardly be expected to enter into owens views  of course not  it is all sordid and mean he cannot even understand the missionary spirit of resigning all  as owen says half the scripture must be hyperbole to him and so he is beginning owens persecution already  it was one of humfreys provoking qualities that no amount of eloquence would ever draw a word of condemnation from him he would praise readily enough but censure was very rare with him and extenuation was always his first impulse so the more honora railed at mr sandbrooks interference with his nephews plans the less satisfaction she received from him  she seemed to think that in order to admire owen as he deserved his uncle must be proportionably reviled and though humfrey did not imply a word save in commendation of the young missionarys devotion she went indoors feeling almost injured at his not understanding it but honoras petulance was a very bright sunny piquancy and she only appeared the more glowing and animated for it when she presented herself at the breakfasttable with a preposterous country appetite  afterwards she filled a vase very tastefully with her varieties of leaves and enjoyed taking in her cousin sarah who admired the leaves greatly while she thought they came from mrs mervyns hothouse but when she found they were the product of her own furrows voted them coarse ugly withered things such as only the simplicity of a londoner could bring into civilized society  so honora stood over her gorgeous feathery bouquet not knowing whether to laugh or to be scornful till humfrey taking up the vase inquired may i have it for my study  oh yes and welcome said honora laughing and shaking her glowing tresses at him i am thankful to any one who stands up for carrots  goodnatured humfrey thought she it is all that i may not be mortified but after all it is not those very goodnatured people who best appreciate lofty actions  he is inviting owen sandbrook more because he thinks it would please papa and because he compassionates him in his solitary lodgings than because he feels the force of his glorious selfsacrifice                                        the northern slope of the holt was clothed with fir plantations intersected with narrow paths which gave admission to the depths of their lonely woodland palace supported on rudely straight columns dark save for the snowy exuding gum roofed in by aspiring beamlike arms bearing aloft their long tufts of dark blue green foliage floored by the smooth slippery russet needle leaves as they fell and perfumed by the peculiar fresh smell of turpentine  it was a still and lonely place the very sounds making the silence more audible if such an expression may be used the wind whispering like the rippling waves of the sea in the tops of the pines here and there the cry of a bird or far far away the tinkle of the sheepbell or the tone of the church clock and of movement there was almost as little only the huge horse ants soberly wending along their highway to their tall hillock thatched with pine leaves or the squirrel in the ruddy russet livery of the scene racing from tree to tree or sitting up with his feathery tail erect to extract with his delicate paws the seed from the base of the fircone scale squirrels there lived to a good old age till their plumy tails had turned white for the squires one fault in the eyes of keepers and gardeners was that he was softhearted towards the varmint  a canadian forest on a small scale an extremely miniature scale indeed but still canadian forests are of pine and the holt plantation was fir and firs were pines and it was a lonely musing place and so on one of the stillest clearest days of st lukes little summer the last afternoon of her visit at the holt there stood honora leaning against a tree stem deep very deep in a vision of the primeval woodlands of the west their red inhabitants and the white man who should carry the true glad tidings westward westward ever from east to west  did she know how completely her whole spirit and soul were surrendered to the worship of that devotion  worship  yes the word is advisedly used honora had once given her spirit in homage to schillers selfsacrificing max the same heartwhole veneration was now rendered to the young missionary multiplied tenfold by the hero being in a tangible visible shape and not by any means inclined to thwart or disdain the allegiance of the goldenhaired girl  nay as family connections frequently meeting they had acted upon each others minds more than either knew even when the hour of parting had come and words had been spoken which gave honora something more to cherish in the image of owen sandbrook than even the hero and saint  there then she stood and dreamt pensive and saddened indeed but with a melancholy trenching very nearly on happiness in the intensity of its admiration and the vague ennobling future of devoted usefulness in which her heart already claimed to share as her person might in some far away period on which she could not dwell                 picture i find i cant spare you honora  a sound approached a firm footstep falling with strong elasticity and such regular cadences that it seemed to chime in with the pinetree music and did not startle her till it came so near that there was distinctive character to be discerned in the tread and then with a strange new shyness she would have slipped away but she had been seen and humfrey with his timber race in his hand appeared on the path exclaiming ah honor is it you come out to meet me like old times you have been so much taken up with your friend master owen that i have scarcely seen you of late  honor did not move away but she blushed deeply as she said i am afraid i did not come to meet you humfrey  no  what you came for the sake of a brown study  i wish i had known you were not busy for i have been round all the woods marking timber  ah said she rousing herself with some effort i wonder how many trees i should have saved from the slaughter  did you go and condemn any of my pets  not that i know of said humfrey  i have touched nothing near the house  not even the old beech that was scathed with lightning  you know papa says that is the touchstone of influence sarah and mr west both against me laughed honora quite restored to her natural manner and confiding ease  the beech is likely to stand as long as you wish it said humfrey with an unaccustomed sort of matteroffact gravity which surprised and startled her so as to make her bethink herself whether she could have behaved ill about it been saucy to sarah or the like  thank you she said have i made a fuss  no honor he said with deliberate kindness shutting up his knife and putting it into his pocket only i believe it is time we should come to an understanding  more than ever did she expect one of his kind remonstrances and she looked up at him in expectation and ready for defence but his broad sunburnt countenance looked marvellously heated and he paused ere he spoke  i find i cant spare you honora you had better stay at the holt for good  her cheeks flamed and her heart galloped but she could not let herself understand  honor you are old enough now and i do not think you need fear  it is almost your home already and i believe i can make you happy with the blessing of god  he paused but as she could not frame an answer in her consternation continued perhaps i should not have spoken so suddenly but i thought you would not mind me i should like to have had one word from my little honor before i go to your father but dont if you had rather not  oh dont go to papa please dont she cried it would only make him sorry  humfrey stood as if under an unexpected shock  oh how came you to think of it she said in her distress i never did and it can never bei am so sorry  very well my dear do not grieve about it said humfrey only bent on soothing her i dare say you are quite right you are used to people in london much more suitable to you than a stupid homely fellow like me and it was a foolish fancy to think it might be otherwise  dont cry honor dear i cant bear that  oh humfrey only understand please  you are the very dearest person in the world to me after papa and mamma and as to fine london people oh no indeed  but  it is owen sandbrook i understand said humfrey gravely  she made no denial  but honor he anxiously exclaimed you are not going out in this wild way among the backwoods it would break your mothers heart and he is not fit to take care of you  i mean he cannot think of it now  o no no i could not leave papa and mamma but some time or other  is this arranged  does your father know it  oh humfrey of course  then it is an engagement  no said honora sadly papa said i was too young and he wished i had heard nothing about it  we are to go on as if nothing had happened and i know they think we shall forget all about it  as if we could  not that i wish it to be different  i know it would be wicked to desert papa and mamma while she is so unwell  the truth is humfrey and her voice sank that it cannot be while they live  my poor little honor he said in a tone of the most unselfish compassion  she had entirely forgotten his novel aspect and only thought of him as the kindest friend to whom she could open her heart  dont pity me she said in exultation think what it is to be his choice  would i have him give up his aims and settle down in the loveliest village in england  no indeed for then it would not be owen i am happier in the thought of him than i could be with everything present to enjoy  i hope you will continue to find it so he said repressing a sigh  i should be ashamed of myself if i did not she continued with glistening eyes  should not i have patience to wait while he is at his real glorious labour  and as to home thats not altered only better and brighter for the definite hope and aim that will go through everything and make me feel all i do a preparation  yes you know him well said humfrey you saw him constantly when he was at westminster  o yes and always  why humfrey it is my great glory and pleasure to feel that he formed me  when he went to oxford he brought me home all the thoughts that have been my better life  all my dearest books we read together and what used to look dry and cold gained light and life after he touched it  yes i see  his tone reminded her of what had passed and she said timidly i forgot  i ought not  i have vexed you humfrey  no he said in his full tender voice i see that it was vain to think of competing with one of so much higher claims  if he goes on in the course he has chosen yours will have been a noble choice honor and i believe he added with a sweetness of smile that almost made her forgive the if that you are one to be better pleased so than with more ordinary happiness  i have no doubt it is all right  dear humfrey you are so good she said struck with his kind resignation and utter absence of acerbity in his disappointment  forget this honora he said as they were coming to the end of the pine wood let us be as we were before  honora gladly promised and excepting for her wonder at such a step on the part of the cousin whose plaything and pet she had hitherto been she had no temptation to change her manner  she loved him as much as ever but only as a kind elder brother and she was glad that he was wise enough to see his immeasurable inferiority to the young missionary  it was a wonderful thing and she was sorry for his disappointment but after all he took it so quietly that she did not think it could have hurt him much  it was only that he wanted to keep his pet in the country  he was not capable of love like owen sandbrooks                                        years passed on  rumour had bestowed mr charlecote of hiltonbury on every lady within twenty miles but still in vain  his mother was dead his sister married to an old college fellow who had waited half a lifetime for a living but still he kept house alone  and open house it was with a dinnertable ever expanding for chance guests strawberry or syllabub feasts half the summer and christmas feasts extending wide on either side of the twelve days  every one who wanted a holiday was free of the holt young sportsmen tried their inexperienced guns under the squires patient eye and mammas disposed of their children for weeks together to enjoy the run of the house and garden and rides according to age on pony donkey or mr charlecote no festivity in the neighbourhood was complete without his sunshiny presence he was wanted wherever there was any family event and was godfather guardian friend and adviser of all  every one looked on him as a sort of exclusive property yet he had room in his heart for all as a magistrate he was equally indispensable in county government and a charity must be undeserving indeed that had not humfrey charlecote esq on the committee  in his own parish he was a beneficent monarch on his own estate a mighty farmer owning that his relaxation and delight were his turnips his bullocks and machines and so content with them and with his guests that honora never recollected that walk in the pine woods without deciding that to have monopolized him would have been an injury to the public and perhaps less for his happiness than this free openhearted bachelor life  seldom did she recall that scene to mind for she had never been by it rendered less able to trust to him as her friend and protector and she stood in need of his services and his comfort when her fathers death had left him the nearest relative who could advise or transact business for her and her mother  then indeed she leant on him as on the kindest and most helpful of brothers  mrs charlecote was too much acclimatized to the city to be willing to give up her old residence and honor not only loved it fondly but could not bear to withdraw from the local charities where her tasks had hitherto lain and woolstonelane therefore continued their home though the summer and autumn usually took them out of london  such was the change in honoras outward life  how was it with that inmost shrine where dwelt her heart and soul  a copious letter writer owen sandbrooks correspondence never failed to find its way to her though they did not stand on such terms as to write to one another and in those letters she lived doing her days work with cheerful brightness and seldom seeming preoccupied but imagination heart and soul were with his mission  very indignant was she when the authorities instead of sending him to the interesting children of the forests thought proper to waste him on mere colonists some of them yankee some presbyterian scots  he was asked insolent nasal questions his goods were coolly treated as common property and it was intimated to him on all hands that as englishman he was little in their eyes as clergyman less as gentleman least of all was this what he had sacrificed everything for  by dint of strong complaints and entreaties after he had quarrelled with most of his flock he accomplished an exchange into a district where red men formed the chief of his charge and honora was happy and watched for histories of noble braves gallant hunters and meekeyed squaws  slowly slowly she gathered that the picturesque deerskins had become dirty blankets and that the diseased filthy sophisticated savages were among the worst of the pitiable specimens of the effect of contact with the most evil side of civilization  to them as owen wrote a missionary was only a white man who gave no brandy and the rest of his parishioners were their obdurate greedy trading tempters  it had been a shame to send him to such a hopeless set when there were others on whom his toils would not be thrown away  however he should do his best  and honor went on expecting the wonders his best would work only the more struck with admiration by hearing that the locality was a swamp of luxuriant vegetation and equally luxuriant fever and ague and the letter he wrote thence to her mother on the news of their loss did her more good than all humfreys considerate kindness  next he had had the ague and had gone to toronto for change of air report spoke of mr sandbrook as the most popular preacher who had appeared in toronto for years attracting numbers to his pulpit and sending them away enraptured by his power of language  how beautiful that a man of such talents always so much stimulated by appreciation should give up all this most congenial scene and devote himself to his obscure mission  report said more but honora gave it no credit till old mr sandbrook called one morning in woolstonelane by his nephews desire to announce to his friends that he had formed an engagement with miss charteris the daughter of a general officer there in command  honor sat out all the conversation and mrs charlecote did not betray herself though burning with a mothers wrath she did nothing worse than hope they would be happy  yet honor had not dethroned the monarch of her imagination  she reiterated to herself and to her mother that she had no ground of complaint that it had been understood that the past was to be forgotten and that owen was far more worthily employed than in dwelling on them no blame could attach to him and it was wise to choose one accustomed to the country and able to carry out his plans  the personal feeling might go but veneration survived  mrs charlecote never rested till she had learnt all the particulars  it was a dashing fashionable family and miss charteris had been the gayest of the gay till she had been impressed by mr sandbrooks ministrations from pope to lover honor knew how easy was the transition but she zealously nursed her admiration for the beauty who was exchanging her gaieties for the forest missions she made her mother write cordially and send out a pretty gift and treated as a personal affront all reports of the charteris disapprobation and of the selfwill of the young people  they were married and the next news that honora heard was that the old general had had a fit from passion thirdly came tidings that the eldest son a prosperous mp had not only effected a reconciliation but had obtained a capital living for mr sandbrook not far from the family seat  mrs charlecote declared that her daughter should not stay in town to meet the young couple and honoras resistance was not so much dignity as a feverish spirit of opposition which succumbed to her sense of duty but not without such wear and tear of strained cheerfulness and suppressed misery that when at length her mother had brought her away the fatigue of the journey completed the work and she was prostrated for weeks by low fever  the blow had fallen  he had put his hand to the plough and looked back  faithlessness towards herself had been passed over unrecognized faithlessness towards his selfconsecration was quite otherwise  that which had absorbed her affections and adoration had proved an unstable excitable being  alas would that long ago she had opened her eyes to the fact that it was her own lofty spirit not his steadfastness which had first kept it out of the question that the mission should be set aside for human love  the crash of her idolatry was the greater because it had been so highly pitched so closely intermingled with the true worship  she was long ill the past series of disappointments telling when her strength was reduced and for many a week she would lie still and dreamy but fretted and wearied so as to control herself with difficulty when in the slightest degree disturbed or called upon to move or think  when her strength returned under her mothers tender nursing the sense of duty revived  she thought her youth utterly gone with the thinning of her hair and the wasting of her cheeks but her mother must be the object of her care and solicitude and she would exert herself for her sake to save her grief and hide the wound left by the rending away of the jewel of her heart  so she set herself to seem to like whatever her mother proposed and she acted her interest so well that insensibly it became real  after all she was but fourandtwenty and the fever had served as an expression of the feeling that would have its way she had had a long rest which had relieved the sense of pentup and restrained suffering and vigour and buoyancy were a part of her character her tone and manner resumed their cheerfulness her spirits came back though still with the dreary feeling that the hope and aim of life were gone when she was left to her own musings she was little changed and went on with daily life contented and lively over the details and returning to her interest in reading in art poetry and in all good works while her looks resumed their brightness and her mother congratulated herself once more on the rounded cheek and profuse curls  at the years end humfrey charlecote renewed his proposal  it was no small shock to find herself guilty of his having thus long remained single and she was touched by his kind forbearance but there was no bringing herself either to love him or to believe that he loved her with such love as had been her vision  the image around which she had bound her heartstrings came between him and her and again she begged his pardon and told him she liked him too well as he was to think of him in any other light  again he with the most tender patience and humility asked her to forgive him for having harassed her and betrayed so little chagrin that she ascribed his offer to generous compassion at her desertion    chapter ii       he who lets his feelings run        in soft luxurious flow     shrinks when hard service must be done        and faints at every woe  seven years more and honora was in mourning for her mother  she was alone in the world without any near or precious claim those clinging tendrils of her heart rent from their oldest surest earthly stay and her time left vacant from her dearest most constant occupation  her impulse was to devote herself and her fortune at once to the good work which most engaged her imagination but humfrey charlecote her sole relation since heart complaint had carried off his sister sarah interfered with the authority he had always exercised over her and insisted on her waiting one full year before pledging herself to anything  at oneandthirty with her golden hair and light figure her delicate skin and elastic step she was still too young to keep house in solitude and she invited to her home a friendless old governess of her own sick at heart with standing for the governesss institution promising her a daughters care and attendance on her old age  gentle old miss wells was but too happy in her new quarters though she constantly averred that she knew she should not continue there treated as injuries to herself all honors assertions of the dignity of age and old maidishness and remained convinced that she should soon see her married  honora had not seen mr sandbrook since his return from canada though his living was not thirty miles from the city  there had been exchanges of calls when he had been in london but these had only resulted in the leaving of cards and from various causes she had been unable to meet him at dinner  she heard of him however from their mutual connection old mrs sandbrook who had made a visit at wrapworth and came home stored with anecdotes of the style in which he lived the charms of mrs sandbrook and the beauty of the children  as far as honora could gather and very unwillingly she did so he was leading the life of an easygoing wellbeneficed clergyman not neglecting the parish according to the requirements of the day indeed slightly exceeding them very popular goodnatured and charitable and in great request in a numerous demisuburban neighbourhood for all sorts of not unclerical gaieties  the rev o sandbrook was often to be met with in the papers preaching everywhere and for everything and whispers went about of his speedy promotion to a situation of greater note  in the seventh year of his marriage his wife died and honora was told of his overwhelming grief how he utterly refused all comfort or alleviation and threw himself with all his soul into his parish and his children  people spoke of him as going about among the poor from morning to night with his little ones by his side shrinking from all other society teaching them and nursing them himself and endeavouring to the utmost to be as both parents in one  the youngest a delicate infant soon followed her mother to the grave and old mrs sandbrook proved herself to have no parents heart by being provoked with his agonizing grief for the poor little sickly thing while it was not in honoras nature not to feel the more tenderly towards the idol of her girlish days because he was in trouble  it was autumn the period when leaves fall off and grow damp and london birds of passage fly home to their smoky nests  honora who had gone to weymouth chiefly because she saw miss wells would be disappointed if she did otherwise when there had grown happily at home with the waves and in talking to the old fishermen but had come back because miss wells thought it chilly and dreary and pined for london warmth and snugness the noonday sun had found the way in at the oriel window of the drawingroom and traced the reflection of the merchants mark upon the upper pane in distorted outline on the wainscoted wall it smiled on the glowing tints of honoras hair but seemed to die away against the blackness of her dress as she sat by the table writing letters while opposite in the brightness of the fire sat the pale placid miss wells with her morning nest of sermon books and needlework around her  honor yawned miss wells looked up with kind anxiety  she knew such a yawn was equivalent to a sigh and that it was dreary work to settle in at home again this first time without the mother  then honor smiled and played with her penwiper  well she said it is comfortable to be at home again  i hope you will soon be able to feel so my dear said the kind old governess  i mean it said honor cheerfully then sighing but do you know mr askew wishes his curates to visit at the asylum instead of ladies  miss wells burst out into all the indignation that was in her mild nature  honor not to visit at the asylum founded chiefly by her own father  it is a parish affair now said honor and i believe those miss stones and their set have been very troublesome  besides i think he means to change its character  it is very inconsiderate of him said miss wells he ought to have consulted you  every one loves his own charity the best said honora humfrey says endowments are generally a mistake each generation had better do its own work to the utmost  i wish mr askew had not begun now it was the work i specially looked to but i let it alone whileand he cannot be expected  i should have expected it of him though exclaimed miss wells and he ought to know better  how have you heard it  i have a note from him this morning said honora he asks me humfrey charlecotes address you know he and mr sandbrook are trustees and her voice grew the sadder  if i am not much mistaken mr charlecote will represent to him his want of consideration  i think not said honora i should be sorry to make the clergymans hard task here any harder for the sake of my feelings  late incumbents daughters are proverbially inconvenient  no i would not stand in the way but it makes me feel as if my work in st wulstans were done and the tears dropped fast  dear dear honora began the old lady eagerly but her words and honoras tears were both checked by the sound of a bell that bell within the court to which none but intimates found access  strange  it is the thought of old times i suppose said honor smiling but i could have said that was owen sandbrooks ring  the words were scarcely spoken ere mr sandbrook and captain charteris were announced and there entered a clergyman leading a little child in each hand  how changed from the handsome hopeful youth from whom she had parted  thin slightly bowed griefstricken and worn she would scarcely have known him and as if to hide how much she felt she bent quickly after shaking hands with him to kiss the two children flaxencurled creatures in white with black ribbons  they both shrank closer to their father  cilly my love owen my man speak to miss charlecote he said she is a very old friend of mine  this is my bonny little housekeeper he added and heres a sturdy fellow for four years old is not he  the girl a delicate fairy of six barely accepted an embrace and clung the faster to her father with a gesture as though to repel all advance the boy took a good stare out of a pair of resolute gray eyes with one foot in advance and offered both hands  honora would have taken him on her knee but he retreated and both leant against their father as he sat an arm round each after shaking hands with miss wells whom he recollected at once and presenting his brotherinlaw whose broad open sailor countenance hardy and weatherstained was a great contrast to his pale hollow furrowed cheeks and heavy eyes  will you tell me your name my dear said honora feeling the children the easiest to talk to but the little girls pretty lips pouted and she nestled nearer to her father  her name is lucilla he answered with a sigh recalling that it had been his wifes name  we are all somewhat of little savages he added in excuse for the childs silence  we have seen few strangers at wrapworth of late  i did not know you were in london  it was a sudden measureall my brothers doing he said i am quite taken out of my own guidance  i went down to wrapworth and found him very unwell quite out of order and neglecting himself said the captain so i have brought him up for advice as i could not make him hear reason  i was afraid you were looking very ill said honora hardly daring to glance at his changed face  cant help being ill returned captain charteris running about the village in all weathers in a coat like that and sitting down to play with the children in his wet things  i saw what it would come to last time  mr sandbrook could not repress a cough which told plainly what it was come to  miss wells asked whom he intended to consult and there was some talk on physicians but the subject was turned off by mr sandbrook bending down to point out to little owen a beautiful carving of a brooding dove on her nest which formed the central bracket of the fine old mantelpiece  there my man that pretty bird has been sitting there ever since i can remember  how like it all looks to old times  i could imagine myself running in from westminster on a saints day  it is little altered in some things said honor  the last great change was too fresh  yes said mr sandbrook raising his eyes towards her with the look that used to go so deep of old we have both gone through what makes the unchangeableness of these impassive things the more striking  i cant see said the little girl pulling his hand  let me lift you up my dear said honora but the child turned her back on her and said father  he rose and was bending at the little imperious voice though evidently too weak for the exertion but the sailor made one step forward and pouncing on miss lucilla held her up in his arms close to the carving the two little feet made signs of kicking and she said in anything but a grateful voice put me down uncle kit  uncle kit complied and she retreated under her papas wing pouting but without another word of being lifted though she had been far too much occupied with struggling to look at the dove  meantime her brother had followed up her request by saying me and he fairly put out his arms to be lifted by miss charlecote and made most friendly acquaintance with all the curiosities of the carving  the rest of the visit was chiefly occupied by the children to whom their father was eager to show all that he had admired when little older than they were thus displaying a perfect and minute recollection and affection for the place which much gratified honora  the little girl began to thaw somewhat under the influence of amusement but there was still a curious ungraciousness towards all attentions  she required those of her father as a right but shook off all others in a manner which might be either shyness or independence but as she was a pretty and naturally graceful child it had a somewhat engaging air of caprice  they took leave mr sandbrook telling the children to thank miss charlecote for being so kind to them which neither would do and telling her as he pressed her hand that he hoped to see her again  honora felt as if an old page in her history had been reopened but it was not the page of her idolatry it was that of the fall of her idol  she did not see in him the champion of the truth but his presence palpably showed her the excitable weakness which she had taken for inspiration while the sweetness and sympathy warmed her heart towards him and made her feel that she had underrated his attractiveness  his implications that he knew she sympathized with him had touched her greatly and then he looked so ill  a note from old mrs sandbrook begged her to meet him at dinner the next day and she was glad of the opportunity of learning the doctors verdict upon him though all the time she knew the meeting would be but pain bringing before her the disappointment not of him but in him  no one was in the drawingroom but captain charteris who came and shook hands with her as if they were old friends but she was somewhat amazed at missing mrs sandbrook whose formality would be shocked by leaving her guests in the lurch  some disturbance in the nursery department i fancy said the captain those children have never been from home and they are rather exacting poor things  poor little things echoed honora then anxious to profit by the teteatete has mr sandbrook seen dr l  yes it is just as i apprehended  lungs very much affected right one nearly gone  nothing for it but the mediterranean  indeed  it is no wonder  since my poor sister died he has never taken the most moderate care of his health perfectly revelled in dreariness and desolateness i believe  he has had this cough about him ever since the winter when he walked up and down whole nights with that poor child and never would hear of any advice till i brought him up here almost by force  i am sure it was time  may it be in time thats all  italy does so much  but what will become of the children  they must go to my brothers of course  i have told him i will see him there but i will not have the children  theres not the least chance of his mending if they are to be always lugging him about  the captain was interrupted by the entrance of mrs sandbrook who looked a good deal worried though she tried to put it aside but on the captain saying im afraid that you have troublesome guests maam out it all came how it had been discovered late in the day that master owen must sleep in his papas room in a crib to himself and how she had been obliged to send out to hire the necessary articles subject to his nurses approval and the captains sympathy having opened her heart she further informed them of the inconvenient rout the said nurse had made about getting new milk for them for which honor could have found it in her heart to justify her and poor owen is just as bad quoth the old lady i declare those children are wearing his very life out and yet he will not hear of leaving them behind  she was interrupted by his appearance at that moment as usual with a child in either hand and a very sad picture it was so mournful and spiritless was his countenance with the hectic tint of decay evident on each thin cheek and those two fair healthful creatures clinging to him thoughtless of their past loss unconscious of that which impended little owen after one good stare evidently recognized a friend in miss charlecote and let her seat him upon her knee listening to her very complacently but gazing very hard all the time at her till at last with an experimental air he stretched one hand and stroked the broad golden ringlet that hung near him evidently to satisfy himself whether it really was hair  then he found his way to her watch a pretty little one from geneva with enamelled flowers at the back which so struck his fancy that he called out cilly look  the temptation drew the little girl nearer but with her hands behind her back as if bent on making no advance to the stranger  honora thought her the prettiest child she had ever seen  small and lightly formed there was more symmetry in her little fairy figure than usual at her age and the skin was exquisitely fine and white tinted with a soft eglantine pink deepening into roses on the cheeks the hair was in long flaxen curls and the eyelashes so long and fair that at times they caught a glossy light shaded eyes of that deep blue upon that limpid white which is like nothing but the clear tints of old porcelain the features were as yet unformed but small and delicate and the upright napoleon gesture had something peculiarly quaint and pretty in such a softlooking little creature  the boy was a handsome fellow with more solidity and sturdiness and honora could scarcely continue to amuse him as she thought of the fathers pain in parting with two such beingshis sole objects of affection  a moments wish flashed across her but was dismissed the next moment as a mere childish romance  old mr sandbrook came in and various other guests arrived old acquaintance to whom owen must be reintroduced and he looked fagged and worn by the time all the greetings had been exchanged and all the remarks made on his children  when dinner was announced he remained to the last with them and did not appear in the diningroom till his uncle had had time to look round for him and mutter something discontentedly about those brats  the vacant chair was beside honora and he was soon seated in it but at first he did not seem inclined to talk and leant back so white and exhausted that she thought it kinder to leave him to himself  when somewhat recruited he said in a low voice something of his hopes that his little cilly as he called her would be less shy another time and honora responding heartily he quickly fell into the parental strain of anecdotes of the childrens sayings and doings whence honora collected that in his estimation lucillas forte was decision and owens was sweetness and that he was completely devoted to them nursing and teaching them himself and finding his whole solace in them  tender pity moved her strongly towards him as she listened to the evidences of the desolateness of his home and his heavy sorrow and yet it was pity alone admiration would not revive and indeed in spite of herself her judgment would now and then respond unwise or weak or why permit this at details of lucillas mutinerie  presently she found that his intentions were quite at variance with those of his brother  his purpose was fixed to take the children with him  they are very young said honora  yes but their nurse is a most valuable person and can arrange perfectly for them and they will always be under my eye  that was just what captain charteris seemed to dread  he little knows began mr sandbrook with a sigh  yes i know he is most averse to it and he is one who always carries his point but he will not do so here he imagines that they may go to their aunts nursery but with an added air of confidence that will never do  honoras eyes asked more  in fact he said as the flush of pain rose on his cheeks the charteris children are not brought up as i should wish to see mine there are influences at work there not suited for those whose home must be a country parsonage if  little cilly has come in for more admiration there already than is good for her  it cannot be easy for her not to meet with that  why no said the gratified father smiling sadly but castle blanch training might make the mischief more serious  it is a gay household and i cannot believe with kit charteris that the children are too young to feel the blight of worldly influence  do not you think with me nora he concluded in so exactly the old words and manner as to stir the very depths of her heart but woe worth the change from the hopes of youth to this premature fading into despondency and the implied farewell  she did think with him completely and felt the more for him as she believed that these charterises had led him and his wife into the gaieties which since her death he had forsworn and abhorred as temptations  she thought it hard that he should not have his children with him and talked of all the various facilities for taking them that she could think of till his face brightened under the grateful sense of sympathy  she did not hold the same opinion all the evening  the two children made their appearance at dessert and there began by insisting on both sitting on his knees owen consented to come to her but lucilla would not stir though she put on some pretty little coquettish airs and made herself extremely amiable to the gentleman who sat on her fathers other hand making smart replies that were repeated round the table with much amusement  but the ordinance of departure with the ladies was one of which the sprite had no idea honor held out her hand for her aunt sandbrook called her her father put her down she shook her curls and said she should not leave father it was stupid up in the drawingroom and she hated ladies which confession set every one laughing so as quite to annihilate the effect of mr sandbrooks yes go my dear  finally he took the two upstairs himselfthe stairs which as he had told honora that evening were his greatest enemies and he remained a long time in their nursery not coming down till tea was in progress mrs sandbrook always made it herself at the great silver urn which had been a testimonial to her husband and it was not at first that she had a cup ready for him  he looked even worse than at dinner and honora was anxious to see him resting comfortably but he had hardly sat down on the sofa and taken the cup in his hand before a dismal childish wail was heard from above and at once he started up so hastily as to cough violently  captain charteris breaking off a conversation came rapidly across the room just as he was moving to the door  youre not going to those imps  owen moved his head and stepped forward  ill settle them  renewed cries met his ears  noa strange place he said  i must  he put his brotherinlaw back with his hand and was gone  the captain could not contain his vexation thats the way those brats serve him every night he exclaimed they will not attempt to go to sleep without him  why ive found him writing his sermon with the boy wrapped up in blankets in his lap theres no sense in it  after about ten minutes during which mr sandbrook did not reappear captain charteris muttered something about going to see about him and stayed away a good while  when he came down he came and sat down by honora and said he is going to bed quite done for  that must be better for him than talking here  why what do you think i found  those intolerable brats would not stop crying unless he told them a story and there was he with his voice quite gone coughing every two minutes and romancing on with some allegory about children marching on their little paths and playing on their little fiddles  so i told miss cilly that if she cared a farthing for her father she would hold her tongue and i packed her up and put her into her nursery  shell mind me when she sees i will be minded and as for little owen nothing would satisfy him but his promising not to go away  i saw that chap asleep before i came down so theres no fear of the yarn beginning again but you see what chance there is of his mending while those children are at him day and night  poor things they little know  one does not expect them to know but one does expect them to show a little rationality  it puts one out of all patience to see him so weak if he is encouraged to take them abroad he may do so but i wash my hands of him  i wont be responsible for himlet them go alone  honora saw this was a reproach to her for the favour with which she had regarded the project  she saw that the fathers weakness quite altered the case and her former vision flashed across her again but she resolutely put it aside for consideration and only made the unmeaning answer it is very sad and perplexing  a perplexity of his own making  as for their not going to castle blanch they were always there in my poor sisters time a great deal more than was good for any of them or his parish either as i told him then and now if he finds out that it is a worldly household as he calls it why what harm is that to do to a couple of babies like those  if mrs charteris does not trouble herself much about the children there are governesses and nurses enough for a score  i must own said honora that i think he is right  children are never too young for impressions  ill tell you what miss charlecote the way he is going on is enough to ruin the best children in the world  that little cilly is the most arrant little flirt i ever came across it is like a comedy to see the absurd little puss going on with the curate ay and with every parson that comes to wrapworth and she sees nothing else  impressions  all she wants is to be safe shut up with a good governess and other children  it would do her a dozen times more good than all his stories of good children and their rocky paths and boats that never sailed on any reasonable principle  poor child said honora smiling she is a little witch  and continued the uncle if he thinks it so bad for them he had better take the only way of saving them from it for the future or they will be there for life  if he gets through this winter it will only be by the utmost care  honora kept her project back with the less difficulty because she doubted how it would be received by the rough captain but it won more and more upon her as she rattled home through the gaslights and though she knew she should learn to love the children only to have the pang of losing them she gladly cast this foreboding aside as selfish and applied herself impartially as she hoped to weigh the duty but trembling were the hands that adjusted the balance  alone as she stood without a tie was not she marked out to take such an office of mere pity and charity  could she see the friend of her childhood forced either to peril his life by his care of his motherless children or else to leave them to the influences he so justly dreaded  did not the case cry out to her to follow the promptings of her heart  ay but might not said caution her assumption of the charge lead their father to look on her as willing to become their mother  oh fie on such selfish prudery imputing such a thought to yonder brokenhearted sinking widower  he had as little room for such folly as she had inclination to find herself on the old terms  the hero of her imagination he could never be again but it would be weak consciousness to scruple at offering so obvious an act of compassion  she would not trust herself she would go by what miss wells said  nevertheless she composed her letter to owen sandbrook between waking and sleeping all night and dreamed of little creatures nestling in her lap and small hands playing with her hair  how coolly she strove to speak as she described the dilemma to the old lady and how her heart leapt when miss wells her mind moving in the grooves traced out by sympathy with her pupil exclaimed poor little dears what a pity they should not be with you my dear they would be a nice interest for you  perhaps miss wells thought chiefly of the brightening in her childs manner and the alert vivacity of eye and voice such as she had not seen in her since she had lost her mother but be that as it might her words were the very sanction so much longed for and ere long honora had her writingcase before her cogitating over the opening address as if her whole meaning were implied in them  my dear owen came so naturally that it was too like an attempt to recur to the old familiarity  my dear mr sandbrook  so formal as to be conscious  dear owen  yes that was the cousinly medium and in diffident phrases of restrained eagerness now seeming too affectionate now too cold she offered to devote herself to his little ones to take a house on the coast and endeavour to follow out his wishes with regard to them her good old friend supplying her lack of experience  with a beating heart she awaited the reply  it was but few lines but all owen was in them      my dear norayou always were an angel of goodness  i feel your     kindness more than i can express  if my darlings were to be left at     all it should be with you but i cannot contemplate it  bless you     for the thought                                                 yours ever o sandbrook  she heard no more for a week during which a dread of pressing herself on him prevented her from calling on old mrs sandbrook  at last to her surprise she received a visit from captain charteris the person whom she looked on as least propitious and most inclined to regard her as an enthusiastic silly young lady  he was very gruff and gave a bad account of his patient  the little boy had been unwell and the exertion of nursing him had been very injurious the captain was very angry with illness child and father  however he said theres one good thing l has forbidden the childrens perpetually hanging on him sleeping in his room and so forth  with the constitutions to which they have every right poor things he could not find a better way of giving them the seeds of consumption  that settles it  poor fellow he has not the heart to hinder their always pawing him so theres nothing for it but to separate them from him  and may i have them asked honor too anxious to pick her words  why i told him i would come and see whether you were in earnest in your kind offer  you would find them no sinecure  it would be a great happiness said she struggling with tears that might prevent the captain from depending on her good sense and speaking calmly and sadly i have no other claims nothing to tie me to any place  i am a good deal older than i look and my friend miss wells has been a governess  she is really a very wise judicious person to whom he may quite trust  owen and i were children together and i know nothing that i should like better than to be useful to him  humph said the captain more touched than he liked to betray well it seems the only thing to which he can bear to turn  oh she said breaking off but emotion and earnestness looked glistening and trembling through every feature  very well said captain charteris im glad at least that there is some one to have pity on the poor things  theres my brothers wife she doesnt say no but she talks of convenience and spoilt childrensandbrook was quite right after all i would not tell him how she answered me  spoilt children to be sure they are poor things but she might recollect they have no mothersuch a fuss as she used to make with poor lucilla too  poor lucilla she would never have believed that dear caroline would have no better welcome for her little ones  spoilt indeed  a precious deal pleasanter children they are than any of the lot at castle blanch and better brought up too  the good captains indignation had made away with his consistency but honora did not owe him a grudge for revealing that she was his pis aller she was prone to respect a man who showed that he despised her and she only cared to arrange the details  he was anxious to carry away his charge at once since every day of this wear and tear of feeling was doing incalculable harm and she undertook to receive the children and nurse at any time  she would write at once for a house at some warm wateringplace and take them there as soon as possible and she offered to call that afternoon to settle all with owen  why said captain charteris i hardly know  one reason i came alone was that i believe that little elf of a cilly has some notion of what is plotting against her  you cant speak a word but that child catches up and she will not let her father out of her sight for a moment  then what is to be done  i would propose his coming here but the poor child would not let him go  that is the only chance  he has been forbidden the walking with them in his arms to put them to sleep and weve got the boy into the nursery and hed better be out of the house than hear them roaring for him  so if you have no objection and he is tolerable this evening i would bring him as soon as they are gone to bed  poor owen was evidently falling under the management of stronger hands than his own and it could only be hoped that it was not too late  his keeper brought him at a little after eight that evening  there was a look about him as if after the last stroke that had befallen him he could feel no more the bitterness of death was past his very hands looked woebegone and astray without the little fingers pressing them he could not talk at first he shook honors hand as if he could not bear to be grateful to her and only the hardest hearts could have endured to enter on the intended discussion  the captain was very gentle towards him and talk was made on other topics but gradually something of the influence of the familiar scene where his brightest days had been passed began to prevail  all was like old timesthe quaint old silver kettle and lamp the pattern of the china cups the ruddy play of the fire on the polished panels of the roomand he began to revive and join the conversation  they spoke of delaroches beautiful madonnas one of which was at the time to be seen at a printshopyes said mr sandbrook and little owen cried out as soon as he saw it that lady the lady with the flowery watch  honora smiled  it was an allusion to the old jests upon her auburn locks a greater compliment to her than to delaroche she said i saw that he was extremely curious to ascertain what my carrots were made of  do you know nora i never saw more than one person with such hair as yours said owen with more animation and oddly enough her name turned out to be charlecote  impossible  humfrey and i are the only charlecotes left that i know of where could it have been  it was at toronto  i must confess that i was struck by the brilliant hair in chapel  afterwards i met her once or twice  she was a canadian born and had just married a settler whose name i cant remember but her maiden name had certainly been charlecote i remembered it because of the coincidence  very curious i did not know there had been any charlecotes but ourselves  and humfrey charlecote has never married  never  what made owen raise his eyes at that moment just so that she met them and why did that dreadful uncontrollable crimson heat come mounting up over cheeks and temples tingling and spreading into her very neck just because it was the most hateful thing that could happen  and he saw it she knew he did so for he dropped his eyes at once and there was an absolute silence which she broke in desperation by an incoherent attempt to say something and that ended by blundering into the tender subjectthe children she found she had been talking about the place to which she thought of taking them a quiet spot on the northern coast of somersetshire  he could bear the pang a little better now and assented and the ice once broken there were so many details and injunctions that lay near his heart that the conversation never flagged  he had great reliance on their nurse and they were healthy children so that there was not much instruction as regarded the care of their little persons but he had a great deal to say about the books they were to be taught from the hymns they were to learn and the exact management required by lucillas peculiar temper and decided will  the theory was so perfect and so beautifully wise that honora sat by in reverence fearing her power of carrying it out and captain charteris listened with a shade of satire on his face and at last broke out with a very odd grunt as if he did not think this quite what he had seen at wrapworth parsonage  mr sandbrook coloured and checked himself  then after a pause he said in a very different tone perhaps so kit  it is only too easy to talk nora knows that there is a long way between my intentions and my practice  the humble dejection of that tone touched her more than she had been touched since he had wrung her hand long long ago  well said the captain perceiving only that he had given pain i will say this for your monkeys they do know what is right at least they have heard the articles of war which i dont fancy the other lot ever did  as to the discipline humph  it is much of a muchness and im not sure but it is not the best at the castle  the children are different at home said owen quietly but he added with the same sad humility i dare say they will be much the better for the change i know  but he broke off and put his hand before his eyes  honora hoped she should not be left alone with him but somehow it did happen  the captain went to bring the carriage into the court and get all imaginable wraps before trusting him out in the air and miss wells disappeared probably intending kindness  of course neither spoke till the captain was almost come back  then owen rose from where he had been sitting listlessly leaning back and slowly said nora we did not think it would end thus when i put my hand to the plough  i am glad to have been here again  i had not remembered what i used to be  i do not ask you to forgive me  you are doing so returning me good forshall i say evil  honor could not speak or look she drooped her head and her hair veiled her she held out her hand as the captain came in and felt it pressed with a feverish eager grasp and a murmured blessing  honora did not see mr sandbrook again but captain charteris made an incursion on her the next day to ask if she could receive the children on the ensuing morning  he had arranged to set off before daybreak embarking for ostend before the children were up so as to spare the actual parting and honora undertook to fetch them home in the course of the day  he had hoped to avoid their knowing of the impending separation but he could only prevail so far as to extract a promise that they should not know when it was to take place  their father had told them of their destination and his own as they sat on his bed in the morning before he rose and apparently it had gone off better than could have been expected little owen did not seem to understand and his sister was a child who never shed tears  the day came and honora awoke to some awe at the responsibility but with a yearning supplied a vacancy filled up  for at least six months she should be as a mother and a parents prayers could hardly have been more earnest  she had not long been dressed when a hasty peal was heard at the bell and no sooner was the door opened than in hurried captain charteris breathless and bearing a large plaid bundle with tangled flaxen locks drooping at one end and at the other rigid white legs socks trodden down one shoe wanting  he deposited it and there stood the eldest child her chin buried in her neck her fingers digging fast into their own palms her eyes gleaming fiercely at him under the penthouse she had made of her brows  theres an introduction he said panting for breath  found her in timethe strandlaid flat on back seat under all the plaids and bagsher father put up his feet and found herwe drove to the lanei ran down with hernot a momentcant stay goodbye little cilly goose to think she could go that figure  he advanced to kiss her but she lifted up her shoulder between him and her face much as a pugnacious pigeon flap its wings and he retreated  wiser not maybe  look here as honora hurried after him into the hall to ask after the patient if you have a bit of stickingplaster he had better not see this  lucilla had made her little pearls of teeth meet in the fleshy part of his palm  honora recoiled shocked producing the plaster from her pocket in an instant  little vixen he said half laughing but i was thankful to her for neither kicking nor struggling  poor child said honora perhaps it was as much agony as passion  he shrugged his shoulders as he held out his hand for her operations then hastily thanking her and wishing her goodbye rushed off again as the astonished miss wells appeared on the stairs  honor shrank from telling her what wounds had been received she thought the gentle lady would never get over such a proceeding and in fact she herself felt somewhat as if she had undertaken the charge of a little wild cat and quite uncertain what the young lady might do next  on entering the breakfastroom they found her sunk down all in a heap where her uncle had set her down her elbows on a low footstool and her head leaning on them the eyes still gazing askance from under the brows but all the energy and life gone from the little dejected figure  poor child  dear little thingwont you come to me  she stirred not  miss wells advanced but the childs only motion was to shake her frock at her as if to keep her off honora really afraid of the consequences of touching her whispered that they would leave her to herself a little the silver kettle came in and tea was made  lucilla my dear the servants are coming in to prayers  she did not offer to move and still honora let her alone and she remained in the same attitude while the psalm was read but afterwards there was a little approximation to kneeling in her position  lucilla dear child you had better come to breakfast  only another defying glance  miss wells with what honor thought defective judgment made pointed commendations of the tea the butter and honey but they had no effect honora though her heart ached for the wrench the poor child had undergone thought it best to affect indifference gave a hint of the kind and scrupulously avoided looking round at her till breakfast was finished  when she did so she no longer met the wary defiant gleam of the blue eyes they were fast shut the head had sunk on the arms and the long breathings of sleep heaved the little frame  poor little dear as miss wells might well exclaim she had kept herself wakeful the whole night that her father might not go without her knowledge  and how pretty she looked in that little black frock so ill and hastily put on one round white shoulder quite out of it and the long flaxen locks showing their silky fineness as they hung dispersed and tangled the pinky flush of sleep upon the little face pillowed on the rosy pair of arms and with a white unstockinged leg doubled under her  poor child there was more of the angel than the tigercat in her aspect now and they had tears in their eyes and moved softly lest they should startle her from her rest  but wakened she must be  honora was afraid of displeasing her domestic vizier and rendering him for ever unpropitious to her little guests if she deferred his removal of the breakfast things beyond a reasonable hour  how was the awaking to be managed  fright tears passion what change would come when the poor little maid must awake to her grief honora would never have expected so poetical a flight from her good old governess as the suggestion play to her but she took it eagerly and going to the disused piano which stood in the room began a low soft air the little sleeper stirred presently raised her head shook her hair off her ears and after a moment to their surprise her first word was mamma  honora was pausing but the child said go on and sat for a few moments as though recovering herself then rose and came forward slowly standing at last close to honora  there was a pause and she said mamma did that  never was a sound more welcome  honora dared to do what she had longed for so much put an arm round the little creature and draw her nearer nor did lucilla resist she only said wont you go on  i can make prettier music in the other room my dear we will go there only youve had no breakfast  you must be very hungry  lucilla turned round saw a nice little roll cut into slices and remembered that she was hungry and presently she was consuming it so prosperously under miss wellss superintendence that honor ventured out to endeavour to retard joness desire to take away by giving him orders about the carriage and then to attend to her other household affairs  by the time they were ended she found that miss wells had brought the child into the drawingroom where she had at once detected the piano and looking up at honora said eagerly now then  and honora fulfilled her promise while the child stood by softened and gratified until it was time to propose fetching little owen your little brotheryou will like to have him here  i want my father said lucilla in a determined voice as if nothing else were to satisfy her  poor child i know you do i am so sorry for you my dear little woman but you see the doctors think papa is more likely to get better if he has not you to take care of  i did not want my father to take care of me said the little lady proudly i take care of father i always make his tea and warm his slippers and bring him his coffee in the morning  and uncle kit never will put his gloves for him and warm his handkerchief  oh what will he do  i cant bear it  the violent grief so long kept back was coming now but not freely the little girl threw herself on the floor and in a tumult of despair and passion went on hurrying out her words its very hard  its all uncle kits doing  i hate him  yes i do  and she rolled over and over in her frenzy of feeling  my dear my dear cried honora kneeling by her this will never do papa would be very much grieved to see his little girl so naughty  dont you know how your uncle only wants to do him good and to make him get well  then why didnt he take me said lucilla gathering herself up and speaking sullenly  perhaps he thought you gave papa trouble and tired him  yes thats it and its not fair cried the poor child again why couldnt he tell me  i didnt know papa was ill he never told me so nor mr pendy either or how i would have nursed him  i wanted to do so much for him i wouldnt have asked him to tell me stories nor nothing no  and now they wont let me take care of him and she cried bitterly  yes said good gentle miss wells thinking more of present comfort than of the too possible future but you will go back to take care of him some day my dear  when the spring comes papa will come back to his little girl  spring  it was a long way off to a mind of six years old but it made lucilla look more amiably at miss wells  and suppose proceeded that good lady you were to learn to be as good and helpful a little girl as can be while he is gone and then nobody will wish to keep you from him  how surprised he would be  and then shall we go home said lucilla  miss wells uttered a somewhat rash assurance to that effect and the child came near her pacified and satisfied by the scheme of delightful goodness and progress to be made in order to please her fatheras she always called him  honor looked on thankful for the management that was subduing and consoling the poor little maid and yet unable to participate in it for though the kind old lady spoke in all sincerity it was impossible to honora to stifle a lurking fear that the hopes built on the prospect of his return had but a hollow foundation  however it attracted lucilla to miss wells so that honora did not fear leaving her on going to bring home little owen  the carriage which had conveyed the travellers had brought back news of his sisters discovery and capture and honora found mrs sandbrook much shocked at the enormity of the proceeding and inclined to pity honora for having charge of the most outrageous children she had ever seen  a very long letter had been left for her by their father rehearsing all he had before given of directions and dwelling still more on some others but then apparently repenting of laying down the law he ended by entreating her to use her own judgment believe in his perfect confidence and gratitude beyond expression for most unmerited kindness  little owen she heard had made the house resound with cries when his father was nowhere to be found but his nurse had quieted him and he came running to honora with an open confiding face  are you the lady and will you take me to cilly and the sea  and may i have a whale  though honora did not venture on promising him a tame whale in the bristol channel she had him clinging to her in a moment eager to set off to go to cilly and the dove he had seen at her house  its a nasty house herei want to come away he said running backwards and forwards between her and the window to look at the horses while nurses interminable boxes were being carried down  the troubles really seemed quite forgotten the boy sat on her knee and chattered all the way to woolstonelane and there he and lucilla flew upon each other with very pretty childish joy the sister doing the honours of the house in right of having been a little longer an inmate nurse caught her and dressed and combed her shoed her and sashed her so that she came down to dinner less picturesque but more respectable than at her first appearance that morning and except for the wonderful daintiness of both children dinner went off very well  all did go well till night and then owens woes began  oh what a piteous sobbing lamentation was it  daddy daddy not to be consoled not to be soothed awakening his sister to the same sad cry stilled only by exhaustion and sleepiness  poor little fellow  night after night it was the same  morning found him a happy bright child full of engaging ways and innocent sayings and quite satisfied with cousin honor but bedtime always brought back the same wailing  nurse a tidy brisk personage with a sensible deferential tone to her superiors and a caressing one to the children tried in vain assurances of papas soon coming back nay it might be feared that she held out that going to sleep would bring the morrow when he was to come but even this delusive promise failed the present was all and cousin honor herself was only not daddy though she nursed him and rocked him in her arms and fondled him and told stories or sung his lullaby with nightly tenderness till the last sobs had quivered into the smooth heavings of sleep  might only sea air and exercise act as a soporific  that was a better chance than the new promise which honora was vexed to find nurse holding out to poor little owen that if he would be a good boy he was going to papa  she was puzzled how to act towards a person not exactly under her authority but she took courage to speak about these false promises and found the remonstrance received in good part indeed nurse used to talk at much length of the children in a manner that implied great affection for them coupled with a sense that it would be an excellent thing for them to be in such judicious hands  honor always came away from nurse in good humour with herself  the locality she had chosen was a sheltered village on the north coast of somerset just where exmoor began to give grandeur to the outline in the rear and in front the welsh hills wore different tints of purple or gray according to the promise of weather lundy isle and the two lesser ones serving as the most prominent objects as they rose fromwell well honor counted herself as a somersetshire woman and could not brook hearing much about the hue of the bristol channel  at any rate just here it had been so kind as to wash up a small strip of pure white sand fit for any amount of digging for her children and though sandbeach was wateringplace enough to have the lodginghouses butchers and bakers so indispensable to the london mind it was not so much in vogue as to be overrun by fine ladies spoiling the children by admiring their beauty so said miss charlecote in her prudencebut was not she just as jealous as nurse that people should turn round a second time to look at those lovely little faces  that was a very happy charge to her and her good old governess with some drawbacks indeed but not such as to distress her over much  the chief was at first owens nightly sorrows his daily idleness over lessons lucillas pride and the exceeding daintiness of both children which made their meals a constant vexation and trouble  but what was this compared with the charm of their dependence on her and of hearing that newlyinvented pet name sweet honey invoked in every little concern that touched them  it was little owens name for her  he was her special favouritethere was no concealing it  lucilla did not need her as much and was of a vigorous independent nature that would stand alone to the utmost  owen gave his affection spontaneously if lucillas was won it must be at unawares  she was living in and for her absent father now and had nothing to spare for any one else or if she had miss wells who had the less claim on her was preferred to cousin honor  father was almost her religion though well taught and unusually forward in religious knowledge as far as honora dared to augur no motive save her love for him had a substantive existence as touching her feelings or ruling her actions  for him she said her prayers and learnt her hymns for him she consented to learn to hem handkerchiefs for him were those crooked letters for ever being written nay at the thought of his displeasure alone could her tears be made to flow when she was naughty and for him she endeavoured to be less fanciful at dinner as soon as her mind had grasped the perception that her not eating what was set before her might really hinder him from always having her with him  she was fairly manageable with very high spirits and not at all a silly or helpless child but though she obeyed miss charlecote it was only as obeying her father through her and his constant letters kept up the strong influence  in her most gracious moods she was always telling her little brother histories of what they should do when they got home to father and mr prendergast but to owen absence made a much greater difference though he still cried at night his sweet honey was what he wanted and with her caressing him he only dreaded her leaving him  he lavished his pretty endearments upon her and missed no one when he held her hand or sat in her lap stroking her curls and exchanging a good deal of fondling  he liked his hymns and enjoyed scripture stories making remarks that caused her to reverence him and though backward idle and sometimes very passionate his was exactly the legitimate character for a child such as she could deal with and love  she was as complete a slave to the two little ones as their father could have been all her habits were made to conform to their welfare and pleasure and very happy she was but the discipline was more decided than they had been used to there were habits to be formed and others to be broken and she was not weak enough not to act up to her duty in this respect even though her heart was winding round that sunnyfaced boy as fast as it had ever clung to his father  the new owen sandbrook with his innocent earnestness and the spiritual light in his eyes should fulfil all her dreams  christmas had passed mr sandbrook had begun to write to his children about seeing them soon lucillas slow hemming was stimulated by the hope of soon making her present and honora was marvelling at her own selfishness in dreading the moment when the little ones would be no longer hers when a hurried note of preparation came from captain charteris  a slight imprudence had renewed all the mischief and his patient was lying speechless under a violent attack of inflammation another letter and all was over  a shock indeed but in honoras eyes owen sandbrook had become chiefly the childrens father and their future was what concerned her most  how should she bear to part with his darlings for ever and to know them brought up in the way that was not good and which their father dreaded and when their orphanhood made her doubly tender over them  to little owen it was chiefly that papa was gone up there whither all his hymns and allegories pointed and at his age all that he did not actually see was much on a par the hope of meeting had been too distant for the extinction of it to affect him very nearly and he only understood enough to prompt the prettiest and most touching sayings wondering about the doings of papa mamma and little baby among the angels with as much reality as he had formerly talked of papa among the french  lucilla heard with more comprehension but her gay temper seemed to revolt against having sorrow forced on her  she would not listen and would not think her spirits seemed higher than ever and honora almost concluded that either she did not feel at all or that the moment of separation had exhausted all  her character made honora especially regret her destiny it was one only too congenial to the weeds that were more likely to be implanted than plucked up at castle blanch  captain charteris had written to say that he and probably his brother should come to sandbeach to relieve miss charlecote from the care of the children and she prized each day while she still had those dear little voices about the house  sweet honey said lucilla who had been standing by the window apparently watching the rain do uncle charteris and uncle kit want us to go away from you  i am very much afraid they do my dear  nurse said if you would ask them we might stay said lucilla tracing the course of a drop with her finger  if asking would do any good my dear sighed honor but i dont think nurse knows  you see you belong to your uncles now  i wont belong to uncle charteris cried lucilla passionately  i wont go to castle blanch  they were all cross to me ratia teased me and father said it was all their fault i was naughty and he would never take me there again  dont let uncle kit go and take me there and she clung to her friend as if the recollection of uncle kits victory by main force hung about her still  i wont i wont my child if i can help it but it will all be as your dear father may have fixed it and whatever he wishes i know that his little girl will do  many a dim hope did honora revolve and more than ever did she feel as if a piece of her heart would be taken away for the orphans fastened themselves upon her and little owen stroked her face and said naughty uncle kit should not take them away  she found from the children and nurse that about a year ago just after the loss of the baby there had been a most unsuccessful visit at castle blanch father and little ones had been equally miserable there in the separation of the large establishment and lucilla had been domineeringly petted by her youngest cousin horatia who chose to regard her as a baby and coerced her by bodily force such as was intolerable to so highspirited a child who was a little woman at home  she had resisted and fallen into dire disgrace and it was almost with horror that she regarded the place and the cousinhood  nurse appeared to have some private disgust of her own as well as to have much resented her childrens being convicted of naughtiness and she spoke strongly in confidence to honora of the ungodly ways of the whole household declaring that after the advantages she had enjoyed with her dear master she could not bear to live there though she mightyes she must be with the dear children just at first and she ventured to express strong wishes for their remaining in their present home where they had been so much improved  the captain came alone  he walked in from the inn just before luncheon with a wearied sad look about him as if he had suffered a good deal he spoke quietly and slowly and when the children came in he took them up in his arms and kissed them very tenderly  lucilla submitted more placably than honor expected but the moment they were set down they sprang to their friend and held by her dress  then came the meal which passed off with small efforts at making talk but with nothing memorable except the captains exclamation at the endwell thats the first time i ever dined with you children without a fuss about the meat  why cilly i hardly know you  i think the appetites are better for the sea air said honor not that she did not think it a great achievement  im afraid it has been a troublesome charge said the captain laying his hand on his nieces shoulder which she at once removed as disavowing his right in her  oh it has made me so happy said honor hardly trusting her voice i dont know how to yield it up  those understanding eyes of lucillas were drinking in each word but uncle kit ruthlessly saidthere its your walking time children you go out now  honora followed up his words with her orders and lucille obeyed only casting another wistful look as if she knew her fate hung in the scales it was showing tact such as could hardly have been expected from the little impetuous termagant and was the best pleading for her cause for her uncles first observation wasa wonder  six months back there would have been an explosion  i am glad you think them improved  civilized beings not plagues  you have been very good to them and as she intimated her own pleasure in them he continuedit will be better for them at castle blanch to have been a little broken in the change from his indulgence would have been terrible  if it were possible to leave them with me i should be so happy at length gasped honora meeting an inquiring dart from the captains eyes as he only made an interrogative sound as though to give himself time to think and she proceeded it broken sentencesif their uncle and aunt did not so very much wish for themperhapsi could  well said captain charteris apparently so little aided by his thoughts as to see no hope of overcoming his perplexity without expressing it the truth is that though i had not meant to say anything of it for i think relations should come first i believe poor sandbrook would have preferred it  and while her colour deepened and she locked her trembling fingers together to keep them still he went on  yes you cant think how often i called myself a dozen fools for having parted him from his children  never held up his head again  i could get him to take interest in nothingevery child he saw he was only comparing to one or other of them  after the year turned and he talked of coming home he was more cheerful but strangely enough for those last days at hyeres though he seemed better his spirits sank unaccountably and he would talk more of the poor little thing that he lost than of these then he had a letter from you which set him sighing and wishing they could always have such care  altogether i thought to divert him by taking him on that expedition but  well ive been provoked with him many a time but there was more of the real thing in him than in the rest of us and i feel as if the best part of our family were gone  and this was all  he was too ill to say much afterwards  couldnt speak when he rang in the morning  was gone by that time next day  now added the captain after a silence i tell you candidly that my feeling is that the ordinary course is right  i think charles ought to take the children and the children ought to be with charles  if you think so began honor with failing hopes  at the same time continued he i dont think theyll be so happy or so well cared for as by you and knowing poor owens wishes i should not feel justified in taking them away since you are so good as to offer to keep them  honor eagerly declared herself much obliged then thought it sounded ironical  unless he proceeded charles should strongly feel it his duty to take them home in which case  oh of course i could say nothing  very well then well leave it to his decision  so it remained and in trembling honora awaited the answer  it was in her favour that he was appointed to a ship since he was thus excluded from exercising any supervision over them at castle blanch and shortly after letters arrived gratefully acceding to her request family arrangements and an intended journey made her proposal doubly welcome for the present at least and mrs charteris was full of polite thanks  poor little waifs and strays  no one else wanted them but with her at least they had a haven of refuge and she loved them the more ardently for their forlorn condition  her own as they had never before been and if the tenure were uncertain she prized it doubly even though by a strange fatality she had never had so much trouble and vexation with them as arose at once on their being made over to her  when all was settled doubt over and the routine life begun lucilla evidently felt the blank of her vanished hopes and became fretful and captious weary of things in general and without sufficient motive to control her natural taste for the variety of naughtiness  honor had not undertaken the easiest of tasks but she neither shrank from her enterprise nor ceased to love the fiery little flighty sprite the pleasing torment of her lifeshe loved her only less than that model of childish sweetness her little owen                                        lucy dear child dont take your brother there  owen dear come back dont you see the mud youll sink in  im only getting a dear little crab sweet honey and the four little feet went deeper and deeper into the black mud  i cant have it done come back children i desire directly  the boy would have turned but his sister had hold of his hand  owen there he is  ill have him and as the crab scuttled sidelong after the retreating tide on plunged the children  lucy come here cried the unfortunate old hen as her ducklings took to the black amphibious mass but not a whit did lucilla heed  in the ardour of the chase on she went unheeding leaving her brother sticking half way where having once stopped he began to find it difficult to withdraw his feet and fairly screamed to sweet honey for help  his progress was not beyond what a few long vigorous steps of hers could come up with but deeply and blackly did she sink and when she had lifted her truant out of his two holes the increased weight made her go ankle deep at the first tread and just at the same moment a loud shriek proclaimed that lucilla in hey final assault on the crab had fallen flat on a yielding surface where each effort to rise sank her deeper and honora almost was expecting in her distress to see her disappear altogether ere the treacherous mud would allow her to come to the rescue  but in that instant of utmost need ere she could set down the little boy a gentleman with longlegged strides had crossed the intervening space and was bearing back the young lady from her mud bath  she raised her eyes to thank him  humfrey she exclaimed  honor so it was you was it  id no notion of it as he placed on her feet the little maiden encrusted with mud from head to foot while the rest of the party were all apparently cased in dark buskins of the same  come to see me and my children she said  i am ashamed you should find us under such circumstances though i dont know what would have become of us otherwise  no lucy you are too disobedient for any one to take notice of you yetyou must go straight home and be cleaned and not speak to mr charlecote till you are quite good  little owen here he ishe was quite led into it  but how good of you to come humfrey where are you  at the hoteli had a mind to come and see how you were getting on and id had rather more than usual to do of late so i thought i would take a holiday  they walked on talking for some seconds when presently as the squires hand hung down a little soft one stole into it and made him exclaim with a start i thought it was pontos nose  but though very fond of children he took up his hand and did not make the slightest response to the sly overture of the small coquette the effect as honor well knew of opposition quite as much as of her strong turn for gentlemen  she pouted a little and then marched on with dont care determination while humfrey and honora began to talk over hiltonbury affairs but were soon interrupted by owen who accustomed to all her attention did not understand her being occupied by any one else honey honeypots and a pull at her hand when she did not immediately attend why dont the little crabs get black legs like mine  because they only go where they ought was the extremely moral reply of the squire  little boys arent meant to walk in black mud  the shrimp boys do go in the mud shrewdly pleaded owen setting honor off laughing at humfreys discomfited look of diversion  it wont do to generalize she said merrily  owen must be content to regard crabs and shrimp boys as privileged individuals  owen demanded whether when he was big he might be a shrimp boy and a good deal of fraternization had taken place between him and mr charlecote before the cottage was reached  it was a very happy day to honora there was a repose and trust to be felt in humfreys company such as she had not experienced since she had lost her parents and the home sense of kindred was very precious  only women whose chief prop is gone can tell the value of one who is still near enough to disapprove without ceremony  the anxiety that honor felt to prove to her cousin that it was not a bit of romantic folly to have assumed her present charge was worth more than all the freedom of action in the world  how much she wanted the children to show off to advantage how desirous she was that he should not think her injudicious yes and how eager to see him pleased with their pretty looks  lucilla came down cleaned curled and pardoned and certainly a heart must have been much less tender than humfrey charlecotes not to be touched by the aspect of those two little fair waxenlooking beings in the deepest mourning of orphanhood  he was not slow in making advances towards them but the maiden had been affronted and chose to be slyly shy and retiring retreating to the other side of miss wells and there becoming intent upon her storybook though many a gleam through her eyelashes betrayed furtive glances at the stranger whom owen was monopolizing  and then she let herself be drawn out with the drollest mixture of arch demureness and gracious caprice  honora had never before seen her with a gentleman and to be courted was evidently as congenial an element to her as to a reigning beauty  she was perfectly irresistible to manhood and there was no doubt ere the evening was over that humfrey thought her one of the prettiest little girls he had ever seen  he remained a week at sandbeach lodging at the inn but spending most of his time with honor  he owned that he had been unwell and there certainly was a degree of lassitude about him though honor suspected that his real motive in coming was brotherly kindness and desire to see whether she were suffering much from the death of owen sandbrook  having come he seemed not to know how to go away  he was too fond of children to become weary of their petty exactions and they both had a sort of passion for him he built castles for them on the beach presided over their rides took them out boating and made them fabulously happy lucilla had not been so good for weeks and the least symptom of an outbreak was at once put down by his goodnatured no no  the evenings at the cottage with honora and miss wells music and bright talk were evidently very refreshing to him and he put off his departure from day to day till an inexorable matter of county business forced him off  not till the day was imminent did the cousins quit the easy surface of holiday leisure talk  they had been together to the late evening service and were walking home when honora began abruptly humfrey i wish you would not object to the children giving me pet names  i did not know that i had shown any objection  as if you did not impressively say miss charlecote on every occasion when you mention me to them  well and is not it more respectful  thats not what i want  where the natural tie is wanting one should do everything to make up for it  and you hope to do so by letting yourself be called honeypots  more likely than by sitting up distant and awful to be miss charlecoted  whatever you might be called must become an endearment said humfrey uttering unawares one of the highest compliments she had ever received and i own i do not like to hear those little chits make so free with your name  for my sake or theirs  for both  there is an old saying about familiarity and i think you should recollect that for the childrens own good it is quite as needful to strengthen respect as affection  and you think i can do that by fortifying myself with miss charlecote perhaps i had better make it mrs honora charlecote at once and get a high cap a rod and a pair of spectacles eh  no if they wont respect me out of a buckram suit depend upon it they would find out it was a hollow one  humfrey smiled  from her youth up honor could generally come off in apparent triumph from an argument with him but the victory was not always where the triumph was  well humfrey she said after some pause do you think i am fit to be trusted with my two poor children  there was a huskiness in his tone as he said i am sincerely glad you have the pleasure and comfort of them  i suspect theres a reservation there  but really humfrey i dont think i went out searching for the responsibility in the way that makes it dangerous  one uncle did not want them and the other could not have them and it would have been mere barbarity in me not to offer  besides their father wished and her voice faltered with tears  no indeed said humfrey eagerly i did not in the least mean that it is not the kindest most generous requital and there he broke off embarrassed by the sincere word that he had uttered but before she had spoken an eager negativeto what she knew nothe went on  and of course i dont mean that you are not one to manage them very well and all thatonly i hope there may not be pain in storei should not like those people to use you for their nursery governess and then take the children away just as you had set your heart upon them  dont do that honor he added with an almost sad earnestness  do what  set my heart on them  do you think i can help loving the creatures she said with mournful playfulness or that my uncertain tenure does not make them the greater darlings  there are ways of loving without setting ones heart was the somewhat grave reply  he seemed to be taking these words as equivalent to transgressing the command that requires all our heart and she began quickly oh but i didnt mean then a sudden thrill crossed her whether there might not be some truth in the accusation  where had erst the image of owen sandbrook stood  first or second  where was now the image of the boy she turned her words into do you think i am doing soin a wrong way  honor dear i could not think of wrong where you are concerned he said  i was only afraid of your kindness bringing you pain if you rest your happiness very much upon those children  i see said honor smiling relieved  thank you humfrey but you see i cant weigh out my affection in that fashion  they will get it the rogues  im not afraid as far as the girl is concerned said humfrey  you are strict enough with her  but how am i to be strict when poor little owen never does anything wrong  yes he is a particularly sweet child  and not at all wanting in manliness cried honor eagerly  so full of spirit and yet so gentle  oh he is a child whom it is a privilege to train and i dont think i have spoilt him yet do you  no i dont think you have  he is very obedient in general  oh if he could be only brought up as i wish  and i do think his innocence is too perfect a thing not to be guarded  what a perfect clergyman he would make  just fancy him devoting himself to some parish like poor dear old st wulstanscarrying his bright sweetness into the midst of all that black babel and spreading light round him he always says he will be a clergyman like his papa and i am sure he must be marked out for it  he likes to look at the sheep on the moors and talk about the shepherd leading them and i am sure the meaning goes very deep with him  she was not going quite the way to show humfrey that her heart was not set on the boy and she was checked by hearing him sigh  perhaps it was for the disappointment he foresaw so she said whether i bring him up or not dont you believe there will be a special care over such a child  there is a special care over every christian child i suppose he said and i hope it may all turn out so as to make you happy  here is your door good night and goodbye  why are not you coming in  i think not i have my things to put up i must go early tomorrow thank you for a very happy week  goodbye honor  there was a shade of disappointment about his tone that she could not quite account for  dear old humfrey  could he be ageing  could he be unwell  did he feel himself lonely  could she have mortified him or displeased him  honor was not a woman of personal vanity or a solution would sooner have occurred to her  she knew upon reflection that it must have been for her sake that humfrey had continued single but it was so inconvenient to think of him in the light of an admirer when she so much needed him as a brother that it had hardly ever occurred to her to do so but at last it did strike her whether having patiently waited so long this might not have been a visit of experiment and whether he might not be disappointed to find her wrapped up in new interestsslightly jealous in fact of little owen  how good he had been  where was the heart that could fail of being touched by so long a course of forbearance and consideration besides honor had been a solitary woman long enough to know what it was to stand alone  and then how well he would stand in a fathers place towards the orphans  he would never decree her parting with them and captain charteris himself must trust him  yet what a shame it would be to give such a devoted heart nothing better than one worn out with the power of love such as he deserved exhausted for ever  and yetand yetsomething very odd bounded up within her and told her between shame and exultation that faithful old humfrey would not be discontented even with what she had to give  another timea little a very little encouragement and the pine wood scene would come back again and thenher heart fainted a littlethere should be no concealmentbut if she could only have been six months married all at once  time went on and honora more than once blushed at finding how strong a hold this possibility had taken of her heart when once she had begun to think of resting upon one so kind so good so strong  every perplexity every care every transaction that made her feel her position as a single woman brought round the yearning to lay them all down upon him who would only be grateful to her for them  every time she wanted some one to consult hope showed her his face beaming sweetly on her and home seemed to be again opening to her that home which might have been hers at any time these twelve years  she quite longed to see how glad the dear kind fellow would be  perhaps maidenly shame would have belied her feelings in his actual presence perhaps she would not have shrunk from him and been more cold than in her unconsciousness but he came not and his absence fanned the spark so tardily kindled  what if she had delayed till too late  he was a man whose duty it was to marry he had waited till he was some years past fortyperhaps this had been his last attempt and he was carrying his addresses elsewhere  well honora believed she had tried to act rightly and that must be her comfortand extremely ashamed of herself she was to find herself applying such a word to her own sensations in such a caseand very much disliking the notion of any possible lady at hiltonbury holt    chapter iii       there is a reaper his name is death        and with his sickle keen     he reaps the bearded grain at a breath        and the flowers that grow betweenlongfellow  a letter from humfrey how honors heart fluttered  would it announce an engagement or would it promise a visit on which her fate would turn or would it be only a business letter on her money matters  angry at her own trepidation she opened it  it was none of all these it told her that mr saville his brotherinlaw was staying at the holt with his second wife and that he begged her to take advantage of this opportunity to come to visit the old place adding that he had not been well and he wished much to see her if she could spare a few days to him from her children  little doubt had she as to the acceptance  the mere words going to hiltonbury had power by force of association to make her heart bound she was a little disappointed that he had not included the children she feared that it looked as if he were really ill but it might be on account of the savilles or maybe he had that to say to her whichoh nonsense  were that the case humfrey would not reverse the order of things and make her come to him  at any rate the children should be her first condition  and then she concentrated her anxieties on his most unusual confession of having been unwell  humfreys substantial person was ready to meet her at the station and the first glance dispelled her nervous tremors and calmed the tossings of her mind in the habitual sense of trust and reliance  he thanked her for coming handed her into the carriage looked after her goods and seated himself beside her in so completely his ordinary fashion of taking care of her that she forgot all her intentions of rendering their meeting momentous  her first inquiry was for his health but he put it aside with something about feeling very well now and he looked so healthy only perhaps a little more hearty and burly that she did not think any more of the matter and only talked in happy desultory scraps now dwelling on her little owens charms now joyfully recognizing familiar objects or commenting upon the slight changes that had taken place  one thing however she observed humfrey did not stop the horse at the foot of the steep hill where walking had been a matter of course when he had been a less solid weight than now  yes honor he said smiling one grows less merciful as one grows old and shortbreathed  you growing old you whom ive never left off thinking of as a promising lad as poor old mrs mervyn used to call you  he turned his face towards her as if about to say something very seriously but apparently changing his intention he said poor old mrs mervyn i wonder how she would like the changes at beauchamp  are the fulmorts doing a great deal  they have quite modernized the house and laid out the gardenwhat i should call very prettily if it were not for my love of the old dutch one  they see a great deal of company and go on in grand style  how do you get on with them  oh very well i have dined there two or three times  he is a goodnatured fellow enough and there are some nice children whom i like to meet with their nurses in the woods  i stood proxy for the last ones sponsor i could not undertake the office myself  goodnatured exclaimed nora  why you know how he behaved at st wulstans  no more than 5 pounds a year would he ever give to any charity though he was making thousands by those ginshops  probably he thought he was doing very liberally  ay there is no hope for st wulstans till people have left off thinking a guinea their duty and five very handsome and that augusta mervyn should have gone and married our bete noireour lord of ginpalacesi do think it must be on purpose for you to melt him  i shall set you at him humfrey next time mr askew writes to me in despair that something wont go on for lack of means  only i must be quite sure that you wont give the money yourself to spare the trouble of dunning  it is not fair to take other peoples duties on oneself besides as youll find honor the holt purse is not bottomless  as she would find  this was a very odd way of making sure of her beforehand but she was not certain that she did not like it  it was comfortable and would save much preliminary  the woods were bursting into spring delicate deeply creased leaves were joyously emerging to the light on the birches not yet devoid of the silvery wool where they had been packed the hazels were fluttering their goslings the palms were honey sweet with yellow tufts the primroses peeped out in the banks of moss  oh humfrey this is the great desire of my life fulfilled to see the holt in the flush of spring  i have always said you cared for the place more than any one said humfrey evidently gratified but with an expression which she did not understand  as if i did not  but how strangely differently from my vision my wish has been fulfilled  how strangely he repeated with even greater seriousness than had been in her voice  the meadow was bright with spring grass the cattle grazing serenely as in old times the gardenah not quite so gayeither it was better in autumn than in spring or it wanted poor sarahs hand the dogs not the same individuals but with much the same manners dancing round their masterall like all home  nothing wanting but alas the goodnatured narrowminded old mistress of the house to fret her and notable sarah to make her comfortable and wonder at her eccentric tastes  ah and how much more was wanting the gentle mother who did all the civility and listening and the father so happy to look at green woods read poetry and unbend his weary brow  how much more precious was the sight of the one living remnant of those days  they had a cheerful evening  mr saville had a great deal of oldfashioned oxford agreeableness he was very courtly but a sensible man with some native fun and many college stories  after many years of donship his remote parish was somewhat of a solitude to him and intercourse with a cultivated mind was as pleasant to him now as the sight of a lady had been in his college days  honor liked conversation too and miss wells lucilla and owen had been rather barren in that respect so there was a great deal of liveliness in which humfrey took his full share while good mrs saville looked like what she was her husbands admiring housekeeper  do you take early walks still humfrey asked honor as she bade him good night  if you do i shall be quite ready to confront the dew and therewith came a revulsion of the consciousness within  was this courting him and to her great provocation there arose an uncomfortable blush  thank you he said with something of a mournful tone im afraid im past that honor  tomorrow after breakfastgood night  honor was a little alarmed by all this and designed a conference with the old housekeeper mrs stubbs to inquire into her masters health but this was not attainable that night and she could only go to bed in the friendly old wainscoted room whose white and gold carved monsters on the mantelpiece were wellnigh as familiar as the dove in woolstonelane but oh how it made her long for the mother whom she used to kiss there  humfrey was brisk and cheerful as ever at breakfast devising what his guests would like to do for the day and talking of some friends whom he had asked to meet mr saville so that all the anxieties with which honora had risen were dissipated and she took her part gaily in the talk  there was something therefore freshly startling to her when on rising humfrey gravely said honor will you come into my study for a little while  the study had always been more of a place for guns and fishingtackle than for books  it was humfreys usual living room when alone and was of course full besides of justice books agricultural reports acts of parliament piles of papers little bags of samples of wheat all in the orderly disorder congenial to the male kind  all this was as usual but the change that struck her was that the large red leather lounging chair hitherto a receptacle for the overflowings of the table was now wheeled beside the fire and near it stood a little table with a large print bible on it which she well remembered as his mothers  humfrey set a chair for her by the fire and seated himself in the easy one leaning back a little  she had not spoken  something in his grave preparation somewhat awed her and she sat upright watching him  it was very kind of you to come honor he began more kind than you know  i am sure it could be no other than a treat  he continued before she could go farther i wished particularly to speak to you  i thought it might perhaps spare you a shock  she looked at him with a terrified eye  dont be frightened my dear he said leaning forward there is no occasion  such things must come sooner or later and it is only that i wished to tell you that i have been having advice for a good many uncomfortable feelings that have troubled me lately  well she asked breathlessly  and dixon tells me that it is aneurism  quick and fast came honoras breath her hands were clasped together her eyes cast about with such a piteous despairing expression that he started to his feet in a moment exclaiminghonor  honor dear dont theres no need  i did not think you would feel it in this way  feel what should i feel if not for you  oh humfrey dont say it you are all that is left meyou cannot be spared and as he came towards her she grasped his hand and clung to him needing the support which he gave in fear of her fainting  dear honor do not take it thus  i am very well nowi dare say i shall be so to the last and there is nothing terrible to the imagination  i am very thankful for both the preparation and the absence of suffering will not you be the same  yes you said honora sitting up again and looking up into his sincere serene face i cannot doubt that even this is well for you but it is all selfishnessjust as i was beginning to feel what you are to me  humfreys face lighted up suddenly  then honor he said evidently putting strong restraint upon his voice you could have listened to me now  she bowed her headthe tears were dropping very fast  thank god he said as again he leant back in his chair and when she raised her eyes again he sat with his hands clasped and a look of heavenly felicity on his face raised upwards  oh humfrey how thoughtlessly i have trifled away all that might have been the happiness of your life  you never trifled with me he said you have always dealt honestly and straightforwardly and it is best as it is  had we been together all this time the parting might have been much harder  i am glad there are so few near ties to break  dont say so you loved by every one the tower of strength to all that is good  hush hush nonsense honor said he kindly  i think i have tried he went on gravely not to fall behind the duties of my station but that would be a bad dependence were there not something else to look to as to missing me the world did very well without me before i was born it will do as well when i am gone and as to you my poor honor we have been very little together of late  i had you to lean on  lean on something stronger he said and as she could not govern her bitter weeping he went onah i am the selfish one now to be glad of what must make it the worse for you but if one thing were wanting to make me happy it was to know that at last you cared for me  i should be a wretch not to do so  so many years of patience and forbearancenobody could be like you  i dont see that said humfrey simply  while you continued the same i could not well turn my mind to any one else and i always knew i was much too loutish for you  now humfrey  yes there is no use in dwelling on this he said quietly  the reason i asked you to be kind enough to come here is that i do not think it well to be far from home under the circumstances  there dont look frightenedthey say it may very possibly not come for several months or a year  i hope to have time to put things a little in order for you and that is one reason i wished to see you i thought i could make the beginning easier to you  but honora was far too much shaken for such a turn to the conversation she would not mortify him but she could neither listen nor understand he who was so full of stalwart force a doomed man yet calm and happy under his sentence he only discovered to be so fondly loved in time to give poignancy to the parting and yet rejoicing himself in the poor tardy affection that had answered his manly constancy too late  his very calmness and stillness cut her to the heart and after some ineffectual attempts to recover herself she was forced to take refuge in her own room  weeping praying walking restlessly about she remained there till luncheon time when humfrey himself came up to knock at her door  honor dear he said come downtry to throw it offsaville does not wish his wife to be made aware of it while she is here lest she should be nervous  you must not betray meand indeed there is no reason for being overcome  nothing vexes me but seeing you so  let us enjoy your visit pray  to be commanded to bear up by a strong manly character so much loved and trusted was perhaps the chief support she could receive she felt that she must act composure and coming down in obedience to her cousin she found the power of doing so  nay as she saw him so completely the bright hospitable host talking to mrs saville about her poultry and carrying on quiet jokes with mr saville she found herself drawn away from the mornings conversation or remembering it like a dream that had passed away  then all went out together and he was apparently as much interested in his young wheat as ever and even more anxious to make her look at and appreciate crops and cattle speaking about them in his hearty simple way as if his pleasure in them was not flagging perhaps because it had never been excessive  he had always sat loose to them and thus they could please and occupy him even when the touch of the iron hand had made itself felt  and again she saw him engrossed in arranging some petty matter of business for one of the poor people and when they had wandered down to the gate pelting the turnout of the boys school with a pocket full of apples that he said he had taken up while in conference with the housekeeper laughing and speaking merrily as the varlets touched their caps to him and always turning to her for sympathy in his pleasures of success or of good nature as though her visit were thorough enjoyment to him  and so it almost was to her  the influence of the dear old scenes was something and his cheeriness was a great deal more the peaceful present was not harassed or disturbed and the foreboding on which she might not dwell made it the more precious  that slow wandering about the farm and village and the desultory remarks the old pleasant reminiscences the inquiries and replies about the villagers and neighbours had a quiet charm about them as free and happy as when youth and child they had frisked through the same paths nay the old scenes so brought back the old habits that she found herself discoursing to him in her former eager fashion upon the last historical character who had bitten her fancy  my old way she said catching herself up dinning all this into your ears as usual when you dont care  dont i said humfrey with his sincere face turned on her in all its sweetness  perhaps i never showed you how much honor and i beg your pardon but i would not have been without it  the savilles came up while honors heart was brimful at this compliment and then it was all commonplace again except for that sunset light that rich radiance of the declining day that seemed unconsciously to pervade all humfreys cheerfulness and to give his mirth and playfulness a solid happiness  some mutual friends of long standing came to dinner and the evening was not unlike the last quite as free from gloom and mr charlecote as bright as ever evidently taking his full share in county business and giving his mind to it  only honor noted that he quietly avoided an invitation to a very gay party which was proposed and his great ally sir john raymond seemed rather vexed with him for not taking part in some new and expensive experiment in farming and asked incredulously whether it were true that he wished to let a farm that he had kept for several years in his own hands  humfrey agreed that it was so and said something farther of wishing to come to terms quickly  she guessed that this was for her sake when she thought all this over in her bedroom  such was the effect of his calmness that it had not been a day of agitation  there was more peace than tumult in her mind as she lay down to rest sad but not analyzing her sadness and lulled by the present into putting aside the future  so she slept quietly and awoke with a weight at her heart but softened and sustained by reverent awe and obedience towards her cousin  when they met he scanned her looks with a bright tender glance and smiled commendation when he detected no air of sleeplessness  he talked and moved as though his secret were one of untold bliss and this was not far from the truth for when after breakfast he asked her for another interview in the study they were no sooner alone than he rubbed his hands together with satisfaction sayingso honor you could have had me after all looking at her with a broad undisguised exulting smile  oh humfrey  dont say it if you dont like it but you cant guess the pleasure it gives me  i could hardly tell at first what was making me so happy when i awoke this morning  i cant see how it should said honor her eyes swimming with tears never to have met with any gratitude fori have used you too illnever valued scarcely even believed in what you lavished on poor silly meand now when all is too late you are glad  glad of course i am returned humfrey i never wished to obtrude my feelings on you after i knew how it stood with you  it would have been a shame  your choice went far above me  for the rest if to find you disposed towards me at the last makes me so happy and he looked at her again with beaming affection how could i have borne to leave you if all had been as i wished  no no it is best as it is  you lose nothing in position and you are free to begin the world again not knocked down or crushed  dont talk so humfrey  it is breaking my heart to think that i might have been making you happy all this time  heaven did not will it so said humfrey reverently and it might not have proved what we fancy  you might not have found such a clodhopper all you wanted and my stupidity might have vexed you though now you fancy otherwise  and i have had a very happy lifeindeed i have honor i never knew the time when i could not say with all my heart the lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground yea i have a goodly heritage everybody and everything you and all the rest have been very kind and friendly and i have never wanted for happiness  it has been all right you could fulfil your duty as a daughter undividedly and now i trust those children will be your object and comfortonly honor not your idols  perhaps it was jealousy but i have sometimes fancied that your tendency with their father  oh how often i must have given you pain  i did not mean that but as i say perhaps i was no fair judge  one thing is well the relations will be much less likely to take them from you when you are living here  she held up her hands in deprecation  honor dear he said pleadingly yet with authority pray let me talk to you  there are things which i wish very much to say indeed without which i could hardly have asked for this indulgence  it is for your own sake and that of the place and people  poor place poor people  he sighed but then turned his smiling countenance towards her again no one else can care for it or them as you do honor  our goodly heritageit was so when i had it from my father and i dont think it has got worse under my charge and i want you to do your duty by it honor and hand it on the same whoever may come after  for your sake humfreyeven if i did not love it  but  yes it is a duty proceeded humfrey gravely  it may seem but a bit of earth after all but the owner of a property has a duty to let it do its share in producing food or maybe in not lessening the number of pleasant things here below  i mean it is as much my office to keep my trees and woods fair to look at as it is not to let my land lie waste  she had recovered a good deal while he was moralizing and became interested  i did not suspect you of the poetical view humfrey she said  it is plain sense i think he said that to grub up a fine tree or a pretty bit of copse without fair reason only out of eagerness for gain is a bit of selfishness  but mind honor you must not go and be romantic  you must have the timber marked when the trees are injuring each other  ah ive often done it with you  i wish you would come out with me today  im going to the outwood i could show you  she agreed readily almost forgetting the wherefore  and above all honor you must not be romantic about wages  it is not right by other proprietors nor by the people themselves  no one is ever the better for a fancy price for his labour  she could almost have smiled he was at once so well pleased that she and his goodly heritage should belong to each other so confident in her love and good intentions towards it and so doubtful of her discretion and management  she promised with all her heart to do her utmost to fulfil his wishes  after all he said thoughtfully the best thing for the placeay and for you and every one would be for you to marry but theres little chance of that i suppose and it is of no use to distress you by mentioning it  ive been trying to put out of my hands things that i dont think you will be able to manage but i should like you to keep up the home farm and you may pretty well trust to brooks  i dare say he will take his own way but if you keep a reasonable check on him he will do very well by you  he is as honest as the day and very intelligent i dont know that any one could do better for you  oh yes i will mind all he tells me  dont show that you mind him  that is the way to spoil him  poor fellow he has been a good servant to me and so have they all  it is a thing to be very thankful for to have had such a set of good servants  honora thought but did not say that they could not help being good with such a master  he went on to tell her that he had made mr saville his executor  mr saville had been for many years before leaving oxford bursar of his college and was a thorough man of business whom humfrey had fixed upon as the person best qualified to be an adviser and assistant to honora and he only wished to know whether she wished for any other selection but this was nearly overpowering her again for since her fathers death she had leant on no one but humfrey himself  one thing more he had to say  you know honor this place will be entirely your own  you and i seem to be the last of the charlecotes and even if we were not there is no entail  you may found orphan asylums with it or leave it to poor sandbrooks children just as you please  oh i could not do that cried honor with a sudden revulsion  love them as she might owen sandbrooks children must not step into humfrey charlecotes place  and besides she added i want my little owen to be a clergyman i think he can be what his father missed  well you can do exactly as you think fit  only what i wanted to tell you is that there may be another branch elder than our own  not that this need make the least difference for the holt is legally ours  it seems that our great grandfather had an elder sona wild sort of fellowthe old people used to tell stories of him  he went on in short till he was disinherited and went off to america  what became of him afterwards i never could make out but i have sometimes questioned how i should receive any of his heirs if they should turn up some day mind you you need not have the slightest scruple in holding your own it was made over to my grandfather by will as i have made it sure for you but i do think that when you come to think how to dispose of it the possibility of the existence of these charlecotes might be taken into consideration  yankee charlecotes she said  never mind most likely nothing of the kind will ever come in your way and they have not the slightest claim on you  i only threw it out because i thought it right just to speak of it  after this commencement humfrey on this and the ensuing days made it his business to make his cousin acquainted with the details of the management of the estate  he took such pleasure in doing so and was so anxious she should comprehend that she was forced to give her whole attention and putting all else aside was tranquilly happy in thus gratifying him  those orderly ranges of conscientious accounts were no small testimony to the steady earnest manner in which humfrey had set himself to his duty from his early youth and to a degree they were his honest pride toohe liked to show how good years had made up for bad years and there was a tenderness in the way he patted their red leather backs to make them even on their shelves as if they had been good friends to him  no they must not run into confusion  the farms and the cottagesthe friendly terms of his intercourse and his largehanded but welljudging almsgivingall revealed to her more of his solid worth and the simplicity that regarded all as the merest duty touched her more than all  many a time did she think of the royal norwegian brothers one of whom went to tie a knot in the willows on the banks of the jordan while the other remained at home to be the blessing of his people and from her broken idol wanderer she turned to worship her steadfast worker at home as far as his humility and homeliness made it possible and valued each hour with him as if each moment were of diamond price  and he was so calmly happy that there was no grieving in his presence  it had been a serene life of simple fulfilment of duty going ever higher and branching wider as a good mans standard gradually rises the longer he lives the one great disappointment had been borne without sourness or repining and the affections deprived of the home channel had spread in a beneficent flood and blessed all around  so though like every sinful son of man sensible of many an error many an infirmity still the open loving spirit was childlike enough for that blessed sense for that feeling which st john expresses as if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence towards god confidence in the infinite merits that atone for the errors of weakness and occasional wanderings of will confidence that made the hope a sure and steadfast one and these sentenced weeks a land of beulah where honoras tardy response to his constant love could be greeted and valued as the precious fulfilment of longcherished wishes not dashed aside as giving bitterness to his departure  the parting was broken by a promise that honora should again meet the savilles at the holt in the autumn  she assured herself that there was no danger before that time and humfrey spoke cheerfully of looking forward to it and seemed to have so much to do and to be so well equal to doing it that he would not let them be concerned at leaving him alone  to worship humfrey was an easier thing at a distance than when beside him  honora came back to sandbeach thoroughly restless and wretched reproaching herself with having wasted such constant priceless affection haunted by the constant dread of each mornings post and longing fervently to be on the spot  she had selfcommand enough not to visit her dejection on the children but they missed both her spirits and her vigilance and were more left to their nurse and her chief solace was in long solitary walks or in evening talks with miss wells  kind miss wells perhaps guessed how matters stood between the two last charlecotes but she hinted not her suspicions and was the unwearied recipient of all honoras histories of his symptoms of his cheerfulness and his solicitude for her  those talks did her good they set the real humfrey before her and braced her to strive against weakness and despondence  and then the thought grew on her why since they were so thoroughly each others why should they not marry and be together to the last  why should he be left to his solitude for this final year why should their meetings be so prudentially chaperoned  suppose the disease should be lingering how hard it was that she should be absent and he left to servants  she could well imagine why he had not proposed it he was too unselfish to think of exposing her to the shock or making her a widow but how came she never to have thought of it  she stood beyond all ordinary rulesshe had nothing worldly to gain nor to lose by being his wife for these few remaining monthsit surely was her part after the way she had treated him to meet him more than half wayshe alone could make the proposalshe wouldshe must  and oh if the doctors should be mistaken  so spoke the midnight dreamoh how many times  but what said cool morning  propriety had risen up grave decorum objecting to what would shock humfrey ay and was making honors cheeks tingle  yes and there came the question whether he would not be more distressed than gratifiedhe who wished to detach himself from all earthly tieswhether he might not be pained and displeased at her thus clinging to himnay were he even gratified might not emotion and agitation be fatal  many many times was all this tossed over in honors mind  often the desperate resolution was definitely taken and she had seen herself quietly meeting him at dear old hiltonbury church with his grave sweet eyes resting satisfied upon her as his darling  as often had the fear of offending him and the instinct of womans dignity turned her away when her heart was beating high  that autumn visitthen she would decide one look as if he wished to retain her the least air of feebleness or depression and she would be determined even if she had to waive all feminine reserves and set the matter in hand herself  she thought mr saville would highly approve and assist and having settled into this period for her project she set herself in some degree at rest and moved and spoke with so much more of her natural ease that miss wells was consoled about her and knew not how entirely heart and soul were at hiltonbury with such devotion as had never even gone to the backwoods  to meet the savilles at hiltonbury in the autumn  yeshonor met mr saville but not as she had intended  by that time the stroke had fallen just as she had become habituated to the expectation just as her promised visit had assumed a degree of proximity and her heart was beating at the prospect of the results  humfrey had been scarcely ailing all the summer he had gone about his occupations with his usual cheerfulness and had taken part in all the village festivals as genially as ever  only close observers could have noticed a slackness towards new undertakings a gradual putting off of old ones a training of those dependent on his counsel to go alone a preference for being alone in the evening a greater habit of stillness and contemplation  september had come and he had merrily sent off two happy boysportsmen with the keeper seeing them over the first field himself and leaning against the gate as he sent them away in convulsions of laughing at his droll auguries  the second was a sunday a lovely day of clear deep blue sky and rich sunshine laughing upon the full wealth of harvest fieldspart fallen before the hand of the reaper part waving in their ripe glowing beauty to which he loved to liken honoras hairpart in noble redundant shocks of corn in full season  brooks used afterwards to tell how he overtook the squire slowly strolling to church on that beauteous autumnal morning and how he paused to remark on the glory of the harvest and to add keep the big barn clear brookslet us have all the women and children in for the supper this timeand i saysend the spotted heifer down tomorrow to old boycotts instead of his cow that died  with such a crop as this one can stand something  and said brooks thank god for it was as plain written on his face as ever i saw  it was the first sunday in the month and there was full service hiltonbury church had one of those oldfashioned altarrails which form three sides of a square and where it was the custom that at the words draw near with faith the earliest communicants should advance to the rail and remain till their place was wanted by others and that the last should not return to their seats till the service was concluded  mr charlecote had for many years been always the first parishioner to walk slowly up the matted aisle and kneel beside the wall under the cumbrous old tables of commandments  there on this day he knelt as usual and harvest labours tending to thin the number of communicants the same who came up first remained to the end joined their voices in the eucharistic lords prayer and angelic hymn and bowed their heads at the blessing of the peace that passeth all understanding  it was not till the rest were moving away that the vicar and his clerk remarked that the squire had not risen  another look and it was plain that he had sunk somewhat forward on his folded arms and was only supported by the rail and the wall  the vicar hastily summoned the village doctor who had not yet left the church  they lifted him and laid him along on the cushioned step where he had been kneeling but motion and breath were gone the strong arms were helpless and the colour had left the open face  taken at once from the heavenly feast on earth to the glory above could this be called sudden death  there he lay on the altar step with hands crossed on his breast and perfectly blessed repose on his manly countenance sweetened and ennobled in its stillness and in every lineament bearing the impress of that holy spirit of love who had made it a meet temple  what an unpremeditated lying in state was that as by ones and twos beneath the clergymans eye the villagers stole in with slowly heavily falling tread to gaze in silent awe on their best friend some sobbing and weeping beyond control others with grave almost stolid tranquillity or the murmured he was a gentleman which in a poor mans mouth means he was a just man and patient the friend of the weak and poor  his farmers and his own labourers put their shoulders to bear him once more to his own house through his halfgathered crops      the hand of the reaper        takes the ears that are hoary     but the voice of the weeper        wails manhood in glory  no bewail him not  it was glory indeed but the glory of early autumn the garnering of the shock of corn in full season  it was well done of the vicar that a few long fullgrained ears of wheat were all that was laid upon his breast in his coffin  there honora saw them  the vicar mr henderson had written to her at once as humfrey had long ago charged him to do enclosing a letter that he had left with him for the purpose a tender soothing farewell and an avowal such as he could never have spoken of the blessing that his attachment to her had been in drawing his mind from the narrowness to which he might have been liable and in elevating the tone of his views and opinions  she knew what he meantit was what he had caught from her youthful enthusiasm secondhand from owen sandbrook  oh what vivid vigorous truth not to have been weakened in the transit through two such natures but to have done its work in the strong practical mind able and candid enough to adopt it even thus filtered  there were a few words of affectionate commendation of his people and his land into her keeping and a parting blessing and lastly written as a postscriptwith a blot as if it had been written with hesitationlittle children keep yourselves from idols  it was not bitter weeping  it was rather the sense of utter vacancy and hopelessness with but one fixed purposethat she would see his face again and be the nearest to him when he was laid in the grave  she hastily wrote to the housekeeper and to the clergyman that she was coming and miss wellss kind opposition only gave her just wilfulness and determination enough to keep her spirit from sinking  so she travelled alone and came to hiltonbury in the sunset as the last long wains were slowly bearing their loads of wheat into the farmyard the waggoners walking dejectedly beside them  mr saville had come before her and was at the door to receive her  she could not very well bear the presence of any one nor the talk of coldblooded arrangements  it seemed to keep away the dreamy living with humfrey and was far more dreary than the feeling of desolateness and when they treated her as mistress of the house that was too intolerable  and yet it was worth something too to be the one to authorize that harvest supper in the big barn in the confidence that it would be anything but revelry  every one felt that the day was indeed a harvest home  the funeral according to his expressed wishes was like those of the farmers of the parish the coffin borne by his own labourers in their white round frocks and the labourers were the expected guests for whom provision was made but far and wide from all the country round though harvest was at the height came farmers and squires poor men and rich from the peer and county member down to the poor travelling hawkerall had met the sunny sympathy of that smile all had been aided and befriended all felt as if a prop a castle of strength were gone  charlecotes innumerable rested in the chancel and the last heir of the line was laid beneath the same flag where he had been placed on that last sunday the spot where honor might kneel for many more meeting him in spirit at the feast and looking to the time when the cry should be put ye in the sickle for the harvest is come  but ere she could look in thorough hope for that time another page of honors life must be turned and an alloy as yet unknown to herself must be purged from her heart  the last gleam of her youthful sunshine had faded with humfrey but youth is but a fraction of human existence and there were further phases to be gone through and lessons to be learnt although she was feeling as if all were over with her in this world and neither hope love nor protection were left her nor any interest save cherishing humfrey charlecotes memory as she sat designing the brass tablet which was to record his name and age in old english illuminated letters surrounded by a border of ears of corn and grapes    chapter iv       the glittering grass with dewstars bright     is all astir with twinkling light     what pity that such fair array     in one brief hour should melt awayrev t whytehead  this is a stroke of good luck said mr charteris  we must not on any account remove the sandbrook children from miss charlecote she has no relations and will certainly make the boy her heir  she will marry said his wife  some fashionable preacher will swallow her red hair  she is just at the age for it  less likely when she has the children to occupy her  well youll have them thrown on your hands yet  the chance is worth trying for though  i would not interfere with her on any account  oh no nor i but i pity the children                                        there master owen be a good boy and dont worry  dont you see im putting up your things to go home  home the light glittered in lucillas eyes  is it wrapworth nursey  dear me miss not wrapworth  thats given away you know but its to hiltonbury you are goingsuch a grand place which if master owen is only a dear good boy will all belong to him one of these days  will there be a pony to ride on asked owen  oh yesif youll only let those stockings alonetherell be ponies and carriages and horses and everything a gentleman can have and all for my own dear little master owen  i dont want to go to hiltonbury said lucilla i want to go home to the river and the boat and see mr prendergast and the black cow  ill give you a black cow cilly said owen strutting about  is hiltonbury bigger than the castle  oh ever so big master owen such acres of wood mr jones says and all your dear cousins and sure to be your own in time  what a great gentleman you will be to be sure dining thirty gentlefolks twice a week as they say poor mr charlecote did and driving four fine horses to your carriage like a gentleman  and then you wont forget poor old nurseypursey  oh no nurse ill give you a ride in my carriage  honora in her listless state had let mr saville think for her and passively obeyed him when he sent her back to sandbeach to wind up her affairs there while he finished off the valuations and other painful business at the holt in which she could be of little use since all she desired was to keep everything as it was  she was anxious to return as soon as possible so as to take up the reins before there had been time for the relaxation to be felt the only chance she felt of her being able to fulfil his charge  the removal the bustle the talking things over with miss wells and the sight of the children did much to restore her and her old friend rejoiced to see that necessary occupation was tending to make her time pass more cheerfully than she perhaps knew  as to the dear old city dwelling it might have fetched an immense price but only to become a warehouse a measure that would have seemed to honor little short of sacrilege  to let it in such a locality was impossible so it must remain unavailable capital and honora decided on leaving her old housekeeper therein with a respectable married niece who would inhabit the lower regions and keep the other rooms in order for an occasional stay in london  she would have been sorry to cut herself off from a month of london in the spring and the house might farther be useful to friends who did not object to the situation or could be lent now and then to a curate and she could well afford to keep it up so she thought herself justified in following her inclination and went up for three mournful days of settling matters there and packing books and ornaments till the rooms looked so dismantled that she could not think how to face them again  it was the beginning of october when she met miss wells children and luggage at the station and fairly was on her way to her home  she tried to call it so as a duty to humfrey but it gave her a pang every time and in effect she felt far less at home than when he and sarah had stood in the doorway to greet the arrivals  she had purposely fixed an hour when it would be dark so that she might receive no painful welcome she wished no one to greet her she had rather they were mourning for their master  she had more than once shocked miss wells by declaring heiresses to be a mistake and yet as she always owned she could not have borne for any one else to have had the holt  fortunately for her the children were sleepy and were rather in a mazy state when lifted out and set on their legs in the wainscoted hall and she sent them at once with nurse to the cheerful room that humfreys little visitors had saved from becoming disused  miss wellss fond vigilance was a little oppressive but she gently freed herself from it and opened the study door  she had begged that as little change as possible might be made and there stood as she had last seen them the large leathern chair the little table the big bible and in it the little faded marker she had herself constructed for his twentyfirst birthday when her powers of making presents had not equalled her will yet what costly gift could have fulfilled its mission like that one  she opened the heavy book at the place  it was at the first lesson for the last day of his life the end of the prophet hosea and the first words her eyes fell upon were the glorious prophecyi will redeem them from death i will ransom them from the power of the grave  her heart beat high and she stood half musing half reading they that dwell under his shadow shall return they shall revive as the corn and grow as the vine  how gentle and refreshing the cadence  a longing rose up in her to apply those latter words more closely by placing them on his tablet she did not think they would shock his humility a consideration which had withheld her from choosing other passages of which she always thought in connection with him  another verse and she read ephraim shall say what have i to do any more with idols  it brought back the postscript  kind humfrey must have seen strong cause before he gave any reproof least of all to her and she could take his word that the fault had been there  she felt certain of it when she thought of her early devotion to owen sandbrook and the utter blank caused by his defection  nay she believed she had begun to idolize humfrey himself but now at her age chastened desponding with nothing before her save the lonely life of an heiress old maid counting no tie of blood with any being what had she to engross her affections from the true object  alas honoras heart was not feeling that object sufficient  conscientious earnest truly loving goodness and all connected with it striving as a faithful dutiful woman to walk rightly still the personal love and trust were not yet come  spent as they had been upon props of earth when these were taken away the tendrils hung down drearily unemployed not fastening on the true support  not that she did not kneel beside that little table as in a shrine and entreat earnestly for strength and judgment to do her duty faithfully in her new station so that humfreys charge might be fulfilled and his people might not suffer and this done and her homage paid to his empty throne she was better able to satisfy her motherly friend by her deportment for the remainder of the evening and to reply to the welcome of the weeping mrs stubbs  by one of humfreys wise acts of foresight his faithful servant reeves had been provided for as the master of the union whither it was certain he would carry the same milk of human kindness as had been so plentiful at hiltonbury and the holt was thus left free for honoras mr jones without fear of clashing though he was divided between pride in his young ladys ownership of a landed estate and his own dislike to a country residence  honora did not sleep soundly  the place was too new and yet too familiar and the rattling of the windows the roaring of the wind in the chimney and the creaking of the vane without absolutely wakening her kept her hearing alive continually weaving the noises into some harassing dream that humfreys voice was calling to her and hindrances always keeping her from him and then of lucilla and owen in some imminent peril whence she shrieked to him to save them and then remembered he would stretch out his hand no more  sounder sleep came at last towards morning and far later than her usual hour she was wakened by a drumming upon her door and the boy and girl dashed in radiant with excitement at the novelty of the place  sweet honey  sweet honey dear do get up and see  theres a rockinghorse at the end of the passage  and theres a real pony out in the field there are cows  theres a goat and a little kid and i want to play with it and i may for it is all mine and yours  all yours  owen boy repeated honora sitting up in surprise  nursey said it was all to be owens said lucilla  and she said i should be as grand a gentleman as poor mr charlecote or uncle charteris proceeded owen and that i should go out hunting in a red coat on a beautiful horse but i want to have the kid now please sweet honey  nurse does not know anything about it said honora much annoyed that such an idea should have been suggested in such a manner  i thought my little owen wished for better thingsi thought he was to be like his papa and try to be a good shepherd praising god and helping people to do right  but cant i wear a red coat too said owen wistfully  no my dear clergymen dont go out hunting or how could they teach the poor little children  then i wont be a clergyman  this was an inconvenient and most undesirable turn but honors first object must be to put the right of heirship out of the little head and she at once begannurse must have made a mistake my dear this place is your home and will be always so i hope while it is mine but it must not be your own and you must not think it will  my little boy must work for himself and other people and thats better than having houses and lands given to him  those words touched the pride in lucillas composition and she exclaimedill work too but the selfconsequence of proprietorship had affected her brother more strongly and he repeated meditatively jones said not mine while she was alive  jones was cross  there might not be much in the words child as he was but there was something in his manner of eyeing her which gave her acute unbearable paina look as if she stood in his way and crossed his importance  it was but a baby fit of temper but she was in no frame to regard it calmly and with an alteration of countenance that went to his heart she exclaimedcan that be my little owen talking as if he wanted his cousin honor dead and out of the way  we had better never have come here if you are to leave off loving me  quick to be infected by emotion the childs arms were at once round her neck and he was sobbing out that he loved his sweet honey better than anything nurse was naughty jones was naughty he wouldnt hunt he wouldnt wear a red coat he would teach little children just like lambs he would be like dear papa anything the poor little fellow could think of he poured out with kisses and entreaties to know if he were naughty still while his sister after her usual fashion on such occasions began to race up and down the room with paroxysms sometimes of stamping sometimes of something like laughter  some minutes passed before honora could compose herself or soothe the boy by her assurances that he was not to blame only those who put things in his head that he could not understand and it was not till after much tender fondling that she had calmed him enough for his morning devotions  no sooner were these over than he looked up and said while the tears still glazed his cheeks sweet honey ill tell nurse and mr jones that im on pilgrimage to the eastern land and ill not turn into byways after red coats and little kids to vex you  whether owen quite separated fact from allegory might have been doubtful to a more prosaic mind than honoras but he had brought this dreamy strain with him from his father and she thought it one of his great charms  she had been obliged to leave him to himself much more than usual of late and she fervently resolved to devote herself with double energy to watching over him and eradicating any weeds that might have been sown during her temporary inattention  he clung so fast to her hand and was so much delighted to have her with him again so often repeating that she must not go away again that the genuineness of his affection could not be doubted and probably he would only retain an impression of having been led to say something very shocking and the alarm to his sensitive conscience would hinder him from ever even trying to remember what it was  she spoke however to nurse telling her that the subject must never be mentioned to the children since it was by no means desirable for them and besides she had no intention of the kind  she wished it to be distinctly understood that master owen was not to be looked upon as her heir  very true maam it is too soon to be talking of such things yet and i must say i was as sorry as possible to find that the child had had it named to him  people will talk you see miss charlecote though i am sure so young a lady as you are      that has nothing to do with it said honora i consider nothing so bad for a child as to be brought up to expectations to which he has no right when he is sure to have to provide for himself  i beg that if you hear the subject entered on again in the childrens presence you will put a stop to it  certainly maam their poor dear papa never would have wished them to be occupied with earthly things of that sort  as i often said there never was such an unworldly gentleman he never would have known if there were a sixpence in the house nor a joint in the larder if there had not been cook and me to care for him  i often said to cookwell for him that he has honest people about him  honora likewise spoke to jones her private retainer  he smiled scorn of the accusation and answered her as the child he had known in frocks yes maam i did tell the young gentleman to hold his tongue for it never would be his in your lifetime nor after in my judgment  why certainly it does seem early days to speak of such a matter said honora sadly  it is unaccountable what people will not put in childrens heads said jones sagely not but what he is a nice quiet young gentleman and gives very little trouble but they might let that alone  miss honora when will it be convenient to you to take my account of the plate  she felt pretty well convinced that jones had only resented the whole on her account and that it was not he who had put the notion into the boys head  as to nurse she was far from equally clear  doubts of nurses sincerity had long been growing upon her and she was in the uncomfortable position of being able to bear neither to think of the childrens intercourse with any one tainted with falsehood nor to dismiss a person implicitly trusted by their father  she could only decide that the first detected act of untruth should be the turningpoint  meantime painful as was many an association honor did not find her position so dreary or so oppressive as she had anticipated  she had a great deal to do and the tracks had been duly made out for her by her cousin  mr saville or humfreys old friend sir john raymond were always ready to help her in great matters and brooks was an excellent dictatorial deputy in small ones  her real love for country life for live animals and above all the power of doing good all found scope humfreys charge gave her a sense of a fulfilled duty and mournful and brokenspirited as she believed herself if humfrey could have looked at her as she scrupulously made entries in his book rode out with the children to try to look knowing at the crops or sat by the fire in the evening with his dogs at her feet telling stories to the children he would not have feared too much for his honor  living or dead the love of humfrey could hardly help being a spring of peace and happiness and the consciousness of it had been too brief and the tie never close enough to lead to a state of crushed spirits  the many little tender observances that she paid to him were a source of mournful sweetness rather than of heartrending  it was a quietly but fully occupied life with a certain severity towards her own comforts and liberality towards those of other people which had always been a part of her character ever since owen sandbrook had read sermons with her on selfdenial  if miss wells had a fire in her bedroom forced upon her miss charlecote had none and hurried down in the bleak winter morning in shawl and gloves to humfreys great bible and then to his account books and her business letters  she was fresh with cold when she met the children for their early reading  and thenbut it was not soon that she learnt to bear that though she had gone through the like before she had to read the household devotions where every petition seemed to be lacking the manly tone to give it fulness and force  breakfast followed the silver kettle making it homelike the children chattering miss wells smiling letters coming in to perplex or to clear up perplexities amuse or cheer  the children were then turned out for an hours hoopdriving on the gravel drive horsechestnut picking or whatever might not be mischief while honora was conferring with jones or with brooks and receiving her orders for the day  next followed letterwriting then lessons in general a real enjoyment unless lucilla happened to have picked up a fit of perversenesssome reading to them or rationalizing of playthe early dinnerthe subsequent expedition with them either walking or ridingfor brooks had soon found ponies for them and they were gallant little riders  honor would not give up the old pony long since trained for her by humfrey though maybe that was her most undutiful proceeding towards him as he would certainly have told her that the creature was shaky on the legs  so at last it tumbled down with her but without any damage save a hole in her skirt and a dreadful crying fit of little owen who was frightened out of his wits she owned that it must be degraded to light cart work and mounted an animal which hiltonbury agreed to be more worthy of her  coming in the children played she either did her business or found leisure for reading then came teatime then the reading of a story book to the children and when they were disposed of of something mildly moral and instructive to suit miss wellss taste  the neighbourhood all mourned mr charlecote as a personal loss and could hardly help regarding any successor as their enemy  miss charlecote had been just enough known in her girlish days not to make her popular in a commonplace neighbourhood the ladies had criticised her hair and her genius and the gentlemen had been puzzled by her searching questions into their county antiquities and obliged to own themselves unaware of a roman milestone propping their bailiffs pigstye or of the spur of a champion of one of the roses being hung over their family pew but when mr henderson and the raymonds reported pleasantly of her and when once or twice she had been seen cantering down the lanes or shopping in elverslope and had exchanged a bow with a familiar face the gentlemen took to declaring that the heiress was an uncommonly fine woman after all and the ladies became possessed with the perception that it was high time to call upon miss charlecotewhat could she be doing with those two children  so there were calls which honor duly returned and then came invitations but to miss wellss great annoyance honor decided against these  it was not selfdenial but she thought it suitable  she did not love the round of county gaieties and in her position she did not think them a duty  retirement seemed to befit the widowhood which she felt so entirely that when miss wells once drove her into disclaiming all possibility of marrying she called it marrying again  when miss wells urged the inexpedience of absolute seclusion she said she would continue to make morning calls and she hoped in time to have friends of her own to stay with her she might ask the raymonds or some of the quiet clerical families the real elite be it observed to spend a day or drink tea but the dinner and ball life was too utterly incongruous for an elderly heiress  when it came to the elderly heiress poor miss wells was always shut up in utter despairshe who thought her brightlocked darling only grew handsomer each day of her pride of womanhood  the brass which honora had chosen for her cousins memorial was slow in being executed and summer days had come in before it was sent to hiltonbury  she walked down a good deal agitated to ascertain whether it were being rightly managed but to her great annoyance found that the church having been left open so many idle people were standing about that she could not bear to mingle with them  had it been only the holt vassalage either their feeling would have been one with her own or they would have made way for her but there were some pert nursery maids gaping about with the children from beauchamp whence the heads of the family had been absent all the winter and spring leaving various nurses and governesses in charge  honora could not encounter their eyes and went to the vicarage to send mr henderson and finding him absent walked over sundry fields in a vain search for brooks  rain came on so violently as to wet her considerably and to her exceeding mortification she was obliged to relinquish her superintendence either in person or by deputy  however when she awoke early and saw the sun laughing through the shining drops she decided on going down ere the curious world was astir to see what had been done  it was not far from six when she let herself out at the porch and very like a morning with humfrey with the tremulous glistening of every spray and the steamy fragrance rising wherever the sun touched the grass that seemed almost to grow visibly the woods were ringing with the song of birds circle beyond circle and there was something in the exuberant merriment of those blackbirds and thrushes that would not let her be sad though they had been humfreys special glory  the thought of such pleasures did not seem out of keeping  the lane was overhung with bushes the banks a whole wealth of ferns climbing plants tall grasses and nettles had not yet felt the sun and were dank and dreary so she hurried on and arriving at the clerks door knocked and opened  he was gone to his work and sounds above showed the wife to be engaged on the toilette of the younger branches  she called out that she had come for the keys of the church and seeing them on the dresser abstracted them bidding the good woman give herself no trouble  she paused under the porch and ere fitting the heavy key to the lock felt that strange pressure and emotion of the heart that even if it be sorrow is also an exquisite sensation  if it were mournful that the one last office she could render to humfrey was over it was precious to her to be the only one who had a right to pay it the one whom he had loved best upon earth round whom she liked to believe that he still might be often hoveringwhom he might welcome by and by  here was the place for communion with him the spot which had indeed been to him none other than the gate of heaven  yet will it be believed  not one look did honora cast at humfrey charlecotes monument that morning  with both hands she turned the reluctant bolts of the lock and pushed open the nailstudded door  she slowly advanced along the uneven floor of the aisle and had just reached the chancel arch when something suddenly stirred making her start violently  it was still and after a pause she again advanced but her heart gave a sudden throb and a strange chill of awe rushed over her as she beheld a little white face over the altar rail the chin resting on a pair of folded hands the dark eyes fixed in a strange dreamy spiritual expression of awe  the shock was but for a moment the next the blood rallied to her heart and she told herself that humfrey would say that either the state of her spirits had produced an illusion or else that some child had been left here by accident  she advanced but as she did so the two hands were stretched out and locked together as in an agony and the childish feeble voice cried out oh if youre an angel please dont frighten me ill be very good  honora was in a pale soft gray dress that caught the light in a rosy glow from the east window and her golden hair was hanging in radiant masses beneath her straw bonnet but she could not appreciate the angelic impression she made on the child who had been tried so long by such a captivity  my poor child she said i am no angel i am only miss charlecote  im afraid you have been shut up here and coming nearer she perceived that it was a boy of about seven years old well dressed though his garments were disordered  he stood up as she came near but he was trembling all over and as she drew him into her bosom and put her arms round him she found him quivering with icy cold  poor little fellow she said rocking him as she sat on the step and folded her shawl round him have you been here all night  how cold you are i must take you home my dear  what is your name  im robert mervyn fulmort said the little boy clinging to her  we came in to see mr charlecotes monument put up and i suppose they forgot me  i waked up and everybody was gone and the door was locked oh please he gasped take me out  i dont want to cry  she thought it best to take him at once into the cheerful sunlight but it did not yet yield the warmth that he needed and all her soothing words could not check the nervous tremor though he held her so tight that it seemed as if he would never let her go  you shall come home with me my dear little boy you shall have some breakfast and then i will take you safe home to beauchamp  oh if you please said the boy gratefully  exercise was thawing his numbed limbs and his eyes brightened  whom were you with she asked  who could have forgotten you  i came with lieschen and nurse and the babies  the others went out with mademoiselle  and you went to sleep  yes i liked to see the mason go chip chip and i wanted to see them fit the thing in  i got into that great pew to see better and i made myself a nest but at last they were all gone  and what did you do then  were you afraid  i didnt know what to do  i ran all about to see if i could look out at a window but i couldnt  did you try to call  wouldnt it have been naughty said the boy and then with an impulse of honest truthfulness i did try once but do you know there was another voice came back again and i thought that die geistern wachten sich auf  the what  die geistern das lieschen sagt in die gewolben wohnen said little robert evidently quite unconscious whether he spoke german or english  so you could not call for the echo  well did you not think of the bells  yes but oh the door was shut and then ill tell youbut dont tell mervyni did cry  indeed i dont wonder  it must have been very lonely  i didnt like it said robert shivering and getting to his german again he described das gewitter beating on the panes with wind and whirling leaves and the unearthly noises of the creaking vane  the terror of the lonely supperless child was dreadful to think of and she begged to know what he could have done as it grew dark  i got to mr charlecote said robertan answer that thrilled her all over  i said id be always very good if he would take care of me and not let them frighten me  and so i did go to sleep  im sure mr charlecote would my dear little man began honora then checked by remembering what he would have said  but didnt you think of one more sure to take care of you than mr charlecote  lieschen talks of der lieber gott said the little boy  we said our prayers in the nursery but mervyn says only babies do  mervyn is terribly wrong then said honora shuddering  oh robert mr charlecote never got up nor went to bed without asking the good god to take care of him and make him good  was that why he was so good asked robert  indeed it was said she fervently nobody can be good without it  i hope my little friend will never miss his prayers again for they are the only way to be manly and afraid of nothing but doing wrong as he was  i wont miss them said robert eagerly then with a sudden puzzled lookdid he send you  who  mr charlecote  whyhow should      what made you think so  iwhy once in the night i woke up and oh it was so dark and there were such noises such rattlings and roarings and then it came all whitewhite lightall the windowbars and all so plain upon the wall and then camebending bending overa great gray darknessoh so horribleand went away and came back  the shadow of the trees swaying in the moonlight  was it  i thought it was the nebel wittwen neckten mir and then the erlkonungtochter  wissen sieand oh i did scream once and then somehow it grew quietly darker and i thought mr charlecote had me folded up so warm on his horses back and that we rode ever so far and they stretched out their long white arms and could not get me but somehow he set me down on a cold stone and said wait here robin and ill send her to lead you  and then came a creaking and there were you  well little robin he did not quite send me but it was to see his tablet that i came down this morning so he brought me after all  he was my very dear cousin humfrey and i like you for having been his little friend  will you be mine too and let me help you if i can and if your papa and mamma give leave come and see me and play with the little girl and boy who live with me  oh yes cried robert i like you  the alliance was sealed with a hearty kiss  but said robert you must ask mademoiselle papa and mamma are away  and how was it no one ever missed you  robert was far less surprised at this than she was for like all children to be left behind appeared to him a contingency rather probable than otherwise  he was a finelooking boy with dark gray thoughtful eyes and a pleasant countenance but his nerves had been so much shaken that he started and seemed ready to catch hold of her at every sound  whats that he cried as a trampling came along the alley as they entered the garden  only my two little cousins said honora smiling  i hope you will be good friends though perhaps owen is too young a playfellow  here lucy owenhere is a little friend for yourobert fulmort  the children came eagerly up and lucilla taking her hand raised her face to kiss the stranger but robert did not approve of the proceeding and held up his head  lucilla rose on tiptoe robin did the same  as he had the advantage of a whole years height he fully succeeded in keeping out of her reach and very comical was the effect  she gave it up at last and contented herself with asking and where do you come from  out of the church was robins reply  then you are very good and holy indeed said owen looking at him earnestly with clasped hands  no said robert gruffly  poor little man he was left behind and shut up in the church all night without any supper said honora  shut up in the church like goody twoshoes cried lucilla dancing about  oh what fun  did the angels come and sing to you asked owen  dont ask such stupid questions cried his sister  oh i know what id have done  didnt you get up into the pulpit  no  and i do so want to know if the lady and gentleman on the monument have their ruffs the same on the inside towards the wall as outside and oh i do so want to get all the dust out of the folds of the ladys ruff i wish theyd lock me into the church and id soon get out when i was tired  lucilla and owen decidedly thought robin had not profited by his opportunities but he figured better in an examination on his brothers and sisters  there were seven of whom he was the fourthaugusta juliana and mervyn being his elders phoebe maria and bertha his juniors  the three seniors were under the rule of mademoiselle the little ones under that of nurse and lieschen and robert stood on neutral ground doing lessons with mademoiselle whom he said in unpicked language which astounded little owen he morally hated and at the same time free of the nursery where it appeared that phoebe was the jolliest little fellow in the world and lieschen was the only goodnatured body going and knew no end of mahrchen  the boy spoke a very odd mixture of lieschens german and of english pervaded by stable slang and was altogether a curious study of the effects of absentee parents nevertheless honora and lucilla both took a considerable fancy to him the latter patronizing him to such a degree that she hardly allowed him to eat the muchneeded breakfast which recalled colour to his cheek and substance to his voice  after much thought owen delivered himself of the sentiment that peoples papas and mammas were very funny doubtless philosophizing on the inconsistency of the class in being some so willing some so reluctant to leave their children behind them  honor fully agreed with him but did not think the discussion profitable for robin whom she now proposed to take home in the ponycarriage  lucilla always eager for novelty and ardent for her new friendship begged to accompany her owen was afraid of the strangers and preferred miss wells  even as they set out they found that roberts disappearance had created some sensation for the clerks wife was hurrying up to ask if miss charlecote had the keys that she might satisfy the man from beauchamp that master fulmort was not in the church  at the lodge the woman threw up her hands with joy at the sight of the child and some way off on the sward stood a bigger boy who with a loud hurrah scoured away towards the house as the carriage appeared  thats mervyn said robert he is gone to tell them  beauchamp was many degrees grander since honor had last visited it  the approach was entirely new  two fresh wings had been added and the front was all over scaffolds and cement in all stages of colour from rich brown to permanent white  robert explained that nothing was so nice as to watch the workmen and showed lucilla a plasterer on the topmost stage of the scaffolding who he said was the nicest man he knew and could sing all manner of songs  rather nervously honora drove under the poles to the halldoor where two girls were seen in the rear of a frenchwoman and honor felt as if robin might have grounds for his moral hatred when her voluble transports of gratitude and affection broke forth and the desolation in which the loss had left them was described  robert edged back from her at once and flew to another party at the bottom of the stairsa very stout nurse and an uncapped flaxenhaired madchen who clasped him in her arms and cried and sobbed over him  as soon as he could release himself he caught hold of a fat little bundle which had been coaxing one of his legs all through lieschens embrace and dragging it forwards cried here she isheres phoebe  phoebe however was shy and cried and fought her way back to hide her face in lieschens apron and meantime a very odd scene took place  schoolroom and nursery were evidently at most direful war  each wanted to justify itself lest the lady should write to the parents each tried to be too grand to seem to care and threw all the blame on the other  on the whole honor gathered that mademoiselle believed the boy enfantin enough to be in the nursery the nurses that he was in the schoolroom and he had not been really missed till bedtime when each party recriminated instead of seeking him and neither would allow itself to be responsible for him  lieschen who alone had her suspicions where he might be abstained from naming them in sheer terror of kobolden geistern corpsecandles and what not and had lain conjuring up his miseries till morning  honora did not much care how they settled it amongst them but tried to make friends with the young people who seemed to take their brothers restoration rather coolly and to be chiefly occupied by staring at lucilla  augusta and juliana were selfpossessed and rather manierees acquitting themselves evidently to the satisfaction of the french governess and honor perceiving her to be a necessary infliction invited her and her pupils especially robin to spend a day in the next week at the holt  the proposal was graciously accepted and lucilla spent the intervening time in a tumult of excitement  nor was the day entirely unsuccessful mademoiselle behaved herself with french tact and miss wells took her off honoras hands a good deal leaving them free for the children  lucilla always aspiring began a grand whispering friendship with the two girls and set her little cap strongly at mervyn but that young gentleman was contemptuous and bored when he found no entertainment in miss charlecotes stud and was only to be kept placable by the bagatelleboard and the strawberrybed  robert followed his lead more than was satisfactory but with visible predilections for the holt ladies old and young  honor talked to him about little phoebe and he lighted up and began to detail her accomplishments and to be very communicative about his home vexations and pleasures and finally when the children were wishing good night he bluntly said it would be better fun to bring lieschen and phoebe  honor thought so too and proposed giving the invitation  dont said robert shed be cross ill bring them  and so he did  two days after the broad german face and the flaxen head appeared leading that fat ball phoebe and robin frisking in triumph beside her  henceforth a great friendship arose between the children phoebe soon lost all dread of those who petted her and favoured them with broad smiles and an incomprehensible patois  owen made very much of her and pursued and imitated robert with the devotion of a small boy to a larger one  lucilla devoted herself to him for want of better game and moreover he plainly told her that she was the prettiest little girl he ever saw and laid all manner of remarkable treasures at her feet miss charlecote believed that he made some curious confidences to her for once owen said i want to know why robin hasnt a sweet honey to make him good  robin has a papa and mamma and a governess  robin was telling lucy he wanted some one to teach him to be good and she said she would but i think she is not old enough  any one who is good is teaching others my owen said honor  we will ask in our prayers that poor little robin may be helped  when mr and mrs fulmort came home there was an interchange of calls many thanks for her kindness to the children and sanction of future intercourse  mr fulmort was a great distiller who had married a county heiress and endeavoured to take his place among the country squires whom he far exceeded in display and his wife a meek sickly person lived a life of slavery to the supposed exigencies of fashion  she had always had in her maiden days a species of awe of the charlecotes london cousin and was now disposed to be rather gratified by her notice of her children  mervyn had been disposed of at a tutors and robert was adrift for many hours of the day  as soon as he had discovered the possibility of getting to the holt alone he was frequently there following honora about in her gardening and farming as much at home as the little sandbrooks sharing in their sports and often listening to the little books that she read aloud to them  he was very far from being such an angelic little mortal as owen with whom indeed his sympathies were few  once some words were caught from him by both children which startled honor exceedingly and obliged her to tell him that if ever she found him to have repeated the like she should forbid his coming near them  he looked excessively sullen and did not come for a week during which lucilla was intolerably naughty and was twice severely punished for using the identical expressions in defiance  then he came again and behaved as if nothing had happened but the offence never recurred  some time after when he boasted of having come away with a lesson unlearnt in flat disobedience to mademoiselle honor sent him straight home though lucilla stamped and danced at her in a frenzy  another time owen rushed up to her in great agony at some torture that robin was inflicting upon a live mouse  upon this honor full of the spirit of indignation fairly struck the offender sharply on the fingers with her ridingwhip  he scowled at her but it was only for a moment  she held him tightly by the hand while she sent the gardener to put his victim out of its misery and then she talked to him not sentimentally her feelings were too strongly stirred but with all her horror of cruelty  he muttered that mervyn and the grooms always did it but he did not hold out longlucilla was holding aloof too much horrified to come nearand finally he burst into tears and owned that he had never thought  every now and then such outbreaks made honor wonder why she let him come perhaps to tempt her children but she remembered that he and humfrey had been fond of one another and she felt drawn towards him though in all prudence she resolved to lessen the attractions of the holt by being very strict with all and rather ungracious to him  yet strange to say the more regulations she made and the more she flashed out at his faults the more constant was her visitor the robin who seemed to thrive upon the veriest crumbs of goodnature  positively honora was sometimes amazed to find what a dragon she could be upon occasion  since she had been brought into subordination at six or eight years old she had never had occasion to find out that she had a spirit of her own till she found herself astonishing jones and brooks for taking the liberty of having a deadly feud making brooks understand that cows were not to be sold nor promises made to tenants without reference to her or showing a determined marauder that humfreys wood was not to be preyed upon any more than in his own time  they were very feminine explosions to be sure but they had their effect and miss charlecotes was a real government  the uproar with nurse came at last through a chance discovery that she had taken owen to a certain forbidden house of gossip where he had been bribed to secrecy with bread and treacle  honora wrote to mrs charteris for permission to dismiss the mischievous woman and obtained full consent and the most complete expression of confidence and gratitude  so there ensued a month when every visit to the nursery seemed to be spent in tears  nurse was really very fond of the children and cried over them incessantly only consoling herself by auguring a brilliant future for them when master owen should reign over hiltonbury like the gentleman he was  but nurse cousin honor says i never shallim to be a clergyman like papa  she says      nurse winked knowingly at the housemaid  yes yes my darling no one likes to hear who is to come after them  dont you say nothing about it aint becoming but by and by see if it dont come so and if my boy aint master here  i wish i was and then nursey would never go  however nurse did go and after some tears owen was consoled by promotion to the habits of an older boy  lucilla was very angry and revenged herself by every variety of opposition in her power all which were put down by the strong hand  it was a matter of necessity to keep a tight grasp on this little wilful sprite the most fiery morsel of engaging caprice and naughtiness that a quiet spinster could well have lit upon  it really sometimes seemed to honora as if there were scarcely a fault in the range of possibilities that she had not committed and indeed a bit of good advice generally seemed to act by contraries and served to suggest mischief  softness and warmth of feeling seemed to have been lost with her father she did not show any particular affection towards her brother or honora  perhaps she liked miss wells but that might be only opposition nay honor would have been almost thankful if she had melted at the departure of the undesirable nurse but she appeared only hard and cross  if she liked any one it was robert fulmort but that was too much in the way of flirtation  vanity was an extremely traceable spring of action  when nurse went miss lucilla gave the household no peace because no one could rightly curl the long flaxen tresses upon her shoulders until the worry became so intolerable that honora partly as penance partly because she thought the present mode neither conducive to tidiness nor comfort took her scissors and trimmed all the ringlets behind bowldish fashion as her own carrots had figured all the days of her childhood  lucilla was held by mrs stubbs during the operation  she did not cry or scream after she felt herself conquered by main strength but her blue eyes gleamed with a strange wild light she would not speak to miss charlecote all the rest of the day and honora doubted whether she were ever forgiven  another offence was the cutting down her name into lucy  honor had avoided cilly from the first silly sandbrook would be too dreadful a sobriquet to be allowed to attach to any one but lucilla resented the change more deeply than she showed  lucy was a housemaids name she said and honor reproved her for vanity and called her so all the more she did not love miss charlecote well enough to say that cilly had been her fathers name for her and that he had loved to wind the flaxen curls round his fingers  every new study every new injunction cost a warfare disobedience and passionate defiance and resistance on the one hand and steady goodtempered firmness on the other gradually growing a little stern the waves became weary of beating on the rock at last  the fiery child was growing into a girl and the calm will had the mastery of her she succumbed insensibly and owing all her pleasures to cousin honor she grew to depend upon her and mind manners and opinions were taking their mould from her    chapter v       too soon the happy child     his nook of heavenward thought must change     for lifes seducing wildchristian year  the summer sun peeped through the venetian blinds greenly shading the breakfasttable  only three sides were occupied  for more than two years past good miss wells had been lying under the shade of hiltonbury church taking with her honora charlecotes last semblance of the dependence and deference of her young ladyhood  the kind governess had been fondly mourned but she had not left her child to loneliness for the brother and sister sat on either side each with a particular petlucillas a large pointer who kept his nose on her knee owens a white fantailed pigeon seldom long absent from his shoulder where it sat quivering and bending backwards its graceful head  lucilla now nearly fourteen looked younger from the unusual smallness of her stature and the exceeding delicacy of her features and complexion and she would never have been imagined to be two years the senior of the handsomefaced largelimbed young saxon who had so far outstripped her in height and yet there was something in those deep blue eyes that on a second glance proclaimed a keen intelligence as much above her age as her appearance was below it  whats the matter said she rather suddenly  yes sweetest honey added the boy you look bothered  is that rascal not paying his rent  no she said it is a different matter entirely  what do you think of an invitation to castle blanch  for us all asked owen  yes all to meet your uncle christopher the last week in august  why cant he come here asked lucilla  i believe we must go said honora  you ought to know both your uncles and they should be consulted before owen goes to school  i wonder if they will examine me said owen  how they will stare to find sweet honeys teaching as good as all their preparatory schools  conceited boy  im not conceitedonly in my teacher  mr henderson said i should take as good a place as robert fulmort did at winchester after four years in that humbugging place at elverslope  we cant go cried lucilla  its the last week of robins holidays  well done lucy and both honor and owen laughed heartily  it is nothing to me said she tossing her head only i thought cousin honor thought it good for him  you may stay at home to do him good laughed owen im sure i dont want him  you are very welcome such a bore as he is  now owen  honey dear i do take my solemn affidavit that i have tried my utmost to be friends with him said owen but he is such a fellownever has the least notion beyond winchester routinelatin and greek cricket and football  youll soon be a schoolboy yourself said lucilla  then i shant make such an ass of myself returned owen  robin is a very good boy i believe said honor  thats the worst of him cried lucilla running away and clapping the door after her as she went  well i dont know said owen very seriously he says he does not care about the saints days because he has no one to get him leave out  i remember said honor with a sweet smile of tender memory when to me the merit of saints days was that they were your fathers holidays  yes youll send me to westminster and be always coming to woolstonelane said owen  your uncles must decide she said half mournfully half proudly you are getting to be a big boypast me oney  it brought her a roughly playful caress and he added youve got the best right im sure  i had thought of winchester she said  robert would be a friend  owen made a face and caused her to laugh while scandalizing her by humming not there not there my child  well be it where it may you had better look over your virgil while i go down to my practical georgics with brooks  owen obeyed  he was like a spirited horse in a leash of silk  strong fearless and manly he was still perfectly amenable to her and had never shown any impatience of her rule  she had taught him entirely herself and both working together with a thorough good will she had rendered him a better classical scholar as all judges allowed than most boys of the same age and far superior to them in general cultivation and she should be proud to convince captain charteris that she had not made him the mollycoddle that was obviously anticipated  the other relatives who had seen the children in their yearly visits to london had always expressed unqualified satisfaction though not advancing much in the good graces of lucy and owen  but honor thought the public school ought to be left to the selection of the two uncles though she wished to be answerable for the expense both there and at the university  the provision inherited by her charges was very slender for contrary to all expectation old mr sandbrooks property had descended in another quarter and there was barely 5000 pounds between the two  to preserve this untouched by the expenses of education was honoras object and she hoped to be able to smooth their path in life by occasional assistance but on principle she was determined to make them independent of her and she had always made it known that she regarded it as her duty to humfrey that her hiltonbury property should be destinedif not to the apocryphal american charlecoteto a relation of their mutual greatgrandmother  cold invitations had been given and declined but this one was evidently in earnest and the consideration of the captain decided honora on accepting it but not without much murmuring from lucilla  caroline and horatia were detestable grownup young ladies her aunt was horrid castle blanch was the slowest place in the world she should be shut up in some abominable schoolroom to do fancywork and never to get a bit of fun  even the being reminded of wrapworth and its associations only made her more cross  she was of a nature to fly from thought or feelingshe was keen to perceive but hated reflection and from the very violence of her feelings she unconsciously abhorred any awakening of them and steeled herself by levity  her distaste only gave way in roberts presence when she appeared highly gratified by the change certain that castle blanch would be charming and her cousin the lifeguardsman especially so  the more disconsolate she saw robert the higher rose her spirits and his arrival to see the party off sent her away in open triumph glorifying her whole cousinhood without a civil word to him but when seated in the carriage she launched at him a drawing the favourite work of her leisure hours broke into unrestrained giggling at his grateful surprise and ere the wood was past was almost strangled with sobs  castle blanch was just beyond the suburbs of london in complete country but with an immense neighbourhood and not halfanhour by train from town  honora drove all the way to enjoy the lovely thames scenery to the full  they passed through wrapworth and as they did so lucilla chattered to the utmost while honora stole her hand over owens and gently pressed it  he returned the squeeze with interest and looked up in her face with a loving smilemother and home were not wanting to him  about two miles further on and not in the same parish began the castle blanch demesne  the park sloped down to the thames and was handsome and quite full of timber and the mansion as the name imported had been built in the height of pseudogothic with a formidable keeplooking tower at each corner but the fortification below consisting of glass the sham cloister likewise glass windows for drawingroom musicroom and conservatory and jutting out far in advance a great embattled gateway with a sham portcullis and doors fit to defy an army  three menservants met the guests in the hall and mrs charteris received them in the drawingroom with the womanoftheworld tact that honora particularly hated there was always such deference to miss charlecote and such an assumption of affection for the children and gratitude for her care of them and miss charlecote had not been an heiress early enough in life for such attentions to seem matters of course  it was explained that there was no schoolroom at present and as a girl of lucillas age who was already a guest joined the rest of the party at dinner it was proposed that she and her brother should do the same provided miss charlecote did not object  honor was really glad of the gratification for lucilla and mrs charteris agreed with her before she had time to express her opinion as to girls being kept back or brought forward  honor found herself lodged in great state in a world of lookingglass that had perfectly scared her poor little hiltonbury maiden and with a large dressingroom where she hoped to have seen a bed for lucilla but she found that the little girl was quartered in another story near the cousins and unwilling to imply distrust and hating to incite obsequious compliance she did not ask for any change but only begged to see the room  it was in a long passage whence doors opened every way and one being left ajar sounds of laughter and talking were heard in tones as if the young ladies were above good breeding in their private moments  mrs charteris said something about her daughters morningroom and was leading the way thither when an unguarded voice exclaimedrouge dragon and all and a start and suppressed laughter at the entrance of the newcomers gave an air of having been caught  four young ladies in degage attitudes were lounging round their afternoon refection of tea  two caroline and horatia charteris shook hands with miss charlecote and kissed lucilla who still looked at them ungraciously followed honoras example in refusing their offer of tea and only waiting to learn her own habitation came down to her room to be dressed for dinner and to criticize cousins aunt house and all  the cousins were not strikingboth were on a small scale caroline the best looking in features and complexion but horatia the most vivacious and demonstrative and with an air of dash and fashion that was more effective than beauty  lucilla not sensible to these advantages broadly declared both young ladies to be frights and commented so freely on them to the willing ears of owen who likewise came in to go down under sweet honeys protection as to call for a reproof from honora one of whose chief labours ever was to destroy the little ladys faith in beauty and complacency in her own  the latter sensation was strong in honor herself as she walked into the room between her beautiful pair and contrasted lucilla with her contemporary a formed and finished young lady all plaits ribbons and braceletsnot half so pleasing an object as the little maid in her white frock blue sash and short wavy hair though maybe there was something quaint in such simplicity to eyes trained by fashion instead of by good taste  here was captain charteris just what he had been when he went away  how different from his stately dull wiferidden elder brother  so brisk and blunt and eager quite lifting his niece off her feet and almost crushing her in his embrace telling her she was still but a hopomythumb and shaking hands with his nephew with a look of scrutiny that brought the blood to the boys cheek  his eyes were never off the children while he was listening to honora and she perceived that what she said went for nothing he would form his judgment solely by what he observed for himself  at dinner he was seated between miss charlecote and his niece and honora was pleased with him for his neglect of her and attention to his smaller neighbour whose face soon sparkled with merriment while his increasing animation proved that the saucy little woman was as usual enchanting him  much that was very entertaining was passing about tigerhunting when at dessert as he stretched out his arm to reach some water for her she exclaimed why uncle kit you have brought away the marks no use to deny it the tigers did bite you  the palm of his hand certainly bore in purple marks resembling those of a set of teeth and he looked meaningly at honora as he quietly replied something rather like a tigress  then it was a bite uncle kit  yes in a putanendtoit tone which silenced lucilla her tact being much more ready when concerned with the nobler sex  in the drawingroom mrs charteriss civilities kept honora occupied while she saw owen bursting with some request and when at length he succeeded in claiming her attention it was to tell her of his cousins offer to take him out shooting and his elder uncles proviso that it must be with her permission  he had gone out with the careful gamekeeper at hiltonbury but this was a different matter more trying to the nerves of those who stayed at home  however honora suspected that the uncles opinion of her competence to be trusted with owen would be much diminished by any betrayal of womanly terrors and she made her only conditions that he should mind uncle kit and not go in front of the guns otherwise he would never be taken out again a menace which she judiciously thought more telling than that he would be shot  by and by mr charteris came to discuss subjects so interesting to her as a farmer that it was past nine oclock before she looked round for her children  healthy as lucilla was her frame was so slight and unsubstantial and her spirits so excitable that overfatigue or irregularity always told upon her strength and temper for which reason honor had issued a decree that she should go to bed at nine and spend two hours of every morning in quiet employment as a counterbalance to the excitement of the visit  looking about to give the summons honor found that owen had disappeared unnoticed and wearied by the agricultural dialogue he had hailed nine oclock as the moment of release and crept off with unobtrusive obedience which honor doubly prized when she beheld his sister full of eagerness among cousins and gentlemen at the racing game  strongly impelled to end it at once honor waited however till the little white horseman had reached the goal and just as challenges to a fresh race were beginning she came forward with her needful summons  oh miss charlecote how cruel was the universal cry  we cant spare all the life of our game said charles charteris  i solemnly declare we werent betting cried horatia  come the first evening  no said honor smiling  i cant have her lying awake to be good for nothing tomorrow as she will do if you entertain her too much  another night then you promise said charles  i promise nothing but to do my best to keep her fit to enjoy herself come lucy  the habit of obedience was fixed but not the habit of conquering annoyance and lucilla went off doggedly  honora would have accompanied her to soothe away her troubles but her cousin ratia ran after her and captain charteris stood in the way disposed to talk  discipline he said approvingly  harsh discipline i fear it seemed to her poor child said honor but she is so excitable that i must try to keep her as quiet as possible  right said the captain i like to see a child a child still  you must have had some tussles with that little spirit  a few she said smiling  she is a very good girl now but it has been rather a contrast with her brother  ha quoth the captain and mindful of the milksop charge honora eagerly continued you will soon see what a spirit he has  he rides very well and is quite fearless  i have always wished him to be with other boys and there are some very nice ones near usthey think him a capital cricketer and you should see him run and vault  he is an activelooking chap his uncle granted  every one tells me he is quite able to make his way at school i am only anxious to know which public school you and your brother would prefer  how old is he  only twelve last month though you would take him for fifteen  twelve then there would be just time to send him to portsmouth get him prepared for a naval cadetship then when i go out with sir david horfield i could take him under my own eye and make a man of him at once  oh captain charteris cried honora aghast his whole bent is towards his fathers profession  the captain had very nearly whistled unable to conceive any lad of spirit preferring study  whatever miss charlecotes wishes may be kit interposed the diplomatic elder brother we only desire to be guided by them  oh no indeed cried honor i would not think of such a responsibility it can belong only to his nearer connections then feeling as if this were casting him off to be pressed by the sailor the next instant she added in hasteonly i hoped it was understoodif you will let methe expenses of his education need not be considered and if he might be with me in the holidays she proceeded imploringly when captain charteris has seen more of him i am sure he will think it a pity that his talents    and there she stopped shocked at finding herself insulting the navy  if a boy have no turn that way it cannot be forced on him said the captain moodily  honora pitied his disappointment wondering whether he ascribed it to her influence and mr charteris blandly expressed great obligation and more complete resignation of the boy than she desired disclaimers ran into mere civilities and she was thankful to the captain for saying shortly well leave it till we have seen more of the boy  breakfast was very late at castle blanch and honora expected a tranquil hour in her dressingroom with her children but owen alone appeared anxious for the shooting but already wearying to be at home with his own pleasures and indignant with everything especially the absence of family prayers  the breakfast was long and desultory and in the midst lucilla made her appearance with horatia who was laughing and saying i found this child wandering about the park and the little pussycat wont tell where she has been  poaching of course responded charles it is what pussycats always do till they get shot by the keepers  et caetera et caetera et caetera  lucilla was among all the young people in the full tide of fun nonsense banter and repartee of a style new to her but in which she was formed to excel and there was such a black look when honor summoned her after the meal as impressed the awkwardness of enforcing authority among nearer relations but it was in vain she was carried off to the dressingroom and reminded of the bargain for two hours occupation  she murmured something about owen going out as he liked  he came to me before breakfast besides he is a boy  what made you go out in that strange manner  there was no answer but honor had learnt by experience that to insist was apt to end in obtaining nothing but a collision of wills and she merely put out the prayer books for the mornings reading of the psalms by the time it was over lucillas fit of temper had past and she leant back in her chair  what are you listening to lucy said honor seeing her fixed eye  the river said lucilla pausing with a satisfied look to attend to the deep regular rush  i couldnt think before what it was that always seemed to be wanting and now i know  it came to me when i went to bed it was so nice  the river voice  yes it must be one of your oldest friends said honora gratified at the softening  so that carried you out  i couldnt help it  i went home said lucilla  home  to wrapworth  all alone cried honor kindly but aghast  i couldnt help it again said the girl  the river noise was so like everythingand i knew the wayand i felt as if i must go before any one was up  so you really went  and what did you do  i got over the palings our own old way and theres my throne still in the back of the laurels and i popped in on old madge and oh she was so surprised  and then i came on mr prendergast and he walked all the way back with me till he saw ratia coming and then he would not go on any farther  well my dear i cant blame you this time  i am hoping myself to go to wrapworth with you and owen  ratia is going to take me out riding and in the boat said lucy without a direct answer  you like your cousins better than you expected  rashe is famous was the answer and so is uncle kit  my dear you noticed the mark on his hand said honora you do not know the cause  no  was it a shark or a mad dog eagerly asked the child slightly alarmed by her manner  neither  but do not you remember his carrying you into woolstonelane i always believed you did not know what your little teeth were doing  it was not received as honora expected  probably the scenes of the girls infancy had brought back associations more strongly than she was prepared forshe turned white gasped and vindictively said im glad of it  honora shocked had not discovered a reply when lucilla somewhat confused at the sound of her own words said i knownot quite thathe meant the bestbut cousin honor it was cruel it was wicked to part my father and me  fatheroh the river is going on still but not my father  the excitable girl burst into a flood of passionate tears as though the death of her father were more present to her than ever before and she had never truly missed him till she was brought in contact with her old home  the fatigue and change the talking evening and restless night had produced their effect her very thoughtlessness and ordinary insouciance rendered the rush more overwhelming when it did come and the weeping was almost hysterical  it was not a propitious circumstance that caroline knocked at the door with some message as to the afternoons arrangements  honor answered at haphazard standing so as to intercept the view but aware that the longdrawn sobs would be set down to the account of her own tyranny and nevertheless resolving the more on enforcing the quiescence the need of which was so evident but the creature was volatile as well as sensitive and by the time the door was shut stood with heaving breast and undried tears eagerly demanding whether her cousins wanted her  not at all said honora somewhat annoyed at the sudden transition it was only to ask if i would ride  charles was to bring the pony for me i must go cried lucy with an eye like that of a greyhound in the leash  not yet said honor  my dear you promised  ill never promise anything again was the pettish murmur  poor child these two morning hours were to her a terrible penance day after day  practically she might have found them heavy had they been left to her own disposal but it was expecting overmuch from human nature to hope that she would believe so without experience and her lessons were a daily irritation an apparent act of tyranny hardening her feelings against the exactor at the same time that the influence of kindred blood drew her closer to her own family with a revulsion the stronger from her own former exaggerated dislike  the nursery at castle blanch and the cousins who domineered over her as a plaything had been intolerable to the little important companion of a grown man but it was far otherwise to emerge from the calm seclusion and sober restraints of the holt into the gaieties of a large party to be promoted to young ladyhood and treated on equal terms save for extra petting and attention  instead of robert fulmort alone all the gentlemen in the house gave her flattering noticeeye ear and helping hand at her disposal and blunt uncle kit himself was ten times more civil to her than to either of her cousins  what was the use of trying to disguise from her the witchery of her piquant prettiness  her cousin horatia had always had a great passion for her as a beautiful little toy and her affection once so trying to its object had taken the far more agreeable form of promoting her pleasures and sympathizing with her vexations  patronage from twoandtwenty to fourteen from a daughter of the house to a guest was too natural to offend and lucilla requited it with vehement attachment running after her at every moment confiding all her grievances and being made sensible of many more ratia always devising delights for her took her on the river rode with her set her dancing opened the world to her and enjoyed her pleasures amused by her precocious vivacity fostering her sauciness extolling the wit of her audacious speeches and extremely resenting all poor honoras attempts to counteract this terrible spoiling or to put a check upon undesirable diversions and absolute pertness  every conscientious interference on her part was regarded as duennalike harshness and her restrictions as a grievous yoke and lucilla made no secret that it was so treating her to almost unvaried illhumour and murmurs  little did lucilla know nor even horatia how much of the charms that produced so much effect were due to these very restraints nor how the droll sauciness and womanly airs were enhanced by the simplicity of appearance which embellished her far more than the most fashionable air set off her companions  once lucilla had overheard her aunt thus excusing her short locks and simple dressit is miss charlecotes doing  of course when so much depends on her we must give way excellent person rather peculiar but we are under great obligations to her  very good property  no wonder that sojourn at castle blanch was one of the most irksome periods of honoras life disappointing fretting and tedious  there was a grievous dearth of books and of reasonable conversation and both she and owen were exceedingly at a loss for occupation and used to sit in the boat on the river and heartily wish themselves at home  he had no companion of his own age and was just too young and too enterprising to be welcome to gentlemen bent more on amusing themselves than pleasing him  he was roughly admonished when he spoilt sport or ran into danger his cousin charles was fitfully goodnatured but generally showed that he was in the way his uncle kit was more brief and stern with him than sweet honeys pupil could endure and honor was his only refuge  his dreariness was only complete when the sedulous civilities of his aunt carried her beyond his reach  she could not attain a visit to wrapworth till the sunday  the carriage went in state to the parish church in the morning and the music and preaching furnished subjects for persiflage at luncheon to her great discomfort and the horror of owen and she thought she might venture to wrapworth in the afternoon  she had a longing for owens church for auld lang syneno more  even his bark church in the backwoods could not have rivalled hiltonbury and the brass  owen true to his allegiance joined her in good time but reported that his sister was gone on with ratia  whereas ratia would probably otherwise not have gone to church at all honor was deprived of all satisfaction in her annoyance and the compensation of a teteatete with owen over his fathers memory was lost by the unwelcome addition of captain charteris  the loss signified the less as owens reminiscences were never allowed to languish for want of being dug up and revived but she could not quite pardon the sailor for the commonplace air his presence cast over the walk  the days were gone by when mr sandbrooks pulpit eloquence had rendered wrapworth church a sunday show to castle blanch  his successor was a cathedral dignitary so constantly absent that the former curate who had been continued on at wrapworth was in the eyes of every one the veritable master  poor mr prendergastwhatever were his qualifications as a preacherhad always been regarded as a disappointment people had felt themselves defrauded when the sermon fell to his share instead of that of mr sandbrook and odious comparison had so much established the opinion of his deficiencies that honora was not surprised to see a largelimbed and rather quaintlooking man appear in the desk but the service was gone through with striking reverence and the sermon was excellent though homely and very plainspoken  the church had been cruelly mauled by churchwardens of the last century and a few gothic decorations intended for the beginning of restoration only made it the more incongruous  the east window of stained glass of a quality left far behind by the advances of the last twenty years bore an inscription showing that it was a memorial and there was a really handsome font honor could trace the late rectors predilections in a manner that carried her back twenty years and showed her almost to her amusement how her own notions and sympathies had been carried onwards with the current of the world around her  on coming out she found that there might have been more kindness in captain charteris than she had suspected for he kept horatia near him and waited for the curate so as to leave her at liberty and unobserved her first object was that owen should see his mothers grave  it was beside the parsonage path a flat stone fenced by a low iron border enclosing likewise a small flowerbed weedy ruinous and forlorn  a floriated cross filled up with green lichen was engraven above the name                               lucilla horatia                beloved wife of the reverend owen sandbrook                           rector of this parish                             and only daughter              of lieutenantgeneral sir christopher charteris                      she died november the 18th 1837                               aged 29 years                                                                    mary caroline                                her daughter                          born november 11th 1837                            died april 14th 1838            i shall go to them but they shall not return to me  how like it was to poor owen that necessity of expression and the visible presage of weakening health so surely fulfilled  and his lucilla  it was a melancholy work to have brought home a missionary and secularized a parish priest  not a generous reflection thought honora at a rivals grave and she turned to the boy who had stooped to pull at some of the bits of groundsel  shall we come here in the early morning and set it to rights  i forgot it was sunday said owen hastily throwing down the weed he had plucked up  you were doing no harm my dear but we will not leave it in this state will you come with us lucy  lucilla had escaped and was standing aloof at the end of the path and when her brother went towards her she turned away  come lucy he entreated come into the garden with us  we want you to tell us the old places  im not coming was all her answer and she ran back to the party who stood by the church door and began to chatter to mr prendergast over whom she had domineered even before she could speak plain  a silent shy man wrapped up in his duties he was mortally afraid of the castle blanch young ladies and stood ill at ease talked down by miss horatia charteris but his eye lighted into a smile as the fairy plaything of past years danced up to him and began her merry chatter asking after every one in the parish and showing a perfect memory of names and faces such as amazed him in a child so young as she had been at the time when she had left the parish  honora and owen meantime were retracing recollections in the rectory garden eking out the boys four years old memories with imaginations and moralizings pondering over the border whence owen declared he had gathered snowdrops for his mothers coffin and the noble plane tree by the waterside sacred to the memory of bible stories told by his father in the summer evenings  that tree laughed lucilla when he told her that night as they walked upstairs to bed  nobody could sit there because of the mosquitoes and i should like to see the snowdrops you found in november  i know there were some white flowers  were they lilies of the valley for little mary  it will do just as well said lucilla  she knew that she could bring either scene before her mind with vivid distinctness but shrinking from the pain almost with horror she only said its a pity you arent a roman catholic owen you would soon find a hole in a rock and say it was where a saint with his head under his arm had made a footmark  you are very irreverent lucy and very cross besides  if you would not come and tell us what could we do  let it alone  if you dont care for dear papa and mamma i do said owen the tears coming into his eyes  im not going to rake it up to please honora returned his sister  if you like to go and poke with her over places where things never happened you may but she shant meddle with my real things  you are very unkind was the next accusation from owen much grieved and distressed when she is so good and dear and was so fond of our dear father  i know said lucilla in a tone he did not understand then with an air of eldership ill assorting with their respective sizes you are a mere child  it is all very well for you and you are very welcome to your sweet honey  owen insisted on hearing her meaning and on her refusal to explain used his superior strength to put her to sufficient torture to elicit an answer  dont owen  let go  there then  why she was in love with our father and nearly died of it when he married and rashe says of course she bullies me for being like my mother  she never bullies you cried owen indignantly shes much kinder to you than you deserve and i hate ratia for putting it into your head and teaching you such nasty mans words about my own honor  ah youll never be a man while you are under her  she only wants to keep us a couple of babies for eversending us to bed and making such a figure of me and lucy relieved her feelings by five perpendicular leaps into the air like an indiarubber ball her hair flying out and her eyes flashing  owen was not much astonished for lucys furies often worked off in this fashion but he was very angry on honors account loving her thoroughly and perceiving no offence in her affection for his father and the conversation assumed a highly quarrelsome character  it was much to the credit of masculine discretion that he refrained from reporting it when he joined honora in the mornings walk to wrapworth churchyard  behold some one was beforehand with themeven lucilla and the curate  the wearisome visit was drawing to a close when captain charteris beganwell miss charlecote have you thought over my proposal  to take owen to sea  indeed i hoped you were convinced that it would never answer  so far from being so that i see it is his best chance  he will do no good till the priggishness is knocked out of him  honor would not trust herself to answer  any accusation but this might have been borne  well well said the captain in a tone still more provoking it was so like hushing a petulant child we know how kind you were and that you meant everything good but it is not in the nature of things that a lad alone with women should not be cock of the walk and nothing cures that like a month on board  he will go to school said honor convinced all this was prejudice  ay and come home in the holidays lording it as if he were master and more like the son and heir  indeed captain charteris you are quite mistaken i have never allowed owen to think himself in that position  he knows perfectly well that there are nearer claims upon me and that hiltonbury can never belong to him  i have always rejoiced that it should be so  i should not like to have the least suspicion that there could be selfinterest in his affection for me in the time to come and i think it presumptuous to interfere with the course of providence in the matter of inheritances  my good miss charlecote said the captain who had looked at her with somewhat of a pitying smile instead of attending to her last words do you imagine that you know that boy  i do not know who else should she answered quivering between a disposition to tears at the harshness and to laughter at the assumption of the stranger uncle to see farther than herself into her darling  ha quoth the sailor slipperyslippery fellows  i do not understand you  you do not mean to imply that i have not his perfect confidence or do you think i have managed him wrongly  if you do pray tell me at once  i dare say i have  i couldnt say so said captain charteris  you are an excellent good woman miss charlecote and the best friend the poor things have had in the world and you have taught them more good than i could im sure but i never yet saw a woman who could be up to a boy any more than she could sail a ship  very likely not said honor with a lame attempt at a goodhumoured laugh but i should be very glad to know whether you are speaking from general experience of woman and boy or from individual observation of the case in point  the captain made a very odd incomprehensible little bow and after a moments thought said plainly speaking then i dont think you do get to the bottom of that lad but theres no telling and i never had any turn for those smooth chaps  if a fellow begins by being overprecise in what is of no consequence ten to one but he ends by being reckless in all the rest  this last speech entirely reassured honor by proving to her that the captain was entirely actuated by prejudice against his nephews gentle and courteous manners and her own religious views  he did not believe in the possibility of the success of such an education and therefore was of course insensible to owens manifold excellences  thenceforth she indignantly avoided the subject and made no attempt to discover whether the captains eye practised in midshipmen had made any positive observations on which to found his dissatisfaction  wounded by his want of gratitude and still more hurt by his unkind judgment of her beloved pupil she transferred her consultations to the more deferential uncle who was entirely contented with his nephew transported with admiration of her management and ready to make her a present of him with all his heart  so readily did he accede to all that she said of schools that the choice was virtually left to her  eton was rejected as a fitter preparation for the squirearchy than the ministry winchester on account of the distaste between owen and young fulmort and her decision was fixed in favour of westminster partly for his fathers sake partly on account of the proximity of st wulstanssuch an infinite advantage as mr charteris observed  the sailor declared that he knew nothing of schools and would take no part in the discussion  there had in truth been high words between the brothers each accusing the other of going the way to ruin their nephew ending by the captains exclaiming well i wash my hands of it  i cant flatter a foolish woman into spoiling poor lucillas son  if i am not to do what i think right by him i shall get out of sight of it all  his prospects kit how often i have told you it is our duty to consider his prospects  hang his prospects  a handsome heiress under forty  how can you be such an ass charles  he ought to be able to make an independent fortune before he could stand in her shoes if he were ever to do so which she declares he never will  yes you may look knowing if you will but she is no such fool in some things and depend upon it she will make a principle of leaving her property in the right channel and be that as it may i warn you that you cant do this lad a worse mischief than by putting any such notion into his head if it be not there already theres not a more deplorable condition in the world than to be always dangling after an estate never knowing if it is to be your own or not and most likely to be disappointed at last and to do miss charlecote justice she is perfectly aware of that and it will not be her fault if he have any false expectations  so if you feed him with them it will all be your fault and thats the last i mean to say about him  captain charteris was not aware of a colloquy in which owen had a share  this lucky fellow said the young lifeguardsman he is as good as an eldest sonfamous shooting countycapital welltimbered estate  no charles said owen my cousin honor always says i am nothing like an eldest son for there are nearer relations  oh ha said charles with a wink of superior wisdom we understand that  she knows how to keep you on your good behaviour  why but for cutting you out i would even make up to her myselffinelooking comely woman and wellpreservedand only the women quarrel with that splendid hair  never mind my boy i dont mean it  i wouldnt stand in your light  as if honor would have you cried owen in fierce scorn  charles charteris and his companions with loud laughter insisted on the reasons  because cried the boy with flashing looks she would not be ridiculous and you are  he paused but they held him fast and insisted on hearing what charles was  not a good churchman he finally pronounced  yes you may laugh at me but honor shant be laughed at  possibly owens views at present were that not to be a good churchman was synonymous with all imaginable evil and that he had put it in a delicate manner  whether he heard the last of it for the rest of his visit may be imagined  and poor boy though he was strong and spirited enough with his own contemporaries there was no dealing with the fullfledged soldier  nor when conversation turned to what we did at hiltonbury was it possible always to disclaim standing in the same relation to the holt as did charles to castle blanch nay a certain importance seemed to attach to such an assumption of dignity of which owen was not loth to avail himself in his disregarded condition     part ii   chapter i       we hold our greyhound in our hand        our falcon on our glove     but where shall we find leash or band        for dame that loves to rovescott  a june evening shed a slanting light over the greensward of hiltonbury holt and made the western windows glisten like diamonds as honora charlecote slowly walked homewards to her solitary evening meal alone except for the nearly blind old pointer who laid his grizzled muzzle upon her knees gazing wistfully into her face as seating herself upon the step of the sundial she fondled his smooth depressed black head  poor ponto she said we are grown old together  our young ones are all gone  grown old  less old in proportion than pontostill in full vigour of mind and body but old in disenchantment and not without the traces of her fortyseven years  the auburn hair was still in rich masses of curl only on close inspection were silver threads to be detected the cheek was paler the brow worn and the gravely handsome dress was chosen to suit the representative of the charlecotes not with regard to lingering youthfulness  the slow movement subdued tone and downcast eye had an air of habitual dejection and patience as though disappointment had gone deeper or solitude were telling more on the spirits than any past blow had done  she saw the preparations for her tea going on within the window but ere going indoors she took out and reread two letters  the first was in the irregular decided characters affected by young ladies in the reaction from their grandmothers pointed illegibilities and bore a scroll at the top with the word cilly in old english letters of bright blue                                                 lowndes square june 14th      my dear honormany thanks for wishing for your willothwisp     again but it is going to dance off in another direction  rashe and     i are bound to the west of ireland as soon as charless inauguration     is over at castle blanch an odd jumble of festivities it is to be     but lolly is just cockney enough to be determinedly rural and     theres sure to be some fun to be got out of it besides i am     pacified by having my special darling edna murrell the lovely     schoolmistress at wrapworth to sing to them  how mr calthorp will     admire her as long as he thinks she is italian  it will be hard if     i cant get a rise out of some of them  this being the case i have     not a moment for coming home but i send some contributions for the     prizegiving some stunning articles from the lowther arcade  the     guttapercha face is for billy harrison whether in disgrace or     not  he deserves compensation for his many weary hours of sunday     school and it may suggest a new art for beguiling the time  mind     you tell him it is from me with my love and bestow the rest on all     the chief reprobates  i wish i could see them but you have no loss     you know how unedifying i am  kiss ponto for me and ask robin for     his commands to connaught  i know his sulkiness will transpire     through phoebe  love to that dear little cinderella and tell her     mamma and juliana that if she does not come out this winter mrs     fulmort shall have no peace and juliana no partners  please to look     in my room for my great nailed boots and hedginggloves also for the     pigs wool in the lefthand drawer of the cabinet and send them to     me before the end of next week  owen would give his ears to come     with us but gentlemen would only obstruct irish chivalry i am only     afraid there is no hope of a faction fight  mr saville called     yesterday so i made him dine here and sung him into raptures  what     a dear old don he is                                     your affectionate cousin      cilly  the second letter stood thus                                               farrances hotel june 14th      my dear miss charlecotei have seen lawrence on your business and     he will prepare the leases for your signature  he suggests that it     might be more satisfactory to wait in case you should be coming to     town so that you might have a personal meeting with the parties but     this will be for you to determine  i came up from  college on     wednesday having much enjoyed my visit  oxford is in many respects     a changed place but as long as our old head remains to us i am sure     of a gratifying welcome and i saw many old friends  i exchanged     cards with owen sandbrook but only saw him as we met in the street     and a very finelooking youth he is a perfect hercules and the     champion of his college in all feats of strength likely too to     stand well in the class list  his costume was not what we should     once have considered academical but his is a daring set     intellectual as well as bodily and the clever young men of the     present day are not what they were in my time  it is gratifying to     hear how warmly and affectionately he talks of you  i do not know     how far you have undertaken the supplies but i give you a hint that     a warning on that subject might not be inappropriate unless they     have come into some great accession of fortune on their uncles     death  i ventured to call upon the young lady in lowndes square and     was most graciously received and asked to dinner by the young mrs     charteris  it was a most recherche dinner in the new italian     fashion which does not quite approve itself to me  regardless of     expense seems to be the family motto  your pupil sings better than     ever and knew how to keep her hold of my heart though i suspected     her of patronizing the old parson to pique her more brilliant     admirers whom she possesses in plenty and no wonder for she is     pretty enough to turn any mans head and shows to great advantage     beside her cousin miss charteris  i hope you will be able to     prevent the cousins from really undertaking the wild plan of     travelling alone in ireland for the sake they say of     salmonfishing  i should have thought them not in earnest but girls     are as much altered as boys from the days of my experience and     brothers too for mr charteris seemed to view the scheme very     coolly but as i told my friend lucilla i hope you will bring her     to reason  i hope your haycrop promises favourably                                         yours sincerely      w saville  no wonder that these letters made loneliness more lonely  oh that horatia exclaimed she almost aloud  oh that captain charteris were available  no one else ever had any real power with lucy it was an unlucky day when he saw that colonial young lady and settled down in vancouvers island  and yet how i used to wish him away with the surly independence he was always infusing into owen  wanting to take him out there indeed  and yet and yeti sometimes doubt whether i did right to set my personal influence over my dear affectionate boy so much in opposition to his unclemr charteris was on my side though  and i always took care to have it clearly understood that it was his education alone that i undertook  what can mr saville meanthe supplies  owen knows what he has to trust to but i can talk to him  a daring setyes everything appears daring to an oldworld man like mr saville  i am sure of my owen with our happy home sundays  i know i am his sweet honey still  and yetthen hastily turning from that dubious and yetowen is the only chance for his sister  she does care for him and he will view this mad scheme in the right light  shall i meet him at the beginning of the vacation and see what he can do with lucy mr saville thinks i ought to be in london and i think i might be useful to the parsonses  i suppose i must but it is a heartache to be at st wulstans  one is used to it here and there are the poor people and the farm and the gardenyes and those dear nightingalesand you poor ponto  one is used to it here but st wulstans is a fresh pain and so is coming back  but if it be in the way of right and to save poor lucy it must be and it is what life is made of  it is a following of the funeral of the hopes that sprang up after my springtime  is it my chastisement or is it my training  alas maybe i took those children more for myself than for dutys sake  may it all be for their true good in the end whatever it may be with me  and now i will not dream  it is of no use save to unnerve me  let me go to my book  it must be a story tonight  i cannot fix my attention yet  as she rose however her face brightened at the sight of two advancing figures and she went forward to meet them  one was a long looselylimbed youth of twoandtwenty with broad shoulders a heavy overhanging brow dark gray serious eyes and a mouth scarcely curved and so fast shut as to disclose hardly any lip  the hair was dark and lank the air was of ungainly force that had not yet found its purpose and therefore was not at ease and but for the educated cast of countenance he would have had a peasant look in the brown homely undress garb which to most youths of his age would have been becoming  with him was a girl tall slim and lightly made though of nicely rounded figure  in height she looked like seventeen but her dress was more childish than usual at that age and the contour of her smooth cheeks and short rounded chin her long neck her happy blue eyes fully opened like those of a child her fair rosy skin and fresh simple air might almost have belonged to seven years old and there was all the earnestness innocence and careless ease of childhood in her movements and gestures as she sprang forward to meet miss charlecote exclaiming robin said i might come  and very right of him  you are both come to tea she added in affirmative interrogation as she shook hands with the young man  no thank you he answered at least i only brought phoebe having rescued her from miss fennimores clutches  i must be at dinner  but i will come again for her  and he yawned wearily  i will drive her back you are tired  no he said  at least the walk is one of the few tolerable things there is  ill come as soon as i can escape phoebe  past seveni must go  cant you stay  i could find some food for you  no thank you he still said i do not know whether mervyn will come home and there must not be too many empty chairs  goodbye and he walked off with long strides but with stooping shoulders and an air of dejection almost amounting to discontent  poor robin said honora i wish he could have stayed  he would have liked it very much said phoebe casting wistful glances toward him  what a pity he did not give notice of his intentions at home  he never will  he particularly dislikes  what as phoebe paused and coloured  saying anything to anybody she answered with a little smile  he cannot endure remarks  i am a very sober old body for a visit to me to be the occasion of remarks said honor laughing more merrily than perhaps robert himself could have done but phoebe answered with grave straightforward sincerity yes but he did not know if lucy might not be come home  honora sighed but playfully said in which case he would have stayed  no said the still grave girl he would have been still less likely to do so  ah the remarks would have been more pointed  but he has brought you at any rate and that is something  how did he achieve it  miss fennimore is really quite ready to be kind said phoebe earnestly with an air of defence whenever we have finished all that we have to do  and when is that asked honor smiling  now for once answered phoebe with a bright arch look  yes i sometimes can and so does bertha when she tries and indeed miss charlecote i do like miss fennimore she never is hard upon poor maria no governess we ever had made her cry so seldom  miss charlecote only said it was a comfort  within herself she hoped that for marias peace and that of all concerned her deficiency might become an acknowledged fact  she saw that the sparing marias tears was such a boon to phoebe as to make her forgive all overtasking of herself  so you get on better she said  much better than robin chooses to believe we do said phoebe smiling perhaps it seemed hard at first but it is comfortable to be made to do everything thoroughly and to be shown a better best than we had ever thought of  i think it ought to be a help in doing the duty of all ones life in a thorough way  all that thou hast to do said honor smiling the weekday side of the fourth commandment  yes that is just the reason why i like it said phoebe with bright gladness in her countenance  but is that the motive miss fennimore puts before you said honor a little ironically  she does not say so answered phoebe  she says that she never interferes with her pupils religious tenets  but indeed i do not think she teaches us anything wrong and there is always robert to ask  this passed as the two ladies were entering the house and preparing for the evening meal  the table was placed in the bay of the open window and looked very inviting the little silver teapot steaming beside the two quaint china cups the small crisp twists of bread the butter cool in iceplant leaves and some fresh fruit blushing in a pretty basket the holt was a region of paradise to phoebe fulmort and glee shone upon her sweet face though it was very quiet enjoyment as the summer breeze played softly round her cheeks and danced with a merry little spiral that had detached itself from her glossy folds of light hair  how delicious she said  how sweet the honeysuckle is dear old thing  you say you have known it all your life and yet it is fresh as ever  it is a little like you phoebe said honor smiling  what because it is not exactly a pretty flower  partly and i could tell you of a few other likenesses such as your being roberts woodbine yet with a sort of clinging freedom  yes and for the qualities you share with the willow ready to give thanks and live on the least that heaven may give  but i dont live on the least that heaven may give said phoebe in such wonder that honor smiled at the justice of her simile without impressing it upon phoebe only asking  is the french journey fixed upon phoebe  yes they start this day fortnight  theynot you  no there would be no room for me with a small sigh  how can that be  who is going  papa mamma two sisters  mervyn added phoebe the courier and the two maids  two maids  impossible  it is always uncomfortable if mamma and my sisters have only one between them said phoebe in her tone of perfect acquiescence and conviction and as her friend could not restrain a gesture of indignation she added eagerlybut indeed it is not only for that reason but miss fennimore says i am not formed enough to profit by foreign travel  she wants you to finish smiths wealth of nations eh  it might be a pity to go away and lose so much of her teaching said phoebe with persevering contentment  i dare say they will go abroad again and perhaps i shall never have so much time for learning  but miss charlecote is lucilla coming home for the horticultural show  i am afraid not my dear  i think i shall go to london to see about her among other things  the charterises seem to have quite taken possession of her ever since she went to be her cousin carolines bridesmaid and i must try to put in my claim  ah  robin so much wished to have seen her sighed phoebe  he says he cannot settle to anything  without seeing her said honor amused though not without pain  yes said phoebe he has thought so much about lucilla  and he tells you  yes in a voice expressing of course while the frank clear eyes turned full on miss charlecote with such honest seriousness that she thought phoebes charm as a confidante might be this absence of romantic consciousness and she knew of old that when robert wanted her opinion or counsel he spared his own embarrassment by seeking it through his favourite sister  miss charlecotes influence had done as much for robert as he had done for phoebe and phoebe had become his medium of communication with her in all matters of near and delicate interest  she was not surprised when the maiden proceededpapa wants robin to attend to the office while he is away  indeed  does robin like it  he would not mind it for a time but papa wants him besides to take to the business in earnest  you know my greatuncle robert mervyn left robert all his fortune quite in his own hands and papa says that if he were to put that into the distillery it would do the business great good and that robert would be one of the richest men in england in ten years time  but that would be a complete change in his views exclaimed honor unable to conceal her disapproval and consternation  just so answered phoebe and that is the reason why he wants to see lucy  she always declared that she could not bear people in business and we always thought of him as likely to be a clergyman but on the other hand she has become used to london society and it is only by his joining in the distillery that he could give her what she is accustomed to and that is the reason he is anxious to see her  so lucy is to decide his fate said honora  i am almost sorry to hear it  surely he has never spoken to her  he never does speak said phoebe with the calm gravity of simplicity which was like a halo of dignity  there is no need of speaking lucilla knows how he feels as well as she knows that she breathes the air  and regards it as little perhaps thought honor sadly  poor robin she said i suppose he had better get his mind settled but indeed it is a fearful responsibility for my poor foolish lucy and but for the fear of grieving phoebe she would have added that such a purpose as that of entering holy orders ought not to have been made dependent upon the fancy of a girl  possibly her expression betrayed her sentiments for phoebe answeredthere can be no doubt that lucy will set him at rest  i am certain that she would be shocked at the notion that her tastes were making him doubt whether to be a clergyman  i hope so  i trust so said honora almost mournfully  it may be very good for her as i believe it is for every woman of any soundness to be taught that her follies tell upon mans greater aims and purposes it may be wholesome for her and a check but  phoebe wondered that her friend paused and looked so sad  oh phoebe said honora after a moments silence speaking fervently if you can in any way do so warn your brother against making an idol let nothing come between him and the direct devotion of will and affection to the higher service  if he decide on the one or the other let it be from duty not with respect to anything else  i do not suppose it is of any use to warn him she added with the tears in her eyes every one sets the whole soul upon some one object not the right and then comes the shipwreck  dear robin said phoebe  he is so good  i am sure he always thinks first of what is right  but i think i see what you mean  if he undertake the business it should be as a matter of obedience to papa not to keep lucy in the great world  and indeed i do not think my father does care much only he would like the additional capital and robert is so much more steady than mervyn that he would be more useful perhaps it would make him more important at home no one there has any interest in common with him and i think that moves him a little but after all those do not seem reasons for not giving himself to gods service she finished reverently and considerately  no indeed cried miss charlecote  then you think he ought not to change his mind  you have thought so all along smiled honor  i did not like it said phoebe but i did not know if i were right  i did tell him that i really believed lucy would think the more highly of him if he settled for himself without reference to her  you did  you were a capital little adviser phoebe  a woman worthy to be loved at all had always rather be set second instead of first      i could not love thee dear so much     loved i not honour more  that is the true spirit and i am glad you judged lucy to be capable of it  keep your brother up to that and all may be well  i believe robert knows it all the time said phoebe  he always is right at the bottom but his feelings get so much tried that he does not know how to bear it  i hope lucy will be kind to him if they meet in london for he has been so much harassed that he wants some comfort from her  if she would only be in earnest  does he go to london at all events  he has promised to attend to the office in great whittingtonstreet for a month by way of experiment  ill tell you what phoebe cried honora radiantly you and i will go too  you shall come with me to woolstonelane and robin shall be with us every day and we will try and make this silly lucy into a rational being  oh miss charlecote thank youthank you  the quiet girls face and neck were all one crimson glow of delight  if you can sleep in a little brown cupboard of a room in the very core of the citys heart  delightful  i have so wished to see that house  owen has told me such things about it  oh thank you miss charlecote  have you ever seen anything in london  never  we hardly ever go with the rest and if we do we only walk in the square  what a holiday it will be  we will see everything and do it justice  ill get an order for the printroom at the british museum  i day say robin never saw it either and what a treat it will be to take you to the egyptian gallery cried honora excited into looking at the expedition in the light of a party of pleasure as she saw happiness beaming in the young face opposite  they built up their schemes in the open window pausing to listen to the nightingales who having ceased for two hours apparently for supper were now in full song echoing each other in all the woods of hiltonbury casting over it a network of sweet melody  honora was inclined to regret leaving them in their glory but phoebe with the world before her was too honest to profess poetry which she did not feel  nightingales were all very well in their place but the first real sight of london was more  the lamp came in and phoebe held out her hands for something to do and was instantly provided with a childs frock while miss charlecote read to her one of fouques shorter tales by way of supplying the element of chivalrous imagination which was wanting in the beauchamp system of education  so warm was the evening that the window remained open until ponto erected his crest as a footfall came steadily along nearer and nearer uplifting one of his pendant lips he gave a low growl through his blunted teeth and listened again but apparently satisfied that the step was familiar he replaced his head on his crossed paws and presently robert fulmorts head and the upper part of his person in correct evening costume were thrust in at the window the moonlight making his face look very white as he said come phoebe make haste it is very late  is it cried phoebe springing up i thought i had only been here an hour  three at least said robert yawning six by my feelings  i could not get away for mr crabbe stayed to dinner mervyn absented himself and my father went to sleep  robin only think miss charlecote is so kind as to say she will take me to london  it is very kind said robert warmly his weary face and voice suddenly relieved  i shall be delighted to have a companion said honora and i reckon upon you too robin whenever you can spare time from your work  come in and let us talk it over  thank you i cant  the dragon will fall on phoebe if i keep her out too late  be quick phoebe  while his sister went to fetch her hat he put his elbows on the sill and leaning into the room said thank you again it will be a wonderful treat to her and she has never had one in her life  i was in hopes she would have gone to germany  it is perfectly abominable  it is all the others doing  they know no one would look at them a second time if anything so much younger and pleasanter was by  they think her coming out would make them look older i know it would make them look crosser  laughing was the only way to treat this tirade knowing as honor did that there was but too much truth in it  she said however yet one could hardly wish phoebe other than she is  the rosebud keeps its charm longer in the shade  i like justice quoth robert  and she continued i really think that she is much benefited by this formidable governess  accuracy and solidity and clearness of head are worth cultivating  nasty latitudinarian piece of machinery said robert with his fingers over his mouth like a sulky child  maybe so but you guard phoebe and she guards bertha and whatever your sense of injustice may be this surely is a better school for her than gaieties as yet  it will be a more intolerable shame than ever if they will not let her go with you  too intolerable to be expected smiled honora  i shall come and beg for her tomorrow and i do not believe i shall be disappointed  she spoke with the security of one not in the habit of having her patronage obstructed by relations and phoebe coming down with renewed thanks the brother and sister started on their way home in the moonlightthe one plodding on moodily the other unable to repress her glee bounding on in a succession of little skips and pirouetting round to clap her hands and exclaim oh robin is it not delightful  if they will let you go said he too desponding for hope  do you think they will not said phoebe with slower and graver steps do you really think so  but no  it cant lead to coming out and i know they like me to be happy when it interferes with nobody  great generosity said robert dryly  oh but robin you know elder ones come first  a truth we are not likely to forget said robert  i wish my uncle had been sensible of it  that legacy of his stands between mervyn and me and will never do me any good  i dont understand said phoebe mervyn has always been completely the eldest son  ay returned robert and with the tastes of an eldest son  his allowance does not suffice for them and he does not like to see me independent  if my uncle had only been contented to let us share and share alike then my father would have had no interest in drawing me into the precious gin and brandy manufacture  you did not think he meant to make it a matter of obedience said phoebe  no he could hardly do that after the way he has brought me up and what we have been taught all our lives about liberty of the individual absence of control and the like jargon  then you are not obliged  he made no answer and they walked on in silence across the silvery lawn the maythorns shining out like flaked towers of snow in the moonlight and casting abysslike shadows the sky of the most deep and intense blue and the carols of the nightingales ringing around them  robert paused when he had passed through the gate leading into the dark path downhill through the wood and setting his elbows on it leant over it and looked back at the still and beautiful scene in all the white mystery of moonlight enhanced by the whiteblossomed trees and the soft outlines of slumbering sheep  one of the birds in a bush close to them began prolonging its drawnin notes in a continuous prelude then breaking forth into a varied complex warbling so wondrous that there was no moving till the creature paused  it seemed to have been a song of peace to robert for he gave a long but much softer sigh and pushed back his hat saying all good things dwell on the holt side of the boundary  a sort of sunday world said phoebe  yes after this wood one is in another atmosphere  yet you have carried your cares there poor robin  so one does into sunday but to get another light thrown on them  the holt has been the blessing of my lifeof both our lives phoebe  she responded with all her heart  yes it has made everything happier at home and everywhere else  i never can think why lucilla is not more fond of it  you are mistaken exclaimed robert she loves no place so well but you dont consider what claims her relations have upon her  that cousin horatia to whom she is so much attached losing both her parents how could she do otherwise than be with her  miss charteris does not seem to be in great trouble now said phoebe  you do not consider you have never seen grief and you do not know how much more a sympathizing friend is needed when the world supposes the sorrow to be over and ordinary habits to be resumed  phoebe was willing to believe him right though considering that horatia charteris lived with her brother and his wife she could hardly be as lonely as miss charlecote  we shall see lucy in london she said  robert again sighed heavily  then it will be over he said  did you say anything there he pursued as they plunged into the dark shadows of the woodland path more congenial to the subject than the light  yes i did said phoebe  and she thought me a weak unworthy wretch for ever dreaming of swerving from my original path  no said phoebe not if it were your duty  i tell you phoebe it is as much my duty to consult lucillas happiness as if any words had passed between us  i have never pledged myself to take orders  it has been only a wish not a vocation and if she have become averse to the prospect of a quiet country life it would not be treating her fairly not to give her the choice of comparative wealth though procured by means her family might despise  yes i knew you would put right and duty first and i suppose by doing so you make it certain to end rightly one way or other  a very few years and i could realize as much as this calthorp the millionaire whom they talk of as being so often at the charterises  it will not be so said phoebe  i know what she will say and as robert looked anxiously at her she continued  she will say she never dreamt of your being turned from anything so great by any fancies she has seemed to have  she will say so more strongly for you know her father was a clergyman and miss charlecote brought her up  phoebes certainty made robert catch something of her hopes  in that case he said matters might be soon settled  this fortune of mine would be no misfortune then and probably phoebe my sisters would have no objection to your being happy with us  as soon as you could get a curacy  oh how delightful and maria and bertha would come too  robert held his peace not certain whether lucilla would consider maria an embellishment to his ideal parsonage but they talked on with cheerful schemes while descending through the wood unlocking a gate that formed the boundary between the holt and the beauchamp properties crossing a field or two and then coming out into the park  presently they were in sight of the house rising darkly before them with many lights shining in the windows behind the blinds  they are all gone upstairs said phoebe dismayed  how late it must be  theres a light in the smokingroom said robert we can get in that way  no no  mervyn may have some one with him  come in quietly by the servants entrance  no danger that people would not be on foot there  as the brother and sister moved along the long stone passage fringed with labelled bells one open door showed two weary maidens still toiling over the plates of the late dinner and another standing ajar revealed various menservants regaling themselves and words and tones caught roberts ear making his brow lower with sudden pain  phoebe was proceeding to mount the stone stairs when a rustling and chattering as of maids descending caused her and her brother to stand aside to make way and down came a pair of heads and candles together over a green bandbox and then voices in vulgar tones half suppressed i couldnt venture it not with miss julianabut miss fulmortshe never looks over her bills nor knows what is in her drawersi told her it was faded when she had never worn it once  and tittering they passed by the brother and sister who were still unseen but robert heaved a sigh and murmured miserable work somewhat to his sisters surprise for to her the great illregulated household was an unquestioned institution and she did not expect him to bestow so much compassion on augustas discarded bonnet  at the top of the steps they opened a door and entered a great wide hall  all was exceedingly still  a gaslight was burning over the fireplace but the corners were in gloom and the coats and cloaks looked like human figures in the distance  phoebe waited while robert lighted her candle for her  albeit she was not nervous she started when a door was sharply pushed open and another figure appeared but it was nothing worse than her brother mervyn in easy costume and redolent of tobacco  about three years older than robert he was more neatly though not so strongly made shorter and with more regular features but much less countenance  if the younger brother had a worn and dejected aspect the elder except in moments of excitement looked bored  it was as if robert really had the advantage of him in knowing what to be out of spirits about  oh its you is it said he coming forward with a sauntering scuffling movement in his slippers  you larking phoebe  what next  i have been drinking tea with miss charlecote explained phoebe  mervyn slightly shrugged his shoulders murmuring something about lively pastime  i could not fetch her sooner said robert for my father went to sleep and no one chose to be at the pains of entertaining crabbe  aya prevision of his staying to dinner made me stay and dine with the th mess  very sagaciouseh pheebe said he turning as if he liked to look into her fresh face  too sagacious said she smiling for you left him all to robert  manner and look expressed that this was a matter of no concern and he said ungraciously nobody detained robert it was his own concern  respect to my father and his guests said robert with downright gravity that gave it the effect of a reproach  mervyn only raised his shoulders up to his ears in contempt took up his candle and wished phoebe good night  poor mervyn fulmort  discontent had been his lifelong comrade  he detested his fathers occupation as galling to family pride yet was greedy both of the profits and the management  he hated country business and country life yet chafed at not having the control of his mothers estate and grumbled at all his fathers measures  what should an old distiller know of landed property  in fact he saw the same difference between himself and his father as did the ungracious plantagenet between the son of a count and the son of a king and for want of provencal troubadours with whom to rebel he supplied their place by the turf and the billiardtable  at present he was expiating some heavy debts by a forced residence with his parents and unwilling attention to the office a most distasteful position which he never attempted to improve and which permitted him both the tedium of idleness and complaints against all the employment to which he was necessitated  the illmanaged brothers were just nearly enough of an age for rivalry and had never loved one another even as children  roberts steadiness had been made a reproach to mervyn and his grave rather surly character had never been conciliating  the independence left to the younger brother by their mothers relative was grudged by the elder as an injury to himself and it was one of the misfortunes of beauchamp that the two sons had never been upon happy terms together  indeed save that roberts right principles and silent habits hindered him from readily giving or taking offence there might have been positive outbreaks of a very unbrotherly nature    chapter ii       enough of science and of art        close up those barren leaves     come forth and bring with you a heart        that watches and receiveswordsworth  halfpast five miss phoebe  thank you and before her eyes were open phoebe was on the floor  six was the regulation hour  systematic education had discovered that halfanhour was the maximum allowable for morning toilette and at halfpast six the young ladies must present themselves in the schoolroom  the bible prayer book and daily meditations could have been seldom touched had not phoebe ever since robert had impressed on her the duty of such constant study made an arrangement for gaining an extra halfhour  cold mornings and youthful sleepiness had received a daily defeat and mayhap it was such a course of victory that made her frank eyes so blithesome and her step so free and light  that bright scheme too shone before her as such a secret of glad hope that knowing how uncertain were her chances of pleasure she prayed that she might not set her heart on it  it was no trifle to her and her simple spirit ventured to lay her wishes before her loving father in heaven and entreat that she might not be denied if it were right for her and would be better for robert or if not that she might be good under the disappointment  her orisons sent her forth all brightness with her small head raised like that of a young fawn her fresh lips parted by an incipient smile of hope and her cheeks in a rosy glow of health a very hebe as mr saville had once called her  such a morning face as hers was not always met by miss fennimore who herself able to exist on five hours sleep had no mercy on that of her pupils and she rewarded phoebes smiling goodmorrow with this is better than i expected you returned home so late  robert could not come for me early said phoebe  how did you spend the evening  miss charlecote read aloud to me  it was a delightful german story  miss charlecote is a very wellinformed person and i am glad the time was not absolutely lost  i hope you observed the condensation of the vapours on your way home  robert was talking to me and the nightingales were singing  it is a pity said miss fennimore not unkindly that you should not cultivate the habit of observation  women can seldom theorize but they should always observe facts as these are the very groundwork of discovery and such a rare opportunity as a walk at night should not be neglected  it was no use to plead that this was all very well when there was no brother robert with his destiny in the scales so phoebe made a meek assent and moved to the piano suppressing a sigh as miss fennimore set off on a domiciliary visit to the other sisters  mr fulmort liked his establishment to prove his consequence and to the old family mansion of the mervyns he had added a whole wing for the educational department  above there was a passage with pretty little bedrooms opening from it below there were two goodsized rooms with their own door opening into the garden  the elder ones had long ago deserted it and so completely shut off was it from the rest of the house that the governess and her pupils were as secluded as though in a separate dwelling  the schoolroom was no repulsivelooking abode it was furnished almost well enough for a drawingroom and only the easels globes and desks the crayon studies on the walls and a formidable timetable showed its real destination  the window looked out into a square parterre shut in with tall laurel hedges and filled with the gayest and sweetest blossoms  it was mrs fulmorts garden for cut flowers supplying the bouquets that decked her tables or were carried to wither at balls and there were three long narrow beds that phoebe and her younger sisters still called theirs and loved with the pride of property but indeed the bright carpeting of the whole garden was something especially their own rejoicing their eyes and unvalued by the rest of the house  on the like liberal scale were the salaries of the educators  governesses were judged according to their demands and the highest bidder was supposed to understand her own claims best  miss fennimore was a finishing governess of the highest order thinking it an insult to be offered a pupil below her teens or to lose one till nearly beyond them nor was she far from being the treasure that mrs fulmort pronounced her in gratitude for the absence of all the explosions produced by the various imperfections of her predecessors  a highly able woman and perfectly sincere she possessed the qualities of a ruler and had long experience in the art  her discipline was perfect in machinery and her instructions admirably complete  no one could look at her keen sensible selfpossessed countenance her decided mouth ever busy hands and unpretending but wellchosen style of dress without seeing that her energy and intelligence were of a high order and there was principle likewise though no one ever quite penetrated to the foundation of it  certainly she was not an irreligious person she conformed as she said to the habits of each family she lived with and she highly estimated moral perfections  now and then a degree of scorn for the narrowness of dogma would appear in reading history but in general she was understood to have opinions which she did not obtrude  as a teacher she was excellent but her own strong conformation prevented her from understanding that young girls were incapable of such tension of intellect as an enthusiastic scholar of fortytwo and that what was sport to her was toil to a mind unaccustomed to constant attention change of labour is not rest unless it be through gratification of the will  her very best pupil she had killed  finding a very sharp sword in a very frail scabbard she had whetted the one and worn down the other by every stimulus in her power till a jury of physicians might have found her guilty of manslaughter but perfectly unconscious of her own agency in causing the atrophy her dear anna webster lived foremost in her affections the model for every subsequent pupil  she seldom remained more than two years in a family  sometimes the young brains were overexcited more often they fell into a dreary state of drilled diligence but she was too much absorbed in the studies to look close into the human beings and marvelled when the fathers and mothers were blind enough to part with her on the plea of health and need of change  on the whole she had never liked any of her charges since the renowned anna webster so well as phoebe fulmort although her abilities did not rise above the very fair and she was apt to be bewildered in metaphysics and political economy but then she had none of the eccentricities of will and temper of miss fennimores clever girls nor was she like most goodhumoured ones recklessly insouciante  her only drawback in the governesss eyes was that she never seemed desirous of going beyond what was daily required of hereach study was a duty and not a subject of zeal  presently miss fennimore came back followed by the two sisters neither of them in the best of tempers  maria a stout clumsilymade girl of fifteen had the same complexion and open eyes as phoebe but her colouring was muddled the gaze fullorbed and vacant and the lips always pouting were just now swelled with the vexation that filled her prominent eyelids with tears  bertha two years younger looked as if nature had designed her for a boy and the change into a girl was not yet decided  she too was very like maria but marias open nostrils were in her a droll retrousse puggish little nose her chin had a boyish squareness and decision her round cheeks had two comical dimples her eyes were either stretched in defiance or narrowed up with fun and a slight cast in one gave a peculiar archness and character to her face her skin face hands and all were uniformly pinky her hair in such obstinate yellow curls that it was to be hoped for her sake that the fashion of being crepe might continue  the brow lowered in petulance and as she kissed phoebe she muttered in her ear a vituperation of the governess in schoolroom patois then began tossing the lessonbooks in the air and catching them again as a preliminary to finding the places thus drawing on herself a reproof in german  french and german were alternately spoken in lesson hours by phoebe and bertha who had lived with foreign servants from infancy but poor maria had not the faculty of keeping the tongues distinct and corrections only terrified her into confusion worse confounded until miss fennimore had in despair decided that english was the best alternative  phoebe practised vigorously  aware that nothing pleasant was passing and that be it what it might she could do no good she was glad to stop her ears with her music until eight oclock brought a pause in the shape of breakfast  formerly the schoolroom party had joined the family meal but since the two elder girls had been out and mervyns friends had been often in the house it had been decided that the home circle was too numerous and what had once been the playroom was allotted to be the eatingroom of the younger ones without passing the red door on the other side of which lay the world  breakfast was announced by the schoolroom maid and miss fennimore rose no sooner was her back turned than bertha indulged in a tremendous writhing yawn wriggling in her chair and clenching both fat fists as she threatened with each at her governesss retreating figure so ludicrously that phoebe smiled while she shook her head and an explosive giggle came from maria causing the lady to turn and behold miss bertha demure as ever and a look of disconsolate weariness fast settling down on each of the two young faces  the unbroken routine pressed heavily at those fit moments for family greetings and for relaxation and even phoebe would gladly have been spared the german account of the holt and of miss charlecotes book for which she was called upon  bertha meanwhile to whom waggishness was existence was carrying on a silent drama on her plate her roll being a quarry and her knife the workmen attacking it  now she undermined now acted an explosion with uplifted eyebrows and an indicated puff with her lips with constant dumbshow directed to maria who without half understanding was in a constant suppressed titter sometimes concealed by her pockethandkerchief  quick as miss fennimore was and often as she frowned on marias outbreaks she never could detect their provocative  overrestraint and want of sympathy were direct instruction in unscrupulous slyness of amusement  a sentence of displeasure on marias illmannered folly was in the act of again filling her eyes with tears when there was a knock at the door and all the faces beamed with glad expectation  it was robert  this was the time of day when he knew miss fennimore could best tolerate him and he seldom failed to make his appearance on his way downstairs the only one of the privileged race who was a wonted object on this side the baize door  phoebe thought he looked more cheerful and indeed gravity could hardly have withstood berthas face as she gave a mischievous tweak to his hair behind under colour of putting her arm round his neck  well curlylocks how much mischief did you do yesterday  id no spirits for mischief she answered with mock pitifulness twinkling up her eyes and rubbing them with her knuckles as if she were crying  you barbarous wretch taking phoebe to feast on strawberries and cream with miss charlecote and leaving poor me to poke in that stupid drawingroom with nothing to do but to count the scollops of mammas flounce  it is your turn  will miss fennimore kindly let you have a walk with me this evening  and me said maria  you of course  may i come for them at five oclock  i can hardly tell what to say about maria  i do not like to disappoint her but she knows that nothing displeases me so much as that illmannered habit of giggling said miss fennimore not without concern  merciful as to marias attainments she was strict as to her manners and was striving to teach her selfrestraint enough to be unobtrusive  poor marias eyes were glassy with tears her chest heaved with sobs and she broke out o pray miss fennimore o pray while all the others interceded for her and bertha well knowing that it was all her fault avoided the humiliation of a confession by the apparent generosity of exclaiming take us both tomorrow instead robin  roberts journey was however fixed for that day and on this plea licence was given for the walk  phoebe smiled congratulation but maria was slow in cheering up and when on returning to the schoolroom the three sisters were left alone together for a few moments she pressed up to phoebes side and said phoebe ive not said my prayers  do you think anything will happen to me  her awfully mysterious tone set bertha laughing  yes maria all the cows in the park will run at you she was beginning when the grave rebuke of phoebes eyes cut her short  how was it my dear asked phoebe tenderly fondling her sister  i was so sleepy and bertha would blow soapbubbles in her hands while we were washing and then miss fennimore came and ive been naughty now and i know i shall go on and then robin wont take me  i will ask miss fennimore to let you go to your room dearest said phoebe  you must not play again in dressing time for theres nothing so sad as to miss our prayers  you are a good girl to care so much  had you time for yours bertha  oh plenty with a toss of her curly head  i dont take ages about things like maria  prayers cannot be hurried said phoebe looking distressed and she was about to remind bertha to whom she spoke in prayer when the child cut her short by the exclamation nonsense maria about being naughty  you know i always make you laugh when i please and that has more to do with it than saying your prayers i fancy  perhaps said phoebe very sadly if you had said yours more in earnest my poor bertha you would either not have made maria laugh or would not have left her to bear all the blame  why do you call me poor exclaimed bertha with a halfoffended halfdiverted look  because i wish so much that you knew better or that i could help you better said phoebe gently  there miss fennimore entered displeased at the english sounds and at finding them all as she thought loitering  phoebe explained marias omission and miss fennimore allowed her five minutes in her own room saying that this must not become a precedent though she did not wish to oppress her conscience  berthas eyes glittered with a certain triumph as she saw that miss fennimore was of her mind and anticipated no consequences from the neglect but only made the concession as to a superstition  without disbelief the child trained only to reason and quick to detect fallacy was blind to all that was not material  and how was the spiritual to be brought before her  phoebe might well sigh as she sat down to her abstract of schlegels lectures  if any one would but teach them she thought but there is no time at all and i myself do not know half so much of those things as one of miss charlecotes lowest classes  phoebe was a little mistaken  an earnest mind taught how to learn with access to the bible and prayer book could gain more from these fountainheads than any external teaching could impart and she could carry her difficulties to robert  still it was out of her power to assist her sisters  surveillance and driving absolutely left no space free from miss fennimores requirements and all that there was to train those young ones in faith was the manner in which it lived and worked in her  nor of this effect could she be conscious  as to dreams or repinings or even listening to her hopes and fears for her project of pleasure they were excluded by the concentrated attention that miss fennimores system enforced  time and capacity were so much on the stretch that the habit of doing what she was doing and nothing else had become second nature to the docile and duteous girl and she had become little sensible to interruptions so she went on with her german her greek and her algebra scarcely hearing the repetitions of the lessons or the counting as miss fennimore presided over marias practice a bit of drudgery detested by the governess but necessarily persevered in for maria loved music and had just voice and ear sufficient to render this single accomplishment not hopeless but a certain want of power of sustained effort made her always break down at the moment she seemed to be doing best  former governesses had lost patience but miss fennimore had early given up the case and never scolded her for her failures she made her attempt less and she was improving more and shedding fewer tears than under any former dynasty even a stern dominion is better for the subjects than an uncertain and weak one regularity gives a sense of reliance and constant occupation leaves so little time for being naughty that bertha herself was getting into training and on the present day her lessons were exemplary always with a view to the promised walk with her brother one of the greatest pleasures ever enjoyed by the denizens of the west wing  phoebes pleasure was less certain and less dependent on her merits yet it invigorated her efforts to do all she had to do with all her might even into the statement of the pros and cons of customs and freetrade which she was required to produce as her mornings exercise  in the midst her ear detected the sound of wheels and her heart throbbed in the conviction that it was miss charlecotes pony carriage nay she found her pen had indited robin would be so glad instead of revenue to the government and while scratching the words out beyond all legibility she blamed herself for betraying such want of selfcommand  no summons came no tidings the wheels went away her heart sank and her spirit revolted against an unfeeling unutterably wearisome captivity but it was only a moments fluttering against the bars the tears were driven back with the thought after all the decision is guided from above  if i stay at home it must be best for me  let me try to be good and she forced her mind back to her exports and her customs  it was such discipline as few girls could have exercised but the conscientious effort was no small assistance in being resigned and in the precious minutes granted in which to prepare herself for dinner she found it the less hard task to part with her anticipations of delight and brace herself to quiet contented duty  the meal was beginning when with a very wide expansion of the door appeared a short consequentiallooking personage of such plump rounded proportions that she seemed ready to burst out of her ridinghabit and of a broad complacent visage somewhat overblooming  it was miss fulmort the eldest of the family a young lady just past thirty a very awful distance from the schoolroom party to whom she nodded with goodnatured condescension saying ah i thought i should find you at dinner im come for something to sustain nature  the riding party are determined to have me with them and they wont wait for luncheon  thank you yes a piece of mutton if there were any under side  how it reminds me of old times  i used so to look forward to never seeing a loin of mutton again  as your chief ambition said miss fennimore who governess as she was could not help being a little satirical especially when berthas eyes twinkled responsively  one does get so tired of mutton and ricepudding answered the less observant miss fulmort who was but dimly conscious of any ones existence save her own and could not have credited a governess laughing at her but really this is not so bad after all for a change and some pale ale  you dont mean that you exist without pale ale  we all drink water by preference said miss fennimore  indeed  miss watson our finishing governess never drank anything but claret and she always had little pates or fish or something because she said her appetite was to be consulted she was so delicate  she was very thin i know and what a figure you have phoebe  i suppose that is water drinking  bridger did say it would reduce me to leave off pale ale but i cant get on without it i get so horridly low  dont you think thats a sign miss fennimore  i beg your pardon a sign of what  that one cant go on without it  miss charlecote said she thought it was all constitution whether one is stout or not and that nothing made much difference when i asked her about german wines  oh augusta has miss charlecote been here this morning exclaimed phoebe  yes she came at twelve oclock and there was i actually pinned down to entertain her for mamma was not come down  so i asked her about those light foreign wines and whether they do really make one thinner you know one always has them at her house  did mamma see her asked poor phoebe anxiously  oh yes she was bent upon it  it was something about you  oh she wants to take you to stay with her in that horrible hole of hers in the cityvery odd of her  what do you advise me to do miss fennimore  do you think those foreign wines would bring me down a little or that they would make me low and sinking  really i have no experience on the subject said miss fennimore loftily  what did mamma say was poor phoebes almost breathless question  oh it makes no difference to mamma phoebes heart bounded but augusta went on she always has her sodawater you know but of course i should take a hamper from bass  i hate being unprovided  but about my going to london humbly murmured phoebe  what did she say considered the elder sister aloud  i dont know im sure  i was not attendingthe heat does make one so sleepybut i know we all wondered she should want you at your age  you know some people take a spoonful of vinegar to fine themselves down and some of those wines are very acid she continued pressing on with her great subject of consultation  if it be an object with you miss fulmort i should recommend the vinegar said miss fennimore  there is nothing like doing a thing outright  and oh how glorious it would be to see her taking it whispered bertha into phoebes ear unheard by augusta who in her satisfied stolidity was declaring no i could not undertake that  i am the worst person in the world for taking anything disagreeable  and having completed her meal which she had contrived to make out of the heart of the joint leaving the others little but fat she walked off to her ride believing that she had done a gracious and condescending action in making conversation with her inferiors of the west wing  yet augusta fulmort might have been good for something if her mind and her affections had not lain fallow ever since she escaped from a series of governesses who taught her selfindulgence by example  i wonder what mamma said exclaimed phoebe in her strong craving for sympathy in her suspense  i am sorry the subject has been brought forward if it is to unsettle you phoebe said miss fennimore not unkindly i regret your being twice disappointed but if your mother should refer it to me as i make no doubt she will i should say that it would be a great pity to break up our course of studies  it would only be for a little while sighed phoebe and miss charlecote is to show me all the museums  i should see more with her than ever i shall when i am come out and i should be with robert  i intended asking permission to take you through a systematic course of lectures and specimens when the family are next in town said miss fennimore  ordinary desultory sightseeing leaves few impressions and though miss charlecote is a superior person her mind is not of a sufficiently scientific turn to make her fully able to direct you  i shall trust to your good sense phoebe for again submitting to defer the pleasure till it can be enhanced  good sense had a task imposed on it for which it was quite inadequate but there was something else in phoebe which could do the work better than her unconvinced reason  even had she been sure of the expediency of being condemned to the schoolroom no good sense would have brought that resolute smile or driven back the dew in her eyes or enabled her voice to say with such sweet meekness very well miss fennimore i dare say it may be right  miss fennimore was far more concerned than if the submission had been grudging  she debated with herself whether she should consider her resolution irrevocable  ten minutes were allowed after dinner in the parterre and these could only be spent under the laurel hedge the sun was far too hot everywhere else  phoebe had here no lack of sympathy but had to restrain bertha who with angry gestures was pronouncing the governess a horrid crosspatch and declaring that no girls ever were used as they were while maria observed that if phoebe went to london she must go too  we shall all go some day said phoebe cheerfully and we shall enjoy it all the more if we are good now  never mind bertha we shall have some nice walks  yes all bothered with botany muttered bertha  i thought at least you would be glad of me said phoebe smiling you who stay at home  to be sure i am said bertha but it is such a shame  i shall tell robin and hell say so too  i shall tell him you nearly cried  dont vex robin said phoebe  when you go out you should set yourself to tell him pleasant things  so im to tell him you wouldnt go on any account  you like your political economy much too well  suppose you say nothing about it said phoebe  make yourself merry with him  thats what youve got to do  he takes you out to entertain you not to worry about grievances  do you never talk about grievances asked bertha twinkling up her eyes  phoebe hesitated  not my own she said because i have not got any  has robert then asked bertha  nobody has grievances who is out of the schoolroom opined maria and as she uttered this profound sentiment the tinkle of miss fennimores little bell warned the sisters to return to the studies which in the heat of summer were pursued in the afternoon that the walk might be taken in the cool of the evening  reading aloud drawing and sensible plain needlework were the avocations till it was time to learn the morrows lessons  phoebe being beyond this latter work drew on and in the intervals of helping maria with her geography had time to prepare such a bright face as might make robert think lightly of her disappointment and not reckon it as another act of tyranny  when he opened the door however there was that in his looks which made her spirits leap up like an elastic spring and his well phoebe was almost triumphant  is itam i was all she could say  has no one thought it worth while to tell you  dont you know interposed bertha you on the other side the red baize door might be all married or dead and buried for aught we should hear but is phoebe to go  i believe so  are you sure asked phoebe afraid yet to hope  yes  my father heard the invitation and said that you were a good girl and deserved a holiday  commendation from that quarter was so rare that excess of gladness made phoebe cast down her eyes and colour intensely a little oppressed by the victory over her governess  but miss fennimore spoke warmly  he cannot think her more deserving than i do  i am rejoiced not to have been consulted for i could hardly have borne to inflict such a mortification on her though these interruptions are contrary to my views  as it is phoebe my dear i wish you joy  thank you phoebe managed to say while the happy tears fairly started in that chilly land the least approach to tenderness was like the gleam in which the hardy woodbine leaflets unfold to sun themselves  thankful for small mercies thought robert looking at her with fond pity but at least the dear child will have one fortnight of a more genial atmosphere and soon maybe i shall transplant her to be lucillas darling as well as mine free from taskwork and doing the labours of love for which she is made  he was quite in spirits and able to reply in kind to the freaks and jokes of his little sister as she started spinning round him like a hummingtop and singing      will you go to the wood robin a bobbin  giving safe vent to an ebullition of spirits that must last her a good while poor little maiden  phoebe took a sober walk with miss fennimore receiving advice on methodically journalizing what she might see and on the scheme of employments which might prevent her visit from being waste of time  the others would have resented the interference with the holiday but phoebe though a little sorry to find that tasks were not to be off her mind was too grateful for miss fennimores cordial consent to entertain any thought except of obedience to the best of her power  miss fennimore was politely summoned to mrs fulmorts dressingroom for the official communication but this day was no exception to the general custom that the red baize door was not passed by the young ladies until their evening appearance in the drawingroom  then the trio descended all alike in white muslin made high and green sashesa dress carefully distinguishing phoebe as not introduced but very becoming to her with the simple folds and the little net ruche suiting admirably the tall rounded slenderness of her shape her long neck and short childish contour of face where there smiled a joy of anticipation almost inappreciable to those who know not what it is to spend day after day with nothing particular to look forward to  very grand was the drawingroom all ambercoloured with satinwood satin and gold and with everything useless and costly encumbering tables that looked as if nothing could ever be done upon them  such a room inspired a sense of being in company and it was no wonder that mrs fulmort and her two elder daughters swept in in as decidedly procession style as if they had formed part of a train of twenty  the star that bestowed three female sovereigns to europe seemed to have had the like influence on hiltonbury parish since both its squires were heiresses  miss mervyn would have been a happier woman had she married a plain country gentleman like those of her own stock instead of giving a county position to a man of lower origin and enormous monied wealth  to live up to the claims of that wealth had been her business ever since and health and enjoyment had been so completely sacrificed to it that for many years past the greater part of her time had been spent in resting and making herself up for her appearance in the evening when she conducted her elder daughters to their gaieties  faded and tallowy in complexion so as to be almost ghastly in her blue brocade and heavy gold ornaments she reclined languidly on a large easychair saying with halfclosed eyes  well phoebe miss fennimore has told you of miss charlecotes invitation  yes mamma  i am very very much obliged  you know you are not to fancy yourself come out said juliana the second sister who had a good tall figure and features and complexion not far from beauty but marred by a certain shrewish tone and air  oh no answered phoebe but with miss charlecote that will make no difference  probably not said juliana for of course you will see nobody but a set of old maids and clergymen and their wives  she need not go far for old maids whispered bertha to maria  pray in which class do you reckon the sandbrooks said phoebe smiling for she chiefly goes to meet them  she may go said juliana scornfully but lucilla sandbrook is far past attending to her  i wonder whether the charterises will take any notice of phoebe exclaimed augusta  my dear said mrs fulmort waking slowly to another idea i will tell boodle to talk towhats your maids nameabout your dresses  oh mamma interposed juliana it will be only poking about the exhibitions with miss charlecote  you may have that plaid silk of mine that i was going to have worn out abroad halfprice for her  bertha fairly made a little stamp at juliana and clenched her fist  if phoebe dreaded anything in the way of dress it was julianas halfprice  my dear your papa would not like her not to be well fitted out said her mother and honora charlecote always has such handsome things  i wish boodle could put mine on like hers  oh very well said juliana rather offended only it should be understood what is to be done if the charterises ask her to any of their parties  there will be such mistakes and confusion if she meets any one we know and you particularly objected to having her brought forward  phoebes eye was a little startled and bertha set her front teeth together on edge and looked viciously at juliana  my dear honora charlecote never goes out said mrs fulmort  if she should you understand phoebe said juliana  coffee came in at the moment and augusta criticized the strength of it which made a diversion during which bertha slipped out of the room with a face replete with mischievous exultation  are not you going to play tonight my dears asked mrs fulmort what was that duet i heard you practising  come juliana said the elder sister i meant to go over it again i am not satisfied with my part  i have to write a note said juliana moving off to another table whereupon phoebe ventured to propose herself as a substitute and was accepted  maria sat entranced with her mouth open and presently mrs fulmort looked up from a kind of doze to ask who was playing  for some moments she had no answer  maria was too much awed for speech in the drawingroom and though bertha had come back she had her back to her mother and did not hear  mrs fulmort exerted herself to sit up and turn her head  was that phoebe she said  you have a clear good touch my dear as they used to say i had when i was at school at bath  play another of your pieces my dear  i am ready now augusta said juliana advancing  little girls were not allowed at the piano when officers might be coming in from the diningroom so marias face became vacant again for julianas music awoke no echoes within her  phoebe beckoned her to a remote ottoman a receptacle for the newspapers of the week and kept her turning over the illustrated news an unfailing resource with her but powerless to occupy bertha after the first saturday and bertha turning a deaf ear to the assurance that there was something very entertaining about a tigerhunt stood solely occupied by eyeing juliana  was she studying comeout life as she watched her sisters surrounded by the gentlemen who presently herded round the piano  it was nearly the moment when the young ones were bound to withdraw when mervyn coming hastily up to their ottoman had almost stumbled over marias foot  beg pardon  oh it was only you  what a cow it is said he tossing over the papers  what are you looking for mervyn asked phoebe  an advertisementbells life for the 3rd  that rascal mears must have taken it  she found it for him and likewise the advertisement which he missing once was giving up in despair  i say he observed while she was searching so you are to chip the shell  im only going to londonim not coming out  gammon he said with an odd wink  you need never go in again like the whatshisname in the fairy tale or you are a sillier child than i take you for  theynodding at the pianoare getting a terrible pair of old cats and we want something young and pretty about  with this unusual compliment phoebe seeing the way clear to the door rose to depart most reluctantly followed by bertha and more willingly by maria who began the moment they were in the hall  phoebe why do they get a couple of terrible old cats  i dont like them  i shall be afraid  mervyn didnt mean began perplexed phoebe cut short by berthas boisterous laughter  oh maria what a goose you are  youll be the death of me some day  why juliana and augusta are the cats themselves oh dear i wanted to kiss mervyn for saying so  oh wasnt it fun  and now mariaoh if i could have stayed a moment longer  bertha bertha not such a noise in the hall  come maria mind you must not tell anybody  bertha come expostulated phoebe trying to drag her sister to the red baize door but bertha stood bending nearly double exaggerating the helplessness of her paroxysms of laughter  well at least the cat will have something to scratch her she gasped out  oh i did so want to stay and see  have you been playing any tricks exclaimed phoebe with consternation as berthas deportment recurred to her  tricksi couldnt help it  oh listen phoebe cried bertha with her wicked look of triumph  i brought home such a lovely stingnettle for miss fennimores peacock caterpillar and when i heard how kind dear juliana was to you about your visit to london i thought she really must have it for a reward so i ran away and slily tucked it into her bouquet and i did so hope she would take it up to fiddle with when the gentlemen talk to her said the elf with an irresistibly comic imitation of julianas manner towards gentlemen  bertha this is beyond began phoebe  didnt you sting your fingers asked maria  bertha stuck out her fat pink paws embellished with sundry white lumps all pleasure said she thinking of the jump juliana will give and how nicely it serves her  phoebe was already on her way back to the drawingrooms bertha sprang after but in vain  never would she have risked the success of her trick could she have guessed that phoebe would have the temerity to return to the company  phoebe glided in without waiting for the sense of awkwardness though she knew she should have to cross the whole room and she durst not ask any one to bring the dangerous bouquet to hernot even roberthe must not be stung in her service  she met her mothers astonished eye as she threaded her way she wound round a group of gentlemen and spied the article of which she was in quest where juliana had laid it down with her gloves on going to the piano  actually she had it  she had seized it unperceived  good little thief it was a most innocent robbery  she crept away with a sense of guilt and desire to elude observation positively starting when she encountered her fathers portly figure in the anteroom  he stopped her with going to bed eh  so miss charlecote has taken a fancy to you has she  it does you credit  what shall you want for the journey  boodle is going to see began phoebe but he interrupted  will fifty do  i will have my daughters well turned out  all to be spent upon yourself mind  why youve not a bit of jewellery on  have you a watch  no papa  robert shall choose one for you then  come to my room any time for the cash and if miss charlecote takes you anywhere among her setgood connections she hasand you want to be rigged out extra send me in the billanything rather than be shabby  thank you papa  then if i am asked out anywhere may i go  why what does the child mean  anywhere that miss charlecote likes to take you of course  only because i am not come out  stuff about coming out  i dont like my girls to be shy and backward theyve a right to show themselves anywhere and you should be going out with us now but somehow your poor mother doesnt like the trouble of such a lot of girls  so dont be shy but make the most of yourself for you wont meet many better endowed nor more highly accomplished  good night and enjoy yourself  palpitating with wonder and pleasure phoebe escaped  such permission overriding all julianas injunctions was worth a few nettle stings and a great fright for phoebe was not philosopher enough in spite of miss fennimoreay and of robertnot to have a keen desire to see a great party  her delay had so much convinced the sisters that her expedition had had some fearful consequences that maria was already crying lest dear phoebe should be in disgrace and bertha had seated herself on the balusters debating with herself whether if phoebe were suspected of the trick a likely story and condemned to lose her visit to london she would confess herself the guilty person  and when phoebe came back too much overcome with delight to do anything but communicate papas goodness and rejoice in the unlimited power of making presents bertha triumphantly insisted on her confessing that it had been a capital thing that the nettles were in julianas nosegay  phoebe shook her head too happy to scold too humble to draw the moral that the surest way to gratification is to remove the thorns from the path of others    chapter iii       she gives thee a garland woven fair        take care     it is a foolscap for thee to wear        beware  beware        trust her not     she is fooling theelongfellow from muller  behold phoebe fulmort seated in a train on the way to london  she was a very pleasant spectacle to miss charlecote opposite to her so peacefully joyous was her face as she sat with the wind breathing in on her in the calm luxury of contemplating the landscape gliding past the windows in all its summer charms and the repose of having no one to hunt her into unvaried rationality  her eye was the first to detect robert in waiting at the terminus but he looked more depressed than ever and scarcely smiled as he handed them to the carriage  get in robert you are coming home with us said honor  you have so much to take i should encumber you  no the sundries go in cabs with the maids  jump in  do your friends arrive tonight  yes but that is no reason you should look so rueful  make the most of phoebe beforehand  besides mr parsons is a wykehamist  robert took his place on the back seat but still as if he would have preferred walking home  neither his sister nor his friend dared to ask whether he had seen lucilla  could she have refused him or was her frivolity preying on his spirits  phoebe tried to interest him by the account of the family migration and of miss fennimores promise that maria and bertha should have two halfhours of real play in the garden on each day when the lessons had been properly done and how she had been so kind as to let maria leave off trying to read a french book that had proved too hard for her not perceiving why this instance of goodnature was not cheering to her brother  miss charlecotes house was a delightful marvel to phoebe from the moment when she rattled into the paved court entered upon the fragrant odour of the cedar hall and saw the queen of shebas golden locks beaming with the evening light  she entered the drawingroom pleasantlooking already under the judicious arrangement of the housekeeper who had set out the holt flowers and arranged the books so that it seemed full of welcome  phoebe ran from window to mantelpiece enchanted with the quaint mixture of old and new admiring carving and stained glass and declaring that owen had not prepared her for anything equal to this until miss charlecote going to arrange matters with her housekeeper left the brother and sister together  well robin said phoebe coming up to him anxiously  he only crossed his arms on the mantelpiece rested his head on them and sighed  have you seen her  not to speak to her  have you called  no  then where did you see her  she was riding in the park  i was on foot  she could not have seen you exclaimed phoebe  she did replied robert i was going to tell you  she gave me one of her sweetest brightest smiles such as only she can give  you know them phoebe  no assumed welcome but a sudden flash and sparkle of real gladness  but whywhat do you mean asked phoebe why have you not been to her i thought from your manner that she had been neglecting you but it seems to me all the other way  i cannot phoebe i cannot put my poor pretensions forward in the set she is with  i know they would influence her and that her decision would not be calm and mature  her decision of what you are to be  that is fixed said robert sighing  indeed  with papa  no in my own mind  i have seen enough of the business to find that i could in ten years quadruple my capital and in the meantime maintain her in the manner she prefers  you are quite sure she prefers it  she has done so ever since she could exercise a choice  i should feel myself doing her an injustice if i were to take advantage of any preference she may entertain for me to condemn her to what would be to her a dreary banishment  not with you cried phoebe  you know nothing about it phoebe  you have never led such a life and you it would not hurtattract i mean but lovely fascinating formed for admiration and craving for excitement as she is she is a being that can only exist in society  she would be miserable in homely retirementi mean she would prey on herself  i could not ask it of her if she consented it would be without knowing her own tastes  no all that remains is to find out whether she can submit to owe her wealth to our business  and shall you  i could not but defer it till i should meet her here said robert  i shrink from seeing her with those cousins or hearing her name with theirs  phoebe imagine my feelings when going into mervyns club with him i heard rashe charteris and cilly sandbrook contemptuously discussed by those very names and jests passing on their independent ways  i know how it is  those people work on her spirit of enterprise and shetoo guileless and innocent to heed appearances  phoebe you do not wonder that i am nearly mad  poor robin said phoebe affectionately  but indeed i am sure if lucy once had a hintno one could not tell her it would shock her too much but if she had the least idea that people could be so impertinent and phoebes cheeks glowed with shame and indignation she would only wish to go away as far as she could for fear of seeing any of them again i am sure they were not gentlemen robin  a man must be supereminently a gentleman to respect a woman who does not make him do so said robert mournfully  that miss charteris  oh that she were banished to siberia  phoebe meditated a few moments then looking up said i beg your pardon robin but it does strike me that if you think that this kind of life is not good for lucilla it cannot be right to sacrifice your own higher prospects to enable her to continue it  i tell you phoebe said he with some impatience i never was pledged  i may be of much more use and influence and able to effect more extended good as a partner in a concern like this than as an obscure clergyman  dont you see  phoebe had only time to utter a somewhat melancholy very likely before miss charlecote returned to take her to her room the promised brown cupboard all wainscoted with delicious cedar so deeply and uniformly panelled that when shut the door was not obvious and it was like being in a box for there were no wardrobes only shelves shut by doors into the wall which the old usage of the household tradition called awmries armoires  the furniture was reasonably modern but not obtrusively so  there was a delicious recess in the deep window with a seat and a table in it and a box of mignonette along the sill  it looked out into the little highwalled entrance court and beyond to the wall of the warehouse opposite and the roar of the great city thoroughfare came like the distant surging of the ocean  seldom had young maidens bower given more satisfaction  phoebe looked about her as if she hardly knew how to believe in anything so unlike her ordinary life and she thanked her friend again and again with such enthusiasm that miss charlecote laughed as she told her she liked the old house to be appreciated since it had like pompeii been potted for posterity  and thank you my dear she added with a sigh for making my coming home so pleasant  may you never know how i dreaded the finding it full of emptiness  dear miss charlecote cried phoebe venturing upon a warm kiss and thrilled with sad pleasure as she was pressed in a warm clinging embrace and felt tears on her cheek  you have been so happy here  it is not the past my dear said honora i could live peacefully on the thought of that  the shadows that people this house are very gentle ones  it is the present  she broke off for the gates of the court were opening to admit a detachment of cabs containing the persons and properties of the new incumbent and his wife  he had been a curate of mr charlecote since whose death he had led a very hardworking life in various towns and on his recent presentation to the living of st wulstans honora had begged him and his wife to make her house their home while determining on the repairs of the parsonage  she ran down to meet them with gladsome steps she had never entirely dropped her intercourse with mr parsons though seldom meeting and he was a relic of the past one of the very few who still called her by her christian name and regarded her more as the clergymans daughter of st wulstans than as lady of the holt  mrs parsons was a thorough clergymans wife as active as himself and much loved and esteemed by honora with whom in their few meetings she had got on to admiration  there they were looking after luggage and paying cabs so heedfully as not to remark their hostess standing on the stairs and she had time to survey them with the affectionate curiosity of meeting after long absence and with pleasure in remarking that there was little change perhaps they were rather more gray and had grown more alike by force of living and thinking together but they both looked equally alert and cheerful and as if fifty and fiftyfive were the very prime of years for substantial work  their first glances at her were full of the same anxiety for her health and strength as they heartily shook hands and accompanied her into the drawingroom she explaining that mr parsons was to have the study all to himself and never be disturbed there then inquiring after the three children two daughters who were married and a son lately ordained  i thought you would have brought william to see about the curacy she said  he is not strong enough said his mother  he wished it but he is better where he is he could not bear the work here  no i told him the utmost i should allow would be an exchange now and then when my curates were overdone said mr parsons  and so you are quite deserted said honor feeling the more drawn towards her friends  starting afresh with a sort of honeymoon as i tell anne replied mr parsons and such a bright look passed between them as though they were quite sufficient for each other that honor felt there was no parallel between their case and her own  ah you have not lost your children yet said mrs parsons  they are not with me said honor quickly  lucy is with her cousins and oweni dont exactly know how he means to dispose of himself this vacation but we were all to meet here  guessing perhaps that mr parsons saw into her dissatisfaction she then assumed their defence there is to be a grand affair at castle blanch a celebration of young charles charteriss marriage and owen and lucy will be wanted for it  whom has he married  a miss mendoza an immense fortunesomething in the stockbroker line he had spent a good deal and wanted to repair it but they tell me she is a very handsome person very ladylike and agreeable and lucy likes her greatly  i am to go to luncheon at their house tomorrow so i shall treat you as if you were at home  i should hope so quoth mr parsons  yes or i know you would not stay here properly  im not alone either why wheres the boy gone  i thought he was here  i have two young fulmorts one staying here the other looking in from the office  fulmort exclaimed mr parsons with three notes of admiration at least in his voice  what the distiller  the enemy himself the identical lord of ginshopsat least his children  did you not know that he married my next neighbour augusta mervyn and that our properties touch  he is not so bad by way of squire as he is here and i have known his wife all my life so we keep up all habits of good neighbourhood and though they have brought up the elder ones very ill they have not succeeded in spoiling this son and daughter she is one of the very nicest girls i ever knew and he poor fellow has a great deal of good in him  i think i have heard william speak of a fulmort said mrs parsons was he at winchester  yes and an infinite help the influence there has been to him  i never saw any one more anxious to do right often under great disadvantages  i shall be very glad for him to be with you  he was always intended for a clergyman but now i am afraid there is a notion of putting him into the business and he is here attending to it for the present while his father and brother are abroad  i am sorry he is gone  i suppose he was seized with a fit of shyness  however when all the party had been to their rooms and prepared for dinner robert reappeared and was asked where he had been  i went to dress he answered  ah where do you lodge  i asked phoebe but she said your letters went to whittingtonstreet  there are two very good rooms at the office which my father sometimes uses  phoebe and miss charlecote glanced at each other aware that mervyn would never have condescended to sleep in great whittingtonstreet  mr parsons likewise perceived a straightforwardness in the manner which made him ready to acknowledge his fellowwykehamist and his sons acquaintance and they quickly became good friends over recollections of oxford and winchester tolerably strong in mr parsons himself and all the fresher on williams account  phoebe whose experience of social intercourse was confined to the stately evening hour in the drawingroom had never listened to anything approaching to this style of conversation nor seen her brother to so much advantage in society  hitherto she had only beheld him neglected in his uncongenial home circle contemning and contemned or else subjected to the fretting torment of lucillas caprice  she had never known what he could be at his ease among persons of the same way of thinking  speaking scarcely ever herself and her fingers busy with her needle she was receiving a better lesson than miss fennimore had ever yet been able to give  the acquiring of knowledge is one thing the putting it out to profit another  gradually from general topics the conversation contracted to the parish and its affairs known intimately to mr parsons a quarter of a century ago but in which honora was now the best informed while robert listened as one who felt as if he might have a considerable stake therein and indeed looked upon usefulness there as compensation for the schemes he was resigning  the changes since mr parsonss time had not been cheering  the late incumbent had been a man whose trust lay chiefly in preaching and who as his health failed and he became more unable to cope with the crying evils around had grown despairing and given way to a sort of dismal callous indifference not doing a little because he could not do much and quashing the plans of others with a nervous dread of innovation  the class of superior persons in trade and families of professional men who in mr charlecotes time had filled many a massivelybuilt pew had migrated to the suburbs and preserved only an office or shop in the parish an empty pew in the church where the congregation was to be counted by tens instead of hundreds  not that the population had fallen off  certain streets which had been a grief and pain to mr charlecote but over which he had never entirely lost his hold had become intolerably worse  improvements in other parts of london dislodging the inhabitants had heaped them in festering masses of corruption in these untouched byways and lanes places where honest men dared not penetrate without a policeman and report spoke of rooms shared by six families at once  mr parsons had not taken the cue unknowing of what he should find in it he said nothing and looked as simple and cheerful as if his life were not to be a daily course of heroism  his wife gave one long stifled sigh and looked furtively upon him with her loving eyes in something of anxious fear but with far more of exultation  yet it was in no dispirited tone that she asked after the respectable poorthere surely must be some employed in small trades or about the warehouses  she was answered that these were not many in proportion and that not only had pewrents kept them out of church but that they had little disposition to go there  they did send their children to the old endowed charity schools but as these children grew up wave after wave lapsed into a smooth respectable heathen life of sunday pleasuring  the more religious became dissenters because the earnest inner life did not approve itself to them in church teaching as presented to them the worse sort by far the most numerous fell lower and lower and hovered scarcely above the depths of sin and misery  drinking was the universal vice and dragged many a seemingly steady character into every stage of degradation  men and women alike fell under the temptation and soon hastened down the descent of corruption and crime  ah said mrs parsons i observed gin palaces at the corner of every street  there was a pause  neither her husband nor honor made any reply  if they had done so neither of the young fulmorts would have perceived any connection between the gin palaces and their fathers profession but the silence caused both to raise their eyes  phoebe judging by her sisters code of the becoming fancied that their friends supposed their feelings might be hurt by alluding to the distillery as a trade and cast about for some cheerful observations which she could not find  robert had received a new idea one that must be put aside till he had time to look at it  there was a ring at the door  honors face lighted up at the tread on the marble pavement of the hall and without other announcement a young man entered the room and as she sprang up to meet him bent down his lofty head and kissed her with halffilial halfcoaxing tenderness  yes here i am  they told me i should find you here  ah phoebe im glad to see you  fulmort how are you and a wellbred shake of the hand to mr and mrs parsons with the ease and air of the young master returning to his mothers house  when did you come  only today  i got away sooner than i expected  i went to lowndes square and they told me i should find you here so i came away as soon as dinner was over  they were dressing for some grand affair and wanted me to come with them but of course i must come to see if you had really achieved bringing bright phoebe from her orbit  his simile conveyed the astronomical compliment at once to honora and phoebe who were content to share it  honora was in a condition of subdued excitement and anxiety compared to which all other sensations were tame chequered as was her felicity a state well known to mothers and sisters  intensely gratified at her darlings arrival gladdened by his presence rejoicing in his endowments she yet dreaded every phrase lest some dim misgiving should be deepened and watched for the impression he made on her friends as though her own depended upon it  admiration could not but come foremost  it was pleasant to look upon such a fine specimen of manly beauty and vigour  of unusual height his form was so well moulded that his superior stature was only perceived by comparison with others and the proportions were those of great strength the small wellset head proudly carried the short straight features and the form of the free massive curls might have been a model for the bust of a greek athlete the colouring was the fresh healthy bronzed ruddiness of english youth and the expression had a certain boldness of goodhumoured freedom agreeing with the quiet power of the whole figure those bright gray eyes could never have been daunted those curling merry lips never at a loss that smooth brow never been unwelcome those easy movements never cramped nor the manners restrained by bashfulness  the contrast was not favourable to robert  the fair proportions of the one brought out the irregular build of the other the classical face made the plain one more homely the erect bearing made the eye turn to the slouching carriage and the readiness of address provoked comparison with the awkward diffidence of one disregarded at home  bashfulness and depression had regained their hold of the elder lad almost as the younger one entered and in the changes of position consequent upon the new arrival he fell into the background and stood leaning caryatid fashion against the mantelshelf without uttering a word while owen in a halfrecumbent position on an ottoman a little in the rear of miss charlecote and her tea equipage and close to phoebe indulged in the blithe loquacity of a return home in a tone of caressing banter towards the first lady of something between goodnature and attention to the latter yet without any such exclusiveness as would have been disregard to the other guests  ponto well  poor old pon how does he get on  was it a very affecting parting phoebe  i didnt see  i met miss charlecote at the station  not even your eyes might intrude on the sacredness of grief  well at least you dried them  but who dried pontos solemnly turning on honora  jones i hope said she smiling  i knew it  says i to myself when henry opened the door jones remains at home for the consolation of ponto  not entirely began honora laughing but the boy shook his head cutting her short with a playful frown  cousin honor it grieves me to see a woman of your age and responsibility making false excuses  mr parsons i appeal to you as a clergyman of the church of england is it not painful to hear her putting forward joness asthma when we all know the true fact is that pontos tastes are so aristocratic that he cant take exercise with an under servant and the housekeeper is too fat to waddle  by the bye how is the old thing  much more effective than might be supposed by your account sir and probably wishing to know whether to get your room ready  my room  thank you no not tonight  ive got nothing with me  what are you going to do tomorrow  i know you are to be at charteriss to luncheon his jewess told me so  for shame owen  i dont see any shame if charles doesnt said owen only if you dont think yourselves at a stall of cheap jewellery at a fairthats all  phoebe take care  youre a learned young lady  no im very backward  ah its the fashion to deny it but mind you dont mention shakespeare  why not  did you never hear of the merchant of venice  phoebe a little startled wanted to hear whether mrs charteris were really jewish and after a little more in this style which honor reasonably feared the parsonses might not consider in good taste it was explained that her riches were jewish though her grandfather had been nothing and his family christian  owen adding that but for her origin she would be very goodlooking not that he cared for that style and his manner indicated that such rosy childish charms as were before him had his preference  but though this was evident enough to all the rest of the world phoebe did not appear to have the least perception of his personal meaning and freely simply answered that she admired darkeyed people and should be glad to see mrs charteris  you will see her in her glory said owen tuesday week the great concern is to come off at castle blanch and a rare sight shell be cilly tells me she is rehearsing her dresses with different sets of jewels all the morning and for ever coming in to consult her and rashe  that must be rather tiresome said honor she cannot be much of a companion  i dont fancy she gets much satisfaction said owen laughing rashe never uses much soft sawder  its an easygoing place where you may do just as you choose and the young ladies appreciate liberty  by the bye what do you think of this irish scheme  honora was so much ashamed of it that she had never mentioned it even to phoebe and she was the more sorry that it had been thus adverted to as she saw robert intent on what owen let fall  she answered shortly that she could not suppose it serious  serious as a churchyard was owens answer  i dare say they will ask phoebe to join the party  for my own part i never believed in it till i came up today and found the place full of salmonflies and the start fixed for wednesday the 24th  who came a voice from the dark mantelshelf  who  why thats the best of it  who but my wise sister and rashe not a soul besides cried owen giving way to laughter which no one was disposed to echo  they vow that they will fish all the best streams and do more than any crack fisherman going and they would like to see who will venture to warn them off  theyve tried that already  last summer what did lucy do but go and fish sir harry bullers water  you know hes a very tiger about preserving  well she fished coolly on in the face of all his keepers they stood aghast didnt know what manner of nixie it was i suppose and when sir harry came down foaming at the mouth she just shook her curls and made him wade in up to his knees to get her fly out of a bramble  that must be exaggerated said robert  exaggerated  not a word  its not possible to exaggerate cillys coolness  i did say something about going with them  you must if they go at all exclaimed honora  out of the question sweet honey  they reject me with disdain declare that i should only render them commonplace and that rich and rare were the gems she wore would never have got across ireland safe if she had a great strapping brother to hamper her  and really as charles says i dont suppose any damage can well happen to them  honora would not talk of it and turned the conversation to what was to be done on the following day  owen eagerly proffered himself as escort and suggested all manner of plans evidently assuming the entire direction and protection of the two ladies who were to meet him at luncheon in lowndes square and go with him to the royal academy which as he and honora agreed must necessarily be the earliest object for the sake of providing innocent conversation  as soon as the clock struck ten robert took leave and owen rose but instead of going lingered talking oxford with mr parsons and telling good stories much to the ladies amusement though increasing honoras trepidation by the fear that something in his tone about the authorities or the slang of his manner might not give her friends a very good idea of his set  the constant fear of what might come next absolutely made her impatient for his departure and at last she drove him away by begging to know how he was going all that distance and offering to send henry to call a cab a thing he was too goodnatured to permit  he bade good night and departed while mr parsons in answer to her eager eyes gratified her by pronouncing him a very fine young man  he is very full of spirit she said  you must let me tell you a story of him  they have a young new schoolmistress at wrapworth his fathers former living you know close to castle blanch  this poor thing was obliged to punish a schoolchild the daughter of one of the bargemen on the thames a huge ruffianly man  well a day or two after owen came upon him in a narrow lane bullying the poor girl almost out of her life threatening her and daring her to lay a finger on his children  what do you think owen did  fought him i suppose said mr parsons judging by the peculiar delight ladies take in such exploits  besides he has sufficiently the air of a hero to make it incumbent on him to kill some giant  we may be content with something short of his killing the giant said honor but he really did gain the victory  that lad under nineteen positively beat this great monster of a man and made him ask the girls pardon knocked him down and thoroughly mastered him  i should have known nothing of it though if owen had not got a black eye which made him unpresentable for the castle blanch gaieties so he came down to the holt to me knowing i should not mind wounds gained in a good cause  they wished her good night in her triumph  the receipt of a letter was rare and supreme felicity to maria therefore to indite one was phoebes first task on the morrow after which she took up her book and was deeply engaged when the door flew back and the voice of owen sandbrook exclaimed goddess of the silver bow what alone  miss charlecote is with her lawyer and robert at the office  the parson and parsoness parsonically gone to study parsonages schools and dilapidations i suppose  what a bore it is having them here id have taken up my quarters here otherwise but i cant stand parish politics  i like them very much said phoebe and miss charlecote seems to be happy with them  just her cut dear old thing the same honest illogical practical sincerity said owen in a tone of somewhat superior melancholy but seeing phoebe about to resent his words as a disrespectful imputation on their friend he turned the subject addressing phoebe in the manner between teasing and flattering habitual to a big schoolboy towards a younger child phases of existence which each had not so long outgrown as to have left off the mutual habits thereto belonging  and what is bright cynthia doing  writing verses i declareworthy sister of phoebus apollo  only notes said phoebe relinquishing her paper in testimony  when found make a note ofsummoned by writtemp ed iiiburgessesknights of shire  it reads like an act of parliament hallams english constitution  my eyes  by way of lighter study  it is quite appalling  pray what may be the occupation of your more serious moments  you see the worst i have with me  holiday recreation to which you can just condescend  i say phoebe i have a great curiosity to understand the zend  i wish you would explain it to me  if i ever read it began phoebe laughing  what you pretend to deny  you wont put me off that way  a lady who can only unbend so far as to the english constitution by way of recreation must  but it is not by way of recreation  come i know my respected cousin too well to imagine she would have imposed such a task  that wont do phoebe  i never said she had but miss fennimore desired me  i shall appeal  theres no act of tyranny a woman in authority will not commit  but this is a free country phoebe as maybe you have gathered from your author and unless her trammels have reached to your soul and he laid his hand on the book to take it away  perhaps they have said phoebe smiling but holding it fast for i shall be much more comfortable in doing as i was told  indeed said owen pretending to scrutinize her as if she were something extraordinary really as an excuse for a good gaze upon her pure complexion and limpid eyes so steady childlike and unabashed free from all such consciousness as would make them shrink from the playful look  indeed  now in my experience the comfort would be in the not doing as you were told  ah but you know i have no spirit  i wish to heaven other people had none cried owen suddenly changing his tone and sitting down opposite to phoebe his elbow on the table and speaking earnestly  i would give the world that my sister were like you  did you ever hear of anything so preposterous as this irish business  she cannot think of it when miss charlecote has told her of all the objections said phoebe  she will go the more returned owen  i say to you phoebe what i would say to no one else  lucillas treatment of honora charlecote is abominablevexes me more than i can say  they say some nations have no words for gratitude  one would think she had come of them  phoebe looked much shocked but said perhaps miss charlecotes kindness has seemed to her like a matter of course not as it does to us who have no claim at all  we had no claim said owen the connection is nothing absolutely nothing  i believe poor dear the attraction was that she had once been attached to my father and he was too popular a preacher to keep well as a lover  well there were we a couple of orphans a nuisance to all our kith and kinnobody with a bit of mercy for us but that queer old coon kit charteris when she takes us home treats us like her own children feels for us as much as the best mother living could undertakes to provide for us  now i put it to you phoebe has she any right to be cast off in this fashion  i dont know in what fashion you mean  dont you  havent you seen how cilly has run restive from babyhood  a pretty termagant she was as even i can remember  and how my poor father spoilt her  any one but honor would have given her up rather than have gone through what she did so firmly and patiently till she had broken her in fairly well  but then come in these charterises and cilly runs frantic after them her own dear relations  much they had cared for us when we were troublesome little pests  but its all the force of blood stuff  the whole truth is that they are gay and honora quiet they encourage her to run riot  honora keeps her in order  have you spoken to her  as well speak to the wind  she thinks it a great favour to run down to hiltonbury for the horticultural show turn everything topsyturvy keep poor dear sweet honey in a perpetual ferment then come away to castle blanch as if she were rid of a troublesome duty  i thought miss charlecote sent lucy to enjoy herself  we always said how kind and selfdenying she was  denied rather said owen only thats her way of carrying it off  a month or two in the season might be very well see the world and get the tone of it but to racket about with ratia and leave honor alone for months together is too strong for me  honora came in delighted at her boys visit and well pleased at the manner in which he was engrossed  two such children needed no chaperon and if that sweet crescent moon were to be his guiding light so much the better  capital girl that he said as she left the room  this is a noble achievement of yours  in getting my youngest princess out of the castle  ay i do feel in a beneficent enchanters position  she has grown up much prettier than she promised to be  and far too good for a fulmort  but that is roberts doing  poor robert how he shows the old distiller in grain  so he is taking to the old shopbest thing for him  only by way of experiment  pleasant experiment to make as much as old fulmort  i wish hed take me into partnership  you owen  i am not proud  these arent the days when it matters how a man gets his tin so he knows what to do with it  ay the world gets beyond the dear old hiltonbury views after all sweet honey and you see what city atmosphere does to me  you know i never wished to press any choice on you she faltered  what with a goodhumoured air of affront you thought me serious dont you know im the ninth instead of the nineteenthcentury man under your wing  id promise you to be a bishop only you see im afraid i couldnt be mediocre enough  for shame owen and yet she smiled  that boys presence and caressing sweetness towards herself were the greatest bliss to her almost beyond that of a mother with a son because more uncertain less her right by nature  phoebe came down as the carriage was at the door and they called in whittington street for her brother but he only came out to say he was very busy and would not intrude on mrs charterisbashfulness for which he was well abused on the way to lowndes square  owen with his air of being at home put aside the servants as they entered the magnificent house replete with a display of state and luxury analogous to that of beauchamp but with better taste and greater ease the fulmorts were in bondage to ostentation the charterises were lavish for their own enjoyment and heedless alike of cost and of appearance  the great drawingroom was crowded with furniture and the splendid marqueterie tables and crimson ottomans were piled with a wild confusion of books prints periodicals papers and caricatures heaped over ornaments and bijouterie and beyond at the doorway of a second room even more miscellaneously filled a small creature sprang to meet them kissing honora and exclaiming here you are  have you brought the pigs wool  ah but youve brought something else  nowhats become of that redbreast as she embraced phoebe  he was so busy that he could not come  illbehaved bird a whole month without coming near me  only a week said phoebe speaking less freely as she perceived two strangers in the room a gentleman in moustaches who shook hands with owen and a lady whom from her greeting to miss charlecote for introductions were not the way of the house she concluded to be the formidable rashe and therefore regarded with some curiosity  phoebe had expected her to be a large masculine woman and was surprised at her dapper proportions and not ungraceful manner  her face neither handsome nor the reverse was one that neither in features nor complexion revealed her age and her voice was pitched to the tones of good society so that but for a certain dont care sound in her words and a defiant freedom of address phoebe would have set down all she had heard as a mistake in spite of the table covered with the brilliant appliances of flymaking over which both she and lucilla were engaged  it was at the period when ladies affected coats and waistcoats and both cousins followed the fashion to the utmost wearing tightlyfitting black coats plain linen collars and shirtlike undersleeves with black ties round the neck  horatia was still in mourning for her mother and wore a black skirt but lucillas was of rich deep gentianellacoloured silk and the buttons of her white vest were of beautiful coral  the want of drapery gave a harshness to miss charteriss appearance but the little masculine affectations only rendered lucys miniature style of feminine beauty still more piquant  less tall than many girls of fourteen she was exquisitely formed the closefitting dress became her taper waist the ivory fairness of the throat and hands shone out in their boyish setting and the soft delicacy of feature and complexion were enhanced by the vivid sparkling of those porcelain blue eyes under the long lashes still so fair and glossy as to glisten in the light like her profuse flaxen tresses arranged in a cunning wilderness of plaits and natural ringlets  the great charm was the minuteness and refinement of the mould containing the energetic spirit that glanced in her eyes quivered on her lips and pervaded every movement of the elastic feet and hands childlike in size statuelike in symmetry elfin in quickness and dexterity  lucile la fee she might well have been called as she sat manipulating the gorgeous silk and feathers with an essential strength and firmness of hands such as could hardly have been expected from such small members and producing such lovely specimens that nothing seemed wanting but a touch of her wand to endow them with life  it was fit fairy work and be it farther known that few women are capable of it they seldom have sufficient accuracy of sustained attention and firmness of finger combined to produce anything artistic or durable and the accomplishment was therefore lucillas pride  her cousin could prepare materials but could not finish  have you brought the pigs wool repeated lucy as they sat down  no  that is a cruel way of testifying  i cant find a scrap of that shade though ive nearly broke my heart in the tackle shops  heres my last fragment and this butcher will be a wreck for want of it  let me see quoth the gentleman bending over with an air of intimacy  you may see returned lucilla but that will do no good  owen got this at a little shop at elverslope and we can only conclude that the father of orange pigs is dead for weve tried every maker and cant hit off the tint  ive seen it in a shop in the strand he said with an air of depreciation such as set both ladies off with an ardour inexplicable to mere spectators both vehemently defending the peculiarity of their favourite hue and little personalities passing exceedingly diverting apparently to both parties but which vexed honora and dismayed phoebe by the coolness of the gentleman and the ease with which he was treated by the ladies  luncheon was announced in the midst and in the diningroom they found miss charteris a dark aquiline beauty of highlycoloured complexion such as permitted the glowing hues of dress and ornament in which she delighted and large languid dark eyes of oriental appearance  in the scarlet and gold net confining her sable locks her ponderous earrings her massive chains and bracelets and gorgeous silk she was a splendid ornament at the head of the table but she looked sleepily out from under her blackfringed eyelids turned over the carving as a matter of course to owen and evidently regarded the two young ladies as bound to take all trouble off her hands in talking arranging or settling what she should do with herself or her carriage  lolly shall take you there or lolly shall call for that passed between the cousins without the smallest reference to lolly herself otherwise eloisa who looked serenely indifferent through all the plans proposed for her only once exerting her will sufficiently to say very well rashe dear youll tell the coachmanonly dont forget that i must go to storr and mortimers  honora expressed a hope that lucilla would come with her party to the exhibition and was not pleased that mr calthorp exclaimed that there was another plan  no no mr calthorp i never said any such thing  miss charteris is not that a little too strong  you told me of the dorking cried lucilla and you said you would not miss the sight for anything but i never said you should have it  rashe meanwhile clapped her hands with exultation and there was a regular chatter of eager voicesi should like to know how you would get the hackles out of a suburban poultry fancier  out of himno out of his best dorking  priced at 120 pounds last exhibitiontwo years oldwouldnt take 200 pounds for him now  you dont mean that youve seen him  hurrah  lucilla opened a paper and waved triumphantly five of the long tippetplumes of chanticleer  you dont mean  mean  i more than mean  didnt you tell us that you had been to see the old party on business and had spied the hackles walking about in his yard  and i had hoped to introduce you  as if we needed that  no no  rashe and i started off at six oclock this morning to shake off the remains of the ball rode down to brompton and did our work  no it was not like the macaw business i declare  the old gentleman held the bird for us himself and i promised him a dried salmon  well i had flattered myselfit was an unfair advantage miss sandbrook  not in the least  had you gone it would have cast a general clumsiness over the whole transaction and not left the worthy old owner half so well satisfied  i believe you had so little originality as to expect to engage him in conversation while i captured the bird but once was enough of that  phoebe could not help asking what was meant and it was explained that while a call was being made on a certain old lady with a blue and yellow macaw lucilla had contrived to abstract the prime glory of the creatures taila blue feather lined with yellowan irresistible charm to a fisherwoman  but here even the tranquil eloisa murmured that cilly must never do so again when she went out with her  no lolly indeed i wont  i prefer honesty i assure you except when it is too commonplace  ill meddle with nothing at madame sonninis this afternoon  then you cannot come with us  why you see honor here have rashe and i been appointed bandmasters lord chamberlains masters of the ceremonies majordomos and i dont know what to all the castle blanch concern and as rashe neither knows nor cares about music ive got all that on my hands and i must take lolly to look on while i manage the programme  are you too busy to find a day to spend with us at st wulstans  a discussion of engagements took place apparently at the rate of five per day but mrs charteris interposed an invitation to dinner for the next evening including robert and farther it appeared that all the three were expected to take part in the castle blanch festivities  lolly had evidently been told of them as settled certainties among the guests and lucilla owen and rashe vied with each other in declaring that they had imagined honor to have brought phoebe to london with no other intent and that all was fixed for the ladies to sleep at castle blanch the night before and robert fulmort to come down in the morning by train  nothing could have been farther from honoras predilections than such gaieties but phoebes eyes were growing round with eagerness and there would be unkindness in denying her the pleasure as well as churlishness in disappointing lucy and owen who had reckoned on her in so gratifying a manner  without decidedly accepting or refusing she let the talk go on  miss fulmort said ratia i hope you are not too religious to dance  much surprised phoebe made some reply in the negative  oh i forgot thats not your sisters line but i thought     and she gave an expressive glance to indicate miss charlecote  oh no again said phoebe decidedly  yes i understand  never mind i ought to have remembered but when people are gone in one is apt to forget whether they think promiscuous dancing immoral or praiseworthy  well you must know some of my brothers constituents are alarmingly excellentfat suburban and retired and we have hatched a juvenile haymaking where they may eat and flirt without detriment to decided piety and when they go off we dress for a second instalment for an evening party  to phoebe it sounded like opening paradise and she listened anxiously for the decision but nothing appeared certain except the morrows dinner and that lucilla was to come to spend the sunday at miss charlecotes and this being fixed the luncheon party broke up with such pretty bright affection on lucillas part such merry coaxing of honor and such orders to phoebe to catch that robin tomorrow that there was no room left for the sense of disappointment that no rational word had passed  where asked owen getting into the carriage  henry knowsthe royal academy  ha no alteration in consequence of the invitation no finery required you must not carry hiltonbury philosophy too far  i have not accepted it  that is not required it is your fate phoebe why dont you speak or are you under an embargo from any of the wicked enchanters  even if so you might be got off among the pious juveniles  papa was so kind as to say i might go wherever miss charlecote liked said phoebe but indeed i had rather do exactly what suits her i dare say the morning party will suit her best  the oily popular preachers  thank you owen laughed honor  no now you must accept the whole  theres room to give the preachers a wide berth even should they insist on concluding with prayer and it will be a pretty sight  they have the guards band coming  i never heard a military band ejaculated phoebe  and there are to be sports for the village children i believe added owen besides you will like to meet some of the lionsthe archdeacon and his wife will be there  but how can i think of filling up mrs charteriss house without the least acquaintance  honeysweet philosopher eloisa heeds as little how her house is filled so it be filled as jessica did her fathers ring  five dresses a day with accoutrements to match and for the rest she is sublimely indifferent  fortune played her a cruel trick in preventing her from being born a fair sultana  not to be a mahometan said phoebe  i dont imagine she is far removed from one then as phoebes horror made her look like maria he addeddont mean that she was not bred a christian but the oriental mind never distinctly embraces tenets contrary to its constitution  miss charlecote is he talking in earnest  i hope not honora said a little severely for he would be giving a grievous account of the poor ladys faith  faith no my dear she has not reflection enough for faith  all that enters into the eastern female mind is a little observance  and you are not going to lead phoebe to believe that you think it indifferent whether those observances be christian or pagan said honora earnestly  there was a little pause and then owen rather hesitatingly saidit is a hard thing to pronounce that threefifths of ones fellowcreatures are on the high road to erebus especially when ethnologically we find that certain aspects of doctrine never have approved themselves to certain races and that climate is stronger than creed  am i not talking fennimorically phoebe  much more fennimorically than i wish her to hear or you to speak said honora you talk as if there were no such thing as truth  ah now comes the question of subjective and objective and i was as innocent as possible of any intention of plunging into such a sea or bringing those furrows into your forehead dear honor  see what it is to talk to you and miss fennimores pupil  all things human and divine have arisen out of my simple endeavour to show you that you must come to castle blanch the planners of the feast having so ordained and it being good for all parties due from the fairy godmother to the third princess and seriously giving cilly another chance of returning within the bounds of discretion  honora thought as much  she hoped that robert would by that time have assumed his right to plead with lucilla and that in such a case she should be a welcome refuge and phoebe still more indispensable so her lips opened in a yielding smile and phoebe thanked her rapturously vague hopes of roberts bliss adding zest to the anticipation of the lifting of the curtain which hid the world of brightness  theres still time said owen with his hand on the checkstring which do you patronize  redmayne or  nonsense smiled honor we cant waste our escort upon womens work  ladies never want a gentleman more than when their taste is to be directed  he is afraid to trust us phoebe  conscience has spoken said owen she knows how she would go and disguise herself in an old dowagers gown to try to look like sixty  as for silk gowns  i positively forbid it he cried cutting her short it is five years old  a reason why i should not have another too grand to wear out  and you never ought to have had it  phoebe it was bought when lucy was seventeen on purpose to look as if she was of a fit age for a wallflower and so well has the poor thing done its duty that lucy hears herself designated as the pretty girl who belongs to the violet and white  if she had known that was coming after her i wont answer for the consequence  if it does annoy lucywe do not so often go out togetherdont owen i never said it was to be now i am bent on landseer  but i said so returned owen for miss charlecote regards the distressed dressmakersfour dressesthink of the fingers that must ache over them  well he does what he pleases sighed honor theres no help for it you see phoebe  shall you dislike looking on  for she doubted whether phoebe had been provided with means for her equipment and might not require delay and correspondence but the frank answer was thank you i shall be glad of the opportunity  papa told me i might fit myself out in case of need  and suppose we are too late for the exhibition  i never bought a dress before quoth phoebe  owen laughed  thats right phoebe  be strongminded and original enough to own that some decorations surpass raffaelles correggios and stuff  no said phoebe simply and with no affectation of scorn they only interest me more at this moment  honor smiled to owen her love for the honesty that never spoke for effect nor took what it believed it ought to feel for what it really felt  withal owen gained his purpose and conducted the two ladies into one of the great shops of ladies apparel  phoebe followed miss charlecote with eyes of lively anticipation  miss fennimore had taught her to be real when she could not be philosophical and scruples as to the vain pomp and glory of the world had not presented themselves she only found herself admitted to privileges hitherto so jealously withheld as to endow them with a factitious value and in a scene of real beauty  the textures patterns and tints were as owen observed such as approved themselves to the aesthetic sense the miniature embroidery of the brocades was absolute art and no contemptible taste was displayed in the apparently fortuitous yet really elaborate groupings of rich and delicate hues fine folds or ponderous draperies  far from it said honor the only doubt is whether such be a worthy application of aesthetics  were they not given us for better uses  to diffuse the widest amount of happiness  that is one purpose  and a fair woman well dressed is the sight most delightful to the greatest number of beholders  honor made a playful face of utter repudiation of the maxim but meeting him on his own ground emphasized fair and well dressedthat is appropriately  that is what brings me here said owen turning round as the changeful silks already asked for were laid on the counter before them  it was an amusing shopping  the gentlemans object was to direct the taste of both ladies but his success was not the same  honoras first affections fell upon a handsome black enlivened by beautiful blue flowers in the flounces but her tyrant scouted it as a dingy dowager and overruled her into choosing a delicate lavender insisting that if it were less durable so much the better for her friends and domineering over the black lace accompaniments with a solemn tenderness that made her warn him in a whisper that people were taking her for his ancient bride thus making him some degrees more drolly attentive settling her headgear with the lady of the shop without reference to her  after all it was very charming to be so affectionately made a fool of and it was better for her children as well as due to the house of charlecote that she should not be a dowdy country cousin  meantime phoebe stood by amused admiring assisting but not at all bewildered  miss fennimore had impressed the maxim always know what you mean to do and do it  she had never chosen a dress before but that did not hinder her from having a mind and knowing it she had a reply for each silk that owen suggested and the moment her turn came she desired to see a green glace  in vain he exclaimed and drew his favourites in front of her in vain appealed to miss charlecote and the shopman she laughed him off took but a moment to reject each proffered green which did not please her and in as brief a space had recognized the true delicate pale tint of ocean  it was one that few complexions could have borne but their connoisseur with one glance from it to her fresh cheek owned her right though much depended on the garniture and he again brought forward his beloved lilac insinuating that he should regard her selection of it as a personal attention  no she laughed and said she had made up her mind and would not change and while he was presiding over honoras black lace she was beforehand with him and her bill was being made out for her white muslin worked mantle white bonnet with a tuft of lady grass white evening dress and wreath of lilies of the valley  green and white forsaken quite was the best revenge that occurred to him and miss charlecote declared herself ashamed that the old ladys dress had caused so much more fuss than the young ladys  it was of course too late for the exhibition so they applied themselves to further shopping until owen had come to the farthest point whence he could conveniently walk back to dine with his cousins and go with them to the opera and he expended some vituperation upon ratia for an invitation which had prevented phoebe from being asked to join the party  phoebe was happy enough without it and though not morbidly bashful felt that at present it was more comfortable to be under miss charlecotes wing than that of lucilla and that the quiet evening was more composing than fresh scenes of novelty  the woolstonelane world was truly very different from that of which she had had a glimpse and quite as new to her  mr parsons after his partial survey was considering of possibilities or more truly of endeavours at impossibilities a mission to that dreadful population means of discovering their sick of reclaiming their children of causing the true light to shine in that frightful gross darkness that covered the people  she had never heard anything yet discussed save on the principle of selfpleasing or selfaggrandizement here selfspending was the axiom on which all the problems were worked  after dinner mr parsons retired into the study and while his wife and miss charlecote sat down for a friendly gossip over the marriages of the two daughters phoebe welcomed an unrestrained teteatete with her brother  they were one on either seat of the old oriel window she with her work on her lap full of pleasant things to tell him but pausing as she looked up and saw his eyes far far away as he knelt on the cushion his elbows on the sill of the open lattice one hand supporting his chin the other slowly erecting his hair into the likeness of the fretful porcupine  he had heard of but barely assented to the morrows dinner or the fete at castle blanch he had not even asked her how lucilla looked and after waiting for some time she said as a feeleryou go with us tomorrow  i suppose i must  lucy said so much in her pretty way about catching the robin that i am sure she was vexed at your not having called  no answer his eyes had not come home  presently he mumbled something so much distorted by the compression of his chin and by his face being out of window that his sister could not make it out  in answer to her sound of inquiry he took down one hand removed the other from his temple and emitting a modicum more voice from between his teeth said it is plainit cant be  what cant be  notlucy gasped phoebe  i cant take shares in the business  her look of relief moved him to explain and drawing himself in he sat down on his own windowseat stretching a leg across and resting one foot upon that where she was placed so as to form a sort of barrier shutting themselves into a sense of privacy  i cant do it he repeated not if my bread depended on it  what is the matter  i have looked into the books i have gone over it with rawlins  you dont mean that we are going to be ruined  better that we were than to go on as we do  phoebe it is wickedness there was a long pause  robert rested his brow on his hand phoebe gazed intently at him trying to unravel the idea so suddenly presented  she had reasoned it out before he looked up and she roused him by softly saying you mean that you do not like the manufacture of spirits because they produce so much evil  though he did not raise his head she understood his affirmation and went on with her quiet logic for poor girl hers was not the happy maidens defencewhat my father does cannot be wrong  without condemning her father she instinctively knew that weapon was not in her armoury and could only betake herself to the merits of the case  you know how much rather i would see you a clergyman dear robin she said but i do not understand why you change your mind  we always knew that spirits were improperly used but that is no reason why none should be made and they are often necessary  yes he answered but phoebe i have learnt today that our trade is not supported by the lawful use of spirits  it is the ministry of hell  phoebe raised her startled eyes in astonished inquiry  i would have credited nothing short of the books but there i find that not above a fifth part of our manufacture goes to respectable houses where it is applied properly  the profitable traffic which it is the object to extend is the supply of the gin palaces of the city  the leases of most of those you see about here belong to the firm it supplies them and gains enormously on their receipts  it is to extend the dealings in this way that my legacy is demanded  the enormity only gradually beginning to dawn upon phoebe all she said was a meditativeyou would not like that  you did not realize it he said nettled at her quiet tone  do not you understand  you and i and all of us have eaten and drunk been taught more than we could learn lived in a fine house and been made into ladies and gentlemen all by battening on the vice and misery of this wretched population  those unhappy men and women are lured into the gaudy palaces at the corners of the streets to purchase a moments oblivion of conscience by stinting their children of bread that we may wear fine clothes and call ourselves county people  do not talk so robert she exclaimed trembling it cannot be right to say such things  it is only the bare fact it is no pleasure to me to accuse my own father i assure you phoebe but i cannot blind myself to the simple truth  he cannot see it in that light  he will not  surely faltered phoebe it cannot be so bad when one does not know it is  so far true  the conscience does not waken quickly to evils with which our lives have been long familiar  and mervyn was brought up to it  that is not my concern said robert too much in the tone of am i my brothers keeper  you will at least tell your reasons for refusing  yes and much i shall be heeded  however my own hands shall be pure from the wages of iniquity  i am thankful that all i have comes from the mervyns  it is a comfort at least that you see your way  i suppose it is but he sighed heavily with a sense that it was almost profanation to have set such a profession in the balance against the sacred ministry  i know she will like it best  dear phoebe in spite of miss fennimore faith must still have been much stronger than reason if she could detect the model parsoness in yonder firefly  poor child she went to bed pondering over her brothers terrible discoveries and feeling as though she had suddenly awakened to find herself implicated in a web of iniquity her delightful parcel of purchases lost their charms and oppressed her as she thought of them in connection with the rags of the squalid children the rector had described and she felt as if there were no escape and she could never be happy again under the knowledge of the price of her luxuries and the dread of judgment  much good had their wealth done them as robert truly said  the house of beauchamp had never been nearly so happy as if their means had been moderate  always paying court to their own station or they were disunited among themselves and not yet amalgamated with the society to which they had attained the younger ones passing their elders in cultivation and every discomfort of change of position felt though not acknowledged  even the mother lady as she was by birth had only belonged to the secondrate class of gentry and while elevated by wealth was lowered by connection and not having either mind or strength enough to stand on her own ground trod with an illassured foot on that to which she aspired  not that all this crossed phoebes mind  there was merely a dreary sense of depression and of living in the midst of a grievous mistake from which robert alone had the power of disentangling himself and she fell asleep sadly enough but fortunately sins committed neither by ourselves nor by those for whom we are responsible have not a lasting power of paining and she rose up in due time to her own calm sunshiny spirit of anticipation of the evenings meeting between robin and lucyto say nothing of her own first dinnerparty    chapter iv       and instead of dearest miss     jewel honey sweetheart bliss     and those forms of old admiring     call her cockatrice and sirenc lamb  the ladies of the house were going to a ball and were in full costume eloisa a study for the arabian nights and lucilla in an azure gossamerlike texture surrounding her like a cloud turquoises on her arms and blue and silver ribbons mingled with her blonde tresses  very like the clergymans wife  o sage honor were you not provoked with yourself for being so old as to regard that bewitching sprite and marvel whence comes the cost of those robes of the woof of faerie  let oberon pay titanias bills  that must depend on who oberon is to be  phoebe to whom a doubt on that score would have appeared high treason nevertheless hated the presence of mr calthorp as much as she could hate anything and was in restless anxiety as to titanias behaviour  she herself had no cause to complain for she was at once singled out and led away from miss charlecote to be shown some photographic performances in which lucy and her cousin had been dabbling  there that horrid monster is owenhe never will come out respectable mr prendergast he is better because you dont see his face  theres our school edna murrell and all i flatter myself that is a work of art only this little wretch fidgeted and muddled himself  is that the mistress  she does not look like one  not like sally page  no she would bewilder the hiltonbury mind  i mean you to see her i would not miss the shock to honor  no dont show it to her  i wont have any preparation  do you call that preparation said owen coming up and taking up the photograph indignantly  you should not do such things cilly  tisnt i that do themits phoebes brotherthe one in the sky i mean dan phoebus and if he wont flatter i cant help it  no no ill not have it broken it is an exact likeness of all the childrens spotted frocks and if it be not of edna it ought to be  look robert said phoebe as she saw him standing shy grave and monumental with nervous hands clasped over the back of a chair neither advancing nor retreating what a beautiful place this is  oh thats from a printglendalough  i mean to bring you plenty of the real place  kathleens cave said the unwelcome millionaire  yes with a comment on kathleens awkwardness  i should like to see the hermit who could push me down  you  youll never tread in kathleens steps  because i shant find a hermit in the cave  talk of skylarking on the lake whose gloomy shore  they all laughed except the two fulmorts  theres a simpler reason said one of the guardsmen namely that neither party will be there at all  no not the saint  nor the lady  miss charteris tells me all the maiden aunts are come up from the country  how angry phoebe was  happily it is an article i dont possess  well we will not differ about technicalities as long as the fact is the same  youll remember my words when you are kept on a diet of hannah more and miss edgeworth till you shall have abjured hounds balls and salmonflies  the woman lives not who has the power  what bet will you take miss sandbrook  what bet will you take lord william that maiden aunts and all i appear on the 3rd in a dress of salmonflies  a hat trimmed with goose feathers to a pockethandkerchief that by that time you are in the family mansion repenting of your sins  phoebe looked on like one in a dream while the terms of the wager were arranged with playful precision  she did not know that dinner had been announced till she found people moving and in spite of her antipathy to mr calthorp she rejoiced to find him assigned to herselfdear good lucy must have done it to keep robin to herself and dear good lucy she shall be in spite of the salmon since in the progress downstairs she has cleared the cloud from his brow  it was done by a confiding caressing clasp on his arm and the few words now for old friends  how charming little phoebe looks  how different were his massive brow and deepset eyes without their usual load and how sweet his gratified smile  where have you been you robin  if i had not passed you in the park i should never have guessed there was such a bird in london  i began to change my mind like christianai thought robins were harmless and gentle birds wont to hop about mens doors and feed on crumbs and suchlike harmless food  and have you seen me eating worms  ive not seen you at all  i did not think you had leisurei did not believe i should be welcome  the cruellest cut of all positive irony  no indeed i am not so conceited as  as what  as to suppose you could want me  and there was i longing to hear about phoebe  if you had only come i could have contrived her going to the zauberflote with us last night but i didnt know the length of her tether  i did not know you were so kind  be kinder yourself another time  dont i know how i have been torn to pieces at hiltonbury without a friend to say one word for the poor little morsel she said piteously  he was impelled to an eager no no but recalling facts he modified his reply into friends enough but very anxious  there i knew none of you trusted me she said pretending to pout  when play is so like earnest  slow people are taken in  thats the fun  i like to show that i can walk alone sometimes and not be snatched up the moment i pop my head from under my leadingstrings  her pretty gay toss of the head prevented robert from thinking whether woman is meant to be without leadingstrings  and it was to avoid countenancing my vagaries that you stayed away she said with a look of injured innocence  i was very much occupied answered robert feeling himself in the wrong  that horrid office  you arent thinking of becoming a clarence to drown yourself in brandythat would never do  no i have given up all thoughts of that  you thought you wretched redbreast  i thought you knew better  so i ought said robert gravely but my father wished me to make the experiment and i must own that before i looked into the details there were considerations whichwhich  such considerations as pounds s d  for shame  for shame indeed said the happy robert  phoebe judged you truly  i did not know what might be the effect of habit and he became embarrassed doubtful whether she would accept the assumption on which he spoke but she went beyond his hopes  the only place i ever cared for is a very small old parsonage she said with feeling in her tone  wrapworth that is near castle blanch  yes  i must show it you  you shall come with honor and phoebe on monday and i will show you everything  i should be delightedbut is it not arranged  ill take care of that  mr prendergast shall take you in as he would a newlyarrived rhinoceros if i told him  he was our curate and used to live in the house even in our time  dont say a word robin it is to be  i must have you see my river and the stile where my father used to sit when he was tired  ive never told any one which that is  ordinarily lucilla never seemed to think of her father never named him and her outpouring was doubly prized by robert whose listening face drew her on  i was too much of a child to understand how fearfully weak he must have been for he could not come home from the castle without a rest on that stile and we used to play round him and bring him flowers  my best recollections are all of that last summerit seems like my whole life at home and much longer than it could really have been  we were all in all to one another  how different it would have been if he had lived  i think no one has believed in me since  there was something ineffably soft and sad in the last words as the beautiful petted but still lonely orphan cast down her eyelids with a low long sigh as though owning her errors but pleading this extenuation  robert much moved was murmuring something incoherent but she went on  rashe does perhaps  cant you see how it is a part of the general disbelief in me to suppose that i come here only for london seasons and such like  i must live where i have what the dear old soul there has not got to give  you cannot doubt of her affection  i am sure there is nothing she would not do for you  do that is not what i want  it cant be done it must be felt and that it never will be  when theres a mutual antagonism gratitude becomes a fetter intolerable when it is strained  i cannot bear to hear you talk so revering miss charlecote as i do and feeling that i owe everything to her notice  oh i find no fault i reverence her too  it was only the nature of things not her intentions nor her kindness that was to blame  she meant to be justice and mercy combined towards us but i had all the one and owen all the other  not that i am jealous  oh no  not that she could help it but no woman can help being hard on her rivals daughter  nothing but the sweet tone and sad arch smile could have made this speech endurable to robert even though he remembered many times when the trembling of the scale in miss charlecotes hands had filled him with indignation  you allow that it was justice he said smiling  no doubt of that she laughed  poor honor  i must have been a grievous visitation but i am very good now i shall come and spend sunday as gravely as a judge and when you come to wrapworth you shall see how i can go to the school when it is not forced down my throatno merit either for our mistress is perfectly charming with such a voice  if i were phoebe i would look out for owen is desperately smitten  phoebe repeated robert with a startled look  owen and phoebe  i considered it une affaire arrangee as much as she had almost said you and me robert could supply the omission but he was only blind of one eye and gravely said it is well there is plenty of time before owen to tame him down  oney laughed lucilla yes he has a good deal to do in that line with his opinions in such a mess that i really dont know what he does believe  though the information was not new to robert her levity dismayed him and he gravely began if you have such fears but she cut him off short  did you ever play at bagatelle  he stared in displeased surprise  did you never see the ball go joggling about before it could settle into its hole and yet abiding there very steadily at last  look on quietly and you will see the poor fellow as sober a parish priest as yourself  you are a very philosophical spectator of the process robert said still displeased  just consider what a capacious swallow the poor boy had in his tender infancy and how hard it was crammed with legends hymns and allegories with so many scruples bound down on his poor little conscience that no wonder when the time of expansion came the whole concern should give way with a jerk  i thought miss charlecotes education had been most anxiously admirable  precisely so  dont you see  why how dull you are for a man who has been to oxford  i should seriously be glad to hear your view for owens course has always been inexplicable to me  to you poor robin who lived gratefully on the crumbs of our advantages  the point was that to you they were crumbs while we had a surfeit  owen never seemed overdone  i used rather to hate him for his faultlessness and his familiarity with what awed my ignorance  the worse for him  he was too apt a scholar and received all unresisting unsiftinganglocatholicism slightly touched with sentiment enthusiasm for the crusades passive obedienceacted faithfully up to it imagined that to be not a good churchman as he told charles expressed the seven deadly sins and that reasoning was the deadliest of all  as far as i understand you you mean that there was not sufficient distinction between proven and nonprovenimportant and unimportant  you begin to perceive  if faith be overworked reason kicks and of course when owen found the holt was not the world that thinking was not the exclusive privilege of demons that habits he considered as imperative duties were inconvenient not to say impracticable that his articles of faith included much of the apocryphalwhy there was a general downfall  poor miss charlecote sighed robert it is a disheartening effect of so much care  she should have let him alone then for uncle kit to make a sailor of then he would have had something better to do than to think  then you are distressed about him said robert wistfully  thank you said she laughing but you see i am too wise ever to think or distress myself  hell think himself straight in time and begin a reconstruction from his scattered materials i suppose and meantime he is a very comfortable brother as such things go but it is one of the grudges i cant help owing to honora that such a fine fellow as that is not an independent sailor or soldier able to have some fun and not looked on as a mere dangler after the holt  i thought the reverse was clearly understood  she ought to have acted as sich  how my relatives and yours too would laugh if you told them so  not that i think like them that it is elizabethan dislike to naming a successor nor to keep him on his good behaviour she is far above that but it is plain how it will he  the only other relation she knows in the world is farther off than we arenot a bit more of a charlecote and twice her age and when she has waited twenty or thirty years longer for the auburnhaired lady my father saw in a chapel at toronto she will bethink herself that owen or owens eldest son had better have it than the queen  thats the sense of it but i hate the hangeron position it keeps him in  it is a misfortune said robert  people treat him as a man of expectations and at his age it would not be easy to disown them even to himself  he has an eldest son air about him which makes people impose on him the belief that he is one and yet who could have guarded against the notion more carefully than miss charlecote  im of uncle kits mind said lucilla that children should be left to their natural guardians  what is lolly really moving before i have softened down the edge of my ingratitude  so said miss charteris as she brought up the rear of the procession of ladies on the stairs  lucilla faced about on the step above with a face where interrogation was mingled with merry defiance  so that is why the calthorp could not get a word all the livelong dinnertime  ah  i used you ill i promised you an opportunity of studying cock robin but you see i could not help keeping him myselfi had not seen him for so long  you were very welcome  it is the very creature that baffles me  i can talk to any animal in the world except an incipient parson  owen for instance  oh if people choose to put a force on nature there can be no general rules  but cilly you know ive always said you should marry whoever you liked but i require another assuranceon your word and honourthat you are not irrevocably jenny wren as yet  did you not see the currant wine said cilly pulling leaves off a myrtle in a tub on the stairs and scattering them over her cousin  seriously cilly  ah i see nowyour exclusive attention to him entirely reassures me  you would never have served him so if you had meant it  it was commonplace in me said lucilla gravely but i could not help it he made me feel so goodor so badthat i believe i shall  not give up the salmon cried horatia  cilly you will drive me to commit matrimony on the spot  do said lucilla running lightly up and dancing into the drawingroom where the ladies were so much at their ease on low couches and ottomans that phoebe stood transfixed by the novelty of a drawingroom treated with such freedom as was seldom permitted in even the schoolroom at beauchamp when miss fennimore was in presence  phoebe bright phoebe cried lucilla pouncing on both her hands and drawing her towards the other room it is ten ages since i saw you and you must bring your taste to aid my choice of the fly costume  did you hear rashe  ive a bet with lord william that i appear at the ball all in flies  isnt it fun  oh jolly cried horatia  make yourself a pikefly  no no not a guy for any one  only wear a trimming of salmonflies which will be lovely  you do not really mean it said phoebe  mean it  with all my heart in spite of the tremendous sacrifice of good flies  where honour is concerned  there i knew you would not shirk  did i ever say soin a whisper not unheard by phoebe and affording her so much satisfaction that she only said in a grave puzzled voice the hooks  hooks and all was the answer  i do nothing by halves  what a state of mind the fishermen will be in proceeded horatia youll have every one of them at your feet  i shall tell them that two of a trade never agree  come and let us choose  and opening a drawer lucilla took out her long parchment book and was soon eloquent on the merits of the doctor the butcher the duchess and all her other radiant fabrications of gold pheasants feathers parrot plumes jays wings and the like  phoebe could not help admiring their beauty though she was perplexed all the while uncomfortable on roberts account and yet not enough assured of the usages of the london world to be certain whether this were unsuitable the charteris family though not of the most elite circles of all were in one to which the fulmorts had barely the entree and the ease and dash of the young ladies lucillas superior age and caressing patronage all made phoebe in her own eyes too young and ignorant to pass an opinion  she would have known more about the properties of a rectangle or the dangers of a paper currency  longing to know what miss charlecote thought she stood answering as little as possible until rashe had been summoned to the party in the outer room and cilly said laughing well does she astonish your infant mind  i do not quite enter into her said phoebe doubtfully  the bestnatured and most unappreciated girl in the world  up to anything and only a victim to prejudice  you who have a strongminded governess ought to be superior to the delusion that it is interesting to be stupid and helpless  i never thought so said phoebe feeling for a moment in the wrong as lucilla always managed to make her antagonists do  yes you do or why look at me in that pleading perplexed fashion save that you have become possessed with the general prejudice  weigh it by the light of whatelys logic and own candidly wherefore rashe and i should be more liable to come to grief travelling alone than two men of the same ages  i have not grounds enough to judge said phoebe beginning as though miss fennimore were giving an exercise to her reasoning powers then continuing with her girlish eagerness of entreaty i only know that it cannot be right since it grieves robin and miss charlecote so much  and all that grieves robin and miss charlecote must be shocking eh oh phoebe what very women all the miss fennimores in the world leave us and how lucky it is  but i dont think you are going to grieve them said phoebe earnestly  i hate the word said lucilla  plaguing is only fun but grieving that is serious  i do believe this is only plaguing cried phoebe and that this is your way of disposing of all the flies  i shall tell robin so  to spoil all my fun exclaimed lucilla  no indeed  phoebe only gave a nod and smile of supreme satisfaction  ah but phoebe if im to grieve nobody whats to become of poor rashe you little selfish woman  selfish no sturdily said phoebe  if it be wrong for you it must be equally wrong for her and perhaps she added slowly you would both be glad of some good reason for giving it up  lucy dear do tell me whether you really like it for i cannot fancy you so  like it  well yes  i like the salmons and i dote on the fun and the fuss  i say phoebe can you bear the burden of a secret  wellonly mind if you tell robin or honor i shall certainly go we never would have taken it up in earnest if such a rout had not been made about it that we were driven to show we did not care and could be trusted with ourselves  then you dont mean it  thats as people behave themselves  hush  here comes honor  look here sweet honey i am in a process of selection  i am pledged to come out at the ball in a unique trimming of salmonflies  my dear cried poor honor in consternation you cant be so absurd  it is so slow not to be absurd  at fit times yes but to make yourself so conspicuous  they say i cant help that returned lucy in a tone of comical melancholy  well my dear we will talk it over on sunday when i hope you may be in a rational mood  dont say so implored lucilla or i shant have the courage to come a rational mood  it is enough to frighten one away and really i do want very much to come  ive not heard a word yet about the holt  how is the old dame this summer  and lucy went on with unceasing interest about all hiltonbury matters great and small bewitching honora more than would have seemed possible under the circumstances  she was such a winning fairy that it was hardly possible to treat her seriously or to recollect causes of displeasure when under the spell of her caressing vivacity and unruffled audacious fun  so impregnable was her gracious goodhumour so untameable her high spirits that it was only by remembering the little spitfire of twelve or fourteen years ago that it was credible that she had a temper at all the temper erst wont to exhale in chamois bounds and dervish pirouettes had apparently left not a trace behind and the sullen ungraciousness to those who offended her had become the sunniest sweetness impossible to disturb  was it real improvement  concealment it was not for lucilla had always been transparently true  was it not more probably connected with that strange levity almost insensibility that had apparently indurated feelings which in early childhood had seemed sensitive even to the extent of violence  was she only goodhumoured because nothing touched her  had that agony of parting with her gentle father seared her affections till she had become like a polished gem all bright glancing beauty but utterly unfeeling    chapter v       reproof falleth on the saucy as waterfeejee proverb  considerate of the slender purses of her children honora had devoted her carriage to fetch them to st wulstans on the sunday morning but her offer had been declined on the ground that the charteris conveyances were free to them and that it was better to make use of an establishment to which sunday was no object than to cloud the honest face of the hiltonbury coachman by depriving his horses of their day of rest  owen would far rather take a cab than so affront grey  pleased with his bright manner honora had yet reason to fear that expense was too indifferent to both brother and sister and that the charteris household only encouraged recklessness  wherever she went she heard of the extravagance of the family and in the shops the most costly wares were recommended as the choice of mrs charteris  formerly though honor had equipped lucilla handsomely for visits to castle blanch she had always found her wardrobe increased by the gifts of her uncle and aunt  the girl had been of age more than a year and in the present state of the family it was impossible that her dress could be still provided at their expense yet it was manifestly far beyond her means and what could be the result  she would certainly brook no interference and would cast advice to the winds  poor honor could only hope for a crash that would bring her to reason and devise schemes for forcing her from the effects of her own imprudence without breaking into her small portion  the great fear was lost false pride and charteris influence should lead her to pay her debts at the cost of a marriage with the millionaire and honor could take little comfort in owens assurance that the calthorp had too much sense to think of cilly sandbrook and only promoted and watched her vagaries for the sake of amusement and curiosity  there was small satisfaction to her wellwishers in hearing that no sensible man could think seriously of her  anxiously was that sunday awaited in woolstonelane the whole party feeling that this was the best chance of seeing lucilla in a reasonable light and coming to an understanding with her  owen was often enough visible in the interim and always extremely agreeable but lucilla never and he only brought an account of her gaieties shrugging his shoulders over them  the day came the bells began they chimed they changed but still no sandbrooks appeared  mr parsons set off and robert made an excursion to the corner of the street  in vain miss charlecote still lingered mrs parsons in despair called phoebe on with her as the single bell rang and honor and robert presently started with heads turned over their shoulders and lips laying all blame on charteris delays of breakfast a last wistful look and the church porch engulfed them but even when enclosed in the polished square pew they could not resign hope at every tread on the matted floor and finally subsided into a trust that the truants might after service emerge from a seat near the door  there were only too many to choose from  that hope baffled honora still manufactured excuses which phoebe greedily seized and offered to her brother but she read his rejection of them in his face and to her conviction that it was all accident he answered as she took his arm a small accident would suffice for sandbrook  you dont think he is hindering his sister  i cant tell  i only know that he is one of the many stumblingblocks in her way  he can do no good to any one with whom he associates intimately  i hate to see him reading poetry with you  why did you never tell me so asked the startled phoebe  you are so much taken up with him that i can never get at you when i am not devoured by that office  i am sure i did not know it humbly answered phoebe  he is very kind and amusing and miss charlecote is so fond of him that of course we must be together but i never meant to neglect you robin dear  no no nonsense it is no paltry jealousy only now i can speak to you i must said robert who had been in vain craving for this opportunity of getting his sister alone ever since the alarm excited by lucillas words  what is this harm robin  say not a word of it  miss charlecotes heart must not be broken before its time and at any rate it shall not come through me  what robert  the knowledge of what he is  dont say it is prejudice  i know i never liked him but you shall hear why  you ought now  roberts mind had often of late glanced back to the childish days when with their present opinions reversed he thought owen a muff and owen thought him a reprobate  to his own blunt and reserved nature the expressions so charming to poor miss charlecote had been painfully distasteful  sentiment profession obtrusive reverence and faultfinding scruples had revolted him even when he thought it a proof of his own irreligion to be provoked  afterwards when both were schoolboys robert had yearly increased in conscientiousness under good discipline and training but in their holiday meetings had found owens standard receding as his own advanced and heard the oncedeficient manly spirit asserted by boasts of exploits and deceptions repugnant to a wellconditioned lad  he saw miss charlecotes perfect confidence abused and trifled with and the more he grew in a sense of honour the more he disliked owen sandbrook  at the university where roberts career had been respectable and commonplace owen was at once a man of mark  mental and physical powers alike rendered him foremost among his compeers he could compete with the fast and surpass the slow on their own ground and his talents ready celerity goodhumoured audacity and quick resource had always borne him through with the authorities though there was scarcely an excess or irregularity in which he was not a partaker and stories of sandbrooks daring were always circulating among the undergraduates  but though robert could have scared phoebe with many a history of lawless pranks yet these were not his chief cause for dreading owens intimacy with her it was that he was one of the youths on whom the spirit of the day had most influence one of the most adventurous thinkers and boldest talkers wild in habits not merely from ebullition of spirits but from want of faith in the restraining power  all this robert briefly expressed in the words phoebe it is not that his habits are irregular and unsteady many are so whose hearts are sound  but he is not soundhis opinions are loose and he only respects and patronizes divine truth as what has approved itself to so many good great and beloved human creatures  it is not denialit is patronage it is the commonsense heresy  i thought we all ought to learn common sense  yes in things human but in things divine it is the subtle english form of rationalism  this is no time to explain phoebe but human sense and intellect are made the test and what surpasses them is only admired as long as its stringent rules do not fetter the practice  i am sorry you told me said phoebe thoughtfully for i always liked him he is so kind to me  had not robert been full of his own troubles he would have been reassured but he only gave a contemptuous groan  does lucy know this she asked  she told me herself what i well knew before  she does not reflect enough to take it seriously and contrives to lay the blame upon the narrowness of miss charlecotes training  oh robin  when all our best knowledge came from the holt  she says perhaps not unjustly that miss charlecote overdid things with him and that this is reaction  she observes keenly  if she would only think  she would have been perfect had her father lived to work on her by affection  the time for that is coming  robert checked her saying stay phoebe  the other night i was fooled by her engaging ways but each day since i have become more convinced that i must learn whether she be only using me like the rest  i want you to be a witness of my resolution lest i should be tempted to fail  i came to town hesitating whether to enter the business for her sake  i found that this could not be done without a great sin  i look on myself as dedicated to the ministry and thus bound to have a household suited to my vocation  all must turn on her willingness to conform to this standard  i shall lay it before her  i can bear the suspense no longer my temper and resolution are going and i am good for nothing  let the touchstone be whether she will resign her expedition to ireland and go quietly home with miss charlecote  if she will so do there is surely that within her that will shine out brighter when removed from irritation on the one side or folly on the other  if she will not i have no weight with her and it is due to the service i am to undertake to force myself away from a pursuit that could only distract me  i have no right to be a clergyman and choose a hindrance not a helpone whose tastes would lead back to the world instead of to my work  as he spoke in stern rigid resolutiononly allowing himself one long deep heavy sigh at the endhe stood still at the gates of the court which were opened as the rest of the party came up and as they crossed and entered the hall they beheld through the open door of the drawingroom two figures in the windowone a dark torso perched outside on the sill the other in blue skirt and boylike bodice negligently reposing on one side of the windowseat her dainty little boots on the other her coarse straw bonnet crossed with white upon the floor the wind playing tricks with the silky glory of her flaxen ringlets her cheek flushed with lovely carnation declining on her shoulder her eyes veiled by their fair fringes  hallo she cried springing up almost caught asleep  and owen pocketing his pipe spun his legs over the windowsill while both began in rattling playful vindication and recrimination                      he wouldnt  it wasnt my fault                       she wouldnt  indeed i wasnt a wilful heathen mr parsons it was he  it was she who chose to take the byways and make us late  rush into church before a whole congregation reeking from a sixmiles walk  ive more respect for the establishment  you walked cried five voices  see her sabbatarianism  nonsense  i should have driven charlies cab  charlie has some common sense where his horse is concerned  he wanted it himself you know  she grew sulky and victimized me to a walk  im sure it was excellent fun  ay and because poor calthorp had proffered his cab for her to drive to jericho and welcome she drags me into all sorts of streets of villainous savours that he might not catch us up  horrid hard mouth that horse of his said lucilla by way of dashing the satisfaction on miss charlecotes face  i do not wonder you were late  oh that was all owens doing  he vowed that he had not nerve to face the pewopener  the grim female in weedsno indeed said owen  indeed i objected to entering in the guise of flaming meteors both on reverential and sanatory grounds  insanatory methinks said miss charlecote how could you let her sleep so much heated in this thorough draught  dont flatter yourself said cilly quaintly shaking her head im not such a goose as to go and catch cold  oh phoebe my salmonflies are loveliness itself and i hereby give notice that a fine of three pairs of thick boots has been proclaimed for every pun upon sisters of the angle and sisters of the angels  so beware robinand the comical audacity with which she turned on him won a smile from the grave lips that had lately seemed so remote from all peril of complimenting her whimsies  even mr parsons said the fun was tempting  come and get ready for luncheon said the less fascinated honora moving away  come and catch it cried the elf skipping upstairs before her and facing round her dear old honeyseed  i honour your motives but wouldnt it be for the convenience of all parties if you took punchs celebrated advicedont  how am i to speak lucy said honora if you come with the avowed intention of disregarding what i say  then hadnt you better not murmured the girl in the lowest tone drooping her head and peeping under her eyelashes as she sat with a hand on each elbow of her armchair as though in the stocks  i would not my child was the mournful answer if i could help caring for you  lucilla sprang up and kissed her  dont then i dont like anybody to be sorry she said  im sure im not worth it  how can i help it when i see you throwing away happinesswelfarethe good opinion of all your friends  my dear honora you taught me yourself not to mind mrs grundy  come never mind the reasonable world has found out that women are less dependent than they used to be  it is not what the world thinks but what is really decorous  lucilla laughedthough with some temperi wonder what we are going to do otherwise  you are going beyond the ordinary restraints of women in your station and a person who does so can never tell to what she may expose herself liberties are taken when people come out to meet them  thats as they choose cried lucilla with such a gesture of her hand such a flash of her blue eyes that she seemed trebly the woman and it would have been boldness indeed to presume with her  yes but a person who has even had to protect herself from incivility to which she has wilfully exposed herself does not remain what she might be behind her screen  omne ignotum pro terribili laughed lucilla still not to be made serious  now i dont believe that the world is so flagrantly bent on annoying every pretty girl  people call me vain but i never was so vain as that  ive always found them very civil and ireland is the land of civility  now seriously my good cousin honor do you candidly expect any harm to befall us  i do not think you likely to meet with absolute injury  lucilla clapped her hands and cried an admission an admission  i told rashe you were a sincere woman  but miss charlecote went on but there is harm to yourself in the affectation of masculine habits it is a blunting of the delicacy suited to a christian maiden and not like the women whom st paul and st peter describe  you would find that you had forfeited the esteem not only of ordinary society but of persons whose opinions you do value and in both these respects you would suffer harm  you my poor child who have no one to control you or claim your obedience as a right are doubly bound to be circumspect  i have no power over you but if you have any regard for her to whom your father confided younay if you consult what you know would have been his wishesyou will give up this project  the luncheonbell had already rung and consideration for the busy clergyman compelled her to go down with these last words feeling as if there were a leaden weight at her heart  lucilla remained standing before the glass arranging her windtossed hair and in her vehemence tearing out combfuls as she pulled petulantly against the tangled curls  her old wayto come over me with my father  hai love him too well to let him be miss charlecotes engine for managing meher dernier ressort to play on my feelings nor will i have robin set at me  whether i go or not shall be as i please not as any one else does and if i stay at home rashe shall own it is not for the sake of the conclave here  i told her she might trust me  down she went and at luncheon devoted herself to the captivation of mr parsons afterwards insisting on going to the schoolsshe whose aversion to them was honoras vexation at home  strangers to make a sensation were contrary to the views of the parsonses but the wife found her husband inconsistentone lady more or less could make no difference on this first sunday and by and by mrs parsons found a set of little formal whitecapped faces so beaming with entertainment at the young ladys stories and the young lady herself looking so charming that she too fell under the enchantment  after church miss charlecote proposed a few turns in the garden dingy enough but a marvel for the situation and here the tacit object of herself and phoebe was to afford robert an opportunity for the interview on which so much depended  but it was like trying to catch a butterfly lucilla was here there everywhere and an excuse was hardly made for leaving her beside the grave silent young man ere her merry tones were heard chattering to some one else  perhaps robert heartsick and oppressed with the importance of what trembled on his tongue was not ready in seizing the moment perhaps she would not let him speak at any rate she was aware of some design since baffling phoebes last attempt she danced up to her bedroom after her and throwing herself into a chair in a paroxysm of laughter cried you abominable little pussycat of a manoeuvrer i thought you were in a better school for the proprieties  no dont make your round eyes and look so dismayed or youll kill me with laughing  cooking teteatetes phoebei thought better of you  oh fie and holding up her finger as if in displeasure she hid her face in ecstasies of mirth at phoebes bewildered simplicity  robert wanted to speak to you she said with puzzled gravity  and you would have set us together by the ears  no no thank you ive had enough of that sort of thing for one day  and what shallow excuses oh what fun to hear your pretexts  wanting to see what mrs parsons was doing when you knew perfectly well she was deep in a sermon and wished you at the antipodes  and blushing all the time like a fullblown poppy and off she went on a fresh scorebut phoebe though disconcerted for a moment was not to be put out of countenance when she understood her ground and she continued with earnestness undesired by her companionvery likely i managed badly but i know you do not really think it improper to see robert alone and it is very important that you should do so  indeed it is lucy she addedthe youthful candour and seriousness of her pleading in strong contrast to the flighty mocking carelessness of lucillas manners do pray see him i know he would make you listen  will you be so very kind  if you would go into the little cedar room i could call him at once  point blank  sitting in my cedar parlour  phoebe youll be the death of me cried cilly between peals of merriment  do you think i have nerves of brass  you would not laugh if you knew how much he feels  a very good thing for people to feel  it saves them from torpor  lucy it is not kind to laugh when i tell you he is miserable  thats only proper my dear said lucilla entertained by teasing  not miserable from doubt answered phoebe disconcerting in her turn we know you too well for that and as an expression amused indignant but far from favourable came over the fair face she was watching she added in haste it is this project he thought you had said it was given up  i am much indebted said lucilla haughtily but again relapsing into laughter but to find myself so easily disposed of     oh phoebe theres no scolding such a baby as you but if it were not so absurd  lucy lucy i beg your pardon is it all a mistake or have i said what was wrong  poor robin will be so unhappy  phoebes distress touched lucilla  nonsense you little goose arent you woman enough yet to know that one flashes out at finding oneself labelled and made over before ones time  im glad if it was all my blundering said phoebe  dear lucy i was very wrong but you see i always was so happy in believing it was understood  how stupid cried lucilla one would never have any fun no you havent tasted the sweets yet or you would know one has no notion of being made sure of till one chooses  yes yes i saw he was primed and cocked but im not going to let him go off  lucy have you no pity  not a bit  dont talk commonplaces my dear  if you knew how much depends upon it  my dear i know that with an arch smile  no you do not said phoebe so stoutly that lucilla looked at her in some suspense  you think said honest phoebe in her extremity that he only wants to maketo propose to you  now it is not only that lucilla and her voice sank as she could hardly keep from crying he will never do that if you go on as you are doing now he does not think it would be right for a clergyman  oh i dare say quoth lucilla and then a silence  did honor tell him so phoebe  never never cried phoebe no one has said a word against you only dont you know how quiet and good any one belonging to a clergyman should be  well ive heard a great deal of news today and it is all my own fault for indulging in sentiment on wednesday  i shall know better another time  then you dont care cried phoebe turning round with eyes flashing as lucilla did not know they could lighten  very well  if you dont think robert worth it i suppose i ought not to grieve for you cant be what i used to think you and it will be better for him when he once has settled his mindthan ifif afterwards you disappointed him and were a fine ladybut oh he will be so unhappy her tears were coming fast and lucy i did like you so much  well this is the funniest thing of all cried lucilla by way of braving her own emotion little miss phoebe gone into the heroics and she caught her two hands and holding her fast kissed her on both cheeks a gone coon am i phoebe no better than one of the wicked and robin he grew angry hopped upon a twig did he  i beg your pardon my dear but it makes me laugh to think of his dignified settling of his mind  oh how soon it could be unsettled again  come i wont have any more of this let it alone phoebe and trust me that things will adjust themselves all the better for letting them have their swing  dont you look prematurely uneasy and dont go and make robin think that i have immolated him at the altar of the salmon  say nothing of all this you will only make a mess in narrating it  very likely i may said phoebe but if you will not speak to him yourself i shall tell him how you feel  if you can laughed lucilla  i mean how you receive what i have told you of his views i do not think it would be fair or kind to keep him in ignorance  much good may it do him said lucy but i fancy you will tell him whether i give you leave or not and it cant make much difference  ill tackle him as the old women say when i please and the madder he may choose to go the better fun it will be  i believe you are saying so to tease me said phoebe but as i know you dont mean it i shall wait till after the party and then unless you have had it out with him i shall tell him what you have said  thank you said lucilla ironically conveying to phoebes mind the conviction that she did not believe that roberts attachment could suffer from what had here passed  either she meant to grant the decisive interview or else she was too confident in her own power to believe that he could relinquish her at all events phoebe had sagacity enough to infer that she was not indifferent to him though as the provoking damsel ran downstairs phoebes loyal spirit first admitted a doubt whether the tricksy sprite might not prove as great a torment as a delight to robin however reflected she i shall make the less mischief if i set it down while i remember it  not much like romance but practical sense was both native and cultivated in miss fennimores pupil  yet as she recorded the sentences and read them over bereft of the speakers caressing grace she blamed herself as unkind and making the worst of gay retorts which had been provoked by her own home thrusts  at least she thought he will be glad to see that it was partly my fault and he need never see it at all if lucy will let him speak to her himself  meantime honora had found from owen that the young ladies had accepted an invitation to a very gay house in cheshire so that their movements would for a fortnight remain doubtful  she recurred to her view that the only measure to be taken was for him to follow them so as to be able to interpose in any emergency and she anxiously pressed on him the funds required  shouldnt i catch it if they found me out said owen shrugging his shoulders  no but indeed sweet honey i meant to have made up for this naughty girls desertion  you and i would have had such rides and readings together i want you to put me on good terms with myself  my dear boy  but wont that best be done by minding your sister  she does want it owen the less she will be prudent for herself the more we must think for her  she can do better for herself than you imagine said owen  men say with all her free ways they could not go the least bit farther with her than she pleases  you wouldnt suppose it but she can keep out of scrapes better than rashe cannever has been in one yet and rashe in twenty  never mind your honor theres sound stuff in the bonny scapegrace all the better for being free and unconventional  the world owes a great deal to those who dare to act for themselves though i own it is a trial when ones own domestic womankind take thereto  or ones mankind to encouraging it said honor smiling but showing that she was hurt  i dont encourage it i am only too wise to give it the zest of opposition  was lucy ever bent upon a naughty trick without being doubly incited by the pleasure of showing that she cared not for her younger brother  i believe you are only too lazy  but will you go  i dont think it can be a penance  you would see new country and get plenty of sport  come with me honey said he with the most insinuating manner which almost moved her  how jolly it would be  nonsense an elderly spinster she said really pleased though knowing it impossible  stuff he returned in the same tone  make it as good as a honeymoon think of killarney honor  you silly boy i cant  theres harvest at home besides it would only aggravate that mad girl doubly to have me coming after her  well if you will not take care of me on a literal wildgoose chase said owen with playful disconsolateness ill not answer for the consequences  but you go  vacation rambles are too tempting to be resisted but mind i dont promise to act good genius save at the last extremity or else shall never get forgiven and i shall keep some way in the rear  so closed the consultation and after an evening which lucilla perforce rendered lively she and her brother took their leave  the next day they were to accompany the charterises to castle blanch to prepare for the festivities honor and her two young friends following on the wednesday afternoon    chapter vi       he who sits by haunted well     is subject to the nixies spell     he who walks on lonely beach     to the mermaids charmed speech     he who walks round ring of green     offends the peevish fairy queenscott  at the station nearest to castle blanch stood the tall form of owen sandbrook telling honor that he and his sister had brought the boat the river was the longer way but they would prefer it to the road and so indeed they did for phoebe herself had had enough of the city to appreciate the cool verdure and calm stillness of the meadow pathway by which they descended to the majestic river smoothly sleeping in glassy quiet or stealing along in complacently dimpling ripples  on the opposite bank shading off the sun an oak copse sloped steeply towards the river painting upon the surface a still shimmering likeness of the summit of the wood every mass of foliage every blushing spray receiving a perfect counterpart and full in the midst of the magic mirror floated what might have been compared to the roseate queen lily of the waters on her leaf  there in the flat shallow boat reclined the maiden leaning over the gunwale gazing into the summer wavelets with which one bare pinklytinted hand was toying and her silken ringlets all but dipping in from beneath the round black hat archly looped up on one side by a carnation bow and encircled by a series of the twin jetty curls of the mallard while the fresh rose colour of the spreading muslin dress was enhanced by the black scarf that hung carelessly over it  there was a moments pause as if no one could break the spell but owen striding on from behind quickly dissolved the enchantment  you monkey youve cast off  you may float on to greenwich next he indignantly shouted  she started shaking her head saucily  twas so slow there and so broiling she called back and i knew i should only drift down to meet you and could put in when i pleased  therewith she took the sculls and began rowing towards the bank but without force sufficient to prevent herself from being borne farther down than she intended  i cant help it she exclaimed fearlessly laughing as she passed them  robert was ready to plunge in to stem her progress lest she should meet with some perilous eddy but owen laid hold on him saying dont be nervous shes all right only giving trouble after the nature of women there are you satisfied he called to her as she came to a stop against a reed bed with a tall fence interposed between boat and passengers  a nice ferrywoman you  come and get me up again was all her answer  serve you right if i never picked you up till londonbridge he answered  stand clear fulmort and with a run and a bound he vaulted over the high hedge and went crackling through the nodding bulrushes and reedmaces while lucy having accomplished pulling up one of the latter was pointing it lancewise at him singing      with a bulrush for his spear and a thimble for a hat     wilt thou fight a traverse with the castle cat  come come tis too squashy here for larking he said authoritatively stepping into the boat and bringing it up with such absence of effort that when a few minutes after he had brought it to the landingplace and the freight was seated robert had no sooner taken the other oar than he exclaimed at the force of the stream with which owen had dealt so easily and lucilla so coolly  it really was a fearful risk he said reproachfully to her  oh she said i know my thames and my thames knows me  nows the time to improve it said owen one or other should preach about young ladies getting loose and not knowing where they may be brought up  but you see i did know besides phoebes news from paris will be better worth hearing said lucilla tickling her friends face with the soft long point of her dark velvety mace  my news from paris  for shame phoebe  your face betrays you  lucy how could you know  i had not even told miss charlecote  its true its true cried lucilla  thats just what i wanted to know  lucy then it was not fair said phoebe much discomposed  i was desired to tell no one and you should not have betrayed me into doing so  phoebe you always were a green oasis in a wicked world  and now let me hear said miss charlecote  i cant flatter you phoebe i thought you were labouring under a suppressed secret  only since this morning pleaded phoebe earnestly and we were expressly forbidden to mention it i cannot imagine how lucy knows  by telegraph  phoebes face assumed an expression of immeasurable wonder  i almost hope to find you at cross purposes after all said honora  no such good luck laughed lucilla  cinderellas seniors never could go off two at a time  ah theres the name  i beg your pardon phoebe  but lucy what can you mean  who can have telegraphed about augusta  ah you knew not the important interests involved nor augusta how much depended on her keeping the worthy admiral in play  it was the nearest thinghad she only consented at the end of the evening instead of the beginning poor lord william would have had the five guineas that he wants so much more than mr calthorp  lucy  it was a bet that sir nicholas would take six calendar months to supply the place of lady bannerman  it was the very last day  if augusta had only waited till twelve  you dont mean that he has been married before  i thought he was such an excellent man said phoebe in a voice that set others besides lucilla off into irresistible mirth  once twice thrice cried lucilla  catch her honor before she sinks into the river in disgust with this treacherous world  do you know him lucy earnestly said phoebe  yes and two of the wives we used to visit them because he was an old captain of uncle kits  i would not believe in number three phoebe if i were you said owen consolingly she wants confirmation  two are as bad as three sighed phoebe and augusta did not even call him a widower  cupid bandaged  it was a case of love at first sight  met at the trois freres provencaux heard each others critical remarks sought an introduction compared notes he discovered her foresight with regard to pale ale each felt that here was a kindred soul  that could not have been telegraphed said phoebe recovering spirit and incredulity  no the telegram was simply bannerman fulmort  830 pm july 10th the other particulars followed by letter this morning  how old is he asked phoebe with resignation  any age above sixty  what phoebe taking it to heart  i was prepared with congratulations  it is only second best to be sure but dont you see your own emancipation  i believe that had never occurred to phoebe said owen  i beg your pardon lucy said phoebe thinking that she had appeared out of temper only it had sounded so nice in augustas letter and she was so kind and somehow it jars that there should have been that sort of talk  cilly was checked  in her utter want of thought it had not occurred to her that augusta fulmort could be other than a laughingstock or that any bright anticipations could have been spent by any reasonable person on her marriage  perhaps the companionship of rashe and the satirical outspoken tone of her associates had somewhat blunted her perception of what might be offensive to the sensitive delicacy of a young sister but she instantly perceived her mistake and the carnation deepened in her cheek at having distressed phoebe and     not that she had deigned any notice of robert after the first cold shake of the hand and he sat rowing with vigorous strokes and a countenance of set gravity more as if he were a boatman than one of the party lucilla could not even meet his eye when she peeped under her eyelashes to recover defiance by the sight of his displeasure  it was a relief to all when honora exclaimed wrapworth how pretty it looks  it was indeed pretty seen through the archway of the handsome stone bridge  the church tower and picturesque village were set off by the frame that closed them in and though they lost somewhat of the enchantment when the boat shot from under the arch they were still a fair and goodly english scene  lucilla steered towards the steps leading to a smooth shaven lawn shaded by a weeping willow well known to honor  here we land you and your bag robert said owen as he put in cilly have a little sense do  but lucilla to the alarm of all was already on her feet skipped like a chamois to the steps and flew dancing up the sward  ere owen and robert had helped the other two ladies to land in a more rational manner she was shaking her mischievous head at a window and thrusting in her sceptral reedmace  neighbour oh neighbour im come to torment you  yes here we are in full force ladies and all and you must come out and behave pretty never mind your slippers you ought to be proud of the only thing i ever worked  come out i say heres your guest and you must be civil to him  i am very glad to see mr fulmort said mr prendergast his only answer in words to all this though while it was going on as if she were pulling him by wires as she imperiously waved her bulrush he had stuck his pen into the inkstand run his fingers in desperation through his hair risen from his seat gazed about in vain for his boots and felt as fruitlessly on the back of the door for a coat to replace the loose alpaca article that hung on his shoulders  there  youve gone through all the motions said cilly thatll do now come out and receive them  accordingly he issued from the door shy and slouching rusty where he wore cloth shiny where he wore alpaca wild as to his hair gay as to his feet but withal the scholarly gentleman complete and not a day older or younger apparently than when honor had last seen him nine years since in bondage then to the child playing at coquetry as now to the coquette playing at childhood  it was curious honor thought to see how though so much more uncouth and negligent than robert the indefinable signs of good blood made themselves visible while they were wanting in one as truly the christian gentleman in spirit and in education  mr prendergast bowed to miss charlecote and shook hands with his guest welcoming him kindly but the two shy men grew more bashful by contact and honor found herself owen and lucilla sustaining the chief of the conversation the curate apparently looking to the young lady to protect him and do the honours as she did by making him pull down a cluster of his roses for her companions and conducting them to eat his strawberries which she treated as her own flitting butterfly like over the beds selecting the largest and ruddiest specimens while her slave plodded diligently to fill cabbage leaves and present them to the party in due gradation  owen stood by amused and silencing the scruples of his companions  he is in elysium he said he had rather be plagued by cilly than receive a mitre  dont hinder him honey it is his pride to treat us as if we were at home and he our guest  wrapworth has not been seen without edna murrell said lucilla flinging the stem of her last strawberry at her brother and miss charlecote is a woman of schools  what arent we to go mr prendergast  i beg your pardon  i did not know  well what is it  i do sometimes wish miss murrell were not such an attraction  you did not think that of yourself  well i dont know miss murrell is a very nice young woman he hesitated as cilly seemed about to thrust him through with her reed but couldnt you cilla now give her a hint that it would be better if she would associate more with mrs jenkyns and  couldnt mr prendergast ive more regard for doing as i would be done by  when you see edna honor  they are very respectable women said the curate standing his ground and it would be much better for her than letting it be said she gives herself airs  thats all because we have had her up to the castle to sing  well so it is i believe  they do say tooi dont know whether it is sothat the work has not been so well attended to nor the children so orderly  spite spite mr prendergast i had a better opinion of you than to think you could be taken in by the tongues of wrapworth  well certainly i did hear a great noise the other day  i see how it is  this is a systematic attempt to destroy the impression i wished to produce  he tried to argue that he thought very well of miss murrell but she would not hear and she went on with her pretty saucy abuse in her gayest tones as she tripped along the churchyard path now doubtless too familiar to renew the associations that might have tamed her spirits perhaps the shock her vivacity gave to the feeling of her friends was hardly reasonable but it was not the less real though even in passing honora could not but note the improved condition of the two graves now carefully tended and with a lovely white rose budding between them  a few more steps and from the open window of the schoolhouse there was heard a buzz and hum not outrageous but which might have caused the item of discipline not to figure well in an inspectors report but mr prendergast and lucilla appeared habituated to the like for they proceeded without apology  it was a handsome gableended building elizabethan enough to testify to the taste that had designed it and with a deep porch where honor had advanced under lucillas guidance so as to have a moments view of the whole scene before their arrival had disturbed it  the childrens backs were towards the door as they sat on their forms at work  close to the oriel window the only person facing the door with a table in front of her there sat in a slightly reclining attitude a figure such as all reports of the new race of schoolmistresses had hardly led honor to imagine to be the bona fide mistress  yet the dress was perfectly quiet merely lilac cotton with no ornament save the small bow of the same colour at the throat and the hair was simply folded round the head but it was magnificent raven hair the head and neck were grandly made the form finely proportioned on a large scale the face really beautiful in a pale dark italian style the complexion of the clearest olive but as she became aware of the presence of the visitors it became overspread with a lovely hue of red while the eyelids revealed a superb pair of eyes liquid depths of rich brown soft and languid and befitting the calm dignity with which she rose curtseyed and signed to her scholars to do the same the deepening colour alone betraying any sense of being taken by surprise  lucilla danced up to her chattering with her usual familiar airy grace well edna how are you getting on  have i brought a tremendous host to invade you  i wanted miss charlecote to see you for she is a perfect connoisseur in schools  ednas blush grew more carnation and the fingers shook so visibly with which she held the work that honora was provoked with lucy for embarrassing the poor young thing by treating her as an exhibition especially as the two young gentlemen were present robert with his back against the doorpost in a state of resignation owen drawing phoebes attention to the little ones whom he was puzzling with incomprehensible remarks and questions  hoping to end the scene honor made a few commonplace inquiries as to the numbers and the habits of the school but the mistress though preserving her dignity of attitude seemed hardly able to speak and the curate replied for her  i see said lucilla your eye keeps roaming to the mischief my naughty brother is doing among the fry down there  oh no maam  i beg your pardon  never mind ill remove the whole concern in a moment only we must have some singing first  dont lucy whispered honor looking up from an inspection of some not firstrate needlework it is distressing her and displays are contrary to all rules of discipline  oh but you must cried cilly  you have not seen wrapworth without come edna my bonniebell and she held out her hand in that semiimperious semicaressing manner which very few had ever withstood  one song echoed owen turning towards the elder girls  i know youll oblige me eh fanny blake  to the scholars the request was evidently not distasteful the more tuneful were gathering together and the mistress took her station among them all as if the exhibition were no novelty  lucilla laying her hand on the victims arm said come dont be nervous or what will you do tomorrow  come  goddess of the silver bow suggested owen  wasnt it that which your mother disapproved fanny because it was worshipping idols to sing about great diana of the ephesians  yes sir said rather a conceited voice from the prettiest of the elder girls and you told us it was about phoebe bright and gave her the blue and silver ribbon  and please sir said another less prepossessing damsel mrs jenkyns took it away and i said id tell you  owen shrugged up his shoulders with a comical look saying as he threw her a shilling never mind theres a silver circle instead of a bowthat will do as well  heres a rival goddess for you phoebe two moons in a system  the girls were in a universal titter the mistress with her eyes cast down blushing more than ever  lucilla muttered an amused but indignant for shame owen and herself gave the keynote  the performance was not above the average of national school melody but no sooner was it over than owen named in an undertone another song which was instantly commenced and in which there joined a voice that had been still during the first but which soon completely took the lead  and such a voice coming as easily as the notes of the nightingale from the noblyformed throat and seeming to fill the room with its sweet power lucillas triumph was complete honors scruples were silenced by the admiring enjoyment and phoebe was in a state of rapture  the nervous reluctance had given way to the artistic delight in her own power and she readily sang all that was asked for latterly such pieces as needed little or no support from the childrenthe three fishers wives coming last and thrilling every one with the wondrous pathos and sadness of the tones that seemed to come from her very heart  it seemed as if they would never have come away had not mr prendergast had pity on the restless movements of some of the younglings who taking no part in the display had leisure to perceive that the clock had struck their hour of release and at the close of the fishers wives he signed to lucilla to look at the hour  poor little things said she turning round to the gaping and discontented collection have we used you so ill  never mind  again using her bulrush to tickle the faces that looked most injured and waken them into smilesheres the prison house open and she sprang out nowcome with a whoop and come with a callill give my club to anybody that can catch me before i get down to the vicarage garden  light as the wind she went bounding flying across the churchyard like a butterfly ever and anon pausing to look round nod and shake her sceptre as the urchins tumbled confusedly after far behind till closing the gate she turned poised the reed javelinwise in the air and launched it among them  it is vain to try to collect them again sighed mr prendergast we must shut up  good night miss murrell and therewith he turned back to his garden where the freakish sprite feigning flight took refuge in the boat cowering down and playfully hiding her face in deprecation of rebuke but all she received was a meekly melancholy o cilla prayers  one days less loathing of compulsory devotion was her answer in saucy defiance  i owed it to them for the weariness of listening for ten minutes to the three fishers wives which they appreciated as little as their pastor did  i know nothing about songs but when one wants thempoor thingsto look to something better than sleep  oh hush  here are miss charlecote and mr fulmort on your side and i cant be crushed with united morality in revenge for the tears edna caused you all to shed  there help miss charlecote in where can owen be dawdling  you cant pull phoebe or we would put off without him ah there as he came bounding down you intolerable loiterer i was just going to leave you behind  the train starting without the engine he said getting into his place yes take an oar if you like little gnat and fancy yourself helping  the gay warfare accompanied by a few perilous tricks on lucillas part lasted through the further voyage  honora guessed at a purpose of staving off graver remonstrance but phoebe looked on in astonishment seventeen is often a more serious time of life than twoand twenty and the damsel could not comprehend the possibility of thoughtlessness when there was anything to think about  the asss bridge was nothing compared with lucy  moreover the habits of persiflage of a lively family often are confusing to one not used to the tone of jest and repartee and phoebe had as little power as will to take part in what was passing between the brother and sister she sat like the spectator of a farce in a foreign tongue till the boat had arrived at the broad open extent of park gently sweeping down towards the river the masses of trees kept on either side so as to leave the space open where the castle towered in pretentious grandeur with a flag slowly swaying in the summer wind on the top of the tallest turret  the trees made cool reaches of shade varied by intervals of hot sunshine and much longer did the way appear creeping onward in the heat than it had looked when the eye only took in the simple expanse of turf from river to castle  phoebe looked to her arrival there and to bedroom conferences as the moment of recovering a reasonable lucy but as they neared the house there was a shout from the wire fence enclosing the shrubbery on the eastern side and horatia was seen standing at the gate calling them to come into the cloisters and have some sustenance  passing the screen of shrubs a scene lay before them almost fit for the gardens of seville  three sides of an extensive square were enclosed by the semigothic buildings floridly decorated with stone carving one consisted of the main edifice the lower windows tented with striped projecting blinds a second of the wing containing the reception rooms fronted by the imitative cloister which was continued and faced with glass on the third sideeach supporting column covered with climbing plants the passionflower the tropaeolum the trumpet honeysuckle or even the pomegranate opening their gay blooms on every side  the closeshaven turf was broken by small patches of gorgeouslytinted flowerbeds diversified by vases filled with trailing plants and lines of orange trees and fuchsias with here and there a deepbelled datura all converging towards the central marble fountain where the water played high and tinkled coolly in sparkling jets  between it and the house there were placed in the shade some brightlytinted cushions and draperies lounging chairs and a low table bearing an orientallooking service of tiny cups of all kinds of bright and fantastic hues no two alike  near it reclined on her cushions a figure in perfect keeping with the scene her jetty hair contrasting with her gold and coral net her scarlet goldembroidered slipper peeping out from her pale buffcoloured dress deeply edged with rich purple and partly concealed by a mantle of the unapproachable pink which suggests persia all as gorgeous in apparel as the blue and yellow macaw on his pole and the green and scarlet lories in their cage  owen made a motion of smoking with honors parasol whispering fair fatima what more is wanting  there ive got lolly out cried horatia advancing with her vehement cordiality and grasping their hands with all her might i would have come and pulled you up the river miss charlecote but for imperative claims  heres some tea for you i know you must be parched  and while mrs charteris scarcely rising held out her ring encrusted fingers and murmured a greeting ratia settled them all pushed a chair behind miss charlecote almost threw phoebe on a cushion handed tea scolded owen and rattled away to lucilla with an impetus that kept phoebe in increased wonder  it was all about the arrangements for the morrow full of the utmost goodnature and desire to secure every ones pleasure but all discussed in a broad outspoken way with a liberal use of slang phrases and of unprefaced surnames a freedom of manner and jovial carelessness of voice that specially marked rashe charteris at home  phoebe had a good deal of opportunity for these observations for as soon as her stream of information was exhausted rashe jumped up and insisted on conducting the guests round the hothouses and pleasuregrounds  she knew miss charlecote was a famous hand at such things  lucilla remained on the grass softly teasing lolly about the exertions of the morrow and owen applying himself to the care of honor rashe took possession of phoebe with all the tyrannous goodnature that had in baby days rendered her hateful to lucilla  she showed off the parrots and gold fish as to a child she teased the sensitive plant and explained curiosities down to the level of the youthful intellect and phoebe scientific enough to know if she went wrong in botany or locality began a word or two of modest suggestion only to be patronizingly enlightened and stopped short in the fear of pedantry  phoebe had yet to learn the ignorance of the world  at last with a huge torrent of explanations and excuses ratia consigned the two guests to share the same bedroom and dressingroom  the number of gentlemen visitors had necessitated close packing and cilly she said had come to sleep in her room  another hope had failed  but at the moment when the door was shut phoebe could only sink into a chair untie her bonnet and fan herself  such oppressive goodnature was more fatiguing than a ten miles walk or than the toughest lesson in political economy  if nature have her own ladies was honoras comment on her young friends exhaustion she likewise has her own dairymaids  miss charteris is a lady said phoebe her sense of the intended kindness of her hostess calling her to speak in vindication  yes said honor hesitating it is station that emboldens her  if she had been a dairymaid she would have been a bouncing rude girl if a farmers daughter she would be hearty and useful if one of the boasters of gentility she would think it worth while to restrain herself as she is her acknowledged birth and breeding enable her to follow her inclinations without fear of opinion  i thought refinement was one great characteristic of a lady said phoebe  so it is but affectation and false shame are the contrary  refinement was rather overworked and there has been a reaction of late simplicity and unconstraint have been the fashion but unfortunately some dispositions are not made to be unconstrained  lucy is just as unrestrained as her cousin said phoebe but she never seems like her  she offends ones judgment sometimes but never ones tasteat least hardly ever and phoebe blushed as she thought of what had passed about her sister that day  poor lucy it is one misfortune of pretty people that they can seldom do what is taken amiss  she is small and feminine too and essentially refined whatever she can do  but i was very sorry for you today phoebe  tell me all about your sister my dear  they knew more than i did if all that is true said phoebe  augusta wroteoh so kindlyand seemed so glad that it made me very happy and papa gave his consent readily to roberts doing as he pleased and almost said something about his taking me to the wedding at paris  if lucy shouldshould accept robin i wonder if she would go too and be bridesmaid  so they comforted themselves with a few pretty auguries dressed and went down to dinner where phoebe had made sure that as before lucy would sit next robin and be subdued  alas no  ladies were far too scarce articles for even the last but one to be the prize of a mere ba to know who were phoebes own neighbours would have been distraction to juliana but they were lost on one in whom the art of conversation was yet undeveloped and who was chiefly intent on reading her brothers face and catching what lucy was saying  she had nearly given up listening in despair when she heard pistols oh of course  rashe has gone to the expense of a revolver but i extracted grandpapas from the family armourysuch little darlings  im strongly tempted to send a challenge just to keep them in usethats because you despise meim a crack shotwe practised every day last winterwomen shoot much better than men because they dont make their hands unsteadywhat can be better than the guidance of ratia the feminine of ratio reason isnt it  it is not quite certain that this horrible latinity did not shock miss fennimores discreet pupil more than all the rest as a wilful insult to miss charlecotes education  she herself was not to escape the guidance of ratia after dinner  her silence had been an additional proof to the goodnatured rashe that she was a child to be protected and entertained so she paraded her through the rooms coaxed her to play when no one was listening showed her illustrated books and newfashioned puzzles and domineered over her so closely that she had not a moment in which to speak a word to her brother whom she saw disconsolately watching the hedge of gentlemen round lucy  was it wrong to feel so ungrateful to a person exclusively devoted to her entertainment for that entire evening  phoebe had never known a roommate nor the solace of a bedtime gossip and by the time miss charlecote began to think of opening the door between their rooms and discussing the disgusts of the day the sounds of moving about had ceased  honor looked in and could not help advancing to the bedside to enjoy the sight of the rosy face in the sound healthful sleep the lips unclosed and the silken brown hair wound plainly across the round brow the childish outline and expression of the features even sweeter in sleep than awake  it rested honoras wearied anxious spirit to watch the perfect repose of that innocent young face and she stood still for some minutes breathing an ejaculation that the child might ever be as guileless and peaceful as now and then sighing at the thought of other young sleepers beside whose couches even fonder prayers had been uttered only as it seemed to be blown aside  she was turning away when phoebe suddenly awoke and was for a moment startled half rising asking if anything were the matter  no my dear only i did not think you would have been in bed so quickly i came to wish you good night and found you asleep  and with the strong tender impulse of a gentle wounded spirit honor hung over the maiden recomposing the clothes and fondling her with a murmured blessing  dear miss charlecote whispered phoebe how nice it is  i have so often wondered what it would be like if any one came in to pet us at night as they do in books and oh it is so nice  say that again please  that was the blessing which would have made lucilla in angry reserve hide her head in the clothes    chapter vii       but ah me shes a heart of stone     which cupid uses for a hone        i verily believe     and on it sharpens those eyedarts     with which he wounds the simple hearts        he bribes her to deceivea coquette by x  breakfast was late and lengthened out by the greater lateness of many of the guests and the superlative tardiness of the lady of the house who had repudiated the cares of the hostess and left the teaequipage to her sisterinlaw  lucilla had been downstairs among the first and hurried away again after a rapid meal forbidding any one to follow her because she had so much to do and on entering the drawingroom she was found with a wilderness of flowers around her filling vases and making last arrangements  honora and phoebe were glad to be occupied and phoebe almost hoped to escape from rashe  speaking to lucilla was not possible for eloisa had been placed by rashe in a low chair with a saucer before her which she was directed to fill with verbenas while the other four ladies with owen whom his cousin had called to their aid were putting last touches to wreaths and giving the final festal air to the rooms  presently robert made his appearance as the bearer of mr prendergasts flowers and setting his back against a shutter in his favourite attitude stood looking as if he wanted to help but knew not how phoebe at least was vividly conscious of his presence but she was supporting a long festoon with which owen was adorning a pierglass and could hardly even turn her head to watch him  oh horrid cried lucilla retreating backwards to look at ratias performance for love or money a bit of clematis  where shall i find one said robert unseeing the masses waving on the cloister if good youth he even knew what clematis was  you there mr fulmort exclaimed rashe for goodness gracious sake go out to tennis or something with the other men  ive ordered them all out or therell be no good to be got out of cilly  phoebe flashed out in his defence you are letting owen alone  ah by the bye that wreath of yours has taken an unconscionable time said miss charteris beginning to laugh but phoebes grave straightforward eyes met her with such a look as absolutely silenced her merriment into a mere mutter of what a little chit it is  honora who was about indignantly to assume the protection of her charge recognized in her what was fully competent to take care of herself  away with both of you said lucilla here is edna come for a last rehearsal and i wont have you making her nervous  take away that robin will you owen  horatia flew gustily to greet and reassure the schoolmistress as she entered trembling although moving with the dignity that seemed to be her form of embarrassment  lucilla meanwhile sped to the others near the window  you must go she said or i shall never screw her up it is a sudden access of stage fright  she is as pale as death  owen stepped back to judge of the paleness and robert contrived to say cannot you grant me a few words lucy  the most impossible thing you could have asked she replied  theres rashes encouragement quite done for her now  she bounded back to the muchovercome edna while phoebe herself perceiving how illadvised an opportunity robert had chosen stepped out with him into the cloister saying she cant help it dear robin she cannot think just now  when can she he asked almost with asperity  think how full her hands are how much excited she is pleaded phoebe feeling that this was no fair moment for the crisis  ireland almost groaned robert but at the same moment grasped her roughly to hinder her from replying for owen was close upon them and he was the person to whom robert would have been most reluctant to display his feelings  catching intuitively at his meaning phoebe directed her attention to some clematis on the opposite side of the cloister and called both her companions to gather it for her glad to be with robert and to relieve miss murrell of the presence of another spectator  charles charteris coming up carried the two young men to inspect some of his doings out of doors and phoebe returned with her wreaths of creepers to find that the poor schoolmistress had become quite hysterical and had been take away by lucilla  rashe summoned her at the same time to the decoration of the musicroom and on entering stopped in amusement and made her a sign in silence to look into a large pierglass which stood so as to reflect through an open door what was passing in the little fanciful boudoir beyond a place fitted like a tent and full of quaint dresden china and toys of bijouterie  there was a complete picture within the glass  lucilla her fair face seen in profile more soft and gentle than she often allowed it to appear was kneeling beside the couch where half reclined the tall handsome edna whose raven hair and pale fine features made her like a heroine as she nervously held the hands which lucilla had placed within her grasp  there was a low murmur of voices one soothing the other half sobbing but nothing reached the outer room distinctly till as phoebe was holding a long wreath which ratia was tying up she heardoh but it is so different with me from you young ladies who are used to company and all  i dare say that young lady would not be timid  what young lady edna  not the one with the auburn hair  ratia made an ecstatic face which disgusted phoebe  oh nothe young lady whom mr sandbrook was helping  i dare say she would not mind singingor anything came amid sobs  ratia nodded looked excessively arch and formed a word with her lips which phoebe thought was jealous but could not imagine what she could mean by it  i dont know why you should think poor phoebe fulmort so brazen  she is a mere child taking a holiday from her strict governess  phoebe laughed back an answer to rashes pantomime which in this case she understood  she has not had half your training in boldness with your inspectors and examinations and all those horrid things  why you never thought of taking fright before even when you have sung to people here  why should you now  it is so different nowso many more people  oh so different  i shall never be able  not at all  you will quite forget all about yourself and your fears when the time comes  you dont know the exhilaration of a room full of people all lights and music  that symphony will lift you into another world and you will feel quite ready for men must work and women must weep  if i can only beginbut oh miss sandbrook shall you be far away from me  no i promise you not  i will bring you down if you will come to ratias room when you are dressed  the black silk and the lilac ribbon owen and i chose for you i must see you in it  dear miss sandbrook you are so kind  what shall i do when you have left  you are going yourself for the holidays silly puss  ah but no one else sympathizes or enters into my feelings  feelings said lucilla lightly yet sadly  dont indulge in them edna they are no end of a torment  ah but if they prey on one one cannot help it  rashe made a face of great distaste  phoebe felt as if it were becoming too confidential to permit of listening all the more as she heard lucillas reply  thats what comes of being tall and stately and dignified  theres so much less of me that i can carry off my troubles twice as well  oh dear miss sandbrook you can have no troubles  havent i  oh edna if you knew  you that have a mother can never know what it is to be like me  im keeping it all at bay lest i should break down but im in the horridest bother and trouble  not knowing what might come next ashamed of having listened to so much yet with one gleam of renewed hope phoebe resolutely disobeyed ratias frowns and gestures and made her presence known by decided movements and words spoken aloud  she saw the immediate effect in edna murrells violent start but lucilla without moving at once began to sing straining her thin though sweet voice as though to surmount a certain tremulousness  edna joined and the melody was lovely to hear but phoebe was longing all the time for robert to be at hand for this softer moment and she hoped all the more when the practising being over and edna dismissed lucy came springing towards her notifying her presence by a caressto outward appearance merely playful but in reality a convulsive clasp of vehement affectionand phoebe was sure that there had been tears in those eyes that seemed to do nothing but laugh  the security that this wild elf was true at heart was however not enough for phoebe  there was the knowledge that each moments delay would drive robert farther aloof and that it was a mere chance whether he should encounter this creature of impulse at a propitious instant nay who could tell what was best for him after all  even phoebes faithful acceptance of her on his word had undergone sundry severe shocks and she had rising doubts whether lucy such as she saw her could be what would make him happy  if the secrets of every guest at a fete were told would any be found unmixedly happy  would there be no one devoid of cares of their own or of other peoples or if exempt from these undisturbed by the absence of the right individual or by the presence of the wrong one by mishaps of deportment difficulties of dress or want of notice  perhaps after all it may be best to have some one abiding anxiety strong enough to destroy tedium and exclude the pettier distresses which are harder to contend with though less dignified and most wholesome of all is it that this should be an interest entirely external  so after all phoebes enjoyment might hardly have been increased had her thoughts been more free from robins troubles when she came down dressed for her first party so like a lily of the valley in her delicate dress that owen acknowledged that it justified her choice and murmured something of in vernal green and virgin white her festal robes arrayed  phoebe was only distressed at what she thought the profanation of quoting from such a source in compliment to her  honora was gratified to find the lines in his memory upon any terms  poor dear honor in one case at least believing all things hoping all things  phoebe ought to have made the most of her compliment  it was all she obtained in that line  juliana herself could not have taken umbrage at her success  nobody imagined her come out no one attempted to disturb her from under miss charlecotes wing and she kept close to her the whole afternoon sometimes sitting upon a haycock sometimes walking in the shrubbery listening to the band or looking at the archery in company with dignified clergyman or elderly lady astonished to meet honor charlecote in so unwonted a scene  owen sandbrook was never far off  he took them to eat ices conducted them to good points of view found seats for them and told them who every one was with droll comments or anecdotes which entertained them so much that phoebe almost wished that robin had not made her sensible of the grain of irreverence that seasoned all owens most brilliant sallies  they saw little of the others  mr and mrs charteris walked about together the one cordial the other stately and gorgeous and miss charlecote came in for her due and passing share of their politeness rashe once invited phoebe to shoot but had too many on her hands to be solicitous about one  flirting no longer herself rashes delight was in those who did flirt and in any assembly her extreme and unscrupulous goodnature made her invaluable to all who wanted to have themselves taken off their own hands or pushed into those of others  she ordered people about started amusements hunted gentlemen up found partners and shook up the bashful  rashe charteris was the life of everything how little was wanting to make her kindhearted activity admirable  lucilla never came in their way at all  she was only seen in full and eager occupation embellishing the archery or forcing the decidedly pious to be fascinated by her gracious selfadaptation  robert was equally inaccessible always watching her but keeping aloof from his sister and only consorting at times with mr prendergast  it was seven oclock when this act of the drama was finally over and the parties staying in the house met round a hurried meal  rashe lounging and yawning laughing and quizzing in a way amazing to phoebe lucilla in the very summit of spirits rattling and laughing away in full swing thence the party dispersed to dress but honora had no sooner reached her room than she said i must go and find lucy  i must do my duty by her little hope as i have  she has avoided me all day i must seek her now  what a difference time and discipline had made in one formerly so timid and gentle as to be alarmed at the least encounter and nervous at wandering about a strange house  nervous and frightened indeed she still was but selfcontrol kept this in check and her dislike was not allowed to hold her back from her duty  humfreys representative was seldom permitted to be weak  but there are times when the difference between man and woman is felt in their dealings with others  strength can be mild but what is strained can seldom be gentle and when she knocked at horatia charteriss door her face from very unhappiness and effort was sorrowfully reproachful as she felt herself an unwelcome apparition to the two cousins who lay on their bed still laughing over the days events  rashe who was still in her morning dress at once gave way saying she must go and speak to lolly and hastened out of the room  lucy in her dishabille sat crouched upon the bed her white bare shoulders and floating hair together with the defiant glance of the blue eye and the hand moodily compressing the lips reminding honor of the little creature who had been summarily carried into her house sixteen years since  she came towards her but there was no invitation to give the caress that she yearned to bestow and she leant against the bed trembling as she said lucy my poor child i am come that you may not throw away your last chance without knowing it  you do not realize what you are about  if you cast aside esteem and reliance how can you expect to retain the affection you sometimes seem to prize  if i am not trusted whats the good of affection  how can you expect trust when you go beyond the bounds of discretion said honor with voice scarcely steadied into her desired firmness  i can i do  lucy listen to me  she gave way to her natural piteous pleading tone i verily believe that this is the very turn  remember how often a moment has decided the fate of a life  she saw the expression relax into some alarm and continued the fulmorts do not say so but i see by their manner that his final decision will be influenced by your present proceedings  you have trifled with him too long and with his mind made up to the ministry he cannot continue to think of one who persists in outraging decorum  those words were effort enough and had better have been unsaid  that is as people may think was all the answer  as he thinks  how do i know what he thinks  heartsick at such mere fencing honor was silent at first then said i for one shall rate your good opinion by your endeavour to deserve it who can suppose that you value what you are willing to risk for an unladylike bet or an unfeminine sporting expedition  you may tell him so said lucilla her voice quivering with passion  you think a look will bring him back but you may find that a true man is no slave  prove his affection misplaced and he will tear it away  had honora been discreet as she was good she would have left those words to settle down but woman that she was she knew not when to stop and coaxingly coming to the small bundle of perverseness she touched the shoulder and said now you wont make an object of yourself tonight  the shoulder shook in the old fashion  at least you will not go to ireland  yes i shall  miss charlecote i beg your pardon cried rashe bursting inoh that she had been five seconds earlierbut dressing is imperative people are beginning to come  honora retreated in utter discomfiture  rashe  rashe  im in for it cried lucilla as the door shut springing up with a look of terror  proposed by deputy exclaimed horatia aghast  no no gasped lucilla its this ireland of yoursthatthat and she wellnigh sobbed  my bonny bell  i knew you would not be bullied into deserting  oh rashe she was very hard on me  every one is but you and lucilla threw herself into her cousins arms in a paroxysm of feeling but their maids knock brought her back to composure sooner than poor honora who shed many a tear over this last defeat as looking mournfully to phoebe she said i have done phoebe  i can say no more to her  she will not hear anything from me  oh what have i done that my child should be hardened against me  phoebe could offer nothing but caresses full of indignant sorrow and there was evidently soothing in them for miss charlecotes tears became softer and she fondly smoothed phoebes fair hair saying as she drew the clinging arms closer round her my little woodbine you must twine round your brother and comfort him but you can spare some sweetness for me too  there i will dress  i will not keep you from the party  i do not care for that only to see robin  we must take our place in the crowd sighed honora beginning her toilet and you will enjoy it when you are there  your first quadrille is promised to owen is it not  yes said phoebe dreamily and she would have gone back to robins sorrows but honora had learnt that there were subjects to be set aside when it was incumbent on her to be presentable and directed the talk to speculations whether the poor schoolmistress would have nerve to sing and somehow she talked up phoebes spirits to such a hopeful pitch that the little maiden absolutely was crossed by a gleam of satisfaction from the ungrateful recollection that poor miss charlecote had done with the affair  against her will she had detected the antagonism between the two and bad as it was of lucy was certain that she was more likely to be amenable where there was no interference from her best friend  the musicroom was already crowded when the two made their way into it and honoras inclination was to deposit herself on the nearest seat but she owed something otherwise to her young charge and phoebes eyes had already found a lonely black figure with arms crossed and lowering brow simultaneously they moved towards him and he towards them  is she come down he asked  phoebe shook her head but at the same moment another door near the orchestra admitted a small white butterfly figure leading in a tall queenly apparition in black whom she placed in a chair adjacent to the bejewelled prima donna of the nighta great contrast with her dustcoloured german hair and complexion and goodnatured plain face  roberts face cleared with relief he evidently detected nothing outre in lucillas aspect and was rejoicing in the concession  womans eyes saw further a sigh from honora an amused murmur around him caused him to bend his looks on phoebe  she knew his eyes were interrogating her but could not bear to let her own reply and kept them on the ground  he was moving towards lucilla who having consigned her protegee to the goodhumoured german had come more among the guests and was exchanging greetings and answering comments with all her most brilliant airs of saucy animation  and who could quarrel with that fairy vision  her rich doubleskirted watered silk was bordered with exquisitely made and coloured flies radiant with the hues of the peacock the gold pheasant the jay parrots of all tints everything rich and rare in plumage  a coronal of the same encircled her glossy hair the tiny plumes contrasting with the blonde ringlets and the bona fide hooks ostentatiously displayed lesser and more innocuous flies edged the sleeves corsage shoes and gloves and her fan which she used as skilfully as jenny wren presented a watteaulike picture of an angling scene  anything more daintily quaintly pretty could not be imagined and the male part of the assembly would have unanimously concurred in sir harry bullers three cheers for the queen of the anglers  but towards the party most concerned in her movements lucilla came not and phoebe understanding a desire to keep as near as might be to miss murrell tried to suggest it as the cause and looking round saw owen standing by miss charlecote with somewhat of an uneasy countenance  terribly hot here he said restlessly suffocating arent you honor  come and take a turn in the cloister the fountain is stunning by moonlight  no proposal could have been more agreeable to honora and phoebe was afraid of losing her chaperon though she would rather have adhered to her brother and the barbs of that wicked little angler were tearing him far too deeply to permit him to move out of sight of his tormentor  but for this the change would have been delicious  the white lights and deep shadows from the calm grave moon contrasted with the long gleams of lamplight from every window reddened by the curtains within the flowers shone out with a strange whiteness the taller ones almost like spiritual shapes the burnished orange leaves glistened the water rose high in silvery spray and fell back into the blackness of the basin made more visible by one trembling shimmering reflection the dark blue sky above seemed shut into a vault by the enclosing buildings and one solitary planet shone out in the lustrous neighbourhood of the moon  so still so solemn so cool  honora felt it as repose and pensively began to admireowen chimed in with her  feverish thoughts and perturbations were always gladly soothed away in her company  phoebe alone stood barely confessing the beauty and suppressing impatience at their making so much of it not yet knowing enough of care or passion to seek repose and much more absorbed in human than in any other form of nature  the music was her first hope of deliverance from her namesake in the sky but behold her companions chose to prefer hearing that grand instrumental piece softened by distance and even madame hedwigs quivering notes did not bring them in  however at the first sounds of the accompaniment to the three fishers wives owen pulled back the curtain and handed the two ladies back into the room by a window much nearer to the orchestra than that by which they had gone out not far from where edna murrell had just risen her hands nervously clasped together her colour rapidly varying and her eyes roaming about as though in quest of something  indeed through all the music the slight sounds of the entrance at the window did not escape her and at the instant when she should have begun to sing phoebe felt those black eyes levelled on herself with a look that startled her they were at once removed the head turned away there was an attempt at the first words but they died away on her lips there was a sudden whiteness lucilla and the german both tried to reseat her but with readier judgment owen made two long steps gathered her up in his strong arms and bore her through the curtains and out at the open window like a mere infant  dont come dontit will only make more fussnobody has seen  go to madame hedwig tell her from me to go on to her next and cover her retreat said lucilla as fast as the words would come signing back honora and hastily disappearing between the curtains  there was a command in lucillas gestures which always made obedience the first instinct even with honora and her impulse to assist thus counteracted she had time to recollect that lucy might be supposed to know best what to do with the schoolmistress and that to dispose of her among her ladies maid friends was doubtless the kindest measure  i must say i am glad she said the poor thing cannot be quite so much spoilt as they wished  the concert proceeded and in the next pause honor fell into conversation with a pleasant lady who had brought one pair of young daughters in the morning and now was doing the same duty by an elder pair  phoebe was standing near the window when a touch on her arm and a whispered help hush made her look round  holding the curtain apart so as to form the least possible aperture and with one finger on her lip was lucys face the eyes brimming over with laughter as she pointed to her headthree of the hooks had set their barbs deep into the crimson satin curtain and held her a prisoner  hush  ill never forgive you if you betray me she whispered drawing phoebe by the arm behind the curtain i should expire on the spot to be found in absaloms case  all that little gooses faulti never reckoned on having to rush about this way  cant you do it  dont spare scissors and lucilla produced a pair from under her skirt  rashe and i always go provided  how is shewhere is she asked phoebe  thats exactly what i cant tell  he took her out to the fountain she was quite like a dead thing  water wouldnt make her come to and i ran for some salts i wouldnt call anybody for it was too romantic a condition to have owen discovered in with a fainting maiden in his arms such a rummage as i had  my own things are all jumbled up i dont know how and rashe keeps nothing bigger than globules only fit for fainting ladybirds so i went to lollys but her bottles have all gold heads and are full of uncannylooking compounds and i made a raid at last on sweet honeys rational old dressingcase poked out her keys from her pocket and got in wasting interminable time  well when i got back to my fainting damsel non est inventus  inventa murmured the spirit of miss fennimore within phoebe  but what had she got well  so i suppose  gone off to the servants rooms no doubt as there is no white lady in the fountain to spirit them both away  what havent you done that yet  oh lucy stand still please or youll get another hook in  give me the scissors i know i could do it quicker  never mind the curtain i say nobody will care  she put up her hand and shook head and feet to the entanglement of a third hook but phoebe decided damsel that she was used her superior height to keep her mastery held up the scissors pressed the fidgety shoulder into quiescence and kept her down while she extricated her without fatal detriment to the satin though with scanty thanks for the liberation was no sooner accomplished than the sprite was off throwing out a word about rashe wanting her  phoebe emerged to find that she had not been missed and presently the concert was over and tea coming round there was a change of places robert came towards her  i am going he said  oh robert when dancing would be one chance  she does not mean to give me that chance i would not ask it while she is in that dress  it is answer sufficient  good night phoebe enjoy yourself  enjoy herself  a fine injunction when her brother was going away in such a mood  yet who would have suspected that rosy honest apple face of any grievance save that her partner was missing  honora was vexed and concerned at his neglect but phoebe appeased her by reporting what lucy had said  thoughtless reckless sighed honora if lucy would leave the poor girl on his hands of course he is obliged to make some arrangement for getting her home  i never knew such people as they are here  well phoebe you shall have a partner next time  phoebe had one thanks chiefly to rashe and somehow the rapid motion shook her out of her troubles and made her care much less for robins sorrows than she had done two minutes before  she was much more absorbed in hopes for another partner  alas he did not come neither then nor for the ensuing  owens value began to rise  miss charlecote did not again bestir herself in the cause partly from abstract hatred of waltzes partly from the constant expectation of owens reappearance and latterly from being occupied in a discussion with the excellent mother upon young girls reading novels  at last after a galoppe at which phoebe had looked on with wishful eyes lucilla dropped breathless into the chair which she relinquished to her  well phoebe how do you like it  oh very much rather ruefully at least it would be if  if you had any partners eh poor child  hasnt owen turned up  its that billiardroom i tried to make charlie shut it up  but well disinter him ill rush in like a skyrocket and scatter the gentlemen to all quarters  no no dont cried phoebe alarmed and catching hold of her  it is not that but robin is gone  atrocious returned cilly disconcerted but resolved that phoebe should not perceive it so we are both under a severe inflictionboth ashamed of our brothers  i am not ashamed of mine said phoebe in a tone of gravity  ah theres the truant said lucilla turning aside  owen where have you hidden yourself  i hope you are ready to sink into the earth with shame at hearing you have rubbed off the bloom from a young ladys first ball  no it was not he who did so stoutly replied phoebe  ah it was all the consequence of the green and white i told you it was a sinister omen said owen chasing away a shade of perplexity from his brow and assuming a certain air that phoebe had never seen before and did not like  at least you will be merciful and allow me to retrieve my character  you had nothing to retrieve said phoebe in the most straightforward manner it was very good in you to take care of poor miss murrell  what became of her  lucy said you would know  ii he exclaimed so vehemently as to startle her by the fear of having ignorantly committed some egregious blunder im the last person to know  the last to be seen with the murdered always falls under suspicion said lucilla  drowned in the fountain cried owen affecting horror  then you must have done it said his sister for when i came back after ransacking the house for salts you had both disappeared  have you been washing your hands all this time after the murder  nothing can clear me but an appeal to the fountain said owen will you come and look in phoebe  it is more delicious than ever  but phoebe had had enough of the moonlight did not relish the subject and was not pleased with owens manner so she refused by a most decided no thank you causing lucy to laugh at her for thinking owen dangerous  at least you will vouchsafe to trust yourself with me for the lancers said owen as cillas partner came to claim her and phoebe rejoiced in anything to change the tone of the conversation still however asking as he led her off what had become of the poor schoolmistress  gone home very sensibly said owen if she is wise she will know how to trust to cillys invitations  people that do everything at once never do anything well  it is quite a rest to turn to any one like you phoebe who are content with one thing at a time  i wish  well then let us dance said phoebe abruptly i cant do that well enough to talk too  it was not that owen had not said the like things to her many times before it was his eagerness and fervour that gave her an uncomfortable feeling  she was not sure that he was not laughing at her by putting on these devoted airs and she felt herself grown up enough to put an end to being treated as a child  he made her a profound bow in a mockery of acquiescence and preserved absolute silence during the first figures but she caught his eye several times gazing on her with looks such as another might have interpreted into mingled regret and admiration but which were to her simply discomfiting and disagreeable and when he spoke again it was not in banter but half in sadness  phoebe how do you like all this  i think i could like it very much  i am almost sorry to hear you say so anything that should tend to make you resemble others is detestable  i should be very sorry not to be like other people  phoebe you do not know how much of the pleasure of my life would be lost if you were to become a mere conventional young lady  phoebe had no notion of being the pleasure of any ones life except robins and marias and was rather affronted that owen should profess to enjoy her childish ignorance and naivete  i believe she said i was rude just now when i told you not to talk i am sorry for it i shall know better next time  your knowing better is exactly what i deprecate  but there it is unconsciousness is the charm of simplicity  it is the very thing aimed at by rashe and cilly and all their crew with their eccentricities  i am sorry for it seriously returned phoebe who had by this time by quiet resistance caused him to land her under the lee of miss charlecote instead of promenading with her about the room  he wanted her to dance with him again saying she owed it to him for having sacrificed the first to common humanity but great as was the pleasure of a polka she shrank from him in this complimentary mood and declared she should dance no more that evening  he appealed to honora who disliking to have her boy balked of even a polka asked phoebe if she were very tired and considering her rather not as equivalent to such a confession proposed a retreat to their own room  phoebe was sorry to leave the brilliant scene and no longer to be able to watch lucilla but she wanted to shake owen off and readily consented  she shut her door after one good night  she was too much grieved and disappointed to converse and could not bear to discuss whether the last hope were indeed gone and whether lucilla had decided her lot without choosing to know it  alas how many turningpoints may be missed by those who never watch  how little did phoebe herself perceive the shoal past which her selfrespect had just safely guided her  i wonder if those were ballroom manners  what a pity if they were for then i shall not like balls was all the thought that she had leisure to bestow on her own share in the nights diversions as through the subsequent hours she dozed and dreamt and mused and slept again with the feverish limbs and cramptormented feet of one new to balls sometimes teased by entangling fishing flies sometimes interminably detained in the moonlight sometimes with miss fennimore waiting for an exercise and the words not to be found in the dictionary and even this unpleasant counterfeit of sleep deserting her after her usual time for waking and leaving her to construct various fabrics of possibilities for robin and lucy  she was up in fair time and had written a long and particular account to bertha of everything in the festivities not recorded in this narrative before miss charlecote awoke from the compensating morning slumber that had succeeded a sad and unrestful night  late as they were they were downstairs before any one but the wellseasoned rashe who sat beguiling the time with a bradshaw and who did not tell them how intolerably cross cilly had been all the morning  nor would any one have suspected it who had seen her last of all come down at a quarter to eleven in the most exultant spirits talking the height of rodomontade with the gentlemen guests and dallying with her breakfast while phoebes heart was throbbing at the sight of two grave figures her brother and the curate slowly marching up and down the cloister in waiting till this was over  and there sat lucilla inventing adventures for an imaginary tour to be brought out on her return by the name of girls in galwayfrom the soiree to the salmonflirts and foolsheads as owen and charles discontentedly muttered to each other or as mr calthorp proposed the angels and the anglers  the ball was to be the opening chapter  lord william entreated for her costume as the frontispiece and mr calthorp begged her to reassume it and let her cousin photograph her on the spot  lucilla objected to the impracticability of white silk the inconvenience of unpacking the apparatus the nuisance of dressing the lack of time but rashe was delighted with the idea and made light of all and the gentlemen pressed her strongly till with rather more of a consent than a refusal she rose from her nearly untasted breakfast and began to move away  cilla said mr prendergast at the window can i have a word with you  at your service she answered as she came out to him and saw that robert had left him  only be quick they want to photograph me in my balldress  you wont let them do it though said the curate  white comes out hideous said lucilla i suppose you would not have a copy if i took one off for you  no i dont like those visitors of yours well enough to see you turned into a merryandrew to please them  so thats what robert fulmort told you i did last night said lucilla blushing at last and thoroughly  no indeed you didnt he said regarding her with an astonished glance  i did wear a dress trimmed with salmonflies because of a bet with lord william said lucilla the suffusion deepening on brow cheek and throat as the confiding esteem of her fatherly friend effected what nothing else could accomplish  she would have given the world to have justified his opinion of his late rectors little daughter and her spirits seemed gone though the worst he did was to shake his head at her  if you did not know it why did you call me that she asked  a merryandrew he answered i never meant that you had been one  no only an old friend like me doesnt like the notion of your going and dressing up in the morning to amuse a lot of scamps  i wont said lucilla very low  well then began mr prendergast as in haste to proceed to his own subject but she cut him short  it is not about ireland  no i know nothing about young ladies and if mr charteris and your excellent friend there have nothing to say against it i cant  my excellent friend had so much to say against it that i was pestered into vowing i would go  tell me not mr prendergasti should not mind giving up to you and she looked full of hope  that would be beginning at the wrong end cilla you are not my charge  you are my clergyman she said pettishly  you are not my parishioner he answered  pish she said when you know i want you to tell me  why you say you have made the engagement  so what i said when she fretted me past endurance must bind me  be it observed that like all who only knew hiltonbury through lucilla mr prendergast attributed any blemishes which he might detect in her to the injudicious training of an old maid so he sympathized  ah ladies of a certain age never get on with young ones  but i thought it was all settled before with miss charteris  i never quite said i would go only we got ready for the sake of the fun of talking of it and now rashe has grown horridly eager about it  she did not care at firstonly to please me  then wouldnt it be using her ill to disappoint her now  you couldnt do it cilla  why you have given your word and she is quite old enough for anything  wouldnt miss charlecote see it so  to regard ratia as a mature personage robbed the project of romance and to find herself bound in honour by her inconsiderate rattle was one of the rude shocks which often occur to the indiscriminate of tongue but the curate had too much on his mind to dwell on what concerned him more remotely and proceeded i came to see whether you could help me about poor miss murrell  you made no arrangement for her getting home last night  no  ah you young people  but it is my fault i should have recollected young heads  then i am afraid it must have been  what  she was seen on the river very late last night with a stranger  he went up to the school with her remained about a quarter of an hour and then rowed up the river again  i am afraid it is not the first time she has been seen with him  but mr prendergast she was here till at least ten  she fainted away just as she was to have sung and we carried her out into the cloister when she recovered she went away to the housekeepers room a bold assertion built on owens partially heard reply to phoebe  ill ask the maids  it is of no use cilla she allows it herself  and pray cried lucilla rallying her sauciness how do you propose ever to have banns to publish if young men and maidens are never to meet by water nor by land  then you do know something  no only that such matters are not commonly blazoned in the commencement  i dont wish her to blazon it but if she would only act openly by me said the distressed curate  i wish nothing more than that she was safe married and then if you ladies appoint another beauty ill give up the place and live at  college  well advertise for the female chimpanzee and depend upon it she will marry at the end of six weeks  so you have attacked her in person  what did she say  nothing that she could help  she stood with those great eyes cast down looking like a statue and sometimes vouchsafing yes sir or no sir  it was no sir when i asked if her mother knew  i am afraid it must be something very unsatisfactory cilla but she might say more to you if you were not going away  oh mr prendergast why did you not come sooner  i did come an hour ago but you were not come down  ill walk on at once the carriage can pick me up  ill fetch my hat poor edna  ill soon make her satisfy your mind  has any one surmised who it can be  the notion is that it is one of your musiciansvery dangerous i am afraid and i say cilla did you ever do such a thingyou couldnt i supposeas lend her shelleys poems  i  no certainly not  there was a copy lying on the table in her little parlour as if she had been writing something out from it  it is very odd but it was in that peculiar olivegreen morocco that some of the books in your fathers library were bound in  not mine certainly said lucilla  good honor charlecote would have run crazy if she thought i had touched a shelley a very odd study for edna  but as to the olivegreen of course it was bound under the same star as ours  cilly cilly now or never photograph or not screamed rashe from behind her threelegged camera  not was lucillas cavalier answer  pack up have done with it rashe  pick me up at the school  away she flew headlong the patient and disconcerted horatia following her to her room to extract hurried explanations and worse than no answers as to the sundries to be packed at the last moment while she hastily put on hat and mantle and was flying down again when her brother with outspread arms nearly caught her in her spring  hollo whats up  dont stop me owen  im going to walk on with mr prendergast and be picked up  i must speak to edna murrell  nonsense  the carriage will be out in five minutes  i must go owen  theres some story of a demon in human shape on the water with her last night and mr prendergast cant get a word out of her  is that any reason you should go ramping about prying into peoples affairs  but owen they will send her away  they will take away her character  thethethe more reason you should have nothing to do with it he exclaimed  it is no business for you and i wont have you meddle in it  such a strong and sudden assumption of fraternal authority took away her breath and then in terror lest he should know cause for this detention she said  owen you dont guess who it was  how should i he roughly answered  some villainous slander of course there is but it is no business of yours to be straking off to make it worse  i should not make it worse  women always make things worse  are you satisfied now as the carriage was seen coming round  that is only to be packed  packed with folly yes  look here  1120 and the train at 125  i will miss the train go up later and sleep in london  stuff and nonsense  who is going to take you  not i  in lucillas desperation in the cause of her favourite edna she went through a rapid selfdebate  honor would gladly wait for her for such a cause she could sleep at woolstonelane and thence go on to join horatia in derbyshire escorted by a hiltonbury servant  but what would that entail  she would be at their mercy  robert would obtain his advantageit would be all over with her  pride arose ednas cause sank  how many destinies were fixed in the few seconds while she stood with one foot forward spinning her black hat by the elastic band  too late mr prendergast i cannot go she said as she saw him waiting for her at the door  dont be angry with me and dont let the womankind prejudice you against poor edna  you forgive me  it is really too late  forgive you smiled mr prendergast pressing her caressing hand in his great lank grasp what for  oh because it is too late and i cant help it  but dont be hard with her  goodbye  too late  why did lucilla repeat those words so often  was it a relief to that irreflective nature to believe the die irrevocably cast and the responsibility of decision over  or why did she ask forgiveness of the only one whom she was not offending but because there was a sense of need of pardon where she would not stoop to ask it  miss charlecote and the fulmorts rashe and cilly were to be transported to london by the same train leaving owen behind to help charles charteris entertain some guests still remaining honora promising him to wait in town until lucilla should absolutely have started for ireland when she would supply him with the means of pursuit  lucillas delay and change of mind made the final departure so late that it was needful to drive excessively fast and the train was barely caught in time  the party were obliged to separate and robert took phoebe into a different carriage from that where the other three found places  in the ten minutes transit by railway lucy always softened by parting was like another being towards honor and talked eagerly of coming home for christmas sent messages to hiltonbury friends and did everything short of retractation to efface the painful impression she had left  sweetest honey she whispered as they moved on after the tickets had been taken thrusting her pretty head over into honors place  nobodys looking give me a kiss and say you dont bear malice though your kitten has been in a scratching humour  malice no indeed said honor fondly but oh remember dear child that frolics may be at too dear a price  she longed to say more but the final stop was made and their roads diverged  honor thought that lucy looked white and trembling with an uneasy eye as though she would have given much to have been going home with her  nor was the consoling fancy unfounded  lucillas nerves were not at their usual pitch and an undefined sense of loss of a safeguard was coming over her  moreover the desire for a last word to robert was growing every moment and he would keep on hunting out those boxes as if they mattered to anybody  she turned round on his substitute and said ive not spoken to robin all this time  no wonder his feathers are ruffled  make my peace with him phoebe dear  on the very platform in that moment of bustle phoebe conscientiously and reasonably began will you tell me how much you mean by that  cillykingscross115 cried ratia snatching at her arm  oh the slave one is  next time we meet phoebe the redbreast will be in a white tie i shall  hurry and agitation were making her flippant and robert was nearer than she deemed  he was assisting her to her seat and then held out his hand but never raised his eyes  goodbye robin she said reason herself shall meet you at the holt at christmas  goodbye he said but without a word of augury and loosed her hand her fingers clung one moment but he drew his away called kingscross to the coachman and she was whirled off  angler as she was she no longer felt her prey answer her pull  had the line snapped  when owen next appeared in woolstonelane he looked fagged and harassed but talked of all things in sky earth or air politics literature or gossip took the bottom of the table and treated the parsonses as his guests  honora however felt that something was amiss perhaps lucilla engaged to lord william and when after luncheon he followed her to the cedar room she began with a desponding well  well she is off  alone with rashe  alone with rashe  why sweet honey you look gratified  i had begun to fear some fresh news said honor smiling with effort i am sure that something is wrong  you do not look well my dear  how flushed you are and your forehead is so hot as she put her hand on his brow  oh nothing he said caressingly holding it there  im glad to have got away from the castle charlie and his set drink an intolerable lot of wine  ill not be there again in a hurry  i am glad of that  i wish you had come away with us  i wish to heaven i had cried owen but it could not be helped  so now for my wildgoose chase  cross tomorrow night only you were good enough to say you would find ways and means  there that is what i intended including your midsummer quarter  dont you think it enough as she detected a look of dissatisfaction  you are very good  it is a tremendous shame but you see honor dear when one is across the water one may as well go the whole animal  if this wise sister of mine does not get into a mess there is a good deal i could doplenty of sport  little henniker and some westminster fellows in the th are at kilkenny  you would like to spend the vacation in ireland said honor with some disappointment  well if you go for my pleasure it is but fair you should have your own  shall i advance your september allowance  thank you  you do spoil one abominably you concoction of honey and all things sweet  but the fact is ive got uncommonly hardup of late no one would believe how ruinous it is being with the charterises  i believe money evaporates in the atmosphere  betting asked honor gasping and aghast  on my honour i assure you not there cried owen eagerly i never did bet there but once and that was lollys doing and i could not get out of it  jew that she is  i wonder what uncle kit would say to that house now  you are out of it and i shall not regret the purchase of your disgust at their ways owen  it may be better for you to be in ireland than to be tempted to go to them for the shooting season  how much do you want you know my dear if there be anything else i had rather pay anything that is right than have you in debt  you were always the sweetest best honey living cried owen with much agitation and it is a shame but there he stopped and ended in a more ordinary toneshame to prey on you as we both do and with no better return  never mind dear owen she said with moisture in her eye your real happiness is the only return i want  come tell me your difficulty most likely i can help you  ive nothing to tell said owen with alarmed impetuosity only that im a fool like every one else andandif you would only double that  double that  owen things cannot be right  i told you they were not right was the impatient answer or i should not be vexing you and myself and as though to smooth away his rough commencement what a comfort to have a honey that will have patience  she shook her head perplexed  owen i wish you could tell me more  i do not like debts  you know dear boy i grudge nothing i can do for you in my lifetime but for your own sake you must learn not to spend more than you will be able to afford  indulgence now will be a penance to you by and by  honora dreaded overdoing lectures to owen  she knew that an old maids advice to a young man was dangerous work and her boys submissive patience always excited her gratitude and forbearance so she desisted in hopes of a confession looking at him with such tenderness that he was moved to exclaimhonor dear you are the best and worstused woman on earth  would to heaven that we had requited you better  i have no cause of complaint against you owen she said fondly you have always been the joy and comfort of my heart and as he turned aside as though stricken by the words whatever you may have to reproach yourself with it is not with hurting me i only wish to remind you of higher and more stringent duties than those to myself  if you have erred as i cannot but fear will you not let me try and smooth the way back  impossible murmured owen there are things that can never be undone  not undone but repented said honor convinced that he had been led astray by his cousin charles and felt bound not to expose him so repented as to become steppingstones in our progress  he only shook his head with a groan  the more sorrow the better hope she began but the impatient movement of his foot warned her that she was only torturing him and she proceededwell i trust you implicitly i can understand that there may be confidences that ought not to pass between us and will give you what you require to help you out of your difficulty  i wish you had a father or any one who could be of more use to you my poor boy and she began to fill up the cheque to the utmost of his demand  it is too muchtoo much cried owen  honor i must tell you at all costs  what will you think when  i do not wish to purchase a confession owen she said you know best whether it be a fit one to make to me or whether for the sake of others you ought to withhold it  he was checked and did not answer  i see how it is continued honor my boy as far as i am concerned i look on your confession as made  you will be much alone while thus hovering near your sister among the mountains and by the streams  let it be a time of reflection and of making your peace with another  you may do so the more earnestly for not having cast off the burthen on me  you are no child now to whom your poor honeys pardon almost seems an absolution  i sometimes think we went on with that too long  no fear of my ever being a boy again said owen heavily as he put the draft into his purse and then bent his tall person to kiss her with the caressing fondness of his childhood almost compensating for what his sister caused her to undergo  then at the door he turned to say remember you would not hear  he was gone having left a thorn with honor in the doubt whether she ought not to have accepted his confidence but her abstinence had been such a mortification both of curiosity and of hostility to the charterises that she could not but commend herself for it  she had strong faith in the efficacy of trust upon an honourable mind and though it was evident that owen had in his own eyes greatly transgressed she reserved the hope that his error was magnified by his own consciousness and admired the generosity that refused to betray another  she believed his present suffering to be the beginning of that growth in true religion which is often founded on some shock leading to selfdistrust  alas how many falls have been counted by mothers as the preludes to rising again like the clearing showers of a stormy day    chapter viii       fearless she had tracked his feet     to this rocky wild retreat     and when morning met his view     her mild glances met it too     ah your saints have cruel hearts     sternly from his bed he starts     and with rude repulsive shock     hurls her from the beetling rockt moore  the deed was done  conventionalities were defied vaunts fulfilled and lucilla sat on a campstool on the deck of a steamer watching the welsh mountains rise grow dim and vanish gradually  horatia in common with all the rest of the womankind was prostrate on the cabin floor treating cillys smiles and roses as aggravations of her misery  had there been a sharer in her exultation the gay pitching and dancing of the steamer would have been charming to lucy but when she retreated from the scene of wretchedness below she felt herself lonely and was conscious of some surprise among the surviving gentlemen at her reappearance  she took out a book as a protection and read more continuously than she had done since vanity fair had come to the holt and she had been pleased to mark honoras annoyance at every page she turned  but the july light faded and only left her the poor amusement of looking over the side for the phosphorescence of the water and watching the smoke of the funnel lose itself overhead  the silent stars and sparkling waves would have set phoebes dutiful science on the alert or transported honors inward ear by the chant of creation but to her they were of moderate interest and her imagination fell a prey to the memory of the eyes averted and hand withdrawn  ill be exemplary when this is over said she to herself and at length her head nodded till she dropped into a giddy doze whence with a chilly start she awoke as the monotonous jog and bounce of the steamer were exchanged for a snort of arrival among mysterious lanes of sparkling lights apparently rising from the waters  she had slept just long enough to lose the lovely entrance of dublin bay stiffen her limbs and confuse her brains and she stood still as the stream of passengers began to rush trampling by her feeling bewildered and forlorn  her cousins voice was welcome though overloud and somewhat piteous  where are you stewardess wheres the young lady oh cilly there you are  to leave me alone all this time and heres the stewardess saying we must go ashore at once or lose the train  oh the luggage and ive lost my plaid and ghastly in the lamplight limp and tottering rashe charteris clasped her arm for support and made her feel doubly savage and bewildered  her first movement was to enjoin silence then to gaze about for the goods  a gentleman took pity on the two ladies and told them not to be deluded into trying to catch the train there would be another in an hours time and if they had any one to meet them they would most easily be found where they were  we have no onewe are alone said lucilla and his chivalry was so far awakened that he handed them to the pier and undertook to find their boxes  rashe was absolutely subdued and hung shivering and helpless on her cousin who felt as though dreaming in the strange scene of darkness made visible by the bright circles round the lamps across which rapidly flitted the cloaked forms of travellers presiding over queer wild caricaturelike shapes each bending low under the weight of trunk or bag in a procession like a magic lantern save for the babel of shrieks cries and expostulations everywhere in light or gloom  a bell rang an engine roared and rattled off  the train sighed horatia we shall have to stay here all night  nonsense said lucy ready to shake her there is another in an hour stay quiet do or he will never find us  porter maamporrterr  no no thank you cried lucilla darting on her rodcase and carriagebag to rescue them from a freckled countenance with claws attached  we shall lose everything cilla thats your trusting to a stranger  all right thank you as she recognized her possessions borne on various backs towards the station whither the traveller escorted them and where things looked more civilized  ratia began to resume her senses though weak and hungry  she was sorely discomfited at having to wait and could not like the seasoned voyagers settle herself to repose on the long leathern couches of the waitingroom but wandered woebegone and impatient scolding her cousin for choosing such an hour for their passage for her desertion and general bad management  the merry goodnatured rashe had disappeared in the seasick cross and weary wight whose sole solace was grumbling but her dolefulness only made lucilla more mirthful  here they were and happen what would it should only be such fun  recovered from the moments bewilderment lucy announced that she felt as if she were at a ball and whispered a proposal of astonishing the natives by a polka in the great empty boarded space  the suggestion would immortalize us come  and she threatened mischievously to seize the waist of the still giddy and achingheaded horatia who repulsed her with sufficient roughness and alarm to set her off laughing at having been supposed to be in earnest  the hurry of the train came at last they hastened downstairs and found the train awaiting them were told their luggage was safe and after sitting till they were tired shot onwards watching the beautiful glimpses of the lights in the ships off kingstown  they would gladly have gone on all night without another disembarkation and scramble but the dublin station came only too soon they were disgorged and hastened after goods  forth came trunk and portmanteau  alas none of theirs nothing with them but two carriagebags and two rodcases  it seems to be a common predicament said lucilla here are at least halfadozen in the same case  horrible management  we shall never see it more  nay take comfort in the general lot  it will turn up tomorrow and meantime sleep is not packed up in our boxes  come lets be off  what noises  how do these drivers keep from running over one another  each seems ready to whip every ones beast but his own  dont you feel yourself in ireland rashe  arrah  i shall begin to scream too if i stand here much longer  we cant go in that thinga fly  dont exist here rashevermin is unknown  submit to your fate and ere another objection could be uttered cilly threw bags and rods into an inside car and pushed her cousin after them chattering all the time to poor horatias distraction  oh delicious  a cross between a bakers cart and a van amburgh  a little more and it would overbalance and carry the horse head over heels  take care rashe youll pound me into dust if you slip down over me  i cant help it  oh the vilest thing in creation  such fun  to be taken when well shaken  here we go up up up and here we go down down down  ha ware fishingrod  this is what it is to travel  no one ever described the experiences of an inside car  because no one in their senses would undergo such misery  but you dont regard the beauties rashe beauties of nature and art combinedsee the lights reflected in the riverwhat a width  oh why dont they treat the thames as they do the liffey  i cant see i shall soon be dead and getting to an inn without luggage its not respectable  if you depart this life on the way the want of luggage will concern me the most my dear  depend on it other people have driven up in inside cars minus luggage in the memory of man in this city of dublin  are you such a worldling base as to depend for your respectability on a paltry leathern trunk  lucillas confidence did not appear misplaced for neither waiters nor chambermaids seemed surprised but assured them that people usually missed their luggage by that train and asseverated that it would appear next morning  lucilla awoke determined to be full of frolic and enjoyment and horatia refreshed by her nights rest was more easily able to detect such fun than on the previous night so the two cousins sat down amicably to breakfast on the sunday morning and inquired about churchservices  my mallards tail hat is odd go to meeting headgear said cilla but one cannot lapse into heathenism so where rashe  wouldnt it be fun to look into a roman catholic affair  no said cilly decidedly where i go it shall be the genuine article i dont like curiosities in religion  its a curiosity to go to church at twelve oclock  if you are so orthodox let us wait for st patricks this afternoon  and in the meantime  it is but eleven this minute and st patricks is not till three  theres nothing to be done but to watch irish nature in the street  oh i never before knew the perfection of carletons illustration  see that woman and her cap and the mans round eyebrows and projecting lips with shillelagh written on them  would it be sabbathbreaking to perpetrate a sketch  but as ratia was advancing to the window lucy suddenly started back seized her and whirled her away crying the wretch  i know him now  i could not make him out last night  who exclaimed rashe starting determinedly to the window but detained by the two small but resolute hands clasped round her waist  that blackwhiskered valet of mr calthorps  if that man has the insolence to dog me and spy me ill not stay in ireland another day  oh what fun burst out horatia  it becomes romantic  atrocious impertinence said lucilla passionately  why do you stand there laughing  at you my dear gasped ratia sinking on the sofa in her spasm of mirth  at your reception of chivalrous devotion  pretty chivalry to come and spy and beset ladies alone  he has not beset us yet  dont flatter yourself  what do you mean by that horatia  do you want to try your pistols on me  the waiter could show us the way to the fifteen acres only you see it is sunday  i want said lucy all tragedy and no comedy to know why you talk of my flattering myself that i am insulted and my plans upset  why said rashe a little sneeringly  why a little professed beauty like you would be so disappointed not to be pursued that she is obliged to be always seeing phantoms that give her no peace  thank you coolly returned cilly  very well ill say no more about it but if i find that man to be in ireland the same day i go home  horatia gave a loud long provoking laugh  lucilla felt it was for her dignity to let the subject drop and betook herself to the only volumes attainable bradshaw and her book of flies while miss charteris repaired to the window to investigate for herself the question of the pursuer and made enlivening remarks on the two congregations the one returning from mass the other going to church but these were not appreciated  it seemed as though the young ladies had but one set of spirits between them which were gained by the one as soon as lost by the other  it was rather a dull day  fast as they were the two girls shrank from rambling alone in streets thronged with figures that they associated with ruffianly destitution  sunday had brought all to light and the large handsome streets were beset with barefooted children elflocked women and lounging beetlebrowed men such as lucy had only seen in the purlieus of whittingtonia in alleys looked into but never entered by the civilized  in reality rich and rare was so true that they might have walked there more secure from insult than in many better regulated regions but it was difficult to believe so especially in attire then so novel as to be very remarkable and the absence of protection lost its charm when there was no one to admire the bravado  she did her best to embalm it for future appreciation by journalizing making the voyage out a far better joke than she had found it and describing the inside car in the true style of the facetious traveller nothing so drives away fun as the desire to be funny and she began to grow weary of her work and disgusted at her own lumbering attempts at penandink mirth but they sufficed to make rashe laugh they would be quite good enough for lord william would grievously annoy honora charlecote would be mentioned in all the periodicals and give them the name of the angel anglers all the next season  was not that enough to go to ireland and write a witty tour for  the outside car took them to st patricks and they had their first real enjoyment in the lazy liveliness of the vehicle and the droll ciceroneship of the driver who contrived to convey such compliments to their pretty faces as only an irishman could have given without offence  lucilla sprang down with exhilarated spirits and even wished for honor to share her indignation at the slovenliness around the cathedral and the absence of close or cloister nay though she had taken an aversion to strafford as a hero of honors she forgave him and resolved to belabour the house of cork handsomely in her journal when she beheld the sixstoried monument and imagined it as he had found it in the altars very place  would that he had created an absolute boylean vacuum what a grand bon mot for her journal  however either the spirit of indignation at the sight of the unkneeling congregation or else the familiar words of the beautiful musical service made her more than usually devout and stirred up something within her that could only be appeased by the resolution that the singing in robert fulmorts parish should be superexcellent  after the service the carman persuaded them to drive in the phoenix park where they enjoyed the beautiful broken ground the picturesque thickets the grass whose colour reminded them that they were in the emerald isle the purple outlines of the wicklow hills whence they thought they detected a fresh mountain breeze  they only wondered to find this delightful place so little frequented  in england a sunday would have filled it with holiday strollers whereas here they only encountered a very few and those chiefly gentlefolks  the populace preferred sitting on the doorsteps or lounging against the houses as if they were making studies of themselves for caricatures and were evidently so much struck with the young ladies attire that the shelter of the hotel was gladly welcomed  lucilla was alone in the sittingroom when the waiter came to lay the cloth  he looked round as if to secure secrecy and then remarked in a low confidential voice theres been a gentleman inquiring for you maam  who was it said lucy with feigned coolness  it was when you were at church maam he wished to know whether two ladies had arrived here miss charteris and miss sandbrook  did he leave his card  he did not maam his call was to be a secret he said it was only to be sure whether you had arrived  then he did not give his name  he did maam for he desired to be let know what route the young ladies took when they left quoth the man with a comical look as though he were imparting a most delightful secret  was he mr calthorp  i said id not mention his name said the waiter with however such decided assent that as at the same moment he quitted the room and horatia entered it cilly exclaimed there rashe what do you say now to the phantom of my vanity  here has he been asking for us and what route we meant taking  he  who  whowhy who should it be  the waiter has just told me  you absurd girl  well ask him yourself  so when the waiter came up miss charteris demanded has mr calthorp been calling here  what was the name maam if you please  calthorp  has mr calthorp been calling here  cawthorne  was it colonel cawthorne of the royal hussars maam  he was here yesterday but not today  i said calthorp  has a mr calthorp been inquiring for us today  i have not heard maam ill inquire said he looking alert and again disappearing while horatia looked as proud of herself as cilly had done just before  he came back again while lucilla was repeating his communication and assured miss charteris that no such person had called  then what gentleman has been here making inquiries about us  gentleman  indeed maam i dont understand your meaning  have you not been telling this young lady that a gentleman has been asking after us and desiring to be informed what route we intended to take  ah sure said the waiter as if recollecting himself i did mention it  some gentleman did just ask me in a careless sort of way who the two beautiful young ladies might be and where they were going  such young ladies always create a sensation as you must be aware maam and i own i did speak of it to the young lady because i thought she had seen the attraction of the gentlemans eyes  so perfectly assured did he look that lucilla felt a moments doubt whether her memory served her as to his former words but just as she raised her eyes and opened her lips in refutation she met a glance from him full of ludicrous reassurance evidently meaning that he was guarding his own secret and hers  he was gone the next moment and horatia turned upon her with exultant merriment  i always heard that ireland was a mendacious country said cilly  and a country where people lose the use of their eyes and ears laughed rashe  o what a foundation for the second act of the drama  of which the third will be my going home by the next steamer  because a stranger asked who we were  each had her own interpretation of the doublefaced waiters assertion and it served them to dispute upon all the evening  lucilla was persuaded that he imagined her an injured beauty reft from her faithful adorer by her stern aunt or duenna and that he considered himself to be doing her a kindness by keeping her informed of her heros vicinity while he denied it to her companion but she scorned to enter into an explanation or make any disavowal and found the few displeased words she spoke were received with compassion as at the dictation of the stern monitress  horatia on the other hand could not easily resign the comical version that lucillas inordinate opinion of her own attractions had made her imagine mr calthorps valet in the street and discover his master in the chance inquirer whom the waiter had mentioned and as cilly could not aver that the man had actually told her in so many words that it was mr calthorp horatia had a right to her opinion and though she knew she had been a young lady a good many years she could not easily adopt the suggestion that she could pass for cillys cruel duenna  lucilla grew sullen and talked of going home by the next steamer rashe far from ready for another sea voyage called herself ill used and represented the absurdity of returning on a false alarm  cilla was staggered and thought what it would be if mr calthorp smoking his cigar at his club heard that she had fled from his imaginary pursuit besides the luggage must be recovered so she let horatia go on arranging for an excursion for the monday only observing that it must not be in dublin  no bonnets are needful there  what do you think of howth and irelands eye the place where kirwan murdered his wife said rashe with great gusto for she had a strong turn for the horrid murders in the newspaper  too near and too smart sulked lucy  well then glendalough that is wild and far off enough and may be done in a day from dublin  ill ring and find out  not from that man  oh we shall see calthorps peopling the hillsides  well let us have the landlord  it was found that both the devils glen and the seven churches might be visited if they started by the seven oclock train and returned late at night and lucilla agreeing the evening went off as best it might the cousins being glad to get out of each others company at nine that they might be up early the next morning  lucy had not liked ratia so little since the days of her infantine tyranny  the morning however raised their spirits and sent them off in a more friendly humour enjoying the bustle and excitement that was meat and drink to them and exclaiming at the exquisite views of sea and rugged coast along beautiful kilmeny bay  when they left the train they were delighted with their outside car and reclined on their opposite sides in enchantment with the fernbordered lanes winding between noble trees between which came inviting glimpses of exquisitely green meadows and hillsides  they stopped at a parklooking gate leading to the devils glen which they were to traverse on foot meeting the car at the other end  here there was just enough life and adventure to charm them as they gaily trod the path winding picturesquely beside the dashing dancing foaming stream now between bare salient bluffs of dark rock now between glades of verdant thicket or bold shouldering slopes of purple heath and soft bent grass  they were constantly crying out with delight as they bounded from one point of view to another sometimes climbing among loose stones leading between ferns and hazel stems to a wellplanted hermitage sometimes springing across the streamlet upon steppingstones at the end of the wood another lodgegate brought them beyond the private grounds that showed care even in their rusticity and they came out on the open hillside in true mountain air soft turf beneath their feet the stream rushing away at the bottom of the slope and the view closed in with blue mountains on which the clouds marked purple shadows  this was freedom this was enjoyment this was worth the journey and cillas elastic feet sprang along as if she had been a young kid  how much was delight in the scenery how much in the scramble need not be analyzed  there was plenty of scrambling before it was over  a woman who had been lying in wait for tourists at the gate guided them to the bend of the glen where they were to climb up to pay their respects to the waterfall the ascent was not far from perpendicular only rendered accessible by the slope of fallen debris at the base and a few steps cut out from one projecting rock to another up to a narrow shelf whence the cascade was to be looked down on  the more adventurous spirits went on to a rock overhanging the fall and with a curious chink or cranny forming a window with a seat and called king otooles chair  each girl perched herself there and was complimented on her strong head and active limbs and all their powers were needed in the long breathless pull up craggy steppingstones then over steep slippery turf ere they gained the summit of the bank  spent though still gasping out such fun they threw themselves on their backs upon the thymy grass and lay still for several seconds ere they sat up to look back at the thicklywooded ravine winding crevicelike in and out between the overlapping skirts of the hills whose rugged heads cut off the horizon  then merrily sharing the first instalment of luncheon with their barefooted guide they turned their faces onwards where all their way seemed one bare gray moor rising far off into the outline of luggela a peak overhanging the semblance of a crater  nothing afforded them much more mirth than a rude bridge consisting of a single row of squareheaded unconnected posts along the heads of which cilla three times hopped backwards and forwards for the mere drollery of the thing with vigour unabated by the long walk over the dreary moorland fields with their stone walls  by the side of the guides cabin the car awaited them and mile after mile they drove on through treeless wastes the few houses with their thatch anchored down by stones showing what winds must sweep along those unsheltered tracts  the desolate solitude began to weary the volatile pair into silence ere the mountains rose closer to them they crossed a bridge over a stony stream begirt with meadows and following its course came into sight of their goal  here was glendalough a cul de sac between the mountains that shelved down enclosing it on all sides save the entrance through which the river issued  their summits were bare of the gray stone that lay in fragments everywhere but their sides were clothed with the lovely irish green pastureland intermixed with brushwood and trees and a beauteous meadow surrounded the white ringlike beach of pure white sand and pebbles bordering the outer lake whose gray waters sparkled in the sun its twin lake divided from it by so narrow a belt of ground that the white beaches lay on their green setting like the outline of a figure of 8 had a more wild and gloomy aspect lying deeper within the hollow and the hills coming sheer down on it at the further end in all their grayness unsoftened by any verdure  the gray was that of absolute black and white intermingled in the grain of the stone and this was peculiarly gloomy but in the summer sunshine it served but to set off the brilliance of the verdure and the whole air of the valley was so bright that cilly declared that it had been traduced and that no skylark of sense need object thereto  losing sight of the lakes as they entered the shabby little town they sprang off the car before a small inn and ere their feet were on the ground were appropriated by one of a shoal of guides in dress and speech an ultra irishman exaggerating his part as a sort of buffoon for the travellers  rashe was diverted by his humours cilla thought them in bad taste and would fain have escaped from his brogue and his antics with some perception that the scene ought to be left to make its impression in peace  small peace however was there among the scores of men women and children within the rude walls containing the most noted relics all beset the visitors with offers of stockings lace or stones from the hills and the chatter of the guide was a lesser nuisance for which she was forced to compound for the sake of his protection  when he had cleared away his compatriots she was able to see the remains of two of the seven churches the cathedral and st kevins kitchen both of enduring gray stone covered with yellow lichen which gave a remarkable golden tint to their extreme old age  architecture there was next to none  st kevins socalled kitchen had a cylindrical tower crowned by an extinguisher and within the roofless walls was a flat stone once the altar and still a station for pilgrims and the cathedral contained two broken coffinlids with floriated crosses but it was merely four rude roofless walls enclosing less space than a cottage kitchen and less ornamental than many a barn  the whole space was encumbered with regular modern headstones ugly as the worst that english graveyards could show and alternating between the names of byrne and otoole families who as the guide said would come hundreds of miles to lie there  it was a grand thought that those two lines in wealth or in poverty had been constant to that one wild mountain buryingplace in splendour or in ruin for more than twelve centuries  here some steps from the cathedral on the top of the slope was the chief grandeur of the view  a noble old carved granite cross eight or ten feet high stood upon the brow bending slightly to one side and beyond lay the valley cherishing its treasure of the twin lakelets girt in by the band across them nestled in the soft lining of copsewood and meadow and protected by the lofty massive hills above  in front but below and somewhat to the right lay another enclosure containing the ivied gable of st marys church and the tall columnlike round tower both with the same peculiar golden hoariness  the sight struck lucilla with admiration and wonder but the next moment she heard the guide exhorting rashe to embrace the stem of the cross telling her that if she could clasp her arms round it she would be sure of a handsome and rich husband within the year  half superstitious and always eager for fun horatia spread her arms in the endeavour but her hands could not have met without the aid of the guide who dragged them together and celebrated the exploit with a hurrah of congratulation while she laughed triumphantly and called on her companion to try her luck  but lucy was disgusted and bluntly refused knowing her grasp to be far too small unable to endure the touch of the guide and maybe shrinking from the failure of the augury  ah to be shure an its not such a purty young lady as yourself that need be taking the trouble did not fall pleasantly on her ears and still less ratias laugh and exclamation you make too sure do you have a care  there were black looks at parting  but you need not be afraid if handsome be a part of the spell  there was no answer and horatia saw that the outspoken raillery that cilly had once courted now gave offence  she guessed that something was amiss but did not know that what had once been secure had been wilfully imperilled and that suspense was awakening new feelings of delicacy and tenderness  the light words and vulgar forecasting had in spite of herself transported lucilla from the rocky thicket where she was walking even to the cedar room at woolstonelane and conjured up before her that grave massive brow and the eye that would not meet her  she had hurried to these wilds to escape that influence and it was holding her tighter than ever  to hasten home on account of mr calthorps pursuit would be the most effectual vindication of the feminine dignity that she might have impaired in roberts eyes but to do this on what ratia insisted on believing a false alarm would be the height of absurdity  she was determined on extracting proofs sufficient to justify her return and every moment seemed an hour until she could feel herself free to set her face homewards  a strange impatience seized her at every spot where the guide stopped them to admire and ratias encouragement of his witticisms provoked her excessively  with a kind of despair she found herself required before taking boat for st kevins cave to mount into a wood to admire another waterfall  see two waterfalls she muttered and you have seen them all  there are only two kinds one a bucket of water thrown down from the roof of a house the other over a staircase  either the water was a fiction or you cant get at them for the wet  that was a splendid fellow at the devils glen  theres as good a one any day at the lock on the canal at home only we do not delude people into coming to see it  up such places too  cilly for shame  what tired and giving in  not tired in the least only this place is not worth getting late for the train  will the young lady take my hand  id be proud to have the honour of helping her up said the guide  but lucilla disdainfully rejected his aid and climbed among the stones and brushwood aloof from the others ratia talking in high glee to the irishman and adventurously scrambling  cilly here it is she cried from beneath a projecting elbow of rock you look down on it  its a delicious fall  i declare one can get into it and by the aid of a tree she lowered herself down on a flat stone whence she could see the cascade better than above  this is stunning i vow one can get right into the bed of the stream right across  dont be slow cilly this is the prime fun of all  you care for the romp and nothing else grumbled lucilla  that boisterous merriment was hateful to her when feeling that the demeanour of gentlewomen must be their protection and with all her high spirit she was terrified lest insult or remark should be occasioned  her signs of remonstrance were only received with a derisive outburst as rashe climbed down into the midst of the bed of the stream  come cilla or i shall indite a page in the diary headed faint heartah as her foot slipped on the stones and she fell backwards but with instant efforts at rising such as assured her cousin that no harm was done nay nonsensical clambering will be the word she said  serves you right for getting into such places  what hurt as horatia after resting in a sitting posture tried to get up but paused with a cry  nothing she said ill but another attempt ended in the same way cilla sprang to her followed by the guide imprecating bad luck to the slippery stones  herself standing in the water lucilla drew her cousin upright and with a good deal of help from the guide and much suffering brought her up the high bank and down the rough steep descent through the wood  she had given her back and side a severe twist but she moved less painfully on more level ground and supported between lucilla and the guide whom the mischance had converted from a comedy clown to a delicately considerate assistant she set out for the inn where the car had been left  the progress lasted for two doleful hours every step worse than the last and much exhausted she at length sank upon the sofa in the little sittingroom of the inn  the landlady was urgent that the wet clothes should be taken off and the back rubbed with whiskey but cilla stood agitating her small soaked foot and insisting that the car should come round at once since the wet had dried on them and they had best lose no time in returning to dublin or at least to bray  but rashe cried out that the car would be the death of her she could not stir without a nights rest  and be all the stiffer tomorrow  once on the car you will be very comfortable  oh no  i cant  this is a horrid place  of all the unlucky things that could have happened  then said cilla fancying a little coercion would be wholesome dont be fainthearted  you will be glad tomorrow that i had the sense to make you move today  i shall order the car  indeed cried horatia her temper yielding to pain and annoyance you seem to forget that this expedition is mine  i am paymaster and have the only right to decide  lucilla felt the taunt base as recalling to her the dependent position into which she had carelessly rushed relying on the family feeling that had hitherto made all things as one  henceforth said she i take my share of all that we spend  i will not sell my free will  so you mean to leave me here alone said horatia with positive tears of pain weariness and vexation at the cruel unfriendliness of the girl she had petted  nonsense  i must abide by your fate  i only hate to see people chickenhearted and thought you wanted shaking up  i stay so long as you own me an independent agent  the discussion was given up when it was announced that a room was ready and rashe underwent so much in climbing the stairs that cilly thought she could not have been worse on the car  the apartment was not much behind that at the village inn at hiltonbury in fact it had gay curtains and a grand figured blind but the door at the charlecote arms had no such independent habits of opening the carpet would have been whole and the chairs would not have creaked beneath lucys grasshopper weight when down she sat in doleful resignation having undressed her cousin sent her chaussure to dry and dismissed the car with a sense of bidding farewell to the civilized world and entering a desert island devoid of the zest of robinson crusoe  what an endless evening it was and how the ladies detested each other there lay horatia not hurt enough for alarm but quite cross enough to silence pity suffering at every move and sore at cillys want of compassion and here sat lucilla thoroughly disgusted with her cousin her situation and her expedition  believing the strain a trifle she not unjustly despised the want of resolution that had shrunk from so expedient an exertion as the journey and felt injured by the selfish want of consideration that had condemned her to this awkward position in this forlorn little inn without even the few toilette necessaries that they had with them at dublin and with no place to sit in for the sittingroom below stairs served as a coffeeroom where sundry male tourists were imbibing whiskey the fumes of which ascended to the young ladies above long before they could obtain their own meal  the chops were curiosities and as to the tea the grounds apparently the peat of the valley filled up nearly an eighth of the cup causing lucilla in lugubrious mirth to talk of that lake whose gloomy tea neer saw hyson nor bohea when rashe fretfully retorted it is very unkind in you to grumble at everything when you know i cant help it  i was not grumbling i only wanted to enliven you  queer enlivenment  nor did lucillas attempts at body curing succeed better  her rubbing only evoked screeches and her advice was scornfully rejected  horatia was a determined homoeopath and sighed for the globules in her wandering box and as whiskey and tobacco both became increasingly fragrant averred again and again that nothing should induce her to stay here another night  nothing  lucilla found her in the morning in all the aches and flushes of a feverish cold her sprain severely painful her eyes swollen her throat so sore that in alarm cilly besought her to send for advice but rashe regarded a murderous allopathist as near akin to an executioner and only bewailed the want of her minikin doses  giving up the hope of an immediate departure lucilla despatched a messenger to bray thence to telegraph for the luggage and the day was spent in fears lest their landlord at dublin might detain their goods as those of suspicious characters  other excitement there was none not even in quarrelling for rashe was in a sleepy state only roused by interludes of gloomy tea and greasy broth and outside the clouds had closed down such clouds as she had never seen blotting out lake and mountain with an impervious gray curtain seeming to bathe rather than to rain on the place  she longed to dash out into it but ratias example warned her against drenching her only garments though indoors the dryness was only comparative everything she touched herself included seemed pervaded by a damp limp rawness that she vainly tried to dispel by ordering a fire  the turf smouldered the smoke came into the room and made their eyes water and rashe insisted that the fire should be put out  cilla almost envied her sleep as she sat disconsolate in the window watching the comparative density of the rain and listening to the extraordinary howls and shrieks in the town which kept her constantly expecting that a murder or a rebellion would come to relieve the monotony of the day till she found that nothing ensued and no one took any notice  she tried to sketch from memory but nothing would hinder that least pleasant of occupationsthought  either she imagined every unpleasant chance of detention she worried herself about robert fulmort or marvelled what mr prendergast and the censorious ladies would do with edna murrell  many a time did she hold her watch to her ear suspecting it of having stopped so slowly did it loiter through the weary hours eleven oclock when she hoped it was onehalfpast two when it felt like five  by real five the mist was thinner showing first nearer then remoter objects the coarse slates of the roofs opposite emerged polished and dripping and the cloud finally took its leave some heavy flakes like cotton wool hanging on the hillside and every rock shining every leaf glistening  verdure and rosy cheeks both resulted from a perpetual vapourbath  lucilla rejoiced in her liberty and hurried out of doors but leaning out of the coffeeroom window loungers were seen who made her sensible of the awkwardness of her position and she looked about for yesterdays guide as a friend but he was not at hand and her uneasy gaze brought round her numbers begging or offering guidance  she wished to retreat but would not and walked briskly along the side of the valley opposite to that she had yesterday visited in search of the other four churches two fragments were at the junction of the lakes another was entirely destroyed but the last called the abbey stood in ruins within the same wall as the round tower which rose straight round mysterious defying inquiry as it caught the evening light on its summit even as it had done for so many centuries past  not that cilla thought of the riddles of that tower far less of the early christianity of the isle of saints of which these ruins and their wild legend were the only vestiges nor of the mysticism that planted clusters of churches in sevens as analogous to the seven stars of the apocalypse  even the rugged glories of the landscape chiefly addressed themselves to her as good to sketch her highest flight in admiration of the picturesque  in the state of mind ascribed to the ancients she only felt the weird unhomelikeness of the place as though she were at the ends of the earth unable to return and always depressed by solitude she could have wept  was it for this that she had risked the love that had been her own from childhood and broken with the friend to whom her father had commended her  was it worth while to defy their censures for this dreary spot this weakspirited exacting unrefined companion and the insult of mr calthorps pursuit  naturally shrewd well knowing the world and guarded by a real attachment lucilla had never regarded the millionaires attentions as more than idle amusement in watching the frolics of a beauty and had suffered them as adding to her own diversion but his secretly following her no doubt to derive mirth from her proceedings revealed to her that woman could not permit such terms without loss of dignity and her cheek burnt at the thought of the ludicrous light in which he might place her present predicament before a conclave of gentlemen  the thought was intolerable  to escape it by rapid motion she turned hastily to leave the enclosure  a figure was climbing over the steps in the wall with outstretched hand as if he expected her to cling to him and mr calthorp springing forward eagerly exclaimed in familiar patronizing tones miss sandbrook  they told me you were gone this way  then in a very different voice at the unexpected look and bow that he encountered i hope miss charteriss accident is not serious  thank you not serious was the freezing reply  i am glad  how did it occur  it was a fall  he should have no good story wherewith to regale his friends  going on well i trust  chancing to be at dublin i heard by accident you were here and fearing that there might be a difficulty i ran down in the hope of being of service to you  thank you in the least thankful of tones  is there nothing i can do for you  thank you nothing  could i not obtain some advice for miss charteris  thank you she wishes for none  i am surehe spoke eagerlythat in some way i could be of use to you  i shall remain at hand  i cannot bear that you should be alone in this remote place  thank you we will not put you to inconvenience  we intended to be alone  i see you esteem it a great liberty said poor mr calthorp but you must forgive my impulse to see whether i could be of any assistance to you  i will do as you desire but at least you will let me leave stefano with you he is a fellow full of resources who would make you comfortable here and me easy about you  thank you we require no one  those thank yous were intolerable but her defensive reserve and dignity attracted the gentleman more than all her dashing brilliancy and he became more urgent  you cannot ask me to leave you entirely to yourselves under such circumstances  i more than ask it i insist upon it  good morning  miss sandbrook do not go till you have heard and forgiven me  i will not hear you mr calthorp  this is neither the time nor place said lucilla inly more and more perturbed but moving along with slow quiet steps and betraying no emotion  the object of our journey was totally defeated by meeting any of our ordinary acquaintance and but for this mischance i should have been on my way home today  oh miss sandbrook do you class me among your ordinary acquaintance  it was all she could do to hinder her walk from losing its calm slowness and before she could divest her intended reply of undignified sharpness he continued who could have betrayed my presence  but for this i meant that you should never have been aware that i was hovering near to watch over you  yes to collect good stories for your club  this is injustice  flagrant injustice miss sandbrook  will you not credit the anxiety that irresistibly impelled me to be ever at hand in case you should need a protector  no was the pointblank reply  how shall i convince you he cried vehemently  what have i done that you should refuse to believe in the feelings that prompted me  what have you done said lucilla whose blood was up  you have taken a liberty which is the best proof of what your feelings are and every moment that you force your presence on me adds to the offence  she saw that she had succeeded  he stood still bowed and answered not possibly deeming this the most effective means of recalling her but from first to last he had not known lucilla sandbrook  the eager protecting familiarity of his first address had given her such a shock that she felt certain that she had no guard but herself from positively insulting advances and though abstaining from all quickening of pace her heart throbbed violently in the fear of hearing him following her and the inn was a haven of refuge  she flew up to her bedroom to tear about like a panther as if by violence to work down the tumult in her breast  she had proved the truth of honoras warning that beyond the pale of ordinary convenances a woman is exposed to insult and however sufficient she may be for her own protection the very fact of having to defend herself is wellnigh degradation  it was not owning the error  it was the agony of humiliation not the meekness of humility and she was as angry with miss charlecote for the prediction as with mr calthorp for having fulfilled it enraged with horatia and desperate at her present imprisoned condition unable to escape and liable to be still haunted by her enemy  at last she saw the discomfited swain reenter the inn his car come round and finally drive off with him and then she felt what a blank was her victory  if she breathed freely it was at the cost of an increased sense of solitude and severance from the habitable world  hitherto she had kept away from her cousin trusting that the visit might remain a secret too mortifying to both parties to be divulged but she found horatia in a state of eager anticipation awakened from the torpor to watch for tidings of a happy conclusion to their difficulties and preparing jests on the pettish ingratitude with which she expected lucilla to requite the services that would be nevertheless accepted  gone  sent away  not even commissioned to find the boxes  horatias consternation and irritation knew no bounds  lucilla was no less indignant that she could imagine it possible to become dependent on his good offices or to permit him to remain in the neighbourhood  rashe angrily scoffed at her newborn scruples and complained of her want of consideration for herself  cilla reproached her cousin with utter absence of any sense of propriety and decorum  rashe talked of ingratitude and her sore throat being by this time past conversation she came to tears  cilla who could not bear to see any one unhappy tried many a never mind many a didnt mean many a fair augury for the morrow but all in vain and night came down upon the angel anglers more forlorn and less friendly than ever and with all the invalids discomforts so much aggravated by the tears and the altercation that escape from this gloomy shore appeared infinitely remote  there was an essential difference of tone of mind between those brought up at hiltonbury or at castle blanch and though high spirits had long concealed the unlikeness it had now been made bare and lucy could not conquer her disgust and disappointment  sunshine was on luggela and horatias ailments were abating so as her temper was not alleviated lucilla thought peace would be best preserved by sallying out to sketch  a drawing from behind the cross became so engrossing that she was sorry to find it time for the early dinner and her artistic pride was only allayed by the conviction that she should always hate what recalled glendalough  rashe was better and was up and dressed  hopes of departure produced amity and they were almost lively over their veal broth when sounds of arrival made lucilla groan at the prospect of cockney tourists obstructing the completion of her drawing  theres a gentleman asking to see you miss  i can see no one  cilla now do  tell him i cannot see him repeated lucy imperiously  how can you be so silly he may have heard of our boxes  i would toss them into the lake rather than take them from him  eh pray let me be present when you perform the ceremony  cilla in the heroics  whom is she expecting said a voice outside the door ever ajar a voice that made lucilla clasp her hands in ecstasy  you owen come in cried horatia writhing herself up  owen old owen thats right burst from cilla as she sprang to him  right  ah that is not the greeting i expected i was thinking how to guard my eyes  so you have had enough of the unprotected dodge  what has rashe been doing to herself  a desperate leap down the falls of niagara  horatia was diffuse in the narration but after the first lucy did not speak  she began by arming herself against her brothers derision but presently felt perplexed by detecting on his countenance something unwontedly grave and preoccupied  she was sure that his attention was far away from rashes long story and she abruptly interrupted it with how came you here owen  he did not seem to hear and she demanded is anything the matter  are you come to fetch us because any one is ill  starting he said no oh no  then what brought you here a family council or honor charlecote  honor charlecote he repeated mistily then making an effort yes good old soul she gave me a vacation tour on condition that i should keep an eye on you  go on rashe what were you saying  didnt you hear me owen  why calthorp the great calthorp is in our wake  cilly is frantic  calthorp about exclaimed owen with a start of dismay  where  ive disposed of him quoth lucilla hell not trouble us again  which way is he gone  i would not tell you if i knew  dont be such an idiot he petulantly answered i want nothing of the fellow only to know whether he is clean gone  are you sure whether he went by bray  i told you i neither knew nor cared  could you have believed owen said rashe plaintively that she was so absurd as never even to tell him to inquire for our boxes  owen knows better but lucilla stopped surprised to see that his thoughts were again astray  giving a constrained smile he asked well what next  to find our boxes they answered in a breath  your boxes  didnt i tell you ive got them here  owen youre a trump cried rashe  how on earth did you know about them inquired his sister  very simply crossed from liverpool yesterday reconnoitred at your hotel was shown your telegram went to the luggageoffice routed out that the things were taking a gentle tour to limerick got them back this morning and came on  and what are you after next  home jerked out lucy without looking up thinking how welcome he would have been yesterday without the goods  yes home said horatia  this abominable sprain will hinder my throwing a line or jolting on irish roads and if cilla is to be in agonies when she sees a man on the horizon we might as well never have come  will you help me to carry home this poor invalid warrior owen said lucilla she will permit you  ill put you into the steamer said owen but you see i have made my arrangements for doing killarney and the rest of it  i declare said rashe recovering benevolence with comfort if they would send scott from the castle to meet me at holyhead cilly might as well go on with you  you would be sufficient to keep off the calthorps  im afraid thats no go hesitated owen  you see i had made my plans trusting to your bold assertions that you would suffer no one to approach  oh never mind  it was no proposal of mine  ive had enough of ireland returned lucy somewhat aggrieved  how soon shall you be sufficiently repaired for a start ratia asked owen turning quickly round to her  tomorrow  no  well ill come over and see  going away cried the ladies by no means willing to part with their guardian  yes i must  expecting that we should be parallels never meeting i had to provide for myself  i see said rashe he has a merry party at newragh bridge and will sit up over whist and punch till midnight  you dont pretend to put yourselves in competition said he snatching at the idea hastily  oh no said his sister with an annoyed gesture  i never expect you to prefer me and my comfort to any one  indeed cilla im sorry he answered gently but in perplexity but i never reckoned on being wanted and engagements are engagements  im sure i dont want you when anything pleasanter is going forward she answered with vexation in her tone  ill be here by eleven or twelve he replied avoiding the altercation but i must get back now  i shall be waited for  who is it that cant wait asked rashe  oh just an english acquaintance of mine  there goodbye  i wish i had come in time to surprise the modern st kevin  are you sure there was no drowning in the lake  you know it was blessed to drown no one after kathleen  reassuring  only mind you put a chapter about it into the tour  under the cover of these words he was gone  i declare theres some mystery about his companion exclaimed horatia suppose it were calthorp himself  owen is not so lost to respect for his sister  but did you not see how little he was surprised and how much preoccupied  very likely but no one but you could imagine him capable of such an outrage  you have been crazy ever since you entered ireland and expect every one else to be the same  seriously what damage did you anticipate from a little civility  if you begin upon that i shall go out and finish my sketch and not unpack one of the boxes  nevertheless lucilla spent much fretting guesswork on her cousins surmise  she relied too much on owens sense of propriety to entertain the idea that he could be forwarding a pursuit so obviously insolent but a still wilder conjecture had been set afloat in her mind  could the nameless one be robert fulmort  though aware of the anonymous nature of brothers friends the secrecy struck her as unusually guarded and to one so used to devotion it seemed no extraordinary homage that another admirer should be drawn along at a respectful distance a satellite to her erratic course nay probably all had been concerted in woolstonelane and therewith the naughty girl crested her head and prepared to take offence  after all it could not be or why should owen have been bent on returning and be so independent of her  far more probably he had met a college friend or a westminster schoolfellow some of whom were in regiments quartered in ireland and on the morrow would bring him to do the lions of glendalough among which might be reckoned the angel anglers  that possibility might have added some grains to the satisfaction of making a respectable toilette next day  certain it is that miss sandbrooks mountain costume was an exquisite feat of elaborate simplicity and that the completion of her sketch was interrupted by many a backward look down the pass and many a contradictory mood sometimes boding almost as harsh a reception for robert as for mr calthorp sometimes relenting in the thrill of hope sometimes accusing herself of arrant folly and expecting as a pis aller the diversion of dazzling and tormenting an oxonian or a soldier or two  be the meeting what it might she preferred that it should be out of horatias sight and so drew on and on to the detriment of her distances  positively it was past twelve and the desire to be surprised unconcernedly occupied could no longer obviate her restlessness so she packed up her hairpencil and walking back to the inn found rashe in solitary possession of the coffeeroom  you have missed him cilly  owen  no one else  no not the calthorp i am sorry for you  but who was here tell me rashe  owen i tell you repeated horatia playing with her impatience  tell me i will know whether he has any one with him  alack for your disappointment for the waste of that blue bow not a soul came here but himself  and where is he how did i miss him said lucilla forcibly repressing the mortification for which her cousin was watching  gone  as i was not in travelling trim and you not forthcoming he could not wait but we are to be off tomorrow at ten oclock  why did he not come out to find me  did you tell him i was close by  he had to join his friend and go to the vale of avoca  ive found out the man cilla  no dont look so much on the qui vive its only jack hastings  jack hastings said lucilla her looks fallen  no wonder he would not bring him here  why not poor fellow  i used to know him very well before he was up the spout  i wish owen had not fallen in with him said the sister gravely  are you certain it is so rashe  i taxed him with it and he did not deny it only put it from him laughing  whats the harm  poor jack was always a goodnatured honourable fellow uncommonly clever and amusinga wellread man too and owen is safe enoughno one could try to borrow of him  what would honors feelings be said lucilla with more fellowfeeling for her than for months past  lax as was the sisters tolerance she was startled at his becoming the associate of an avowedly loose character under the stigma of the world and with perilous abilities and agreeableness and it was another of horatias offences against proper feeling not only to regard such evil communications with indifference but absolutely to wish to be brought into contact with a person of this description in their present isolated state  displeased and uneasy lucilla assumed the role of petulance and quarrelsomeness for the rest of the day and revenged herself to the best of her abilities upon rashe and owen by refusing to go to inspect the scene of kathleens fatal repulse  true to his appointment owen arrived alone on a car chosen with all regard to horatias comfort and was most actively attentive in settling on it the ladies and their luggage stretching himself out on the opposite side his face raised to the clouds as he whistled an air but his eye was still restless and his sister resolved on questioning him  opportunities were however rare whether or not with the design of warding off a teteatete he devoted himself to his cousins service in a manner rare to her since she had laid herself out to be treated as though her name were horace instead of horatia  however lucilla was not the woman to be balked of a settled purpose and at their hotel at dublin she nailed him fast by turning back on him when horatia bade them good night  well what do you want he asked annoyed  i want to speak to you  i hope it is to beg me to write to ask honor to receive you at home and promise to behave like a decent and respectable person  i want neither a judge nor an intercessor in you  come lucy it really would be for every ones good if you would go and take care of poor honor  you have been using her vilely and i should think youd had enough of rashe for one while  if i have used her vilely at least i have dealt openly by her said lucilla  she has always seen the worst of me on the surface  can you bear to talk of her when you know how you are treating her  he coloured violently and his furious gesture would have intimidated most sisters but she stood her ground and answered his stammering demand what she dared to imply  you may go into a passion but you cannot hinder me from esteeming it shameful to make her mission a cover for associating with one whom she would regard with so much horror as jack hastings  jack hastings cried owen to her amazement bursting into a fit of laughter loud long and explosive  well done rashe  you told her so  she told me so and one does not contradict a lady  something must have put it into her head  only to be accounted for by an unrequited attachment laughed owen depend on it a comparison of dates would show hastingss incarceration to have been the epoch of rashes taking to the high masculine line      if eer she loved twas him alone     who lived within the jug of stone  for shame owen rashe never was in love  but he went on laughing at rashes disappointment at his solitary arrival till she said tartly you cannot wonder at our thinking you must have some reason for neither mentioning your companions name nor bringing him with you  in fact no man not under a cloud could abstain from paying homage to the queen of the anglers  it was so true as to raise an angry spot on her cheek and provoke the hasty excuse it would have been obvious to have brought your friend to see your cousin and sister  one brokenbacked both unwashed  o the sincerity of the resistance i overheard  no gentleman admitted forsooth  o for a lodge in some vast wilderness  yes st anthony would have found it a wilderness indeed without his temptations  what would st dunstan have been minus the black gentlemans nose or st kevin but for kathleen  it was a fortunate interposition that calthorp turned up the day before i came or i might have had to drag the lake for you  this personal attack only made her persist  it was very different when we were alone or with you you know very well that there could have been no objection  no objection on your side certainly so i perceive but suppose there were no desire on the other  oh in a piqued voice i know many men dont care for ladies society but i dont see why they should be nameless  i thought you would deem such a name unworthy to be mentioned  well but who is the shy man  is it the little henniker who used to look as if he would dive under the table when you brought him from westminster  if i told you you would remember it against the poor creature for life as a deliberate insult and want of taste  good night  he took his hat and went out leaving lucy balancing her guesses between ensign henniker and him whom she could not mention  her rejection of mr calthorp might have occasioned the present secrecy and she was content to leave herself the pleasant mystery in the hope of having it dispelled by her last glance of kingstown quay  in that hope she rocked herself to sleep and next morning was so extra vivacious as to be a sore trial to poor rashe in the anticipation of the peine forte et dure of st georges channel  owen was also in high spirits but a pattern of consideration and kind attention as he saw the ladies on board and provided for their comfort not leaving them till the last moment  lucillas heart had beaten fast from the moment she had reached kingstown she was keeping her hand free to wave a most encouraging kiss and as her eye roamed over the heads upon the quay without a recognition she felt absolutely baffled and cheated and gloriously as the bay of dublin spread itself before her she was conscious only of wrath and mortification and of a bitter sense of dreariness and desertion  nobody cared for her not even her brother    chapter ix             my pride that took     fully easily all impressions from below     would not look up or half despised the height     to which i could not or i would not climb     i thought i could not breathe in that fine air                                                        idylls of the king  can you come and take a turn in the templegardens phoebe asked robert on the way from church the day after owens visit to woolstonelane  phoebe rejoiced for she had scarcely seen him since his return from castle blanch and his state of mind was a mystery to her  it was long however before he afforded her any clue  he paced on grave and abstracted and they had many times gone up and down the least frequented path before he abruptly said i have asked mr parsons to give me a title for holy orders  i dont quite know what that means  how simple you are phoebe he said impatiently it means that st wulstans should be my first curacy  may my labours be accepted as an endeavour to atone for some of the evil we cause here  dear robin what did mr parsons say  was he not very glad  no there lies the doubt  doubt  yes  he told me that he had engaged as many curates as he has means for  i answered that my stipend need be no consideration for i only wished to spend on the parish but he was not satisfied  many incumbents dont like to have curates of independent means i believe it has an amateur appearance  mr parsons cannot think you would not be devoted  i hope to convince him that i may be trusted  it is all that is left me now  it will be very cruel to you and to the poor people if he will not said phoebe warmly what will papa and mervyn say  i shall not mention it till all is settled i have my fathers consent to my choice of a profession and i do not think myself bound to let him dictate my course as a minister  i owe a higher duty and if his business scatters the seeds of vice surely obedience in the lord should not prevent me from trying to counteract them  it was a case of conscience to be only judged by himself and where even a sister like phoebe could do little but hope for the best so she expressed a cheerful hope that her father must know that it was right and that he would care less now that he was away and pleased with augustas prospects  yes said robert he already thinks me such a fool that it may be indifferent to him in what particular manner i act it out  and how does it stand with mr parsons  he will give me an answer tomorrow evening provided i continue in the same mind  there is no chance of my not doing so  my time of suspense is over and the words absolutely sounded like relief though the set stern face and the long breaths at each pause told another tale  i did not think she would really have gone said phoebe  this once and we will mention her no more  it is not merely this expedition but all i saw at wrapworth convinced me that i should risk my faithfulness to my calling by connecting myself with one who with all her loveliness and generosity lives upon excitement  she is the very light of poor prendergasts eyes and he cannot endure to say a word in her dispraise she is constantly doing acts of kindness in his parish and is much beloved there yet he could not conceal how much trouble she gives him by her want of judgment and wilfulness patronizing and forgetting capriciously and attending to no remonstrance  you saw yourself the treatment of that schoolmistress  i thought the more of this because prendergast is so fond of her and does her full justice no her very aspect proves that a parish priest has no business to think of her  large tears swelled in phoebes eyes  the first vision of her youth was melting away and she detected no relenting in his grave resolute voice  shall you tell her was all she could say  that is the question  at one time she gave me reason to think that she accepted a claim to be considered in my plans and understood what i never concealed  latterly she has appeared to withdraw all encouragement to reject every advance and yet  phoebe tell me whether she has given you any reason to suppose that she ever was in earnest with me  i know she respects and likes you better than any one and speaks of you like no one else said phoebe then pausing and speaking more diffidently though with a smile i think she looks up to you so much that she is afraid to put herself in your power for fear she should be made to give up her odd ways in spite of herself and yet that she has no notion of losing you  did you see her face at the station  i would not  i could not meet her eyes  i snatched my hand from the little clinging fingers and roberts voice almost became a gasp  it was not fit that the spell should be renewed  she would be miserable i under constant temptation if i endeavoured to make her share my work best as it is  she has so cast me off that my honour is no longer bound to her but i cannot tell whether it be due to her to let her know how it is with me or whether it would be mere coxcombry  the sunday that she spent here said phoebe slowly she had a talk with me  i wrote it down  miss fennimore says it is the safest way  where is it cried robert  i kept it in my pocketbook for fear any one should see it and it should do harm  here it is if it will help you  i am afraid i made things worse but i did not know what to say  it was one of the boldest experiments ever made by a sister for what man could brook the sight of an unvarnished statement of his proxys pleading or help imputing the failure to the gobetween  i would not have had this happen for a thousand pounds was his acknowledgment  child as you are phoebe had you not sense to know that no woman could endure to have that said which should scarcely be implied  i wonder no longer at her studied avoidance  if it be all my bad management cannot it be set right humbly and hopefully said phoebe  there is no right he said  there take it back  it settles the question  the security you childishly showed was treated as offensive presumption on my part  it would be presuming yet farther to make a formal withdrawal of what was never accepted  then is it my doing  have i made mischief between you and put you apart said poor phoebe in great distress  cant i make up for it  you  no you were only an over plainspoken child and brought about the crisis that must have come somehow  it is not what you have done or not done it is what lucy sandbrook has said and done shows that i must have done with her for ever  and yet said phoebe taking this as forgiveness you see she never believed that you would give her up  if she did i am sure she would not have gone  she thinks her power over me stronger than my principles  she challenges medesires you to tell me so  we shall see  he spoke as a man whose steadfastness had been defied and who was piqued on proving it to the utmost  such feelings may savour of the wrath of man they may need the purifying of chastening and they often impel far beyond the bounds of sober judgment but no doubt they likewise frequently render that easy which would otherwise have appeared impossible and which if done in haste may be regretted but not repented at leisure  under some circumstances the harshness of youth is a healthy symptom proving force of character and conviction though that is only when the foremost victim is self  robert was far from perfect and it might be doubted whether he were entering the right track in the right way but at least his heart was sound and there was a fair hope that his failings in working their punishment might work their cure  it was in a thorough brotherly and christian spirit that before entering the house he compelled himself to say dont vex yourself phoebe i know you did the best you could  it made no real difference and it was best that she should know the truth  thank you dear robin cried phoebe grateful for the consolation i am glad you do not think i misrepresented  you are always accurate he answered  if you did anything undesirable it was representing at all  but that is nothing to the purpose  it is all over now and thank you for your constant goodwill and patience my dear  there now then it is an understood thing that her name is never spoken between us  meanwhile roberts proposal was under discussion by the elders  mr parsons had no abstract dread of a wealthy curate but he hesitated to accept gratuitous services and distrusted plans formed under the impulse of disappointment or of enthusiasm since in the event of a change both parties might be embarrassed  there was danger too of collisions with his family and mr parsons took counsel with miss charlecote knowing indeed that where her affections were concerned her opinions must be taken with a qualification but relying on the good sense formed by rectitude of purpose  honors affection for robert fulmort had always been moderated by owens antagonism her moderation in superlatives commanded implicit credence and mr parsons inferred more instead of less than she expressed better able as he was to estimate that manly character gaining force with growth and though slow to discern between good and evil always firm to the duty when it was once perceived and thus rising with the elevation of the standard  the undemonstrative temper and tardiness in adopting extra habits of religious observance and profession which had disappointed honor struck the clergyman as evidences both of sincerity and evenness of development proving the sterling reality of what had been attained  not taking but trusty judged the vicar  but the lad was an angry lover  how tantalizing to be offered a fourth curate with a long purse only to find st wulstans serving as an outlet for a lovers quarrel and the youth restless and restive ere the end of his diaconate  how savage you are said his wife as if the parish would be hurt by his help or his presence  if he goes let him gosome other help will come  and dont deprive him of the advantage of a good master said honor  this wretched cure is not worth flattery he said smiling  nay said mrs parsons how often have i heard you rejoice that you started here  under mr charlecoteyes  you are the depository of his traditions said honor hand them on to robert  i wish nothing better for owen  mr parsons wished something better for himself and averted a reply by speaking of robert as accepted  roberts next request was to be made useful in the parish while preparing for his ordination in the autumn ember week and though there were demurs as to unnecessarily anticipating the strain on health and strength he obtained his wish in mercy to a state only to be alleviated by the realities of labour  so few difficulties were started by his family that honora suspected that mr fulmort always chiefly occupied by what was immediately before him hardly realized that by taking an assistant curacy at st wulstans his son became one of the pastors of whittingtonstreets great and little richardcourts cicelyrow alicelane catalley and turnagaincorner  scarcely however was this settled when a despatch arrived from dublin headed the fast fly fishers or the modern st kevin containing in ingoldsby legendlike rhymes the entire narration of the glendalough predicament of the fast and fair and concluding with a piece of prose by the same author assuring his sweet honey that the poem though strange was true that he had just seen the angelic anglers on board the steamer and it would not be for lack of good advice on his part if lucy did not present herself at woolstonelane to partake of the dish called humble pie on the derivation whereof antiquaries were divided  half amused half vexed by his levity and wholly relieved and hopeful honora could not help showing owens performance to phoebe for the sake of its cleverness but she found the child too young and simple to enter into it for the whole effect was an entreaty that robert might not see it only hear the facts  rather annoyed by this want of appreciation of owens wit honora saw nevertheless that phoebe had come to a right conclusion  the breach was not likely to be diminished by finding that the wilful girl had exposed herself to ridicule and the fulmort nature had so little sense of the ludicrous that this goodnatured brotherly satire would be taken for mere derision  so honor left it to phoebe to give her own version only wishing that the catastrophe had come to his knowledge before his arrangements had been made with mr parsons  phoebe had some difficulty in telling her story  robert at first silenced her peremptorily but after ten minutes relented and said moodily well let me hear  he listened without relaxing a muscle of his rigid countenance and when phoebe ended by saying that miss charlecote had ordered lucys room to be prepared thinking that she might present herself at any moment he said take care that you warn me when she comes  i shall leave town that minute  robert robert if she come home grieved and knowing better  i will not see her he repeated  i made her taking this journey the test  the result is nothing to me  phoebe i trust to you that no intended goodnature of miss charlecotes should bring us together promise me  phoebe could do nothing but promise and not another sentence could she obtain from her brother indeed his face looked so formidable in its sternness that she would have been a bold maiden to have tried  honora augured truly that not only was his stern nature deeply offended but that he was quite as much in dread of coming under the power of lucys fascinations as cilla had ever been of his strength  such mutual aversion was really a token of the force of influence upon each and honor assured phoebe that all would come right  let her only come home and be good and you will see phoebe  she will not be the worse for an alarm nor even for waiting till after his two years at st wulstans  the reception of the travellers at castle blanch was certainly not mortifying by creating any excitement  charles charteris said his worst in the words one week and his wife was glad to have some one to write her notes  this indifference fretted lucy  she found herself loathing the perfumy rooms the sleepy voice and hardly able to sit still in her restless impatience of lollys platitudes and charless insouciance while rashe could never be liked again  even a lecture from honor charlecote would have been infinitely preferable and one grim look of roberts would be bliss  no one knew whether miss charlecote were still in town nor whether augusta fulmort were to be married in england or abroad and as to miss murrell lolly languidly wondered what it was that she had heard  hungering for some one whom she could trust lucilla took an early breakfast in her own room and walked to wrapworth hoping to catch the curate lingering over his coffee and letters  from a distance however she espied his form disappearing in the schoolporch and approaching heard his voice reading prayers and the childrens chanted response coming to the oriel she looked in  there were the rows of shiny heads fair brown and black there were the long sable back and choppedhay locks of the curate but where a queenlike figure had of old been wont to preside she beheld a tallow face with sandy hair under the most precise of net caps and a straight threadpaper shape in scanty gray stuff and white apron  dizzy with wrathful consternation cilla threw herself on one of the seats of the porch shaking her foot and biting her lip frantic to know the truth yet too much incensed to enter even when the hum of united voices ceased the rushing sound of rising was over and measured footsteps pattered to the classes where the manly interrogations sounded alternately with the shrill little answers  clump clump came the heavy feet of a laggard her head bent over her book her thick lips vainly conning the unlearned task unaware of the presence of the young lady till lucilla touched her saying what martha a ten oclock scholar  she gave a little cry opened her staring eyes and dropped a curtsey  whom have you here for mistress asked lucilla  please maam governess is runned away  what do you mean  yes maam replied the girl developing powers of volubility such as scholastic relations with her had left unsuspected  she ran away last saturday was a week and there was nobody to open the school when we came to it a sunday morning and we had holidays all last week maam and mother was terrified 225 out of her life and father he said he wouldnt have me never go for to do no such thing and that he didnt want no fine ladies as was always spiting of me  every one will seem to spite you if you keep no better hours said lucy little edified by marthas virtuous indignation  the girl had scarcely entered the school before the clergyman stood on the threshold and was seized by both hands with the words oh mr prendergast what is this  you here cilla  whats the matter  what has brought you back  had you not heard  a sprain of ratias and other things  never mind whats all this  ah i knew you would be sadly grieved  so you did frighten her away  i never meant it  i tried to act for the best  she was spoken to by myself and others but nobody could make any impression and we could only give her notice to go at the harvest holidays  she took it with her usual grand air  which is really misery and despair  oh why did i go  go on  i wrote to the mother advising her if possible to come and be with the girl till the holidays  that was on thursday week and the old woman promised to come on the mondaywrote a very proper letter allowing for the methodistical phrasesbut on the saturday it was observed that the house was not opened and on sunday morning i got a noteif youll come in ill show it to you  he presently discovered it among multitudinous other papers on his chimneypiece  within a ladylike envelope was a thick satinpaper queenssized note containing these words      reverend sirit is with the deepest feelings of regret for the     unsatisfactory appearance of my late conduct that i venture to     address you but time will enable me to account for all and i can at     the present moment only entreat you to pardon any inconvenience i may     have occasioned by the precipitancy of my departure  credit me     reverend and dear sir it was only the law of necessity that could     have compelled me to act in a manner that may appear questionable     your feeling heart will excuse my reserve when you are informed of     the whole  in the meantime i am only permitted to mention that this     morning i became a happy wife  with heartfelt thanks for all the     kindness i have received i remain                                                              reverend sir                                                    your obedient servant                                                                    edna  not one message to me exclaimed lucilla  her not having had the impudence is the only redeeming thing  i did not think she would have left no word for me said lucy who knew she had been kinder than her wont and was really wounded  happy wife who can it be  happy wife repeated the curate  it is miserable fool most likely by this time  no surname signed  whats the postmark  only charingcross  could you find out nothing or did you not think it worth while to look  what do you take me for cilla  i inquired at the station but she had not been there and on the monday i went to london and saw the mother who was in great distress for she had had a letter much like mine only more unsatisfactory throwing out absurd hints about grandeur and prosperitypoor deluded simpleton  she distinctly says she is married  yes but she gives no name nor place  whats that worth  after such duplicity as she has been practising so long i dont know how to take her statement  those people are pleased to talk of a marriage in the sight of heaven when they mean the devils own work  no no  i will not think it  then dont my dear  you were very young and innocent and thought no harm  im not youngim not innocent furiously said cilly  tell me downright all you suspect  im not given to suspecting said the poor clergyman half in deprecation half in reproof but i am afraid it is a bad business  if she had married a servant or any one in her own rank there would have been no need of concealing the name at least from her mother  i feared at first that it was one of your cousin charless friends but there seems more reason to suppose that one of the musical people at your concert at the castle may have thought her voice a good speculation for the stage  he would marry her to secure her gains  if so why the secrecy  mrs jenkins has taught you to make it as bad as possible burst out lucy  o why was not i at home  is it too late to trace her and proclaim her innocence  i was wishing for your help  i went to mr charteris to ask who the performers were but he knew nothing about them and said you and his sister had managed it all  the director was derval  he is fairly respectable at least i know nothing to the contrary  ill make charlie write  there was an italian with a black beard and a bass voice whom we have had several times  i saw him looking at her  just tell me what sort of woman is the mother she lets lodgings does not she  yes in little whittingtonstreet  dear me  i trust she is no friend of honor charlecotes  out of her beat i should think  she dissents  what a blessing  i beg your pardon but if anything could be an aggravation it would be honor charlecotes moralities  so you were not aware of the dissent  and you are going to set that down as more deceit as if it were the poor things business to denounce her mother  now to show you that i can be sure that edna was brought up to the church i will tell you her antecedents  her father was sir thomas deanes butler they lived in the village and she was very much in the nursery with the miss deaneshad some lessons from the governess  there was some notion of making her a nursery governess but sir thomas died the ladies went abroad taking her father with them edna was sent to a training school and the mother went to live in the city with a relation who let lodgings and who has since died leaving the concern to mrs murrell whose husband was killed by an upset of the carriage on the alps  i heard all that and plenty besides  poor woman she was in such distress that one could not but let her pour it all out but i declare the din rang in my ears the whole night after  a very nice respectablelooking body she was with jetblack eyes like diamonds and a rosy countrified complexion quite a treat to see in that grimy place her widows cap as white as snow but oh such a tongue  she would give me all her spiritual experienceshow she was converted by an awakening minister in catalley and yet had a great respect for such ministers of the church as fed their flocks with sincere milk mixed up with the biography of all the shopmen and clerks who ever lodged there and to whom she acted as a mother  it was not their fault that she did not act as a motherinlaw  edna has told me of the unpleasantness of being at home on account of the young men  exactly  i was spared none of the chances she might have had but the only thing worthy of note was about a cashier who surreptitiously brought a friend from the hopera to overhear her singing hymns on the sunday evening and thus led to an offer on his part to have her brought out on the stage  ha could that have come to anything  no  mrs murrells suspicions took that direction and we hunted down the cashier and the friend but they were quite exonerated  it only proves that her voice has an unfortunate value  if she be gone off with the italian bass i cant say i think it a fatal sign that she was slow to present him to her domestic mause headrigg who no doubt would deliberately prefer the boards of her coffin to the boards of the theatre  well come alongwe will get a letter from charles and rescue heri mean clear her  wont you look into school and see how we go on  the women complained so much of having their children on their hands though i am sure they had sent them to school seldom enough of late that i got this young woman from mrs stuarts asylum till the holidays  i think we shall let her stay on she has a good deal of method and all seem pleased with the change  you have your wish of a fright  no i thank you  im not so glad as the rest of you to get rid of refinement and superiority  there was no answer and more touched by silence than reply she hastily said never mind  i dare say she may do better for the children but you know i who am hard of caring for any one did care for poor edna and i cant stand paeans over your new broom  mr prendergast gave a smile such as was only evoked by his late rectors little daughter and answered no one can be more concerned than i  she was not in her place here that was certain and i ought to have minded that she was not thrust into temptation  i shall remember it with shame to my dying day  which means to say that so should i  no you did not know so much of the evils of the world  i told you before mr pendy that i am twenty times more sophisticated than you are  you talk of knowing the world  i wish i didnt  im tired of everybody  and on the way home she described her expedition and had the pleasure of the curates sympathy if not his entire approval  perhaps there was no other being whom she so thoroughly treated as a friend actually like a woman friend chiefly because he thoroughly believed in her and was very blind to her faults  robert would have given worlds to have found her once what mr prendergast found her always  she left him to wait in the drawingroom while she went on her mission but presently rushed back in a fury  nobody cared a straw for the catastrophe  lolly begged her not to be so excited about a trifle it made her quite nervous and the others laughed at her rashe pretended to think it a fine chance to have changed the life of an early christian for the triumphs of the stage and charles scouted the idea of writing to the mans employer  he call derval to account for all the tricks of his fiddlers and singers  much obliged  mr prendergast decided on going to town by the next train to make inquiries of derval himself without further loss of time and cilly declared that she would go with him and force the conceited professor to attend but the curate who had never found any difficulty in enforcing his own dignity and thought it no business for a young lady declined her company unless he said she were to spend the day with miss charlecote  ive a great mind to go to her for good and all  let her fall upon me for all and sundry  it will do me good to hear a decent woman speak again besides poor old soul she will be so highly gratified that she will be quite meek and so will some one else quoth the perverse little heart ill put up a few things and not delay you  this is very sudden said the curate wishing to keep the peace between her and her friends and not willing that his sunbeam should fleet so like the borealis race  will it not annoy your cousins  they ought to be annoyed  and are you certain that you would find miss charlecote in town  i thought her stay was to be short  im certain of nothing but that every place is detestable  what would you do if you did not find her  go on to eustonsquare  do you think i dont know my way to hiltonbury or that i should not get welcome enoughay and too muchthere  then if you are so uncertain of her movements do you not think you had better let me learn them before you start  she might not even be gone home and you would not like to come back here again if  like a dog that has been out hunting said lucilla who could bear opposition from this quarter as from no other  you wont take the responsibility thats the fact  well you may go and reconnoitre if you will but mind if you say one word of what brings you to town i shall never go near the holt at all  to hearwhenever the raymonds or any other of the godly schoolkeeping sort come to dinnerof the direful effects of certificated schoolmistresses would drive me to such distraction that i cannot answer for the consequences  i am sure it is not a fact to proclaim  ah but if you run against mr parsons youll never abstain from telling him of his stray lamb nor from condoling with him upon the wolf in catalley  now theres a fair hope of his having more on his hands than to get his fingers scratched by meddling with the cats and so that this may remain unknown  so consider yourself sworn to secrecy  mr prendergast promised  the good man was a bit of a gossip so perhaps her precaution was not thrown away for he could hardly have helped seeking the sympathy of a brother pastor especially of him to whose fold the wanderer primarily belonged  nor did lucy feel certain of not telling the whole herself in some unguarded moment of confidence  all she cared for was that the story should not transpire through some other source and be brandished over her head as an illustration of all the maxims that she had so often spurned  she ran after mr prendergast after he had taken leave to warn him against calling in woolstonelane and desired him instead to go to masterss shop where it was sure to be known whether miss charlecote were in town or not  mr prendergast secretly did grateful honour to the consideration that would not let him plod all the weary way into the city  little did he guess that it was one part mistrust of his silence and three parts reviving pride which forbade that honora should know that he had received any such commission  the day was spent in pleasant anticipations of the gratitude and satisfaction that would be excited by her magnanimous return and her pardon to honor and to robert for having been in the right  she knew she could own it so graciously that robert would be overpowered with compunction and for ever beholden to her and now that the charterises were so unmitigatedly hateful it was time to lay herself out for goodness and fling him the rein with only now and then a jerk to remind him that she was a free agent  a longtalkedof journey on the continent was to come to pass as soon as horatias strain was well  in spite of wealth and splendour eloisa had found herself disappointed in the step that she had hoped her marriage would give her into the most elite circles  languid and indolent as her mind was she could not but perceive that where ratia was intimate and at ease she continued on terms of form and ceremony and her husband felt more keenly that the society in his house was not what it had been in his mothers time  they both became restless and lolly who had already lived much abroad dreaded the dulness of an english winter in the country while charles knew that he had already spent more than he liked to recollect and that the only means of keeping her contented at castle blanch would be to continue most ruinous expenses  with all these secret motives the tour was projected as a scheme of amusement and the details were discussed between charles and rashe with great animation making the soberness of hiltonbury appear both tedious and sombre though all the time lucy felt that there she should again meet that which her heart both feared and yearned for and without which these pleasures would be but shadows of enjoyment  yet that they were not including her in their party gave her a sense of angry neglect and impatience  she wanted to reject their invitation indignantly and make a merit of the sacrifice  the afterdinner discussion was in full progress when she was called out to speak to mr prendergast  heated wearied and choking with dust he would not come beyond the hall but before going home he had walked all this distance to tell her the result of his expedition  derval had not been uncivil but evidently thought the suspicion an affront to his corps which at present was dispersed by the end of the season  the italian bass was a married man and had returned to his own country  the clue had failed  the poor leaf must be left to drift upon unknown winds  but said the curate by way of compensation at masterss i found miss charlecote herself and gave your message  i gave no message  no no because you would not send me up into the city but i told her all you would have had me say and how nearly you had come up with me only i would not let you for fear she should have left town  cillas face did not conceal her annoyance but not understanding her in the least he continued im sure no one could speak more kindly or considerately than she did  her eyes filled with tears and she must be heartily fond of you at the bottom though maybe rather injudicious and strict but after what i told her you need have no fears  did you ever know me have any  ah well you dont like the word but at any rate she thinks you behaved with great spirit and discretion under the circumstances and quite overlooks any little imprudence  she hopes to see you the day after tomorrow and will write and tell you so  perhaps no intentional slander ever gave the object greater annoyance than cilly experienced on learning that the good curate had in the innocence of his heart represented her as in a state of proper feeling and interceded for her and it was all the worse because it was impossible to her to damp his kind satisfaction otherwise than by a brief thank you the tone of which he did not comprehend  was she alone she asked  didnt i tell you the young lady was with her and the brother  robert fulmort and cillas heart sank at finding that it could not have been he who had been with owen  ay the young fellow that slept at my house  he has taken a curacy at st wulstans  did he tell you so with an illconcealed start of consternation  not he lads have strange manners  i should have thought after the terms we were upon here he need not have been quite so much absorbed in his book as never to speak  he has plenty in him instead of manners said lucilla but ill take him in hand for it  though lucillas instinct of defence had spoken up for robert she felt hurt at his treatment of her old friend and could only excuse it by a strong fit of conscious moodiness  his taking the curacy was only explicable she thought as a mode of showing his displeasure with herself since he could not ask her to marry into whittingtonia but that must be all nonsense thought she i will soon have him down off his high horse and mr parsons will never keep him to his engagementsilly fellow to have made itor if he does i shall only have the longer to plague him  it will do him good  let me see he will come down tomorrow with honoras note  ill put on my lilac muslin with the innocent little frill and do my hair under his favourite net and look like such a horrid little meek ringdove that he will be perfectly disgusted with himself for having ever taken me for a fishing eagle  he will be abject and ill be generous and not give another peck till it has grown intolerably stupid to go on being good or till he presumes  for the first time for many days lucilla awoke with the impression that something pleasant was about to befall her and her wild heart was in a state of glad flutter as she donned the quiet dress and found that the subdued colouring and graver style rendered her more softly lovely than she had ever seen herself  the letters were on the breakfasttable when she came down the earliest as usual and one was from honor charlecote the first sight striking her with vexation as discomfiting her hopes that it would come by a welcome bearer  yet that might be no reason why he should not yet run down  she tore it open      my dearest lucyuntil i met mr prendergast yesterday i was not     sure that you had actually returned or i would not have delayed an     hour in assuring you if you could doubt it that my pardon is ever     ready for you      many thanks was the muttered comment  oh that poor dear     stupid man would that i had stopped his mouth      i never doubted that your refinement and sense of propriety would be     revolted at the consequences of what i always saw to be mere     thoughtlessness      dearly beloved of an old maid is i told you so      but i am delighted to hear that my dear child showed so much true     delicacy and dignity in her trying predicament      delighted to find her dear child not absolutely lost to decorum     thanks again      and i console myself for the pain it has given by the trust that     experience has proved a better teacher than precept      where did she find that grand sentence      so that good may result from past evil and present suffering and     that you may have learnt to distrust those who would lead you to     disregard the dictates of your own better sense      meaning her own self      i have said all this by letter that we may cast aside all that is     painful when we meet and only to feel that i am welcoming my child     doubly dear because she comes owning her error      i dare say  we like to be magnanimous dont we  oh mr     prendergast i could beat you      our first kiss shall seal your pardon dearest and not a word shall     pass to remind you of this distressing page in your history      distressing  excellent fun it was  i shall make her hear my     diary if i persuade myself to encounter this intolerable kiss of     peace  it will be a mercy if i dont serve her as the thief in the     fable did his mother when he was going to be hanged      i will meet you at the station by any train on saturday that you     like to appoint and early next week we will go down to what i am     sure you have felt is your only true home      have i  oh she has heard of their journey and thinks this my     only alternative  as if i could not go with them if i chosei wish     they would ask me though  they shall  ill not be driven up to the     holt as my last resource and live there under a system of mild     browbeating because i cant help it  no no robin shall find it     takes a vast deal of persuasion to bend me to swallow so much pardon     in milk and water  i wonder if theres time to change the spooney     simplicity and come out in something spicy with a dash of the     bloomer  but maybe theres some news of him in the other sheet     now she has delivered her conscience of her rigmarole  oh here it     is      phoebe will go home with us as she is according to the family     system not summoned to her sisters wedding  robert leaves london     on saturday morning to fetch his books c from oxford mr     parsons having consented to give him a title for holy orders and to     let him assist in the parish until the next ember week  i think     dear girl that it should not be concealed from you that this step     was taken as soon as he heard that you had actually sailed for     ireland and that he does not intend to return until we are in the     country      does he not  another act of coercion  i suppose you put him up to     this madam as a pleasing course of discipline  you think you have     the whiphand of me do you  pooh  see if hell stay at oxford      i feel for the grief im inflicting      oh so you complacently think now i have made her sorry      but i believe uncertainty waiting and heart sickness would cost     you far more  trust me as one who has felt it that it is far     better to feel oneself unworthy than to learn to doubt or distrust     the worthiness or constancy of another      my father to wit  a pretty thing to say to his daughter  what     right has she to be pining and complaining after him  he the     unworthy one  ill never forgive that conceited inference  just     because he could not stand sentiment  master robert gone  wont i     soon have him repenting of his outbreak      i have no doubt that his feelings are unchanged and that he is     solely influenced by principle  he is evidently exceedingly unhappy     under all his reserve      he shall be more so till he behaves himself and comes back     humble  ive no notion of his flying out in this way      and though i have not exchanged a word with him on the subject i     am certain that his good opinion will be retrieved with infinite joy     to himself as soon as you make it possible for his judgment to be     satisfied with your conduct and sentiments  grieved as i am it is     with a hopeful sorrow for i am sure that nothing is wanting on your     part but that consistency and sobriety of behaviour of which you have     newly learnt the necessity on other grounds  the parsonses have gone     to their own house so you will not find any one here but two who     will feel for you in silence and we shall soon be in the quiet of     the holt where you shall have all that can give you peace or comfort     from your everloving old         h c  feel for me  never  dont you wish you may get it  teach the catechism and feed caterpillars till such time as it pleases mrs honor to write up and say the specimen is tame  how nice  no no  ill not be frightened into their lording it over me  i know a better way  let mr robert find out how little i care and get himself heartily sick of st wulstans till it is turn again whittington indeed  poor fellow i hate it but he must be cured of his airs and have a good fright  why dont they ask me to go to paris with them  where can i go if they dont  to mary cranfords  stupid place but i will show that im not so hard up as to have no place but the holt to go to  if it were only possible to stay with mr prendergast it would be best of all  cant i tell him to catch a chaperon for me  then he would think honor a regular dragon which would be a shame for it was nobodys fault but his  i shall tell him im like the christian religion for which people are always making apologies that it doesnt want  two years  patience  it will be very good for robin and fourandtwenty is quite soon enough to bite off ones wings and found an anthill  as to being bullied into being kissed pitied pardoned and trained by honor ill never sink so low  no at no price  poor mr prendergast  did ever a more innocent mischiefmaker exist  poor honora  little did she guess that the letter written in such love such sympathy such longing hope would only excite fierce rebellion  yet it was at the words of moses that the kings heart was hardened and what was the end  he was taken at his word  thou shalt see my face no more  to be asked to join the party on their tour had become lucillas prime desire if only that she might not feel neglected or driven back to hiltonbury by absolute necessity and when the husband and wife came down the wish was uppermost in her mind  eloisa remarked on her quiet style of dress and observed that it would be quite the thing in paris where people were so much less outre than here  i have nothing to do with paris  oh surely you go with us said eloisa i like to take you out because you are in so different a style of beauty and you talk and save one trouble  will not she go charles  you see lolly wants you for effect he said sneeringly  but you are always welcome cilly we are woefully slow when you aint there to keep us going and i should like to show you a thing or two  i only did not ask you because i thought you had not hit it off with rashe or have you made it up  oh rashe and i understand each other said cilly secure that though she would never treat rashe with her former confidence yet as long as they travelled en grand seigneur there was no fear of collisions of temper  rashe is a good creature said lolly but she is so fast and so eccentric that i like to have you cilly you look so much younger and more ladylike  one thing more said charles in his character of head of the family shouldnt you look up miss charlecote cilly  theres owen straining the leash pretty hard and you must look about you that she does not take up with these new pets of hers and cheat you  the fulmorts  stuff  they have more already than they know what to do with  the very reason she will leave them the more  i declare cilly he added half in jest half in earnest the only security for you and owen is in a double marriage  perhaps she projects it  you fire up as if she had  if she had do you think that i should go back said cilly trying to answer lightly though her cheeks were in a flame  no no i am not going to let slip a chance of paris  she stopped short dismayed at having committed herself and horatia coming down was told by acclamation that cilly was going  of course she is said forgiving and forgetting rashe  little cilly left behind to serve for food to the rouge dragon  no no i should have no fun in life without her  rashe forgot the past far more easily that cilla could ever do  there was a certain guilty delight in writing      my dear honormany thanks for your letter and intended     kindnesses  the scene must however be deferred as my cousins mean     to winter at paris and i cant resist the chance of hooking a     marshal or a prince or two  rashes strain was a great sell but we     had capital fun and shall hope for more success another season  i     would send you my diary if it were written out fair  we go so soon     that i cant run up to london so i hope no one will be disturbed on     my account                                              your affectionate     cilly  no need to say how often lucilla would have liked to have recalled that note for addition or diminution how many misgivings she suffered on her peculiar mode of catching robins how frequent were her disgusts with her cousin and how often she felt like a captivethe captive of her own selfwill  thats right said horatia to lolly  i was mortally afraid she would stay at home to fall a prey to the incipient parson but now he is choked off and calthorp is really in earnest we shall have the dear little morsel doing well yet    chapter x       o ye who never knew the joys     of friendship satisfied with noise        fandango ball and rout     blush when i tell you how a bird     a prison with a friend preferred        to liberty withoutcowper  had lucilla sandbrook realized the effect of her note she would never have dashed it off but like all heedless people pain out of her immediate ken was nothing to her  after the loving hopes raised by the curates report and after her own tender and forgiving letter honor was pierced to the quick by the scornful levity of those few lines  of the ingratitude to herself she thought but little in comparison with the heartless contempt towards robert and the miserable lightmindedness that it manifested  my poor poor child was all she said as she saw phoebe looking with terror at her countenance yes there is an end of it  let robert never vex himself about her again  phoebe took up the note read it over and over again and then said low and gravely it is very cruel  poor child she was born to the charteris nature and cannot help it like seeks like and with paris before her she can see and feel nothing else  phoebe vaguely suspected that there might be a shadow of injustice in this conclusion  she knew that miss charlecote imagined lucilla to be more frivolous than was the case and surmised that there was more offended pride than mere levity in the letter  insight into character is a natural not an acquired endowment and many of poor honors troubles had been caused by her deficiency in that which was intuitive to phoebe though far from consciously  that perception made her stand thoughtful wondering whether what the letter betrayed were folly or temper and whether like miss charlecote she ought altogether to quench her indignation in contemptuous pity  there my dear said honor recovering herself after having sat with ashy face and clasped hands for many moments  it will not bear to be spoken or thought of  let us go to something else  only phoebe my child do not leave her out of your prayers  phoebe clung about her neck kissed and fondled her and felt her cheeks wet with tears in the passionate tenderness of the returning caress  the resolve was kept of not going back to the subject but honora went about all day with a soft tardy step and subdued voice like one who has stood beside a deathbed  when phoebe heard those stricken tones striving to be cheerful she could not find pardon for the wrong that had not been done to herself  she dreaded telling robert that no one was coming whom he need avoid though without dwelling on the tone of the refusal  to her surprise he heard her short matteroffact communication without any token of anger or of grief made no remark and if he changed countenance at all it was to put on an air of gloomy satisfaction as though another weight even in the most undesirable scale were preferable to any remnant of balancing and compunction for possible injustice were removed  could lucilla but have seen that face she would have doubted of her means of reducing him to obedience  the course he had adopted might indeed be the more excellent way in the end but at present even his selfdevotion was not in such a spirit as to afford much consolation to honor  if good were to arise out of sorrow the painful seedtime was not yet over  his looks were stern even to harshness and his unhappiness seemed disposed to vent itself in doing his work after his own fashion brooking no interference  he had taken a lodging over a bakers shop at turnagain corner  honor thought it fair for the locality and knew something of the people but to phoebe it was horror and dismay  the two small rooms the painted cupboard the cut paper in the grate the pictures in yellow gauze with the flies walking about on them the round mirror the pattern of the carpet and the close narrow street struck her as absolutely shocking and she came to miss charlecote with tears in her eyes to entreat her to remonstrate and tell robin it was his duty to live like a gentleman  my dear said honor rather shocked at a speech so like the ordinary fulmort mind i have no fears of robert not living like a gentleman  i knownot in the real sense said phoebe blushing but surely he ought not to live in this dismal poky place with such mean furniture when he can afford better  i am afraid the parish affords few better lodgings phoebe and it is his duty to live where his work lies  you appreciated his selfdenial i thought  do you not like him to make a sacrifice  i ought said phoebe her mind taking little pleasure in those acts of selfdevotion that were the delight of her friend  if it be his duty it cannot be helped but i cannot be happy at leaving him to be uncomfortableperhaps ill  coming down from the romance of martyrdom which had made her expect phoebe to be as willing to see her brother bear hardships in the london streets as she had herself been to dismiss owen the first to his wigwam honor took the more homely view of arguing on the health and quietness of turnagain corner the excellence of the landlady and the fact that her own cockney eyes had far less unreasonable expectations than those trained to the luxuries of beauchamp  but by far the most efficient solace was an expedition for the purchase of various amenities of life on which phoebe expended the last of her fathers gift  the next morning was spent in great secrecy at the lodgings where phoebe was so notable and joyous in her labours that honor drew the conclusion that housewifery was her true element and science art and literature only acquired because they had been made her duties reckoning all the more on the charming order that would rule in owen sandbrooks parsonage  all troubles and disappointments had faded from the young girls mind as she gazed round exulting on the sacred prints on the walls the delicate statuettes and wellfilled spillholder and matchbox on the mantelshelf the solid inkstand and appurtenances upon the handsome tablecover the comfortable easychair and the bookcases whose contents had been reduced to order due and knew that the bedroom bore equal testimony to her skill while the good landlady gazed in admiration acknowledging that she hardly knew her own rooms and promising with all her heart to take care of her lodger  alas when on the way to the station honor and phoebe made an unexpected raid to bring some last improvements robert was detected in the act of undoing their work and denuding his room of even its original luxuries  phoebe spoke not but her face showed her discomfiture and honora attacked him openly  i never meant you to know it he said looking rather foolish  then to ingratitude you added treachery  it is not that i do not feel your kindness  but you are determined not to feel it  no no only this is no position for mere luxuries  my fellowcurates  will use such conveniences of life as come to them naturally said honor who had lived long enough to be afraid of the freaks of asceticism  hear me robert  you are not wise in thrusting aside all that brings home to you your little sisters love  you think it cannot be forgotten but it is not well to cast away these daily memorials  i know you have much to make you severenay morosebut if you become so you will never do your work efficiently  you may repel but never invite frighten but not soothe  you want me to think my efficiency dependent on armchairs and tablecovers  i know you will be harder to all for living in needless discomfort and that you will be gentler to all for constantly meeting tokens of your sisters affection  had you sought these comforts for yourself the case would be different but robert candidly which of you is the selfpleasing which the mortified one at this moment  robert could not but look convicted as his eyes fell on the innocent face with the tears just kept back by strong effort and the struggling smile of pardon  never mind robin said phoebe as she saw his air of vexation i know you never meant unkindness  do as you think right only pray think of what miss charlecote says  she has one thing more to say added honor  do you think that throwing aside phoebes little services will make you fitter to go among the little children  there was no answer but a reluctant approach to a smile gave phoebe courage to effect her restorations and her whispered you will not disturb them met with an affirmative satisfactory to herself  perhaps he felt as of old when the lady of the holt had struck him for his cruelty to the mouse or expelled him for his bad language  the same temper remained although selfrevenge had become the only outlet  he knew what it was that he had taken for devoted selfdenial  yes robin were miss charlecotes parting words as she went back to days of her own long past  wilful doing right seldom tends to good above all when it begins by exaggeration of duty  and robert was left with thoughts such as perchance might render him a more tractable subordinate for mr parsons instead of getting into training for the order of st dominic  phoebe had to return less joyfully than she had gone forth  her first bright star of anticipation had faded and she had partaken deeply of the griefs of the two whom she loved so well  not only had she to leave the one to his gloomy lodgings in the city and the toil that was to deaden suffering but the other must be parted with at the station to return to the lonely house where not even old ponto would meet herhis last hour having to every ones grief come in her absence  phoebe could not bear the thought of that solitary return and even at the peril of great disappointment to her sisters begged to sleep that first night at the holt but honor thanked her and laughed it off no no my dear i am used to be alone and depend upon it there will be such an arrear of farm business for me that i should hardly have time to speak to you  you need not be uneasy for me dear one there is always relief in having a great deal to do and i shall know you are near to come if i want you  theres a great deal in that knowledge phoebe  if i were of any use  yes phoebe this visit has made you my friend instead of my playfellow  phoebes deepening colour showed her intense gratification  and there are the sundays added honor  i trust miss fennimore will let you come to luncheon and to the second service with me  i will try very hard  for phoebe could not help feeling like the canary who sees his owners hand held out to catch him after his flight or the pony who marks his groom at the gate of the paddock  cage and rein were not grievous but liberty was over and freewill began to sink into submission as the chimneys of home came nearer even though the anticipation of her sisters happiness grew more and more on her and compensated for all  shrieks of ecstasy greeted her she was held as fast as though her sisters feared to lose her again and miss fennimore showed absolute warmth of welcome  foreign tongues were dispensed with and it was a festival evening of chatter and display of purchases presents and commissions  the evidences of phoebes industry were approved  her abstracts of her reading her notes of museums and exhibitions her drawing needlework and new pieces of music exceeded miss fennimores hopes and appalled her sisters  you did all that cried bertha profiting by miss fennimores absence i hope to goodness she wont make it a precedent  wasnt it very tiresome asked maria  sometimes but it made me comfortable as if i had a backbone for my day  but didnt you want to feel like a lady  i dont think i felt otherwise maria  like a grownup lady like mamma and my sisters  o examples cried bertha  no wonder maria thinks doing nothing the great thing to grow up for  but phoebe how could you be so stupid as to go and do all this heap  you might as well have stayed at home  miss fennimore desired me  the very reason why id have read stories and made pictures out of them just to feel myself beyond her talons  talents not talons said maria  cats have talons people have talents  sometimes both sometimes neither observed bertha  no explanation phoebe whats the use  i want to know if owen sandbrook didnt call you little miss precision  something like it  and you went on when he was there  generally  oh what opportunities are wasted on some people  wouldnt i have had fun  but of course he saw you were a poor little notcomeout thing and never spoke to you  oh if miss charlecote would ask me to london  and me chimed in maria  well what would you do  not act like a goose and bring home dry abstracts  id make miss charlecote take me everywhere and quite forget all my science unless i wanted to amaze some wonderful genius  oh dear wont i make augusta look foolish some of these days  she really thinks that steel attracts lightning  do you think miss charlecotes society will appreciate me phoebe  and me again asked maria  phoebe laughed heartily but did not like berthas scoffing mirth at marias question  glad as she was to be at home her glimpse of the outer world had so enlarged her perceptions she could not help remarking the unchildlike acuteness of the younger girl and the obtuse comprehension of the elder and she feared that she had become discontented and faultfinding after her visit  moreover when bertha spoke much english a certain hesitation occurred in her speech which was apt to pass unnoticed in her foreign tongues but which jarred unpleasantly on her sisters ear and only increased when noticed  at nine when phoebe rose as usual to wish good night miss fennimore told her that she need not for the future retire before ten the hour to which she had of late become accustomed  it was a great boon especially as she was assured that the additional hour should be at her own disposal  you have shown that you can be trusted with your time my dear  but not tonight as phoebe was turning to her desk remember how long i have suffered a famine of conversation  what were you not sensible of your own value in that respect  i thought you instructed me i did not know you conversed with me  theres a difference between one susceptible of instruction and anything so flippant and volatile as bertha said miss fennimore smiling  and poor maria  she is so good and kind  if she could only see a few things and people and learn to talk  silence and unobtrusiveness are the only useful lessons for her poor girl then observing phoebes bewildered looks my dear i was forced to speak to bertha because she was growing jealous of marias exemptions but you who have been constantly shielding and supplying her deficiencies you do not tell me that you were not aware of them  i always knew she was not clever said phoebe her looks of alarmed surprise puzzling miss fennimore who in all her philosophy had never dreamt of the unconscious instinct of affection  i could not have thought it she said  thought what  pray tell me  o what is the matter with poor maria  then my dear you really had never perceived that poor maria is nothas not the usual amount of capacitythat she cannot be treated as otherwise than deficient  does mamma know it faintly asked phoebe tears slowly filling her eyes  miss fennimore paused inwardly rating mrs fulmorts powers little above those of her daughter  i am not sure she said your sister juliana certainly does and in spite of the present pain i believe it best that your eyes should be opened  that i may take care of her  yes you can do much in developing her faculties as well as in sheltering her from being thrust into positions to which she would be unequal  you do so already  though her weakness was apparent to me the first week i was in the house yet owing to your kind guardianship i never perceived its extent till you were absent  i could not have imagined so much tact and vigilance could have been unconscious  nay dear child it is no cause for tears  her life may perhaps be happier than that of many of more complete intellect  i ought not to cry owned phoebe the tears quietly flowing all the time  such people cannot do wrong in the same way as we can  ah phoebe till we come to the infinite how shall the finite pronounce what is wrong  phoebe did not understand but felt that she was not in miss charlecotes atmosphere and from the heavenly from him to whom little is given little will be required came to the earthly and said imploring and you will never be hard on her again  i trust i have not been hard on her  i shall task her less and only endeavour to give her habits of quiet occupation and make her manners retiring  it was this relaxation of discipline together with berthas sad habit of teasing which was intolerable in your absence that induced me to explain to her the state of the case  how shocked she must have been  not quite as you were  her first remark was that it was as if she were next in age to you  she is not old enough to understand  the governess shook her head  nay when i found her teasing again she told me it was a psychological experiment  little monkey she laid hold of some books of mine and will never rest till she has come to some conclusion as to what is wanting in maria  too young to feel what it means repeated phoebe  she was no great acquisition as a companion for she neither spoke nor stirred so that the governess would have thought her drowsy but for the uprightness of the straight back and the steady fold of the fingers on the knee  much as miss fennimore detested the sight of inaction she respected the reverie consequent on the blow she had given  it was a refreshing contrast with berthas levity and she meditated why her system had made the one sister only accurate and methodical while the other seemed to be losing heart in mind and becoming hard and shrewd  there was a fresh element in phoebes life  the native respect for the innocent had sprung up within her and her spirit seemed to expand into protecting wings with which to hover over her sister as a charge peculiarly her own  here was the new impulse needed to help her when subsiding into the monotony and taskwork of the schoolroom and to occupy her in the stead of the more exciting hopes and fears that she had partaken in london  miss fennimore wisely relaxed her rule over phoebe since she had shown that liberty was regarded as no motive for idleness so though the maiden still scrupulously accomplished a considerable amount of study she was allowed to portion it out as suited her inclination and was no longer forbidden to interrupt herself for the sake of her sisters  it was infinite comfort to be no longer obliged to deafen her ears to the piteous whine of fretful incapacity and to witness the sullen heaviness of faculties overtasked and temper goaded into torpor  the fact once faced the result was relief maria was spared and considered and phoebe found the governess much kinder not only to her sister but to herself absence had taught the value of the elder pupil and friendly terms of equality were beginning to be established  phoebes freedom did not include solitary walks and on weekdays she seldom saw miss charlecote and then only to hear natural history the only moderately safe ground between the two elder ladies  what was natural science with the one was natural history with the other  one went deep in systems and classifications and thrust linnaeus into the dark ages the other had observed collected and drawn specimens with the enthusiasm of a londoner for the country till she had a valuable little museum of her own gathering and was a handbook for the county curiosities  star bird flower and insect were more than resources they were the friends of her lonely life and awoke many a keen feeling of interest many an aspiration of admiring adoration that carried her through her dreary hours  and though miss fennimore thought her science puerile her credulity extensive and her observations inaccurate yet she deemed even this ladylike dabbling worthy of respect as an element of rational pleasure and selftraining and tried to make bertha respect it and abstain from inundating miss charlecote with sesquipedalian names for systems and families and above all from her principal delight setting the two ladies together by the ears by appealing to her governess to support her abuse of linnaeus as an old dictionarymaker or for some bold geological theory that poor honor was utterly unprepared to swallow  bertha was somewhat like the wren who rising on the eagles head thought itself the monarch of the birds but honor was by no means convinced that she was not merely blindfolded on the back of clavileno aligero  there was neither love nor admiration wasted between honor and miss fennimore and phoebe preferred their being apart  she enjoyed her sunday afternoons short enough for school must not be neglected but honor shyly acceded to phoebes entreaty to be allowed to sit by her class and learn by her teaching  it was an effort  honor shrank from exposing her own misty metaphors hesitating repetitions and trivial queries to so clear a head trained in distinct reasoning but it was the very teaching that the scientific young lady most desired and she treasured up every hint afterwards pursuing the subject with the resolution to complete the chain of evidence and asking questions sometimes rather perplexing to honor accustomed as she was to take everything for granted  out came authorities and honor found herself examining into the grounds of her own halfknowledge gaining fresh ideas correcting old ones and obtaining subjects of interest for many an hour after her young friend had left her  while at home phoebe after running the gauntlet of berthas diversion at her putting herself to school when scripture lessons were long ago done with would delight maria with long murmuring discourses often stories about the scholars but always conveying some point of religious instruction  it was a subject to which maria was less impervious than to any other she readily learned to croon over the simple hymns that phoebe brought home and when once a scripture story had found entrance to her mind would beg to have it marked in her bible and recur to it frequently  miss fennimore left her entirely to phoebe at these times keeping bertha from molesting her by sarcastic queries or by remarks on the singsong hymns such as made phoebe sometimes suspect that marias love for these topics rendered them the more distasteful to the younger girl  she tried to keep them as much sheltered as possible but was still sometimes disconcerted by berthas mischievous laugh or by finding miss fennimores eyes fixed in attention  phoebes last hour on these evenings was spent in laying up her new lore in her diligently kept notebook weighing it and endeavouring to range it in logical sequence which she had been duly trained to consider the test of reasoning  if she sometimes became bewildered and detected insufficient premises for true conclusions if she could not think allegory or analogy the evidence it was made at the sundayschool and which miss charlecote esteemed as absolute proof her sound heart and loving faith always decided her that she should discover the link in time and the doctrine had too strong a hold on her convictions and affections for her to doubt that the chain of argument existed though she had not yet found it  it was not the work for which so young a head was intended and perhaps it was well that she was interrupted by the arrival at home of the heads of the family  augusta and her husband were to spend the winter abroad juliana had met some friends whom she had accompanied to their home and though she had exacted that phoebe should not come out yet the eldest daughter at home was necessarily brought somewhat forward  phoebe was summoned to the family meals and went out driving with her mother or riding with her father but was at other times in the schoolroom where indeed she was the most happy  the life downstairs was new to her and she had not been trained to the talk there expected of her  the one event of her life her visit to london gave evident dissatisfaction  there were growls whenever robert was mentioned and phoebe found that though permission had been given for his taking the curacy it had been without understanding his true intentions with regard to whittingtonia  something had evidently passed between him and his father and brother while on their way through london which had caused them to regard him as likely to be a thorn in their side and phoebe could not but fear that he would meet them in no spirit of conciliation would rather prefer a little persecution and would lean to the side of pastoral rather than filial duty whenever they might clash  even if he should refrain from speaking his full mind to his father he was likely to use no precautions with his brother and phoebe was uneasy whenever either went up for their weekly visit of inspection at the office  her mother gently complained  honora charlecotes doing i suppose  he should have considered more  such a wretched place no genteel family near  your papa would never let me go near it  but he must buy an excellent living soon where no one will know his connection with the trade  the only sympathy phoebe met with at home on roberts ordination was in an unexpected quarter  then your brother has kept his resolution said miss fennimore  under his reserve there is the temper that formed the active ascetics of the middle ages  his doctrine has a strong mediaeval tinge and with sufficient strength of purpose may lead to like results  when phoebe proudly told miss charlecote of this remark they agreed that it was a valuable testimony both to the doctrines and the results honor had had a letter from robert that made her feel by force of contrast that owen was more than three years from a like conception of clerical duty  the storm came at last  by order of the court of chancery there was put up for sale a dreary section of whittingtonia in dire decay and remote from civilization  the firm of fulmort and son had long had their eyes on it as an eligible spot for a palace for the supply of their commodity and what was their rage when their agent was outbidden and the tenements knocked down to an unknown customer for a fancy price after much alarm lest a rival distiller should be invading their territory their wrath came to a height when it finally appeared that the new owner of the six ruinous houses in cicely row was no other than the reverend robert mervyn fulmort with the purpose of building a church and schools for whittingtonia at his own expense  mervyn came home furious  high words had passed between the brothers and his report of them so inflamed mr fulmort that he inveighed violently against the malice and treachery that scrupled not to undermine a father  never speaking to robert again casting him off and exposing the vicar for upholding filial insolence and undutifulness were the mildest of his threats  they seemed to imagine that robert was making this outlay supposing that he would yet be made equal in fortune by his father to the others and there was constant repetition that he was to expect not a farthinghe had had his share and should have no more there was only a scoff at phoebes innocence when she expressed her certainty that he looked for no compensation knowing that he had been provided for and was to have nothing from his father and phoebe trembled under such abuse of her favourite brother till she could bear it no longer and seizing the moment of mervyns absence she came up to her father and said in as coaxing a tone as she could papa should not every one work to the utmost in his trade  what of that little one  then pray dont be angry with robert for acting up to his said phoebe clasping her hands and resting them fondly on his shoulder  act up to a fools head  parsons should mind their business and not fly in their fathers faces  isnt it their work to make people more good continued phoebe with an unconscious wiliness looking more simple than her wont  let him begin with himself then  learn his duty to his father  a jackanapes trying to damage my business under my very nose  if those poor people are in such need of having good done to them  scum of the earth  much use trying to do good to them  ah but if it be his work to try and if he wanted a place to build a school  youre in league with him i suppose  no papa  it surprised me very much  even mr parsons knew nothing of his plans robert only wrote to me when it was done that now he hoped to save a few of the children that are turned out in the streets to steal  steal  theyll steal all his property  a proper fool your uncle was to leave it all to a lad like that  the sure way to spoil him  i could have trebled all your fortunes if that capital had been in my hands and now to see him throw it to the dogs  phoebe i cant stand it conscience  i hate such coxcombry  as if men would not make beasts of themselves whether his worship were in the business or not  yes ventured phoebe but at least he has no part in their doing so  much you know about it said her father again shielding himself with his newspaper but so much less angrily than she had dared to expect that even while flushed and trembling she felt grateful to him as more placable than mervyn  she knew not the power of her own sweet face and gently honest manner nor of the novelty of an attentive daughter  when the neighbours remarked on mrs fulmorts improved looks and spirits and wondered whether they were the effect of the rhine or of getting off her eldest daughter they knew not how many fewer dull hours she had to spend  phoebe visited her in her bedroom talked at luncheon amused her drives coaxed her into the garden read to her when she rested before dinner and sang to her afterwards  phoebe likewise brought her sisters attainments more into notice though at the expense of berthas contempt for mammas preference for marias staring fuchsias and feeble singing above her own bold chalks from models and scientific music and indignation at phoebes constantly bringing maria forward rather than her own clever self  droning narrative long drawn out had as much charm for mrs fulmort as for maria  if she did not always listen she liked the voice and she sometimes awoke into descriptions of the dresses parties and acquaintance of her youth before trifling had sunk into dreary insipidity under the weight of too much wealth too little health and nothing to do  my dear she said i am glad you are not out  quiet evenings are so good for my nerves but you are a fine girl and will soon want society  not at all mamma i like being at home with you  no my dear  i shall like to take you out and see you dressed  you must have advantages or how are you to marry  theres no hurry said phoebe smiling  yes my dear girls always get soured if they do not marry  not miss charlecote mamma  ah but honor charlecote was an heiress and could have had plenty of offers  dont talk of not marrying phoebe i beg  no said phoebe gravely  i should like to marry some one very good and wise who could help me out of all my difficulties  bless me phoebe  i hope you did not meet any poor curate at that place of honor charlecotes  your papa would never consent  i never met anybody mamma said phoebe smiling  i was only thinking what he should be like  well what said mrs fulmort with girlish curiosity  not that its any use settling  i always thought i would marry a marquiss younger son because it is such a pretty title and that he should play on the guitar  but he must not be an officer phoebe we have had trouble enough about that  i dont know what he is to be mamma said phoebe earnestly except that he should be as sensible as miss fennimore and as good as miss charlecote  perhaps a man could put both into one and then he could lead me and always show me the reason of what is right  phoebe phoebe you will never get married if you wait for a philosopher  your papa would never like a very clever genius or an author  i dont want him to be a genius but he must be wise  oh my dear  that comes of the way young ladies are brought up  what would the miss berrilees have said where i was at school at bath if one of their young ladies had talked of wanting to marry a wise man  phoebe gave a faint smile and said what was mr charlecote like mamma whose brass was put up the day robert was locked into the church  humfrey charlecote my dear  the dearest most goodhearted man that ever lived  everybody liked him  there was no one that did not feel as if they had lost a brother when he was taken off in that sudden way  and was not he very wise mamma  bless me phoebe what could have put that into your head  humfrey charlecote a wise man  he was just a common oldfashioned hearty country squire  it was only that he was so friendly and kindhearted that made every one trust him and ask his advice  i should like to have known him said phoebe with a sigh  ah if you married any one like that  but theres no use waiting theres nobody left like him and i wont have you an old maid  you are prettier than either of your sistersmore like me when i came away from miss berrilees and had a goldsprigged muslin for the assize ball and humfrey charlecote danced with me  phoebe fell into speculations on the wisdom whose counsel all asked and which had left such an impression of affectionate honour  she would gladly lean on such an one but if no one of the like mould remained she thought she could never bear the responsibilities of marriage  meantime she erected humfrey charlecotes image into a species of judge laying before this vision of a wise man all her perplexities between miss charlecotes religion and miss fennimores reason and all her practical doubts between roberts conflicting duties  strangely enough the question what would mr charlecote have thought often aided her to cast the balance  though it was still phoebe who decided it was phoebe drawn out of herself and strengthened by her mask  with vivid interest such as for a living man would have amounted to love she seized and hoarded each particle of intelligence that she could gain respecting the object of her admiration  honora herself though far more naturally enthusiastic had with her dreamy nature and diffused raptures never been capable of thus reverencing him nor of the intensity of feeling of one whose restrained imagination and unromantic education gave force to all her sensations  yet this deep individual regard was a more wholesome tribute than honor had ever paid to him or to her other idol for to phoebe it was a step lifting her to things above and beyond a guide on the road never a vision obscuring the true object  six weeks had quietly passed when like a domestic thunderbolt came julianas notification of her intention to return home at the end of a week  mrs fulmort clinging to her single thread of comfort hoped that phoebe might still be allowed to come to her boudoir but the gentlemen more boldly declared that they wanted phoebe and would not have her driven back into the schoolroom to which the mother only replied with fears that juliana would be in a dreadful temper whereon mervyn responded let her  never mind her phoebe  stick up for yourself and well put her down  except for knowing that she was useful to her mother phoebe would have thankfully retired into the west wing rather than have given umbrage mervyns partisanship was particularly alarming and endeavour as she might to hope that juliana would be amiable enough to be disarmed by her own humility and unobtrusiveness she lived under the impression of disagreeables impending  one morning at breakfast mr fulmort after grumbling out his wonder at julianas writing to him suddenly changed his tone into hollo whats this  my engagement  by jove shouted mervyn too good to be true  so shes done it  i didnt think hed been such an ass having had one escape  who continued mr fulmort puzzling as he held the letter far offengagement to deardear devil does she say  the only fit match muttered mervyn laughing  no no sir bevilsir bevil acton  what not the fellow that gave us so much trouble  he had not a sixpence but she must please herself now  you dont mean that you didnt know what she went with the merivales forfive thousand a year and a baronetcy eh  the deuce  if i had known that he might have had her long ago  its quite recent said mervyn  a mere chance and he has been knocking about in the colonies these ten yearsmight have cut his wisdom teeth  ten yearsnot halfadozen said mr fulmort  ten reiterated mervyn  it was just before i went to old raymonds acton took me to dine at the mess  he was a nice fellow then and deserved better luck  ten years constancy said phoebe who had been looking from one to the other in wonder trying to collect intelligence  do tell me  whew whistled mervyn  juliana hadnt her sharp nose nor her sharp tongue when first she came out  acton was quartered at elverslope and got smitten  she flirted with him all the winter but i fancy she didnt give you much trouble when he came to the point eh sir  i thought him an impudent young dog for thinking of a girl of her prospects but if he had this to look toi was sorry for him too  ten years ago mused mr fulmort  and she has liked no one since  or no one has liked her which comes to the same said mervyn  the regiment went to the cape and there was an end of it till we fell in with the merivales on board the steamer and they mentioned their neighbour sir bevil acton come into his property and been settled near them a year or two  fine sport it was to see juliana angling for an invitation brushing up her friendship with minnie merivaleamiable to the last degree  my stars what work she must have had to play good temper all these six weeks and how we shall have to pay for it  or acton will said mr fulmort with a hearty chuckle of triumphant goodhumour  was it a misfortune to phoebe to have been so much refined by education as to be grated on by the vulgar tone of those nearest to her  it was well for her that she could still put it aside as their way even while following her own instinct  mervyn and juliana had been on cat and dog terms all their lives he was certain to sneer at all that concerned her and phoebe reserved her belief that an attachment nipped in the bud was ready to blossom in sunshine  she ran up with the news to her mother  juliana going to be married  well my dear you may be introduced at once  how comfortable you and i shall be in the little brougham  phoebe begged to be told what the intended was like  let me seewas he the one that won the steeplechase  no that was the one that augusta liked  we knew so many young men that i could never tell which was which and your sisters were always talking about them till it quite ran through my poor head such merry girls as they were  and poor juliana never was so merry after he was gone  i dont remember replied this careful mother but you know she never could have meant anything for he had nothing and you with your fortunes are a match for anybody  phoebe my dear we must go to london next spring and you shall marry a nobleman  i must see you a titled lady as well as your sisters  ive no objection provided he is my wise man said phoebe  juliana had found the means of making herself welcome and her marriage a cause of unmixed jubilation in her family  prosperity made her affable and instead of suppressing phoebe she made her useful and treated her as a confidante telling her of all the previous intimacy and all the secret sufferings in dear bevils absence but passing lightly over the last happy meeting which phoebe respected as too sacred to be talked of  the little maidens hopes of a perfect brother in the constant knight rose high and his appearance and demeanour did not disappoint them  he had a fine soldierly figure and that air of a thorough gentleman which phoebes holt experience had taught her to appreciate his manners were peculiarly gentle and kind especially to mrs fulmort and phoebe did not like him the less for showing traces of the effects of wounds and climate and a grave subdued air almost amounting to melancholy  but before he had been three days at beauchamp juliana made a virulent attack on the privileges of her younger sisters  perhaps it was the consequence of poor marias volunteer to sir bevili am glad juliana is going with you for now no one will be cross to me but it seemed to verify the poor girls words that she should be hunted like a strange cat if she were found beyond her own precincts and that the other two should be treated much in the same manner  bertha stood up for her rights declaring that what mamma and miss fennimore allowed she would not give up for juliana but the only result was an admonition to the governess and a fierce remonstrance to the poor meek mother  phoebe who only wished to retire from the stage in peace had a more difficult part to play  whats the matter now demanded mervyn making his way up to her as she sat in a remote corner of the drawingroom in the evening  why were you not at dinner  there was no room i believe  nonsense our table dines eightandtwenty and there were not twenty  that was a large party and you know i am not out  you dont look like it in that longsleeved white affair and nothing on your head either  where are those ivyleaves you had yesterdayreal werent they  they were not liked  not liked they were the prettiest things i have seen for a long time acton said they made you look like a nymphthe green suits that shiny light hair of yours and makes you like a picture  yes they made me look forward and affected  now who told you that  has the fennimore got to her old tricks  oh no no  i see a jealous toad  i heard him telling her that you reminded him of her in old times  the spiteful vixen  well phoebe if you cut her out i bargain for board and lodging at acton manor  this will be no place for a quiet meek soul like me  phoebe tried to laugh but looked distressed uncomprehending and far from wishing to comprehend  she could not escape for mervyn had penned her up and went on you dont pretend that you dont see how it is that unlucky fellow is heartily sick of his bargain but you see he was too soft to withstand her throwing herself right at his head and doing the worm in the bud and the cruel father green and yellow melancholy c ever since they were inhumanly parted  for shame mervyn  you dont really believe it is all out of honour  i should never have believed a man of his years could be so green but some men get crotchets about honour in the army especially if they get elderly there  it is very noble if it be right and he can take those vows from his heart moralized phoebe  but no mervyn she cannot think so  no woman could take any one on such terms  wouldnt she though sneered her brother  shed have him if grim death were hanging on to his other hand  people arent particular when they are nigh upon their third ten  dont tell me such things  i dont believe them but they ought never to be suggested  you ought to thank me for teaching you knowledge of the world  he was called off but heavy at her heart lay the text the knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom  mervyns confidences were serious troubles to phoebe  gratifying as it was to be singled out by his favour it was distressing to be the repository of what she knew ought never to have been spoken prompted by a coarse tone of mind and couched in language that though he meant it to be restrained sometimes seemed to her like the hobgoblins whispers to christian  oh how unlike her other brother  robert had troubles mervyn grievances and she saw which were the worst to bear  it was a pleasing novelty to find a patient listener and he used it to the utmost while she often doubted whether to hear without remonstrance were not undutiful yet found opposition rather increased the evil by the storm of illtemper that it provoked  this last communication was dreadful to her yet she could not but feel that it might be a wholesome warning to avoid giving offence to the jealousy which when once pointed out to her she could not prevent herself from tracing in julianas petulance towards herself and resolve to force her into the background  even bertha was more often brought forward for in spite of a tongue and temper cast somewhat in a similar mould she was rather a favourite with juliana whom she was not unlikely to resemble except that her much more elaborate and accurate training might give her both more power and more selfcontrol  as mervyn insinuated juliana was prudent in not lengthening out the engagement and the marriage was fixed for christmas week but it was not to take place at hiltonbury  sir bevil was bashful and dreaded county festivities and juliana wished to escape from maria as a bridesmaid so they preferred the privacy of an hotel and a london church  phoebe could not decently be excluded and her heart leapt with the hope of seeing robert though so unwelcome was his name in the family that she could not make out on what terms he stood whether proscribed or only disapproved and while sure that he would strive to be with her she foresaw that the pleasure would be at the cost of much pain  owen sandbrook was spending his vacation at the holt and miss charlecote looked so bright as she walked to church leaning on his arm that phoebe had no regrets in leaving her  indeed the damsel greatly preferred the holt in his absence  she did not understand his discursive comments on all things in art or nature and he was in a mood of flighty fitful spirits which perplexed her alike by their wild satirical mirth and their mournful sentiment  she thought miss charlecote was worried and perplexed at times by his tone but there was no doubt of his affection and attention for his sweet honey and phoebe rejoiced that her own absence should be at so opportune a moment  sir bevil went to make his preparations at home whence he was to come and join the fulmorts the day after their arrival in town  mrs fulmort was dragged out in the morning and deposited at farrances in time for luncheon a few minutes before a compact little brougham set down lady bannerman jollier than ever in velvet and sable and more scientific in cutlets and pale ale  her goodnature was full blown  she was ready to chaperon her sisters anywhere invited the party to the christmas dinner and undertook the grand soiree after the wedding  she proposed to take juliana at once out shopping only lamenting that there was no room for phoebe and was so universally benevolent that in the absence of the bride elect phoebe ventured to ask whether she saw anything of robert  robert  yes he called when we first came to town and we asked him to dinner but he said it was a fast day and you know sir nicholas would never encourage that sort of thing  how was he  he looked odder than ever and so ill and cadaverous  no wonder poking himself up in such a horrid place where one cant notice him  did he seem in tolerable spirits  i dont know  he always was silent and glum and now he seems wrapped up in nothing but ragged schools and those disgusting city missions im sure we cant subscribe so expensive as it is living in town  imagine mamma what we are giving our cook  juliana returned and the two sisters went out leaving phoebe to extract entertainment for her mother from the scenes passing in the street  presently a gentlemans handsome cabriolet and distinguishedlooking horse were affording food for their descriptions when to her surprise sir bevil emerged from it and presently entered the room  he had come intending to take out his betrothed and in her absence transferred the offer to her sister  phoebe demurred on more accounts than she could mention but her mother remembering what a drive in a stylish equipage with a military baronet would once have been to herself overruled her objections and hurried her away to prepare  she quickly returned a cheery spectacle in her russet dress and brown straw bonnet and her scarlet necktie the robin redbreasts livery which she loved  your cheeks should be a refreshing sight to the londoners phoebe said sir bevil with his rare but most pleasant smile  where shall we go you dont seem much to care for the park  im at your service wherever you like to go  and as phoebe hesitated with cheeks trebly beneficial to the londoners he kindly added well what is it  never mind what im open to anythingeven madame tussauds  if i might go to see robert  augusta said he was looking ill  my dear interposed her mother you cant think of it  such a dreadful place and such a distance  it is only a little way beyond st pauls and there are no bad streets dear mamma  i have been there with miss charlecote  but if it be too far or you dont like driving into the city never mind she continued turning to sir bevil i ought to have said nothing about it  but sir bevil reading the ardour of the wish in the honest face pronounced the expedition an excellent idea and carried her off with her eyes as round and sparkling as those of the children going to christmas parties  he stole glances at her as if her fresh innocent looks were an absolute treat to him and when he talked it was of robert in his boyhood  i remember him at twelve years old a sturdy young ruffian with an excellent notion of standing up for himself  phoebe listened with delight to some characteristic anecdotes of roberts youth and wondered whether he would be appreciated now  she did not think sir bevil held the same opinions as robert or miss charlecote he was an upright highminded soldier with honour and subordination his chief religion and not likely to enter into roberts peculiarities  she was in some difficulty when she was asked whether her brother were not under some cloud or had not been taking a line of his owna gentler form of inquiry which she could answer with the simple truth  yes he would not take a share in the business because he thought it promoted evil and he felt it right to do parish work at st wulstans because our profits chiefly come from thence  it does not please at home because they think he could have done better for himself and he sometimes is obliged to interfere with mervyns plans  sir bevil made the less answer because they were in the full current of london traffic and his proud chestnut was snuffing the hat of an omnibus conductor  careful driving was needed and phoebe was praised for never even looking frightened then again for her organ of locality and the skilful pilotage with which she unerringly and unhesitatingly found the way through the whittingtonian labyrinths and as the disgusted tiger pealed at the knocker of turnagain corner she was told she would be a useful guide in the south african bush  at home was the welcome reply and in another second her arms were round roberts neck  there was a thorough brotherly greeting between him and sir bevil each saw in the other a man to be respected and robert could not but be grateful to the man who brought him phoebe  her eyes were on the alert to judge how he had been using himself in the last halfyear  he looked thin yet that might be owing to his highly clerical coat and some of his rural ruddiness was gone but there was no want of health of form or face only the spareness and vigour of thorough working condition  his expression was still grave even to sadness and sternness seemed gathering round his thin lips  heavy of heart he doubtless was still but she was struck by the absence of the undefined restlessness that had for years been habitual to both brothers and which had lately so increased on mervyn that there was a relief in watching a face free from it and telling not indeed of happiness but of a mind made up to do without it  she supposed that his room ought to satisfy her for though untidy in female eyes it did not betray ultra selfneglect  the fire was brisk there was a respectable luncheon on the table and he had even treated himself to the guardian some new books and a beautiful photograph of a foreign cathedral  the room was littered with halfunrolled plans which had to be cleared before the guests could find seats and he had evidently been beguiling his luncheon with the perusal of some large ms sheets redtaped together at the upper corner  thats handsome said sir bevil  what is it for  a school or almshouses  something of both said robert his colour rising  we want a place for disposing of the destitute children that swarm in this district  oh show me cried phoebe  is it to be at that place in cicely row  i hope so  the stiff sheets were unrolled the designs explained  there was to be a range of buildings round a court consisting of dayschools a home for orphans a creche for infants a readingroom for adults and apartments for the clergy of the church which was to form one side of the quadrangle  sir bevil was much interested and made useful criticisms but he objected what is the use of building new churches in the city when there is no filling those you have  st wulstans is better filled than formerly said robert  the pew system is the chief enemy there but even without that it would not hold a tenth part of the whittingtonian population would they come to it which they will not  the church must come to them and with special services at their own times  they need an absolute mission on entirely different terms from the woolstone quarter  and are you about to head the mission  to endeavour to take a share in it  and who is to be at the cost of this pursued sir bevil  have you a subscription list  robert coloured again as he answered why no we can do without that so far  phoebe understood and her face must have revealed the truth to sir bevil for laying his hand on roberts arm he said my good fellow you dont mean that you are answerable for all this  you know i have something of my own  you will not leave much of it at this rate  how about the endowment  i shall live upon the endowment  have you considered  you will be tied to this place for ever  that is one of my objects replied robert and in reply to a look of astonished interrogation myself and all that is mine would be far too little to atone for a fraction of the evil that our house is every day perpetrating here  i should hate the business myself said the baronet but dont you see it in a strong light  every hour i spend here shows me that i do not see it strongly enough  and there followed some appalling instances of the effects of the multiplicity of ginpalaces things that it wellnigh broke roberts heart to witness absorbed as he was in the novelty of his work fresh in feeling and never able to divest himself of a sense of being a sharer in the guilt and ruin  sir bevil listened at first with interest then tried to lead away from the subject but it was roberts single idea and he kept them to it till their departure when phoebes first words were as they drove from the door oh thank you you do not know how much happier you have made me  her companion smiled saying i need not ask which is the favourite brother  mervyn is very kind to me quickly answered phoebe  but robert is the oracle eh he said kindly and merrily  robert has been everything to us younger ones she answered  i am still more glad that you like him  his grave face not responding as she expected she feared that he had been bored that he thought robert righteous over much or disapproved his opinions but his answer was worth having when it came  i know nothing about his views i never looked into the subject but when i see a young man giving up a lucrative prospect for conscience sake and devoting himself to work in that sink of iniquity i see there must be something in him  i cant judge if he goes about it in a wrongheaded way but i should be proud of such a fellow instead of discarding him  oh thank you cried phoebe with ecstasy that made him laugh and quite differently from the madeup laughter she had been used to hear from him  what are you thanking me for he said  i do not imagine that i shall be able to serve him  ill talk to your father about him but he must be the best judge of the discipline of his own family  i was not thinking of your doing anything said phoebe but a kind word about robert does make me very grateful  there was a long silence only diversified by an astonished nod from mervyn driving back from the office  just before setting her down sir bevil said i wonder whether your brother would let us give something to his church  will you find out what it shall be and let me know  as a gift from juliana and myselfyou understand  it was lucky for phoebe that she had brought home a good stock of satisfaction to support her for she found herself in the direst disgrace and her mother too much cowed to venture on more than a feeble selfdefensive murmur that she had told phoebe it would never do convinced in her own conscience that she had done nothing blameworthy phoebe knew that it was the shortest way not to defend herself and the storm was blowing over when mervyn came in charmed to mortify juliana by compliments to phoebe on doing it stylishly careering in actons turnout but when the elder sister explained where she had been mervyn too deserted her and turned away with a fierce imprecation on his brother such as was misery to phoebes ears  he was sourly illhumoured all the evening juliana wreaked her displeasure on sir bevil in ungraciousness till such silence and gloom descended on him that he was like another man from him who had smiled on phoebe in the afternoon  yet though dismayed at the offence she had given and grieved at these evidences of roberts illodour with his family phoebe could not regret having seized her single chance of seeing roberts dwelling for herself nor the having made him known to sir bevil  the one had made her satisfied the other hopeful even while she recollected with foreboding that truth sometimes comes not with peace but with a sword to set at variance parent and child and make foes of them of the same household  juliana never forgave that drive  she continued bitter towards phoebe and kept such a watch over her and sir bevil that the jealous surveillance became palpable to both  sir bevil really wanted to tell phoebe the unsatisfactory result of his pleading for robert she wanted to tell him of roberts gratitude for his offered gift but the exchange of any words in private was out of their power and each silently felt that it was best to make no move towards one another till the unworthy jealousy should have died away  though sir bevil had elicited nothing but abuse of pigheaded folly his espousal of the young clergymans cause was not without effect  robert was not treated with more open disfavour than he had often previously endured and was free to visit the party at farrances if he chose to run the risk of encountering his fathers blunt coldness mervyns sulky dislike and julianas sharp satire but as he generally came so as to find his mother and phoebe alone some precious moments compensated for the various disagreeables  nor did these affect him nearly as much as they did his sister  it was in fact one of his remaining unwholesome symptoms that he rather enjoyed persecution and took no pains to avoid giving offence  if he meant to be uncompromising he sometimes was simply provoking and phoebe feared that sir bevil thought him an unpromising protege  he was asked to the christmas dinner at the bannermans and did not fulfil augustas prediction that he would say it was a fast day and refuse  that evening gave phoebe her best teteatete with him but she observed that all was about whittingtonia not one word of the past summer not so much as an inquiry for miss charlecote  evidently that page in his history was closed for ever and if he should carry out his designs in their present form a wife at the intended institution would be an impossibility  how near the dearest may be to one another and yet how little can they guess at what they would most desire to know  sir bevil had insisted on his being asked to perform the ceremony and she longed to understand whether his refusal were really on the score of his being a deacon or if he had any further motive  his own family were affronted though glad to be left free to request the services of the greatest dignitary of their acquaintance and sir bevils blunt no no poor fellow say no more about it made her suppose that he suspected that roberts vehemence in his parish was meant to work off a disappointment  it was a dreary wedding in spite of london grandeur  in all her success juliana could not help looking pinched and ill at ease her wreath and veil hardening instead of softening her features and her bridegrooms studious cheerfulness and forced laughs became him less than his usual silent dejection  the admiral was useful in getting up stock weddingwit but phoebe wondered how any one could laugh at it and her fellowbridesmaids all her seniors seemed to her as perhaps she might to them like thoughtless children playing with the surface of things she pitied sir bevil and saw little chance of happiness for either yet heard only congratulations and had to be bright busy and helpful under a broad stiff white watered silk scarf beneath which juliana had endeavoured to extinguish her but in which her tall rounded shape looked to great advantage  indeed that young rosy face and the innocently pensive wondering eyes were so sweet that the bride had to endure hearing admiration of her sister from all quarters and the acton bridemaidens whispered rather like those at netherby hall  it was over and phoebe was the reigning miss fulmort  her friends were delighted for her and for themselves and her mother entered on the full enjoyment of the little brougham    chapter xi          when some dear scheme        of our life doth seem     shivered at once like a broken dream        and our hearts to reel        like ships that feel     a sharp rock grating against their keelc f a  it was high summer and in spite of choleraaverting thunderstorms the close streets and the odour of the thames were becoming insufferable mr parsons arranged a series of breathing times for his clerical staff but could make robert fulmort accept none  he was strong and healthy ravenous of work impervious to disgusts and rejected holidays as burdensome and hateful  where should he go  what could he do  what would become of his wild scholars without him and who would superintend his buildings  mr parsons was fain to let him have his own way as had happened in some previous instances specially the edifice in cicely row where the incumbent would have paused but the curate rushed on with resolute zeal and impetuosity taking measures so decidedly ere his intentions were revealed that neither remonstrance nor prevention were easy and a species of annoyed doubtful admiration alone was possible  it was sometimes a gratifying reflection to the vicar that when the buildings were finished whittingtonia would become a district and its busy curate be no longer under his jurisdiction  meantime robert was left with a companion in priests orders but newer to the parish than himself to conduct the services at st wulstans while the other curates were taking holiday and the vicar at his sons countryhouse  to see how contentedly nay pleasurably fulmort endured perpetual broiling passing from frying school to grilling pavement and seething human hive was constant edification to his colleague who fresh from the calm university felt such a life to be a slow martyrdom and wished his liking for the deacon were in better proportion to his esteem  a child to be baptized at 8 little whittingtonstreet he said with resigned despair as at the vestry door he received a message from a small maid one afternoon when the air looked lucid yellow with sultry fire  ill go replied robert with the alacrity that sometimes almost irritated his fellows and off he sped with alert steps at which his friend gazed with the sensation of watching a salamander  little whittingtonstreet where it was not warehouses was chiefly occupied by small tradesfolk or by lodginghouses for the numerous young men employed in the city  it was one of the most respectable parts of that quarter but being much given to dissent was little frequented by the clergy who had too much immorality to contend with to have leisure to speak against schism  when he rang at no 8 the little maid ushered him down a narrow dark staircase and announcing please maam heres the minister admitted him into a small room feeling like a cellar the window opening into an area  it was crowded with gay and substantial furniture and contained two women one lying on a couch partially hidden by a screen the other an elderly person in a widows cap with an infant in her arms  good morning sir we were sorry to trouble you but i felt certain as i told my daughter that a minister of the gospel would not tarry in time of need  not that i put my trust in ordinances sir i have been blest with the enlightenment of the new birth but my daughter sir she follows the church  yes sir the poor little lamb is a sad sufferer in this vale of tears  so wasted away you see you would not think he was nine weeks old  we would have brought him to church before sir only my daughters hillness and her usbands habsence  it was always her wish sir and i was not against it for many true christians have found grace in the church sir  robert considered whether to address himself to the young mother whose averted face and uneasy movements seemed to show that this stream of words was distressing to her  he thought silence would be best procured by his assumption of his office and quietly made his preparations opened his book and took his place  the young woman raising herself with difficulty said in a low sweet voice the gentleman is ready mother  as there was no pressing danger he read the previous collects the elder female responding with devout groans the younger sinking on her knees her face hidden in her wasted hands  he took the little feeble being in his arms and demanded the name  hoeing charterhouse replied the grandmother  he looked interrogative and hoeing charterhouse was repeated  owen charteris said the low sweet voice  a thrill shot over his whole frame as his look met a large full liquid pair of dark eyes such as once seen could never be forgotten though dropped again instantly while a burning blush arose instantly veiled by the hands which hid all up to the dark hair  recalling himself by an effort he repeated the too familiar name and baptized the child bending his head over it afterwards in deep compassion and mental entreaty both for its welfare and his own guidance in the tissue of wrongdoing thus disclosed  a hasty stealthy glance at the hands covering the mothers face showed him the ring on her fourth finger and as they rose from their knees he said i am to register this child as owen charteris sandbrook  with a look of deadly terror she faintly exclaimed i have done it you know him sir you will not betray him  i know you too said robert sternly  you were the schoolmistress at wrapworth  i was sir  it was all my fault  oh promise me sir never to betray him it would be the ruin of his prospects for ever  and she came towards him her hands clasped in entreaty her large eyes shining with feverish lustre her face wasted but still lovely a piteous contrast to the queenly being of a year ago in her pretty schoolroom  compose yourself said robert gravely i hope never to betray any one  i confess that i am shocked but i will endeavour to act rightly  i am sure sir broke in mrs murrell with double volume after her interval of quiescence it is not to be expected but what a gentlemans friends would be offended  it was none of my wish sir being that i never knew a word of it till she was married and it was too late or i would have warned her against broken cisterns  but as for her sir she is as innocent as a miserable sinner can be in a fallen world  it was the young gentleman as sought her out  i always misdoubted the ladies noticing her and making her take part with mensingers and womensingers and such vanities as is pleasing to the unregenerate heart  ah sir without grace where are we  not that he was ever other than most honourable with her or she would never have listened to him not for a moment but she was overpersuaded sir and folks said what they hadnt no right to say and the minister he was ard on her and so you see sir she took fright and married him out of and trusting to a harm of flesh and went to hireland with him  she just writ me a note which filled my art with fear and trembling a nonymous note with only hedna signed to it and i waited with failing eyes and sorrow of heart till one day in autumn he brings her back to me and here she has been ever since dwining away in a nervous fever as the doctors call it as its a misery to see her and he never coming nigh her  once murmured edna who had several times tried to interrupt  once ay for one hour at christmas  he is known here he cant venture often interposed the wife and there was a further whisper he couldnt stay he couldnt bear it  but the dejected accents were lost in the old womans voicenow sir if you know him or his family i wouldnt be wishing to do him no hinjury nor to ruinate his prospects being as he says that the rich lady will make him her hare but sir if you have any power with him as a godly minister or the friend of his youth maybe  he is only waiting till he has a curacya house of his ownmother  no edna hold your peace  it is not fit that i should see my only child cut down as the grass of the field and left a burthen upon me a lone woman while he is eating of the fat of the land  i say it is scandalous that he should leave her here and take no notice not coming near her since one hour at christmas and only just sending her a few pounds now and then not once coming to see his own child  he could not he is abroad pleaded edna  he tells you he is abroad exclaimed robert  he went to paris at easter  he promised to come when he comes home  you poor thing burst out robert  he is deceiving you  he came back at the end of three weeks  i heard from my sister that she saw him on sunday  robert heartily rued his abruptness as the poor young wife sank back in a deadly swoon  the grandmother hurried to apply remedies insisting that the gentleman should not go and continuing all the time her version of her daughters wrongs  her last remnant of patience had vanished on learning this deception and she only wanted to publish her daughters claims proceeding to establish them by hastening in search of the marriage certificate as soon as edna had begun to revive but sooner than robert was satisfied to be left alone with the inanimate helpless form on the couch  he was startled when edna raised her hand and strove to speaksir do not telldo not tell my mother where he is  she must not fret himshe must not tell his friendshe would be angry  she ceased as her mother returned with the certificate of the marriage contracted last july before the registrar of the huge suburban union to which wrapworth belonged the centre of which was so remote that the pseudobanns of owen charteris sandbrook and edna murrell had attracted no attention  it was very wrong feebly said edna i drew him into it  i loved him so much and they all talked so after i went in the boat with him that i thought my character was gone and i begged him to save me from them  it was my fault sir and ive the punishment  youll not betray him sir only dont let that young lady your sister trust to him  not yet  my baby and i shall soon be out of her way  the calm languor of her tone was almost fearful and even as she spoke a shuddering seized her making her tremble convulsively her teeth knocking together and the couch shaking under her  you must have instant advice cried robert  i will fetch some one  you wont betray him almost shrieked edna  a little whilestay a little whilehe will be free of me  there was delirium in look and voice and he was compelled to pause and assure her that he was only going for the doctor and would come again before taking any other step  it was not till the medical man had been summoned that his mind recurred to the words about his sister  he might have dismissed them as merely the jealous suspicion of the deserted wife but that he remembered lucillas hint as to an attachment between owen and phoebe and he knew that such would have been most welcome to miss charlecote  my phoebe my one bright spot was his inward cry must your guileless happiness be quenched  o i would rather have it all over again myself than that one pang should come near you in your sweetness and innocence the blessing of us all  and i not near to guard nor warn  what may not be passing even now  unprincipled hardhearted deceiver walking at large among those gentle unsuspicious womentrading on their innocent trust  would that i had disclosed the villainy i knew of  his hand clenched his brow lowered and his mouth was set so savagely that the passing policeman looked in wonder from the dangerous face to the clerical dress  early next morning he was at no 8 and learnt that mrs brook as the maid called her had been very ill all night and that the doctor was still with her  begging to see the doctor robert found that high fever had set in an aggravation of the low nervous fever that had been consuming her strength all the spring and her condition was already such that there was little hope of her surviving the present attack  she had been raving all night about the young lady with whom mr sandbrook had been walking by moonlight and when the door of the little adjoining bedroom was open her moans and broken words were plainly audible  robert asked whether he should fetch her husband and mrs murrell caught at the offer  owens presence was the single hope of restoring her and at least he ought to behold the wreck that he had wrought  mrs murrell gave a terrible thrust by saying that the young lady at least ought to be let know that she might not be trusting to him  do not fear mrs murrell he said almost under his breath  my only doubt is whether i can meet owen sandbrook as a christian should  cutting off her counsels on the unconverted nature he strode off to find his colleague whom he perplexed by a few rapid words on the necessity of going into the country for the day  his impatient condition required vehement action and with a sense of hurrying to rescue phoebe he could scarcely brook the slightest delay till he was on his way to hiltonbury nor till the train spared him all action could he pause to collect his strength guard his resentment or adjust his measures for warning but not betraying  he could think of no honourable mode of dealing save carrying off owen to london with him at once sacrificing the sight of his sister for the present and either writing or going to her afterwards when the mode of dealing the blow should be more evident  it cost him keen suffering to believe that this was the sole right course but he had bound himself to it by his promise to the poor suffering wife blaming himself for continually putting his sister before her in his plans  at elverslope on his demand for a fly for hiltonbury he was answered that all were engaged for the horticultural show in the forest but the people at the station knowing him well made willing exertions to procure a vehicle for him and a taxed cart soon making its appearance he desired to be taken not to the holt but to the forest where he had no doubt that he should find the object of his search  this horticultural show was the great gaiety of the year  the society had originated with humfrey charlecote for the benefit of the poor as well as the rich and the summer exhibition always took place under the trees of a fragment of the old forest which still survived at about five miles from hiltonbury  the day was a county holiday  the delicate orchid and the crowned pine were there with the hairy gooseberry the cabbage and potato and the homely cottagegarden nosegay from many a woodland hamlet  the young ladies competed in collections of dried flowers for a prize botany book and the subscriptions were so arranged that on this festival each poorer member might with two companions be provided with a hearty meal while grandees and farmers had a luncheontent of their own and regarded the day as a county picnic  it was a favourite affair with all intensely enjoyed and full of good neighbourhood  humfrey charlecotes spirit never seemed to have deserted it it was a gathering of distant friends a delight of children as of the full grown and while the young were frantic for its gipsying fun their elders seldom failed to attend if only in remembrance of poor mr charlecote who had begged one and all not to let it drop  above all honora felt it due to humfrey to have prizeroots and fruits from the holt and would have thought herself fallen indeed had the hardest rain kept her from the rendezvous with one wagon carrying the cottagers articles and another a troop of schoolchildren  no doubt the forest would be the place to find owen sandbrook but for the rest  from the very extremity of his perplexity roberts mind sought relief in external objects  so joyous were the associations with the forest road on a horticultural day that the familiar spots could not but revive them  those green glades where the graceful beeches retreated making cool green galleries with their slender gleaming stems reminded him of his putting his new pony to speed to come up with the holt carriage that scathed oak had a tradition of lightning connected with it yonder was the spot where he had shown lucilla a herd of deer here the rising ground whence the whole scene could be viewed and from force of habit he felt exhilarated as he gazed down the slope of heather where the fine old oaks and beeches receding had left an open space now covered with the wellknown tents there the large one broadly striped with green containing the show there the white marquees for the eaters the union jacks gay colours floating lazily from a pole in the outlaws knoll the dark full foliage of the forest and purple tints of the heather setting off the bright female groups in their delicate summer gaieties  vehicles of all degreessmart barouche lengthy britzschka light gig dashing ponycarriage rattling shanderadan and gorgeous wagonwere drawn up in treble file minus their steeds the sounds of wellknown tunes from the band were wafted on the wind and such an air of jocund peace and festivity pervaded the whole that for a moment he had a sense of holidaymaking ere he sighed at the shade that he was bringing on that scene of merriment  reaching the barrier he paid his entrancemoney and desiring the carriage to wait walked rapidly down the hill  on one side of the road was the gradual sweep of open heath on the other was a rapid slope shaded by trees and covered with fern growing tall and grand as it approached the moist ground in the hollow below  voices made him turn his head in that direction  aloof from the rest of the throng he beheld two figures halfway down the bank so nearly hidden among the luxuriant winglike fronds of the osmond royal which they were gathering that at first only their hats were discerniblea broad gray one with drooping feather and a light oxford boating straw hat  the merry ring of the clear girlish voice the deeptoned replies told him more than his first glance did and with one inward ejaculation for selfcommand he turned aside to the descent  the rustling among the copsewood caught the ear of phoebe who was the highest up and springing up like a fawn in the covert she criedrobin dear robin how delicious but ere she had made three bounds towards him his face brought her to a pause and in an awestruck voice she asked robert what is it  it does not concern you dearest at least i hope not  i want owen sandbrook  then it is she  o robin can you bear it she whispered clinging to him terrified by the agitated fondness of his embrace  i know nothing of her was his answer interrupted by owen who raising his handsome ruddy face from beneath shouted mirthfully  ha phoebe what interloper have you caught  what fulmort not quite grilled in the wulstonian oven  i was in search of you  wait there phoebe said robert advancing to meet owen with a gravity of countenance that provoked an impatient gesture and the question  come have it out  do you mean that you have been ferreting out some old scrape of mine  i mean said robert looking steadily at him that i have been called in to baptize your sick child  your wife is dying and you must hasten if you would see her alive  that wont do  you know better than that returned owen with illconcealed agitation partaking of anger  she was quite recovered when last i heard but she is a famous hand at getting up a scene and that mother of hers would drive job out of his senses  they have worked on your weak mind  i was an ass to trust to the old womans dissent for hindering them from finding you out and getting up a scene  they did not  it was by accident that i was the person who answered the summons  they knew neither me nor my name so you may acquit them of any preparation  i recognized your name which i was desired to give to the child and then in spite of wasting terror and deadly sickness i knew the mother  she has been pining under low nervous fever still believing you on the continent and the discovery that she had been deceived was such a shock as to bring on a violent attack which she is not likely to have strength to survive  i never told her i was still abroad said owen in a fretful tone of selfdefence  i only had my letters forwarded through my scout for i knew i should have no peace nor safety if the old woman knew where to find me and preach me crazy and i could not be going to see after her for thanks to honor charlecote and her schools every child in whittingtonia knows me by sight  i told her to be patient till i had a curacy and was independent but it seems she could not be  ill run up as soon as i can get some plea for getting away from the holt  death will leave no time for your excuses said robert  by setting off at once you may catch the five oclock express at w  well it is your object to have a grand explosion  when i am cut out you and cilly may make a good thing of it  i wish you joy  ha by jove he muttered as he saw phoebe waiting out of earshot  and then turning from robert who was dumb in the effort to control a passionate reply he called out goodbye phoebe i beg your pardon but you see i am summoned  family claims are imperative  what is the matter said the maiden terrified not only at his tone but at the gestures of her brother of fierce suppressed menace towards him despairing protection towards her  why he has told you  matter enough isnt it  im a married man  i ask your compassion with a bitter laugh  it is you who have told her said robert who after a desperate effort had forced all violence from his voice and language  traitor as you consider me your secret had not crossed my lips  but nothere is no time to waste on disputes  your wife is sinking under neglect and her seeing you once more may depend on your not loitering away these moments  i dont believe it  canting and tragedy queening  taking him in  i know better muttered owen sullenly as he moved up the bank  o robin how can he be so hard whispered phoebe as she met her brothers eyes wistfully fixed on her face  he is altogether selfish and heartless returned robert in the same inaudible voice  my phoebe give me this one comfort  you never listened to him  there was nothing to listen to said phoebe turning her clear surprised eyes on him  you couldnt think him so bad as that  o robin how silly  what were you doing here he asked holding her arm tight  only miss fennimore wanted some osmunda and miss charlecote sent him to show me where it grew because she was talking to lady raymond  the free simplicity of her look made robert breathe freely  charity was coming back to him  at the same moment owen turned his face flushed and full of emotion but the obduracy gone  i may take a long leave  when you see honor charlecote fulmort  i shall not see her  i am going back with you said robert instantly deciding now that he felt that he could both leave phoebe and trust himself with the offender  you think i want to escape  no but i have duties to return to  besides you will find a scene for which you are little prepared and which will cost you the more for your present mood  i may be of use there  your secret is safe with phoebe and me  i promised your wife to keep it and we will not rob you of the benefit of free confession  and what is to explain my absence  no no the secret is one no longer and it has been intolerable enough already said owen recklessly poor honor it will be a grievous business and little phoebe will be a kind messenger  wont you phoebe  i leave my cause in your hands  but faltered phoebe she should hear who  simple child you cant draw inferences  cilla wouldnt have asked dont you remember her darling at wrapworth  people shouldnt throw such splendid women in ones way especially when they are made of such inflammable materials and take fire at a civil word  so ill poor thing  now robert on your honour has not the mother been working on you  i tell you not what the mother told me but what the medical man said low nervous fever set in long ago and she has never recovered her confinement  heat and closeness were already destroying her when my disclosure that you were not abroad as she had been led to believe brought on fainting and almost immediate delirium  this was last evening she was worse this morning  poor girl poor girl muttered owen his face almost convulsed with emotion  there was no helping it  she would have drowned herself if i had not taken her with mequite capable of it after those intolerable women at wrapworth had opened fire  i wish womens tongues were cut out by act of parliament  so phoebe tell poor honor that i know i am unpardonable but i am sincerely sorry for her  i fell into it theres no knowing how and she would pity me and so would you if you knew what i have gone through  goodbye phoebe  most likely i shall never see you again  wont you shake hands and tell me you are sorry for me  i should be if you seemed more sorry for your wife than yourself she said holding out her hand but by no means prepared for his not only pressing it with fervour but carrying it to his lips  then as robert started forward with an impulse of snatching her from him he almost threw it from his grasp and with a long sigh very like bitter regret and a murmur that resembled thats a little angel he mounted the bank  robert only tarried to say may i be able to bear with him  phoebe do your best for poor miss charlecote  i will write  phoebe sat down at the foot of a tree veiled by the waving ferns to take breath and understand what had passed  her first act was to strike one hand across the other as though to obliterate the kiss then to draw off her glove and drop it in the deepest of the fern never to be worn again  hateful  with that poor neglected wife pining to death in those stifling city streets to be making sport in those forest glades  shame shame  but oh worst of all was his patronizing pity for miss charlecote  phoebes own mission to miss charlecote was dreadful enough and she could have sat for hours deliberating on the mode of carrying grief and dismay to her friend who had looked so joyous and exulting with her boy by her side as she drove upon the ground but there was no time to be lost and rousing herself into action with strong effort phoebe left the fern brake walking like one in a dream and exchanging civilities with various persons who wondered to see her alone made her way to the principal marquee where luncheon had taken place and which always served as the rendezvous  here sat mammas keeping up talk enough for civility and peeping out restlessly to cluck their broods together here gentlemen stood in knots talking county business servants congregated in the rear to call the carriages stragglers gradually streamed together and oh here you are was the staple exclamation  it was uttered by mrs fulmort as phoebe appeared and was followed by plaintive inquiries for her sisters and assurances that it would have been better to have stayed in the cool tent and gone home at once phoebe consoled her by ordering the carriage and explaining that her sisters were at hand with some other girls then begged leave to go home with miss charlecote for the night  my dear what shall i do with the others without you  maria has such odd tricks and bertha is so teasing without you  you promised they should not tire me  i will beg them to be good dear mamma i am very sorry but it is only this once  she will be alone  owen sandbrook is obliged to go away  i cant think what she should want of you moaned her mother so used as she is to be alone  did she ask you  no she does not know yet  i am to tell her and that is why i want you to be so kind as to spare me dear mamma  my dear it will not do for you to be carrying young mens secrets at least not owen sandbrooks  your papa would not like it my dear until she had acknowledged him for her heir  you have lost your glove too phoebe and you look so heated you had better come back with me said mrs fulmort who would not have withstood for a moment a decree from either of her other daughters  indeed said phoebe you need not fear mamma  it is nothing of that sort quite the contrary  quite the contrary  you dont tell me that he has formed another attachment just when i made sure of your settling at last at the holt and you such a favourite with honor charlecote  not one of those plain miss raymonds i hope  i must not tell till she has heard said phoebe so please say nothing about it  it will vex poor miss charlecote sadly so pray let no one suspect and i will come back and tell you tomorrow by the time you are dressed  mrs fulmort was so much uplifted by the promise of the grand secret that she made no more opposition and maria and bertha hurried in with phoebes glove which with the peculiar fidelity of property wilfully lost had fallen into their hands while searching for robert  both declared they had seen him on the hill and clamorously demanded him of phoebe  her answer he is not in the forest you will not find him was too conscious fully to have satisfied the shrewd bertha but for the pleasure of discoursing to the other girls upon double gangers of whom she had stealthily read in some prohibited german literature of her governesss  leaving her to astonish them phoebe took up a position near miss charlecote who was talking to the good matronlylooking lady raymond and on the first opportunity offered herself as a companion  on the way home honor much pleased was proposing to find owen and walk through a beautiful and less frequented forest path when she saw her own carriage coming up with that from beauchamp and lamented the mistake which must take her away as soon as owen could be found  i ventured to order it said phoebe i thought you might prefer it owen is gone  he left a message with me for you  experience of former blows taught honora to ask no questions and to go through the offices of politeness as usual  but lady raymond long a friend of hers though barely acquainted with mrs fulmort and never having seen phoebe before living as she did on the opposite side of the county took a moment for turning round to the young girl and saying with a friendly motherly warmth far from mere curiosity i am sure you have bad news for miss charlecote  i see you cannot speak of it now but you must promise me to send to moorcroft if sir john or i can be of any use  phoebe could only give a thankful grasp of the kind hand  the raymonds were rather despised at home for plain habits strong religious opinions and scanty fortunes but she knew they were miss charlecotes great friends and advisers  not till the gay crowd had been left behind did honor turn to phoebe and say gently my dear if he is gone off in any foolish way you had better tell me at once that something may be done  he is gone with robert said phoebe  bertha did really see robert he had made a sad discovery and came for owen  do you remember that pretty schoolmistress at wrapworth  never had phoebe seen such a blanched face and dilated eyes as were turned on her with the gasping words impossible they would not have told you  they were obliged said phoebe they had to hurry for the train for she is very ill indeed  honor leant back with folded hands and closed eyes so that phoebe almost felt as if she had killed her  i suppose robert was right to fetch him she said but their telling you  owen told me he fancied robert had done so said phoebe and called out to me something about family claims and a married man  married cried honora starting forward  you are sure  quite sure repeated phoebe he desired me to tell you i was to say he knew he was unpardonable but he had suffered a great deal and he was grieved at the sorrow you would feel  having faithfully discharged her message phoebe could not help being vexed at the relenting poor fellow  honor was no longer confounded as at the first sentences and though still cast down was more relieved than her young friend could understand asking all that had passed between the young men and when all had been told leaning back in silence until when almost at home she laid her hand on phoebes arm and said my child never think yourself safe from idols  she then sought her own room and phoebe feared that her presence was intrusive for she saw her hostess no more till teatime when the wan face and placid smile almost made her weep at first then wonder at the calm unconstrained manner in which her amusement was provided for and feel ready to beg not to be treated like a child or a stranger  when parting for the night however honor tenderly said thanks my dear for giving up the evening to me  i have only been an oppression to you  you did me the greatest good  i did not want discussion i only wanted kindness  i wish i had you always but it is better not  their uncle was right  i spoil every one  pray do not say so  you have been our great blessing  if you knew how we wish to comfort you  you do comfort me  i can watch robert realizing my visions for others and you my twilight moon my autumn flower  but i must not love you too much phoebe  they all suffer for my inordinate affection  but it is too late to talk  good night sweet one  shall you sleep said phoebe wistfully lingering  yes i dont enter into it enough to be haunted  ah you have never learnt what it is to feel heavy with trouble  i believe i shall not dwell on it till i know more  there may be much excuse she may have been artful and at least owen dealt fairly by her in one respect  i can better suppose her unworthy than him cruelly neglectful  in that hope honor slept and was not more depressed than phoebe had seen her under lucillas desertion  she put off herjudgment till she should hear more went about her usual occupations and sent phoebe home till letters should come when they would meet again  both heard from robert by the next post and his letter to miss charlecote related all that he had been able to collect from mrs murrell or from owen himself  the narrative is here given more fully than he was able to make it  edna murrell born with the susceptible organization of a musical temperament had in her earliest childhood been so treated as to foster refined tastes and aspirations such as disgusted her with the respectable vulgarity of her home  the pet of the nursery and schoolroom looked down on the lodge kitchen and parlour and her discontent was a matter of vanity with her parents as a sign of her superiority while plausibility and caution were continually enjoined on her rather by example than by precept and she was often aware of her mothers indulgence of erratic propensities in religion unknown either to her father or his employers  unexceptionable as had been her trainingschool education the high cultivation and soundness of doctrine had so acted on her as to keep her farther aloof from her mother whose far more heartfelt religion appeared to her both distasteful and contemptible and whose advice was thus cast aside as prejudiced and sectarian  such was the preparation for the unprotected life of a schoolmistress in a house by herself  servants and small tradesfolk were no companions to her and were offended by her ladylike demeanour and her refuge was in books that served but to increase the perils of sham romance and in enthusiastic adoration of the young lady whose manners apparently placed her on an equality although her beauty and musical talents were in truth only serving as a toy  her face and voice had already been thrust on owens notice before the adventure with the bargeman had constituted the young gentleman the hero of her grateful imagination and commenced an intercourse for which his sisters inconsiderate patronage gave ample opportunities  his head was full of the theory of fusion of classes and of the innate refinement freshness of intellect and vigour of perception of the unsophisticated at least so he thought and when he lent her books commenting on favourite passages and talked poetry or popular science to her he imagined himself walking in the steps of those who were asserting the claims of intelligence to cultivation and sowing broadcast the seeds of art literature and emancipation  perhaps he knew not how often he was betrayed into tokens of admiration sufficient to inflame such a disposition as he had to deal with and if he were aware of his influence and her adoration it idly flattered and amused him without thought of the consequences  on the night when she had fainted at the sight of his attention to phoebe she was left on his hands in a state when all caution and reserve gave way and her violent agitation fully awakened him to the perception of the expectations he had caused the force of the feelings he had aroused  a mixture of pity vanity and affection towards the beautiful creature before him had led to a response such as did not disappoint her and there matters might have rested for the present but that their interview had been observed  edna terrorstricken believing herself irretrievably disgraced had thrown herself on his mercy in a frantic condition such as made him dread exposure for himself as well as suspense for her tempestuous nature  with all his faults the pure atmosphere in which he had grown up together with the tone of his associates comparatively free from the grosser and more hardhearted forms of vice had concurred with poor ednas real modesty and principle in obtaining the sanction of marriage for her flight with him from the censure of wrapworth and the rebukes of her mother  throughout his feeling had been chiefly stirred up by the actual sight of her beauty and excited by her fervent passion  when absent from her there had been always regrets and hesitations such as would have prevailed save for his compassion and dread of the effects of her desperation both for her and for himself  the unpardonable manner in which he knew himself to have acted made it needful to plunge deeper for the very sake of concealment  yet once married he would have been far safer if he had confessed the fact to his only true friend since it must surely come to light some time or other but he had bred himself up in the habit of schoolboy shuffling hiding everything to the last moment and he could not bear to be cast off by the charterises be pitied and laughed at by his oxford friends nor to risk honor charlecotes favour perhaps her inheritance return to oxford the victim of an attachment to a village schoolmistress better never return thither at all as would be but too probably the case  no the secret must be kept till his first start in life should be secure and he talked to edna of his future curacy while she fed her fancy with visions of lovely parsonages and clergymens ladies in a world of pensive bliss and after the honeymoon in ireland promised to wait patiently provided her mother might know all  owen had not realized the home to which he was obliged to resign his wife nor his motherinlaws powers of tongue  there were real difficulties in the way of his visiting her  it was the one neighbourhood in london where his person might be known and if he avoided daylight he became the object of espial to the disappointed lodgers who would have been delighted to identify the mr brook who had monopolized the object of their admiration  these perils the various disagreeables and especially mrs murrells complaints and demands for money had so much annoyed owen who felt himself the injured party in the connection that he had not only avoided the place but endeavoured to dismiss the whole humiliating affair from his mind trying to hinder himself from being harassed by letters and when forced to attend to the representations of the women sending a few kind words and promises with such money as he could spare always backed however by threats of the consequences of a disclosure which he vaguely intimated would ruin his prospects for life  little did the thoughtless boy comprehend the cruelty of his neglect  in the underground rooms of the city lodginghouse the voluntary prison of the shamefaced halfowned wife the overwrought headache incidental to her former profession made her its prey nervous fever came on as the suspense became more trying and morbid excitement alternated with torpor and depression  medical advice was long deferred and that which was at last sought was not equal to her needs  it remained for the physician summoned by robert in his horror at her delirium to discover that her brain had long been in a state of irritation which had become aggravated to such a degree that death was even to be desired  could she yet survive it could hardly be to the use of her intellect  robert described poor owens impetuous misery and the cares which he lavished on the unconscious sufferer mentioning him with warmth and tenderness that amazed honor from one so stern of judgment  nay robert was more alive to the palliations of owens conduct than she was herself she grieved over the complicated deceit and resented the cruelty to the wife with the keen severity of secluded womanhood unable to realize the temptations of youngmanhood  why could he not have told me she said  i could so easily have forgiven him for generous love if i alone had been offended and there had been no falsehood but after the way he has used us all and chiefly that poor young thing i can never feel that he is the same  and though the heart that knew no guile had been saved from suffering the thought of the intimacy that she had encouraged and the wishes she had entertained for phoebe filled her with such dismay that it required the sight of the innocent serene face and the sound of the happy unembarrassed voice to reassure her that her darlings peace had not been wrecked  for though owen had never overpassed the bounds of the familiar intercourse of childhood there had been an implication of preference in his look and tone nor had there been error in the intuition of poor ednas jealous passion  something there was of involuntary reverence that had never been commanded by the far more beautiful and gifted girl who had taken him captive  so great was the shock that honora moved about mechanically hardly able to think  she knew that in time she should pardon her boy but she could not yearn to do so till she had seen him repent  he had sinned too deeply against others to be taken home at once to her heart even though she grieved over him with deep loving pity and sought to find the original germs of error rather in herself than in him  had she encouraged deceit by credulous trust  alas alas that should but have taught him generosity  it was the old story  fond affection had led her to put herself into a position to which providence did not call her and to which she was therefore unequal  fond affection had blinded her eyes and fostered in its object the very faults most hateful to her  she could only humble herself before her maker for the recurring sin and entreat for her own pardon and for that of the offender with whose sins she charged herself  and to man she humbled herself by her confession to captain charteris and by throwing herself unreservedly on the advice of mr saville and sir john raymond for her future conduct towards the culprit  if he were suffering now for her rejection of the counsel of manhood and experience it was right that they should deal with him now and she would try to bear it  and she also tried as much as possible to soften the blow to lucilla who was still abroad with her cousins    chapter xii       a little grain of conscience made him sour                                                                    tennyson  a penny for your thoughts cilly said horatia sliding in on the slippery boards of a great bare room of a lodginghouse at the celebrated spa of spitzwasserfitzung  my thoughts  i was trying to recollect the third line of      sated at home of wife and children tired     sated abroad all seen and naught admired  bless me how grand  worth twopence  so good how shakspeare as the princess ottilie would say  twopence for its sincerity  it is not for your sake that i am not in old england  nor for that of the three flaxenhaired princesses with religious opinions to be accommodated to those of the crowned heads they may marry  im sick of the three and their raptures  i wish i was as ignorant as you and that shakspeare had never been read at the holt  this is a sudden change  i thought spitzwasserfitzung and its princesses had brought halcyon days  halcyon days will never come till we get home  which lolly will never do  she passes for somebody here and will never endure castle blanch again  ill make owen come and take me home  no said rashe seriously dont bring owen here  if lolly likes to keep charles where gaming is mans sole resource dont run owen into that scrape  what a despicable set you are sighed lucilla  i wonder why i stay with you  you might almost as well be gone said ratia  you arent half so useful in keeping things going as you were once and you wont be ornamental long if you let your spirits be so uncertain  and pray how is that to be helped  no dont come out with that stupid thing  commonplace because it is reasonable  you would have plenty of excitement in the engagement and then no end of change and settle down into a blooming little matron with all the business of the world on your hands  you have got him into excellent training by keeping him dangling so long and it is the only chance of keeping your looks or your temper by the time i come and stay with you youll be so agreeable you wont know yourself  blessings on that hideous posthorn for stopping your mouth cried lucilla springing up  not that letters ever come to me  letters and mr and mrs charteris all entered together and rashe was busy with her own share when lucilla came forward with a determined face unlike her recent listless look and said i am wanted at home  i shall start by the diligence tonight  how now said charles  the old lady wanting you to make her will  no said lucilla with dignity  my brothers wife is very ill  i must go to her  is she demented asked charles looking at his sister  raving was the answer  she has been so the whole morning  i shall cut off her hair and get ice for her head  i tell simple truth returned cilla  here is a letter from honor charlecote solving the two mysteries of last summer  owens companion who rashe would have it was jack hastings  ha married then  the cool hand  and verily but that cilly takes it so easily i should imagine it was her singing prodigyeh  it was then  absurd idiot exclaimed charles  there he is done for now  yes drawled eloisa one never could notice a low person like that  she is my sister remember cried lucilla with stamping foot and flashing eye  cunning rogue continued horatia  how did he manage to give no suspicion  oh what fun  no wonder she looked green and yellow when he was flirting with the little fulmort  lets hear all cillyhow when and where  at the registrars at r july 14th 1854 returned lucilla with defiant gravity  last july said charles  ha the young donkey was under agehadnt consent of guardian  i dont believe the marriage will hold water  ill write to stevens this minute  well that would be luck exclaimed rashe  much better than he deserves added charles to be such a fool as to run into the noose and marry the girl  lucilla was trembling from head to foot and a light gleamed in her eyes but she spoke so quietly that her cousins did not apprehend her intention in the question  you mean what you say  of course i do said charles  im not sure of the law and some of the bigwigs are very cantankerous about declaring an affair of this sort null but i imagine there is a fair chance of his getting quit for some annual allowance to her and ill do my best even if i had to go to london about it  a man is never ruined till he is married  thank you returned lucilla her lips trembling with bitter irony now i know what you all are made of  we are obliged for your offered exertion but we are not inclined to become traitors  cilly i thought you had more sense  you are no child  i am a womani feel for womanhood  i am a sisteri feel for my brothers honour  charles burst into a laugh  eloisa remonstratedmy dear consider the disgrace to the whole familya village schoolmistress  our ideas differ as to disgrace said lucilla  let me go ratia i must pack for the diligence  the brother and sister threw themselves between her and the door  are you insane cilly  what do you mean should become of you  are you going to join the menage and teach the a b c  i am going to own my sister while yet there is time said lucilla while you are meditating how to make her a deserted outcast death is more merciful  pining under the miseries of an unowned marriage she is fast dying of pressure on the brain  i am going in the hope of hearing her call me sister  i am going to take charge of her child and stand by my brother  dying poor thing  why did you not tell us before said horatia sobered  i did not know it was to save charles so much kind trouble said lucilla  let me go rashe you cannot detain me  i do believe she is delighted said horatia releasing her  in truth she was inspirited by perceiving any door of escape  any vivid sensation was welcome in the irksome vacancy that pursued her in the absence of immediate excitement  devoid of the interest of opposition and of the bracing changes to the holt her intercourse with the charterises had become a weariness and vexation of spirit  idle foreign life deteriorated them and her principle and delicacy suffered frequent offences but like all living wilfully in temptation she seemed under a spell only to be broken by an act of selfhumiliation to which she would not bend  longing for the wholesome atmosphere of hiltonbury she could not brook to purchase her entrance there by permitting herself to be pardoned  there was one whom she fully intended should come and entreat her return and the terms of her capitulation had many a time been arranged with herself but when he came not though her heart ached after him pride still forbade one homeward step lest it should seem to be in quest of him or in compliance with his wishes  here then was a summons to englandnay into his very parishwithout compromising her pride or forcing her to show deference to rejected counsel  nay in contrast with her cousins she felt her sentiments so lofty and generous that she was filled with the gladness of conscious goodness so like the days of her early childhood that a happy dew suffused her eyes and she seemed to hear the voice of old thames  her loathing for the views of her cousins had borne down all resentment at her brothers folly and ednas presumption and relieved that it was not worse and full of pity for the girl she had really loved honors grieved displeasure and charless kind project together made her the ardent partisan of the young wife  because honor intimated that the girl had been artful and had forced herself on owen lucilla was resolved that her favourite had been the most perfect of heroines and that circumstance alone should bear such blame as could not be thrown on honor herself and the wrapworth gossipry  poor circumstances  the journey gave her no concern  the way was direct to ostend and spitzwasserfitzung contained a pension which was a great resort of incipient english governesses so that there were no difficulties such as to give her enterprising spirit the least concern  she refused the escort that rashe would have pressed upon her and made her farewells with quiet resolution  no further remonstrance was offered and though each party knew that what had passed would be a barrier for ever good breeding preferred an indifferent parting  there were light cheery words but under the full consciousness that the friendship begun in perverseness had ended in contempt  horatia turned aside with a goodnatured poor child she will soon wish herself back  lucilla taking her last glance sighed as she thought my father did not like them  but for honor i would never have taken up with them  without misadventure lucilla arrived at london bridge and took a cab for woolstonelane where she must seek more exact intelligence of the locality of those she sought  so long had her eye been weary of novelty while her mind was ill at ease that even holborn in the august sun was refreshingly homelike and begrimed queen anne sitting in the sun before st pauls wore a benignant aspect to glances full of hope and selfapproval  an effort was necessary to recall how melancholy was the occasion of her journey and all mournful anticipation was lost in the spirit of partisanship and patronageyes and in that pervading consciousness that each moment brought her nearer to whittingtonia  great was the amaze of good mrs jones the housekeeper at the arrival of miss lucy and equal disappointment that she would neither eat nor rest nor accept a convoy to no 8 little whittingtonstreet  she tripped off thither the instant she had ascertained the number of the house and heard that her brother was there and his wife still living  she had formed to herself no image of the scenes before her and was entirely unprepared by reflection when she rang at the door  as soon as she mentioned her name the little maid conducted her downstairs and she found herself in the sittingroom face to face with robert fulmort  without showing surprise or emotion or relaxing his grave listening air he merely bowed his head and held out his hand  there was an atmosphere of awe about the room as though she had interrupted a religious office and she stood still in the solemn hush her lips parted her bosom heaving  the opposite door was ajar and from within came a kind of sobbing moan and a low feeble faltering voice faintly singing      for men must work and women must weep     and the sooner tis over the sooner to sleep  the choking thrill of unwonted tears rushed over lucilla and she shuddered  robert looked disappointed as he caught the notes then placing a seat for lucilla said very low we hoped she would waken sensible  her mother begged me to be at hand  has she never been sensible  they hoped so at one time last night  she seemed to know him  is he there  robert only sighed assent for again the voice was heardi must get up miss sandbrook wants me  she says i shant be afraid when the time comes but ohso many many facesall their eyes looking and where is hewhy doesnt he look  oh miss sandbrook dont bring that young lady herei knowi know it is why he never comeskeep her away  the voice turned to shrieking sobs  there were sounds of feet and hurried movements and owen came out gasping for breath and his face flushed  i cant bear it he said with his hands over his face  can i be of use asked robert  no the nurse can hold her and he leant his arms on the mantelpiece his frame shaken with longdrawn sobs  he had never even seen his sister and she was too much appalled to speak or move  when the sounds ceased owen looked up to listen and robert said still no consciousness  no better not  what would she gain by it  it must be better not if so ordained said robert  pshaw what are last feelings and words  as if a blighted life and such suffering were not sure of compensation  theres more justice in heaven than in your system  he was gone and robert with a deep sigh said i am not judging  i trust there were tokens of repentance and forgiveness but it is painful as her mother feels it to hear how her mind runs on light songs and poetry  mechanically  true and delirium is no criterion of the state of mind  but it is very mournful  in her occupation one would have thought habit alone would have made her ear catch other chimes  lucilla remembered with a pang that she had sympathized with ednas weariness of the monotony of hymn and catechism  thinking poetry rather dull and tiresome she had little guessed at the effect of sentimental songs and volumes of l e l and the like on an inflammable mind when once taught to slake her thirsty imagination beyond the spck  she did not marvel at the set look of pain with which robert heard passionate verses of shelley and byron fall from those dying lips  they must have been conned by heart and have been the favourite study or they could hardly thus recur  i must go said robert after a time i am doing no good here  you will take care of your brother if it is over before i return  where are you  my things are in woolstonelane  i meant to get him there  i will come back by seven oclock but i must go to the school  may i go in there  you had better not  it is a fearful sight and you cannot be of use  i wish you could be out of hearing but the house is full  one moment robertthe child  sent to a nurse when every sound was agony  he stepped into the sick room and brought out mrs murrell who began with a curtsey but eagerly pressed lucillas offered hand  subdued by sorrow and watching she was touchingly meek and resigned enduring with the patience of real faith and only speaking to entreat that mr fulmort would pray with her for her poor child  never had lucilla so prayed and ere she had suppressed her tears ere rising from her knees robert was gone  she spent the ensuing hours of that summer evening seated in the armchair barely moving listening to the ticking of the clock and the thunder of the streets and at times hearkening to the sounds in the inner chamber the wanderings feebler and more rare but the fearful convulsions more frequent seeming as it were to be tearing away the last remnant of life  these moments of horrorstruck suspense were the only breaks save when owen rushed out unable to bear the sight and stood with hidden face in such absorption of distress as to be unconscious of her awestruck attempts to obtain his attention or when mrs murrell came to fetch something order her maid or relieve herself by a few sad words to her guest  gratified by the eager sisterly acknowledgment of poor edna she touched lucilla deeply by speaking of her daughters fondness for miss sandbrook grief at having given cause for being thought ungrateful and assurances that the secret never could have been kept had they met the day after the soiree  many had been the poor things speculations how miss sandbrook would receive her marriage but always with confidence in her final mercy and justice and when lucilla heard of the prolonged wretchedness the hope deferred the evil reports and suspicions of neighbours and lodgers the failing health and cruel disappointment and looked round at the dismal little stifling dungeon where this fair and gifted being had pined and sunk beneath slander and desertion hot tears of indignation filled her eyes and with fingers clenching together she said oh that i had known it sooner  edna was right  i will be the person to see justice done to her  and when left alone she cast about for the most open mode of proclaiming edna murrell her brothers honoured wife and her own beloved sister the more it mortified the charterises the better  by the time robert came back the sole change was in the failing strength and he insisted on conducting lucilla to woolstonelane mrs murrell enforcing his advice so decidedly that there was no choice  she would not be denied one look at the sufferer but what she saw was so miserably unlike the beautiful creature whom she remembered that she recoiled feeling the kindness that had forbidden her the spectacle and passively left the house still under the chill influence of the shock she had tasted nothing since breakfasting on board the steamer and on coming into the street the comparative coolness seemed to strike her through she shivered felt her knees give way and grasped roberts arm for support  he treated her with watchful considerate solicitude though with few words and did not leave her till he had seen her safe under the charge of the housekeeper when in return for his assurance that he would watch over her brother she promised to take food and go at once to rest  too weary at first to undress and still thinking that owen might be brought to her she lay back on the couch in her own familiar little cedar room feeling as if she recalled the day through the hazy medium of a dream and as if she had not been in contact with edna nor owen nor robert but only with pale phantoms called by those names  robert especially  engrossed and awestricken as she had been still it came on her that something was gone that to her had constituted robert fulmort  neither the change of dress nor even the older and more settled expression of countenance made the difference but the want of that nameless hesitating deference which in each word or action formerly seemed to implore her favour or even when he dared to censure did so under appeal to her mercy  had he avoided her she could have understood it but his calm authoritative selfpossession was beyond her though as yet she was not alarmed for her mind was too much confused to perceive that her influence was lost but it was uncomfortable and part of this strange unnatural world as though the wax which she had been used to mould had suddenly lost its yielding nature and become marble  tired out she at last went to bed and slept soundly but awoke early and on coming down found from the housekeeper that her brother had been brought home at two oclock by mr fulmort and had gone to his room at once  all was over  lucilla longing to hear more set out to see mrs murrell before he should come downstairs  while the good woman was forced to bestir herself for her lodgers breakfasts lucilla could steal a solitary moment to gaze on the pallid face to which death had restored much of its beauty  she pressed her lips on the regal brow and spoke half aloud edna edna sandbrook sister edna you should have trusted me  you knew i would see justice done to you and i will  you shall lie by my mothers side in our own churchyard and wrapworth shall know that she whom they envied and maligned was owen sandbrooks wife and my cherished sister  poor mrs murrell with her swimming eyes and stock phrases brought far more christian sentiments to the bed of death  poor dear love her father and i little thought it would end in this when we used to be so proud of her  we should have minded that pride is not made for sinners favour is deceitful and beauty is vain and the lord saw it well that we should be cast down and slanderous lips opened against us that so we might feel our trust is in him alone  oh it is good that even thus she was brought to turn to him  but i thankoh i thank him that her father never lived to see this day  she wept such tears of true thankfulness and resignation that lucilla almost abashed by the sight of piety beyond her comprehension stood silent till with a change to the practical mrs murrell recovered herself saying if you please maam when had i best come and speak to the young gentleman  i ought to know what would be pleasing to him about the funeral  we will arrange said lucilla she shall be buried with my mother and sister in wrapworth churchyard  though gratified mrs murrell demurred lest it might be taken ill by the family and by that godly minister whose kindness and sympathy at the time of ednas evasion had made a deep impression but lucilla boldly undertook that the family must like it and she would take care of the minister  nor was the good woman insensible to the posthumous triumph over calumny although still with a certain hankering after kensal green as a sweet place with pious monuments where she should herself be laid and the company that did things so reasonable and so handsome  lucilla hurried back to fulfil the mission of nemesis to the charterises which she called justice to edna and by the nine oclock post despatched three notes  one containing the notice for the timeson the 17th instant at 8 little whittingtonstreet st wulstans edna the beloved wife of owen charteris sandbrook esq another was to order a complete array of mourning from her dressmaker and the third was to the reverend peter prendergast in the most simple manner requesting him to arrange for the burial of her sisterinlaw at 5 pm on the ensuing saturday indicating the labourers who should act as bearers and ending with you will be relieved by hearing that she was no other than our dear edna married on the 14th of july last year  she then beguiled the time with designs for gravestones until she became uneasy at owens nonappearance and longed to go and see after him but she fancied he might have spent nights of watching and thought sleep would be the best means of getting through the interval which appalled her mind unused to contact with grief  still his delay began to wear her spirits and expectation so long wrought up to the meeting and she was at least equally restless for the appearance of robert wanting to hear more from him and above all certain that all her dreary cravings and vacancy would be appeased by one dialogue with him on whatever topic it might be  she wished that she had obeyed that morning bell at st wulstans  it would have disposed of halfanhour and she would have met him  for shame quoth the haughty spirit now that has come into my head i cant go at all  her solitude continued till halfpast ten when she heard the welcome sound of roberts voice and flew to meet him but was again checked by his irresponsive manner as he asked for owen  i have not seen him  i do not know whether to knock lest he should be asleep  i hope he is  he has not been in bed for three nights  i will go and see  he was moving to the door without lingering for a word more  she stopped him by saying pray hear first what i have settled with mrs murrell  she told me said robert  is it owens wish  it ought to be  it must  every public justice must be paid now  is it quite well judged unless it were his strong desire  have you considered the feelings of mr prendergast or your relations  there is nothing i consider more  if charles thinks it more disgraceful to marry a christian for love than a jewess for money he shall see that we are not of the same opinion  i never pretend to judge of your motives  mercy what have i gone and said ejaculated lucilla as the door closed after him  why did i let it out and make him think me a vixen better than a hypocrite though  i always professed to show my worst whats come to me that i cant go on so contentedly  he must hear the charteris sentiments though that he may not think mine a gratuitous affront  her explanation was at her tongues end but robert only reappeared with her brother whom he had found dressing  owen just greeted his sister but asked no questions only dropping heavily into a chair and let her bring him his breakfast  so young was he still wanting six weeks to years of discretion so youthful his appearance in spite of his size and strength that it was almost absurd to regard him as a widower and expect him to act as a man of mature age and feeling  there was much of the boy in his excessive and freelyindulged lassitude and his halfsullen halfshy reserve towards his sister  knowing he had been in conversation with robert she felt it hard that before her he only leant his elbows on the table yawned and talked of his stiffness until his friend rising to leave them he exerted himself to say dont go fulmort  i am afraid i must  i leave you to your sister  she noted that it was not lucy  but i say fulmort there are things to settlefuneral and all that he said in a helpless voice like a sulky schoolboy  your sister has been arranging with mrs murrell  yes owen said lucilla tears glistening in her eyes and her voice thrilling with emotion it is right and just that she should be with our mother and little mary at home so i have written to mr prendergast  very well he languidly answered  settle it as you will only deliver me from the old woman  he was in no state for reproaches but lucilla was obliged to bite her lip to restrain a torrent of angry weeping  at his urgent instance robert engaged to return to dinner and went leaving lucilla with nothing to do but to watch those heavy slumberings on the sofa and proffer attentions that were received with the surliness of one too miserable to know what to do with himself  she yearned over him with a new awakening of tenderness longing yet unable to console or soothe  the light surfaceintercourse of the brother and sister each selfishly refraining from stirring the depths of the others mind rendered them mere strangers in the time of trouble and vainly did lucy gaze wistfully at the swollen eyelids and flushed cheeks watch every peevish gesture and tend each sullen wish with pitying sweetness she could not reach the inner man nor touch the aching wound  towards evening mrs murrells name was brought in provoking a fretful injunction from owen not to let him be molested with her cant  lucilla sighed compliance though vexed at his egotism and went to the study where she found that mrs murrell had brought her grandson her own most precious comforter whom she feared she must resign to be bred up as a gentleman as he was and despise his poor old granny and she would say not a word only if his papa would let her keep him till he had cut his first teeth for he had always been tender and she could not be easy to think that any one else had the charge of him  she devoured him with kisses as she spoke taking every precaution to keep her profuse tears from falling on him and lucilla much moved answered oh for the present no one could wish to part him from you  poor little fellow may i take him for a little while to my brother  it may do him good  cilly had rather have ridden a kicking horse than handled an infant  she did not think this a prepossessing specimen but it was passive  she had always understood from books that this was the sure means of opening the sealed fountains of grief  she remembered what little mary had been to her father and in hopes that parental instinct would make owen know better what to do with her burden than she did she entered the drawingroom where a little murmuring sound caused owen to start up on his elbow exclaiming what are you at  dont bring that here  i thought you might wish to see him  what should i do with him asked owen in the same glum childish tone turning his face inwards as he lay down  take it away  aint i wretched enough already to please you  she gave up the point much grieved and strongly drawn to the little helpless one rejected by his father misused and cast off like his mother  would no one stand up for him  yes it must be her part  she was his champion  she would set him forth in the world by her own toil if need were  sealing the promise with a kiss she returned him to his grandmother and talked of him as so entirely her personal concern that the good woman went home to report to her inquiring friends that the young lady was ready to hact very feeling and very andsome  probably desirous to avoid further reference to his unwelcome son and heir owen had betaken himself to the solace of his pipe and was pacing the garden with steps now sauntering with depression now impetuous with impatience always moving too much like a caged wild beast to invite approach  she was disconsolately watching him from the window when mr fulmort was admitted  a year ago what would he not have given for that unfeigned simple welcome as she looked up with eyes full of tears saying oh robert it is so grievous to see him  very sad was the mournful answer  you may be able to help him  he asks for you but turns from me  he has been obliged to rely on me since we came to town said robert  you must have been very kind she warmly exclaimed  but he drew back from the effusion saying i did no more than was absolutely necessary  he does not lay himself open to true comfort  death never seemed half so miserable before cried lucilla  yet this poor thing had little to live for  was it all poor honors tender softening that took off the edge to our imaginations  it is not always so mournful shortly said robert  no even the mother bears it better and not for want of heart  she is a christian said robert  poor owen  it makes me remorseful  i wonder if i made too light of the line he took yet what difference could i have made  sisters go for so little and as to influence honor overdid it  then as he made no reply tell me do you think my acquiescence did harm  i cannot say  your conscience must decide  it is not a case for me  i must go to him  it was deep mortification  used to have the least hint of dawning seriousness thankfully cherished and fostered it was a rude shock when most in need of epanchement du coeur after her dreary day to be thrown back on that incomprehensible process of selfexamination and by robert too  she absolutely did not feel as if she were the same lucilla  it was the sensation of doubt on her personal identity awakened in the good woman of the ballad when her little dog began to bark and wail at her  she strove to enliven the dinner by talking of hiltonbury and of julianas marriage thus awakening owen into life and talkativeness so much in his light ordinary humour as to startle them both  lucilla would have encouraged it as preferable to his gloom but it was decidedly repressed by robert  she had to repair to solitary restlessness in the drawingroom and was left alone there till so late that robert departed after a single cup of tea cutting short a captious argument of owens about impossibility of proof and truth being only true in a sense  owens temper was however less morose and when his sister was lighting his candle for him at night kindly said what a bore ive been all day lucy  i am glad to be with you dear owen i have no one else  eh  whats become of rashe  never mention her again  what  theyve cut you  i have cut them  she related what had passed  owen set his face into a frown  even so charlie doltishness less pardonable than villainy  you were right to cut the connection lucy it has been our curse  so now you will back to poor honor and try to make it up to her  im not going near honor till she forgives you and receives your child  then you will be very ridiculous said owen impatiently  she has no such rancour against me as you have against her poor dear but it is not in the nature of things that she should pass over this unlucky performance  if it had been such a performance as charles desired i should have said so  pshaw  i hadnt the chance and gloss it as you will lucy theres no disguising it she would have it and i could not help it but she was neglected and it killed her  he brought his hand down on the table with a heavy thump which together with the words made his sister recoil could honor treat me the same after that  and she not my mother either  why had not my father the sense to have married her  then i could go to her and get rid of this intolerable weight and he groaned aloud  a mother could hardly love you more said lucy to her own surprise if you will but go to herewhen she sees you so unhappy  out of the question broke in owen i cant stay here  i would have gone this very night but i cant be off till that poor thing  off  ay to the diggings somewhere anywhere to get away from it all  oh owen do nothing mad  im not going to do anything just now i tell you  dont be in a fright  i shant take french leave of you  youll find me tomorrow morning worse luck  good night  lucilla was doubly glad to have come  her pride approved his proposal though her sisterly love would suffer and she was anxious about the child but dawning confidence was at the least a relief  next morning he was better and talked much too like his ordinary self but relapsed afterwards for want of employment and when a letter was brought to him left by his wife to be read after her death he broke down and fell into a paroxysm of grief and despair which still prevailed when a message came in to ask admission for mr prendergast relieved to be out of sight of depression that her consolations only aggravated and hoping for sympathy and counsel lucy hastened to the study with outstretched hands and was met with the warmth for which she had longed  still there was disappointment  in participation with owens grief she had lost sight of his offences and was not prepared for any commencement  well cilla i came up to talk to you  a terrible business this of master owens  it breaks ones heart to see him so wretched  i hope he is  he ought to be  now mr prendergast  the curate held up both his hands deprecating her coaxing piteous look and used his voice rather loudly to overpower hers and say what he had prepared as a duty  yes yes he is your brother and all that  you may feel for him what you like  but i must say this it was a shameful thing and a betrayal of confidence such as it grieves me to think of in his fathers son  i am sorry for her poor thing whom i should have looked after better and i am very sorry indeed for you cilla but i must tell you that to bury the poor girl next to mrs sandbrook as your brothers wife would be a scandal  dont speak so loud he will hear  his mild face was unwontedly impatient as he said i can see how you gave in to the wish i dont blame you but if you consider the example to the parish  after what i told you in my letter i dont see the evil of the example unless it be your esprit de corps about the registrar and they could not well have requested you to officiate  cilla you were always saucy but this is no time for nonsense  you cant defend them  perhaps you are of your squires opinionthat the bad example was in the marrying her at all  mr prendergast looked so much shocked that lucilla felt a blush rising conscious that the tone of the society she had of late lived with had rendered her tongue less guarded her cheek less shamefaced than erst but she galloped on to hide her confusion  you were their great cause if you had not gone and frightened her they might have philandered on all this time till the whole affair died of its own silliness  yes no one was so much to blame as i  i will trust no living creature again  my carelessness opened the way to temptation and heaven knows lucilla i have been infinitely more displeased with myself than with them  well so am i with myself for putting her in his way  dont let us torment ourselves with playing the game backwards againi hate it lets see to the next  that is what i came for  now cilla though i would gladly do what i could for poor owen just think what work it will make with the girls at wrapworth who are nonsensical enough already to have this poor runaway brought back to be buried as the wife of a fine young gentleman  poor ednas history is no encouragement to look out for fine young gentlemen  they will know the fact and sink the circumstances  so you are so innocent as to think they dont know  depend upon it every house in wrapworth rings with it and wont it be more improving to have the poor things grave to point the moral  cilla you are a little witch  you always have your way but i dont like it  it is not the right one  not right for owen to make full compensation  mind it is not edna murrell the eloped schoolmistress but mrs sandbrook whom her husband wishes to bury among his family  poor lad is he much cut up  so much that i should hardly dare tell him if you had refused  he could not bear another indignity heaped on her and a wound from you would cut deeper than from any one else  you should remember in judging him that he had no parent to disobey and there was generosity in taking on him the risk rather than leave her to a broken heart and your tender mercy  i fear his tender mercy has turned out worse than mine but i am sorry for all he has brought on himself poor lad  shall i try whether he can see you  no no i had rather not  you say young fulmort attends to him and i could not speak to him with patience  five oclock saturday  yes but that is not all  that poor childrobert fulmort you and i must be sponsors  cilla cilla how can i answer how it will be brought up  some one must  its father talks of leaving england and it will be my charge  will you not help me you who always have helped me  my fathers grandson you cannot refuse him mr pendy said she using their old childish name for him  he yielded to the united influence of his rectors daughter and the memory of his rector  though no weak man those two appeals always swayed him and lucillas air spirited when she defended soft when she grieved was quite irresistible so she gained her point and felt restored to herself by the exercise of power and by making her wonted impression  since one little dog had wagged his little tail she no longer doubted if i be i yet this only rendered her more nervously desirous of obtaining the like recognition from the other and she positively wearied after one of roberts old wistful looks  a teteatete with him was necessary on many accounts and she lay in wait to obtain a few moments alone with him in the study  he complied neither eagerly nor reluctantly bowed his head without remark when she told him about the funeral and took the sponsorship as a matter of course  very well i suppose there is no one else to be found  is it your brothers thought  i told him  so i feared  oh robert we must take double care for the poor little thing  i will do my best he answered  do you know what owen intends said lucilla in low alarmed accents  he has told you  it is a wild purpose but i doubt whether to dissuade him except for your sake he added with his first softening towards her like balm to the sore spot in her heart  never mind me i can take care of myself she said while the muscles of her throat ached and quivered with emotion  i would not detain him to be pitied and forgiven  do not send him away in pride said robert sadly  am i not humbled enough she said and her drooping head and eye seemed to thrill him with their wonted power  one step he made towards her but checked himself and said in a matteroffact tone currie the architect has a brother a civil engineer just going out to canada to lay out a railway  it might be an opening for owen to go as his assistantunless you thought it beneath him  these last words were caused by an uncontrollable look of disappointment but it was not the proposal no but the change of manner that struck her  the quiet indifferent voice was like water quenching a struggling spark but in a moment she recovered her powers  beneath him  oh no i told you we were humbled  i always longed for his independence and i am glad that he should not go alone  the work would suit his mathematical and scientific turn  then since you do not object i will see whether he would like it or if it be practicable in case miss charlecote should approve  robert seized this opportunity of concluding the interview  lucy ran upstairs for the fierce quarterdeck walking that served her instead of tears as an ebullition that tired down her feelings by exhaustion  some of her misery was for owen but would the sting have been so acute had robert fulmort been more than the true friend  phoebes warning given in that very room seemed engraven on each panel if you go on as you are doing now he does not think it would be right for a clergyman  could lucilla have looked through the floor she would have seen robert with elbows on the windowsill and hands locked over his knitted brows and could she have interpreted his shortdrawn sighs she would have heard poor child poor child  it is not coquetry  that was injustice she loves me  she loves me still  why do i believe it only too late why is this trial sent me since i am bound to the scheme that precludes my marriage  what use is it to see her as undisciplinedas unfit as ever  i know it  i always knew it  but i feel still a traitor to her she had warning  she trusted the power of my attachment in spite of my judgment  fickle to her or a falterer to my higher pledge  never  i must let her see the positioncrush any hopeotherwise i cannot trust myself nor deal fairly by her  heaven help us both  when they next met robert had propounded his canadian project and owen had caught at it  idleness had never been his fault and he wanted severe engrossing labour to stun pain and expel thought  he was urgent to know what standard of attainments would be needful and finding robert ignorant on this head seized his hat and dashed out in the gaslight to the nearest booksellers for a treatise on surveying  robert was taken by surprise or he might have gone too  he looked as if he meditated a move but paused as lucy said poor fellow how glad he is of an object  may it not be to his better feelings like sunshine to morning dew said robert sighing  i hear a very high character of mr currie and a rightminded practical scientific man may tell more on a disposition like his  than parsons and women said lucilla with a gleam of her old archness  exactly so  he must see religion in the world not out of it  after all i have not heard who is this mr currie and how you know him  i know him through his brother who is building the church in cecily row  a church in cecily row  st cecilias  who is doing it  honor charlecote  no i am  you  tell me all about it said lucilla leaning forward to listen with the eager air of interest which when not half so earnest had been always bewitching  poor robert looked away and tried to think himself explaining his scheme to the archdeacon  the place is in frightful disorder filled with indescribable vice and misery but there is a shadow of hope that a few may be worked on if something like a mission can be organized circumstances seemed to mark me out as the person to be at the cost of setting it on foot my fathers connection with the parish giving it a claim on me  so i purchased the first site that was in the market and the buildings are in progress chapel schools orphanage and rooms for myself and two other clergy  when all the rest is provided for there will remain about two hundred and fifty pounds a yearjust enough for three of us living together  he durst not glance towards her or he would have seen her cheek white as wax and her eye seeking his in dismayed inquiry  there was a pause then she forced herself to falteryes  i suppose it is very rightvery grand  it is settled  the archdeacon has seen the plans the bishop has consented  long and deep was the silence that fell on both  lucilla knew her fate as well as if his long coat had been a cowl  she would not could not feel it yet  she must keep up appearances so she fixed her eyes steadily on the drawing her idle hands were perpetrating on the back of a letter and appeared absorbed in shading a turks head  if roberts motives had not been unmixed if his zeal had been alloyed by temper or his selfdevotion by undutifulness if his haste had been selfwilled or his judgment onesided this was an hour of retribution let her have all her faults she was still the lucy who had flown home to him for comfort  he felt as if he had dashed away the little bird that had sought refuge in his bosom  fain would he have implored her pardon but for the stern resolution to abstain from any needless word or look such as might serve to rivet the affection that ought to be withdrawn and he was too manly and unselfish to indulge in discussion or regret too late as it was to change the course to which he had offered himself and his means  to retract would have been a breach of promisea hasty one perhaps but still an absolute vow publicly made and in all his wretchedness he had at least the comfort of knowing the present duty  afraid of last words he would not even take leave until owen came in upon their silence full of animation and eagerness to see how far his knowledge would serve him with the book that he had brought home  robert then rose and on owens pressing to know when he might see the engineer promised to go in search of him the next day but added that they must not expect to see himself till evening since it would be a busy day  lucilla stood up but speech was impossible  she was in no mood to affect indifference yet she could neither be angry nor magnanimous  she seemed to have passed into a fresh stage of existence where she was not yet at home and in the same dreamy way she went on drawing red indians till by a sudden impulse she looked up and said owen why should not i come out with you  he was intent on a problem and did not hear  owen take me with you i will make a home for you  eh  owen let me come to canada and take care of you and your child  he burst out laughing  well done cilly that beats all  am i likely to be in play  if not you are crazy  as if a man could go surveying in the backwoods with a woman and a brat at his heels  lucys heart seemed to die within her  nothing was left to her hopes and fears were alike extinct and life a waste before her  still and indifferent she laid her down at night and awoke in the morning wishing still to prolong the oblivion of sleep  anger with robert would have been a solace but his dejection forbade this nor could she resent his highflown notions of duty and deem herself their victim since she had slighted fair warning and repelled his attempts to address her  she saw no resource save the holt now more hopelessly dreary and distasteful than ever and she shrank both from writing to honor or ending her tantalizing intercourse with robert  to watch over her brother was her only comfort and one that must soon end  he remained immersed in trigonometry and she was glad he should be too much engrossed for the outbreaks of remorseful sorrow that were so terrible to witness and carefully guarded him from all that could excite them  mrs murrell brought several letters that had been addressed to him at her house and as lucilla conveyed them to him she thought their oxford postmarks looked suspicious especially as he thrust them aside with the back of his hand returning without remark to a b and c d  presently a person asked to speak with mr sandbrook and supposing it was on business connected with the funeral lucilla went to him and was surprised at recognizing the valet of one of the gentlemen who had stayed at castle blanch  he was urgent to see mr sandbrook himself but she resolved to avert all annoyances refused to admit him offering to take a message  was it from his master  why no maam  in fact i have left his lordships service he said hesitating  in point of fact i am the principal  there was a little business to be settled with the young gentleman when he came into his fortune and understanding that such was the case since i heard of him as settled in life i have brought my account  you mistake the person  my brother has come into no fortune and has no expectation of any  indeed maam exclaimed the man  i always understood that mr owen charteris sandbrook was heir to a considerable property  what of that  only this maamthat i hold a bond from that gentleman for the payment of 600 pounds upon the death of miss honora charlecote of the holt hiltonbury whose property i understood was entailed on him  his tone was still respectful but his hand shook with suppressed rage and his eye was full of passion  miss charlecote is not dead steadily answered lucilla  she is in perfect health not fifty years old and her property is entirely at her own disposal  either the mans wrath was beyond control or he thought it his interest to terrify the lady for he broke into angry complaints of being swindled with menaces of exposure but lucilla never deficient in courage preserved ready thought and firm demeanour  you had better take care she said  my brother is under age and not liable  if you should recover what you have lent him it can only be from our sense of honesty  leave me your address and a copy of the bond and i give you my word that you shall receive your due  the valet grown rich in the service of a careless master and richer by moneylending transactions with his masters friends knew miss sandbrook and was aware that a ladys word might be safer than a spendthrifts bond  he tried swaggering in the hope of alarming her into a promise to fulfil his demand uninvestigated but she was on her guard and he reflecting that she must probably apply to others for the means of paying gave her the papers and freed her from his presence  freed her from his presence  yes but only to leave her to the consciousness of the burthen of shame he had brought her  she saw why owen thought himself past pardon  speculation on the death of his benefactress  borrowing on an inheritance that he had been forbidden to expect  doubledyed deceit and baseness  yesterday she had said they were humbled enough  this was not humiliation it was degradation  it was far too intolerable for standing still and feeling it  lucillas impetuous impulses always became her obstinate resolutions and her pride rebounded to its height in the determination that owen should leave england in debt to no man were it at the cost of all she possessed  reentering the drawingroom she had found that owen had thrust the obnoxious letters into the wastebasket each unopened envelope with the contents rent down the middle  she sat down on the floor and took them out saying as she met his eye i shall take these  i know what they are  they are my concern  folly he muttered  dont you know i have the good luck to be a minor  that is no excuse for dishonesty  look at home before you call names said owen growing enraged before you act spy on me i should like to know who paid for your fine salmonfly gown and all the rest of it  i never contracted debts in the trust that my age would enable me to defraud my creditors  who told you that i did  i tell you lucilla ill endure no such conduct from you  no sister has a right to say such things and starting up his furious stamp shook the floor she sat upon so close to her that it was as if the next would demolish her  she did not move except to look up all the length of the tall figure over her into the passionflushed face  i should neither have said nor thought so owen she replied  i should have imputed these debts to mere heedless extravagance like other peopleslike my own if you pleasesave for your own words and for finding you capable of such treachery as borrowing on a postobit  he walked about furiously stammering interrogations on the mode of her discovery and as she explained storming at her for having brought this down on him by the folly of putting that thing into the times  why could she not have stayed away instead of meddling where she was not wanted  i thought myself wanted when my brother was in trouble said lucilla mournfully raising her face which she had bent between her hands at the first swoop of the tempest  heaven knows i had no thought of spying i came to stand by your wife and comfort you  i only learnt all this in trying to shield you from intrusion  oh would that i knew it not would that i could think of you as i did an hour ago  oh owen though i have never shared your fondness for honor charlecote i thought it genuine i did not scorn it as fortunehunting  it was not  it never was cried the poor boy  honor  poor honor lucy i doubt if i could have felt for my mother as i do for her  oh if you could guess how i long for her dear voice in my ears her soft hand on my head and he sank into his chair hiding his face and sobbing aloud  am i to believe that when began lucilla slowly  the last resource of desperation cried owen  what could i do with such a drain upon me the old woman for ever clamouring for money and threatening exposure  my allowance  poor honor meant well but she gave me just enough to promote expensive habits without supplying them  there was nothing to fall back onexcept the ways of the castle blanch folk  betting  he nodded  so when it went against me and people would have it that i had expectations it was not for me to contradict them  it was their business not mine to look out for themselves and pretty handsomely they have done so  it would have been a very different percentage if i had been an eldest son  as it is my bond iswhat is it for lucy  six hundred  how much do you think i have touched of that  not two  of that threefourths went to the harpies i fell in with at paris under charless auspicesand fiveandtwenty therepointing in the direction of whittingtonstreet  will the man be satisfied with the two hundred  dont he wish he may get it  but lucy you are not to make a mess of it  i give you warning i shall go and never be heard of more if honor is applied to  i had rather die than do so  you are not frantic enough to want to do it out of your own money  i say give me those papers  he stooped and stretched out the powerful hand and arm which when only halfgrown had been giantlike in struggles with his tiny sister but she only laid her two hands on the paper with just sufficient resistance to make it a matter of strength on his side  they were man and woman and what availed his muscles against her will  it came to parley  now lucy i have a right to think for you  as your brother i cannot permit you to throw your substance to the dogs  as your sister i cannot allow you to rest dishonoured  not a whit more than any of your chosen friends  every man leaves debts at oxford  the extortion is framed on a scale to be unpaid  let it be  there shall be no stain on the name that once was my fathers if there be on the whole world beside  then with some sulkiness you wont be content without beggaring me of my trumpery twentyfive hundred as soon as i am of age  not at all  your child must live on that  only one person can pay your debts without dishonouring you and that is your elder sister  elder donkey was the ungrateful answer  why what would become of you  youd have to be beholden to honor for the clothes on your back  i shall not go back to honor i shall earn my own livelihood  lucilla are you distracted or is it your object to make me so  only on one condition could i return to the holt said lucilla resolutely  if honor would freely offer to receive your son i would go to take care of him  except for his sake i had rather she would not  i will not go to be crushed with pardon and obligation while you are proscribed  i will be independent and help to support the boy  sure muttered owen to himself lucifer is her patron saint  if i looked forward to anything it was to her going home tame enough to make some amends to poor dear sweet honey but i might as well have hoped it of the panther of the wilderness  i declare ill write to honor this minute  he drew the paper before him  lucilla started to her feet looking more disgusted and discomfited than by any former shock  however she managed to restrain any dissuasion knowing that it was the only right and proper step in his power and that she could never have looked robert in the face again had she prevented the confession but it was a bitter pill above all that it should be made for her sake  she rushed away as usual to fly up and down her room  she might have spared herself that agony  owens resolution failed him he could not bring himself to make the beginning nor to couple the avowal of his offence with such presumption as an entreaty for his childs adoption though he knew his sisters impulsive obstinacy well enough to be convinced that she would adhere pertinaciously to this condition  faltering after the first line he recurred to his former plan of postponing his letter till his plans should be so far matured that he could show that he would no longer be a pensioner on the bounty of his benefactress and that he sought pardon for the sake of no material advantage  he knew that robert had intimated his intention of writing after the funeral and by this he would abide  late in the evening robert brought the engineers answer that he had no objection to take out a pupil and would provide board lodging and travelling expenses but he required a considerable premium and for three years would offer no salary  his standard of acquirements was high but such as rather stimulated than discouraged owen who was delighted to find that an appointment had been made for a personal interview on the ensuing monday    picture he drew the paper before him  lucilla started to her feet  it was evident that if these terms were accepted the debts if paid at all must come out of lucillas fortune  owens own portion would barely clothe him and afford the merest pittance for his child until he should be able to earn something after his three years apprenticeship  she trusted that he was convinced and went upstairs some degrees less forlorn for having a decided plan but a farther discovery awaited her and one that concerned herself  on her bed lay the mourning for which she had sent tasteful and expensive in her usual complete style and near it an envelope  it flashed on her that her order had been dangerously unlimited and she opened the cover in trepidation but what was her dismay at the double treble quadruple foolscap  the present articles were but a fraction to the dreadful aggregatethe sum total numbered hundreds  in a dim hope of error she looked back at the items black lace dress dec 2nd 1852she understood all  it dated from the death of her aunt previously her wardrobe had been replenished as though she had been a daughter of the house and nothing had marked the difference indeed the amply provided horatia had probably intended that things were to go on as usual  lucilla had been allowed to forget the existence of accounts in a family which habitually ignored them  things had gone smoothly the beautiful little miss sandbrook was an advertisement to her milliners and living among wealthy people and reported to be on the verge of marriage with a millionaire there had been no hesitation in allowing her unlimited credit  probably the dressmaker had been alarmed by the long absence of the family and might have learnt from the servants how lucilla had quitted them therefore thinking it expedient to remind her of her liabilities and not only did the present spectacle make her giddy but she knew there was worse beyond  the frenchwoman who supplied all extra adornments among them the balldress whose far bitterer price she was paying could make more appalling demands and there must be other debts elsewhere such that she doubted whether her entire fortune would clear both her brother and herself  what was the use of thinking  it must be done and the sooner she knew the worst the better  she felt very illused certain that her difficulties were caused by horatias inattention and yet glad to be quit of an obligation that would have galled her as soon as she had become sensible of it  it was more than ever clear that she must work for herself instead of returning to the holt as a dependent instead of a guest  was she humbled enough  the funeral day began by her writing notes to claim her bills and to take steps to get her capital into her own hands  owen drowned reflection in geometry till it was time to go by the train to wrapworth  there mr prendergast fancied he had secured secrecy by eluding questions and giving orders at the latest possible moment  the concourse in the church and churchyard was no welcome sight to him since he could not hope that the tall figure of the chief mourner could remain unrecognized worthy man did he think that wrapworth needed that sight to assure them of what each tongue had wagged about for many a day  owen behaved very properly and with much feeling  when not driving it out by other things the fact was palpable to him that he had brought this fair young creature to her grave and in the very scenes where her beauty and enthusiastic affection had captivated him association revived his earlier admiration and swept away his futile apology that she had brought the whole upon herself  a gust of pity love and remorse convulsed his frame and though too proud to give way his restrained anguish touched every heart and almost earned him mr prendergasts forgiveness  before going away lucilla privately begged mr prendergast to come to town on monday to help her in some business  it happened to suit him particularly well as he was to be in london for the greater part of the week to meet some country cousins and the appointment was made without her committing herself by saying for what she wanted him lest reflection should convert him into an obstacle instead of an assistant  the intervening sunday with owen on her hands was formidable to her imagination but it turned out better than she expected  he asked her to walk to westminster abbey with him the time and distance being an object to both and he treated her with such gentle kindness that she began to feel that something more sweet and precious than she had yet known from him might spring up if they were not forced to separate  once on rising from kneeling she saw him stealthily brushing off his tears and his eyes were heavy and swollen but softened as she felt his tone of feelings was a riddle beyond her power between their keenness and their petulance their manly depth and boyish levity their remorse and their recklessness and when he tried to throw them off she could not but follow his lead  i suppose he said late in the day we shall mortify fulmort if we dont go once to his shop  otherwise i like the article in style  i am glad you should like it at all said lucy anxiously  i envy those who like poor dear honor or that little phoebe can find life in the driest form said owen  they would say it is our fault that we cannot find it  honor would think it her duty to say so  phoebe has a wider range and would be more logical  is it our fault or misfortune that our ailments cant be cured by a paring of st bridgets thumbnail or by any nostrum sacred or profane that really cures their votaries  i regard it as a misfortune  those are happiest who believe the most and are eternally in a state in which their faith is working out its effects upon them mentally and physically  happy people  really i think unless you were one of those happy people it is no more consistent in you to go to church than it would be in me to set up rashes globules  no dont tell me so lucy  there lie all my best associations  i venerate what the great the good the beloved receive as their blessing and inspiration  sometimes i can assimilate myself and catch an echo of what was happiness when i was a child at honors knee  the tears had welled into his eyes again and he hurried away  lucilla had faith or rather acquiescence without feeling  feeling without faith was a mystery to her  how much owen believed or disbelieved she knew not probably he could not himself have told  it was more uncertainty than denial rather dislike to technical dogma than positive unbelief and yet with his predilections all on the side of faith she could not womanlike understand why they did not bring his reason with them after all she decided in her offhand fashion that there was quite enough that was distressing and perplexing without concerning herself about them  style as owen called it was more attended to than formerly at st wulstans but was not in perfection  robert whose ear was not his strong point did not shine in intoning and the other curate preached the impression seemed only to have weakened that of the morning for owens remarks on coming out were on the english habit of having overmuch of everything and on the superior sense of foreigners in holidaymaking instead of making a conscience of stultifying themselves with double and triple churchgoing  cilla agreed in part but owned that she was glad to have done with continental sundays that had left her feeling good for nothing all the week just as she had felt when once as a child to spite honor she had come down without saying her prayers  the burthen bound on her conscience by english prejudice said her brother adding that this was the one oppressive edict of popular theology  it was mere selfdefence to say that the dulness was puritanical since the best anglican had a cutanddried pattern for all others  but surely as a fact sunday observance is the great safeguard  all goes to the winds when that is given up  the greater error to have rendered it grievous  lucilla had no reply  she had not learnt the joy of the weeks easterday  it had an habitual awe for her not sacred delight and she could not see that because it was one point where religion taught the world that it had laws of its own besides those of mere experience and morality therefore the world complained and would fain shake off the thraldom  owen relieved her by a voluntary proposal to turn down whittingtonstreet and see the child  perhaps he had an inkling that the chapel in catalley would be in full play and that the small maid would be in charge besides it was gaslight and the lodgers would be out  at any rate softening was growing on him  he looked long and sorrowfully at the babe in its cradle and at last  he will never be like her  no and i do not think him like you  in fact it is an ugly little mortal said owen after another investigation  yet its very odd lucy i should like him to live  very odd indeed she said nearly laughing  well i own before ever i saw him when they said he would die i did think it was best for himself and every one else  so maybe it would but you see i shouldnt like it  he will be a horrible expense and it will be a great bore to know what to do with him so absurd to have a son only twenty years younger than oneself but i think i like him after all  it is something to work for to make up to him for what she suffered  and i say lucy his eye brightened perhaps honor will take to him  what a thing it would be if he turned out all she hoped of me poor thing  i would be banished for life if he could be in my place and make it up to her  he might yet have the holt  you have not proposed sending him to her  no i am not so cool he sadly answered but she is capable of anything in an impulse of forgiveness  he spent the evening over his letter and in spite of his sitting with his back towards his sister she saw more than one sheet spoilt by large tears unperceived till they dropped and felt a jealous pang in recognizing the force of his affection for honor  that love and compassion seemed contemptible to her they were so inconsistent with his deception and disobedience and she was impatient of seeing that so far as he felt his errors at all it was in their aspect towards his benefactress  his ingratitude towards her touched him in a more tender part than his far greater errors towards his wife  the last was so shocking and appalling that he only half realized it and boylike threw it from him the other came home to the fondness that had been with him all his life and which he missed every hour in his grief  lucy positively dreaded his making such submission or betraying such sorrow as might bring honora down on them full of pardon and beneficence  at least she had the satisfaction of hearing ive said nothing about you cilla  thats right  nor the child he continued brushing up his hair from his brow  when i came to go over it i did hate myself to such a degree that i could not say a word like asking a favour  lucy was greatly relieved  he looked like himself when he came down to breakfast exhilarated by the restoration to activity and the opening of a new path though there was a subdued grave look on his young brow not unsuited to his deep mourning  he took up his last evenings production looked at it with some satisfaction and observed sweet old honey  i do hope that letter may be a little comfort to her good old heart  then he told that he had been dreaming of her looking into the cradle and he could not tell whether it were himself or the boy that he had seen sitting on a haycock at hiltonbury  who knows but it may be a good omen said he in his sanguine state you said you would go to her if she took the child  i did not say i would not  well dont make difficulties pray dont lucilla  i want nothing for myself but if i could see you and the child at the holt and hear her dear voice say one word of kindness i could go out happy  imagine if she should come to town  lucilla had no mind to imagine any such thing    chapter xiii       an upper and a lower spring        to thee to all are given     they mingle not apart they gleam        the joys of earth of heaven on high     god grant thee grace to choose the spring        even before the nether spring is drym  one moment phoebe ill walk a little way with you and honor charlecote throwing on bonnet and scarf hurried from the drawingroom where mrs saville was working  in spite of that youthful run and girlish escape from company to a confidante the last fortnight had left deep traces  every incipient furrow had become visible the cheeks had fallen the eyes sunk the features grown prominent and the auburn curls were streaked with silver threads never previously perceptible to a casual eye  while languid mechanical talk was passing phoebe had been mourning over the change but she found her own miss charlecote restored in the freer manner the long sigh the tender grasp of the arm as soon as they were in the open air  phoebe almost in a whisper i have a letter from him  phoebe pressed her arm and looked her sympathy  such a nice letter added honor  poor fellow he has suffered so much  should you like to see it  owen had not figured to himself what eyes would peruse his letter but honor was in too much need of sympathy to withhold the sight from the only person who she could still hope would be touched  you see he asks nothing nothing she wistfully pleaded  only pardon not to come home nor anything  yes surely that is real contrition  surely surely it is yet they are not satisfiedmr saville and sir john  they say it is not full confession but you see he does refer to the rest  he says he has deeply offended in other ways  the rest  you do not know  i thought your brother had told you  no  ah  robert is his friend  mr saville went and found it out  it was very right of him i believe  quite right i should know but  dear miss charlecote it has pained you terribly  it is what young men do but i did not expect it of him  expensive habits debts i could have borne especially with the calls for money his poor wife must have caused but i dont know how to believe that he gave himself out as my heir and obtained credit on that accounta bond to be paid on my death  phoebe was too much shocked to answer  as soon as mr saville heard of these troubles continued honor as indeed i put all into his hands he thought it right i should know all he went to oxford found out all that was against poor owen and then proceeded to london and saw the lawyer in whose hands captain charteris had left those childrens affairs  he was very glad to see mr saville for he thought miss sandbrooks friends ought to know what she was doing so it came out that lucilla had been to him insisting on selling out nearly all her fortune and paying off with part of it this horrible bond  she is paying his debts rather than let you hear of them  and they are very angry with him for permitting it as if he or anybody else had any power to stop lucy  i know as well as possible that it is she who will not let him confess and make it all open with me  and yet after this what right have i to say i know  how little i ever knew that boy  yes it is right it should be taken out of my handsmy blindness has done harm enough already but if i had not bound myself to forbear i could not help it when i see the savilles so much set against him  i do not know that they are more severe in action thanthan perhaps they ought to be but they will not let me pity him  they ought not to dictate to you said phoebe indignantly  dictate  oh no my dear  if you could only hear his compliments to my discretion you would know he was thinking all the time there is no fool like an old fool  no i dont complain  i have been wilful and weak and blind and these are the fruits  it is right that others should judge for him and i deserve that they should come and guard me though when i think of such untruth throughout i dont feel as if there were danger of my ever being more than sorry for him  it is worse than the marriage said phoebe thoughtfully  there might have been generous risk in that  this wasoh very nearly treachery  no wonder lucy tries to hide it  i hope never to say a word to her to show that i am aware of it  she is coming home then  she must since she has broken with the charterises but she has never written  has robert mentioned her  never he writes very little  i long to know how it is with him  now that he has signed his contract and made all his arrangements he cannot retract butbut we shall see said honor with one gleam of playful hope  if she should come home to me ready to submit and be gentle there might be a chance yet  i am sure he is poor owens only real friend  if i could only tell you half my gratitude to him for it  and i will tell you what mr saville has actually consented to my doingi may give owen enough to cover his premium and outfit and i hope that may set him at ease in providing for his child for the present from his own means as he ought to do  poor little thing what will become of it  he and his sister must arrange said honor hastily as if silencing a yearning of her own  i do not need the savilles to tell me i must not take it off their hands  the responsibility may be a blessing to him and it would be wrong to relieve him of a penalty in the natural course of providence  there now you have put it into my head to think what a pleasure it would be to you  i have done enough for my own pleasure phoebe  had you only seen that boy when i had him first from his father and thought him too much of the angel to live  there was a long pause and honor at length exclaimed i see the chief reason the savilles came here  why  to hinder my seeing him before he goes  i am sure it would be sad pain to you cried phoebe deprecatingly  i dont know  he must not come here but since i have had this letter i have longed to go up for one day see him and bring lucy home  mr saville might go with me  you dont favour it phoebe  would robert  robert would like to have owen comforted said phoebe slowly but not if it only made it worse pain for you  dear miss charlecote dont you think if the worst had been the marriage you would have tried everything to comfort him but now that there is this other horrid thing this presuming on your kindness it seems to me as if you could not bear to see him  when i think of their enmity and his sorrow i feel drawn thither but when this deception comes before me i had rather not look in his face again  if he petted me i should think he was taking me in again  he has robert he has his sister and i have promised to let mr saville judge i think mr saville would let me go if robert said i ought  phoebe fondled her and left her relieved by the outpouring  poor thing after mistakes which she supposed egregious in proportion to the consequences and the more so because she knew her own good intentions and could not understand the details of her errors it was an absolute rest to delegate her authority even though her affections revolted against the severity of the judge to whom she had delivered herself and her boy  one comfort was that he had been the adviser chosen for her by humfrey in obeying him she put herself into humfreys hands and remembering the doubtful approval with which her cousin had regarded her connection with the children and his warnings against her besetting sin she felt as if the whole was the continuation of the mistake of her life her conceited disregard of his broad homely wisdom and as if the only atonement in her power was to submit patiently to mr savilles advice  and in truth his measures were not harsh  he did not want to make the young man an outcast only to prevent advantage being taken of indulgence which he overrated  it was rather his wife who was oppressive in her desire to make miss charlecote see things in a true light and teach her what she could never learn to leave off loving and pitying  even this was perhaps better for her than a solitude in which she might have preyed upon herself and debated over every step in conscious darkness  before her letter was received owen had signed his agreement with the engineer and was preparing to sail in a fortnight  he was disappointed and humiliated that honor should have been made aware of what he had meant to conceal but he could still see that he was mercifully dealt with and was touched by and thankful for the warm personal forgiveness which he had sense enough to feel even though it brought no relaxation of the punishment  lucy was positively glad of the nonfulfilment of the condition that would have taken her back to the holt and without seeing the letter had satisfaction in her resentment at honor for turning on owen vindictively after having spoilt him all his life  he silenced her summarily and set out for his preparations  she had already carried out her project of clearing him of his liabilities  mr prendergast had advised her strongly to content herself with the post obit leaving the rest to be gradually liquidated as the means should be obtained but her wilful determination was beyond reasoning and by tyrannical coaxing she bent him to her will and obliged him to do all in which she could not be prominent  her own debts were a sorer subject and she grudged the vain expenses that had left her destitute without even the power of writing grandly to horatia to pay off her share of the foreign expenditure  she had to mr prendergasts great horror told him of her governess plan but had proceeded no further in the matter than studying the advertisements until finding that honor only invited her and not her nephew home to the holt she proceeded to exhale her feelings by composing a sentence for the times  as governess a lady  mr prendergast  reddening and abruptly hasty the curate entered and sitting down without a word applied himself to cutting his throat with an ivory paperknife  lucilla began to speak but at her first word as though a spell were broken he exclaimed cilly are you still thinking of that ridiculous nonsense  going out as a governess  look there and she held up her writing  he groaned gave himself a slice under each ear and viciously bit the end of the paperknife  you are going to recommend me she said with a coaxing look  you know i think it a monstrous thing  but you know of a place and will help me to it cried she clapping her hands  dear good mr pendy always a friend in need  well if you will have it so  it is not so bad as strangers  theres georges wife come to town to see a governess for little sarah and she wont do  shall i do asked lucilla with a droll shake of her sunny hair  yes i know you would vouch for me as tutoress to all the princesses able to teach the physical sciences the guitar and arabic in three lessons but if mrs prendergast be the woman i imagine much she will believe you arent they inordinately clever  little sarah islet me seequite a child  her father did teach her but he has less time in his new parish and they think she ought to have more accomplishment polish and such like  and imagine from the specimen before them that i must be an adept at polishing prendergasts  now cilla do be serious  tell me if all this meant nothing and i shall be very glad  if you were in earnest i could not be so well satisfied to see you anywhere else  you would find mrs prendergast quite a mother to you  only one girl  i wanted a lot of riotous boys but beggars must not be choosers  this is just rightpeople out of the way of those who knew me in my palmy days yet not absolute strangers  that was what induced methey are so much interested about you cilla  and you have made a fine heroic story  i should not wonder if it all broke down when the parties met  when am i to be trotted out for inspection  why i told her if i found you really intended it and had time i would ask you to drive to her with me this morning and then no one need know anything about it he said almost with tears in his eyes  thats right cried lucilla  it will be settled before owen turns up ill get ready this instant  i say she added at the door housemaids always come to be hired minus crinoline and flowers is it the same with governesses  cilla how can you said her friend excessively distressed at the inferior position but his depression only inspired her with a reactionary spirit of mischief  crape is inoffensive but my hair  what shall i do with it  does mrs prendergast hold the prejudice against pretty governesses  she would take venus herself if she talked no nonsense but i dont believe you are in earnest growled the curate angry at last  that is encouragement cried lucilla flying off laughing that she might hide from herself her own nervousness and dismay at this sudden step into the hard verity of selfdependence  she could not stop to consider what to say or do her refuge was always in the impromptu and she was far more bent on forcing mr prendergast to smile and distracting herself from her one aching desire that the irish journey had never been than of forming any plan of action  in walking to the cabstand they met robert and exchanged greetings a sick faintness came over her but she talked it down and her laugh sounded in his ears when they had passed on  yet when the lodgings were reached the sensation recurred her breath came short and she could hardly conceal her trembling  no one was in the room but a lady who would have had far to seek for a governess less beautiful than herself  insignificance was the first idea she inspired motherliness the second the third that she was a perfect lady and a sensible woman  after shaking lucilla kindly by the hand and seating her on the sofa she turned to her cousin saying sarah and her papa are at the national gallery i wish you would look for them or they will never be in time for luncheon  luncheon is not for an hour and a half  but it is twenty minutes walk and they will forget food and everything else unless you keep them in order  ill go presently but he did not move only looking piteous while mrs prendergast began talking to lucilla about the pictures until she recovering detected the state of affairs and exclaimed with her ready grace and abruptness now mr prendergast dont you see how much you are in the way  a plain truth peter said his cousin laughing  lucy stepped forward to him saying affectionately please go you cant help me and i am sure you may trust me with mrs prendergast and she stretched out a hand to the lady with an irresistible childlike gesture of confidence  dont you think you may peter asked mrs prendergast holding the hand you shall find her here at luncheon  i wont do anything to her  the good curate groaned himself off and lucy felt so much restored that she had almost forgotten that it was not an ordinary call  indeed she had never yet heard a womans voice that thus attracted and softened her mrs prendergast needed not to be jealous of venus while she had such tenderness in her manner such winning force in her tone  that was well done she said  talking would have been impossible while he sat looking on  i am afraid he has given far too good an account of me said lucy in a low and trembling voice  his account comes from one who has known you from babyhood  and spoilt me from babyhood  yes sarah knows what cousin peter can do in that line  he had little that was new to tell us and what he had was of a kind  she broke off choked by tears  what she had heard of the girls selfdevotion touched her trebly at the sight of one so small young and softlooking  and if she had ever been dubious of peters pet she was completely fascinated  i must not be taken on his word said cilla smiling  no that would not be right by any of us  then pray be very hard with meas a thorough stranger  but i am so inexperienced i have only had one interview with a governess  and what did she do asked lucilla as both recovered from a laugh  she gave so voluble an account of her acquirements and requirements that i was quite alarmed  im sure i cant do that  i dont know what i can do  a pause broken by lucy who began to feel that she had more of the cool readiness of the great world  how old is your daughter  nearly fifteen  while we had our small parish in sussex we taught her ourselves and her father brought her on in latin and euclid  do you know anything of those miss sandbrook not that it signifies  miss charlecote used to teach me with my brother  i have forgotten but i could soon get them up again  they will hardly be wanted but sarah will respect you for them  now at southminster our time is so taken up that poor sarah gets neglected and it is very trying to an eager diligent girl to prepare lessons and have them continually put off so we thought of indulging her with a governess to bring her on in some of the modern languages and accomplishments that have grown rusty with us  i think i could do that said lucilla  i believe i know what other people do and my languages are fresh from the continent  ought i to give you a specimen of my pronunciation  pray dont laughed mrs prendergast  you know better than i what is right and must prepare to be horrified by the sounds you will hear  i ought to have brought my sketches  i had two years of lessons from s  sarah is burning for teaching in that line  music  dr prendergast likes the grand old pieces and hardly cares for modern ones  i hardly played anything newer than mozart at hiltonbury  miss charlecote taught me very well i believe and i had lessons from the organist from elverslope besides a good deal in the fashionable line since  i have kept that up  one wants it  there was another shy pause and lucilla growing more scrupulous and more confidential volunteeredmine has been an idle life since i came out i am threeandtwenty now and have been diligently forgetting for the last six years  did you know that i had been a fast young lady  but things had come to such a pass that say what she would all passed for ingenuous candour and humility and the answer was  i know that you have led a very trying life but to have passed through such unscathed is no disadvantage  if i have said lucy sadly  mrs prendergast who had learned all the facts of lucillas history through the wrapworth medium knew only the heroic side of her character and admired her the more for her diffidence  so when terms were spoken of the only fear on the one side was that such a treasure must be beyond her means on the other lest what she needed for her nephews sake might deprive her of such a home  however seventy pounds a year proved to be in the thoughts of both and the preliminaries ended with i hope you will find my little sarah a pleasant companion  she is a good girl and intelligent but you must be prepared for a few angles  i like angles  i dont care for commonplace people  i am afraid that you will find many such at southminster  we cannot promise you the society you have been used to  i am tired of society  i have had six years of it and she sighed  you must fix your own time said mrs prendergast and indeed we will try to make you at home  my brother will be gone in a fortnight said lucilla  after that i should like to come straight to you  her tone and look made those two last words not merely chez vous but to you individuallyto you kind one who will comfort me after the cruel parting  mrs prendergast put her arm round her and kissed her  dont said lucilla with the sweetest april face  i cant bear being made foolish  nevertheless mrs prendergast showed such warm interest in all her concerns that she felt only that she had acquired a dear friend by the time the others came in father and daughter complaining the one gaily the other dolefully that cousin peter had so hunted them that they could look at nothing in peace  indeed he was in such a state of restless misery that mrs prendergast in compassion to him sent her daughter to dress called her husband away and left the place clear for him to say in a tone of the deepest commiseration well my poor child  o mr pendy you have found me a true home  be the others what they may there must be rest in hearing her voice  it is settled then  yes  i only hope you have not taken them in  i did my best to let her know the worst of me but it would make no impression  seventy pounds a year  i hope that is not wicked  o cilla what would your father feel  come we wont fight that over again  i thought i had convinced you of the dignity of labour and i do feel as if at last i had lit on some one whom i could allow to do me good  she could not console him he grieved over her changed circumstances with far more regret than she felt and though glad for her sake that she should be with those whom he could trust yet his connection with her employers seemed to him undutiful towards his late rector  all that she saw of them reassured her  the family manners were full of wellbred goodhumour full of fun with high intelligence much real refinement and no pretension  the father was the most polished with the scholarly courtesy of the dignified clergyman the mother was the most simple and caressing the daughter somewhat uncouth readily betraying both her feelings and her cleverness and drollery in the style of the old friend whom lucilla was amused to see treated as a youth and almost a contemporary of her pupil  what chiefly diverted her was the grotesque aspect of dr prendergast and his daughter  both were on a large scale with immense mouths noses turned up to display wide nostrils great gray eyes angularly set yellow hair and eyebrows red complexions and big bones  the doctor had the advantage of having outgrown the bloom of his ugliness his forehead was bald and dignified his locks softened by grizzling and his fine expression and clerical figure would have carried off all the quaintness of his features if they had not been so comically caricatured in his daughter yet she looked so full of life and character that lucilla was attracted and sure of getting on well with her moreover the little elf felt the impression she was creating in this land of brobdignag  sarah was looking at her as a terracotta pitcher might regard a cup of eggshell china and lucy had never been lovelier her mourning enhanced the purity of her white skin and marked her slender faultless shape her flaxen hair hung in careless wreaths of ringlet and braid her countenance if pale had greater sweetness in its dejection now and then brightened by gleams of her courageous spirit sarah gazed with untiring wonder pardoning cousin peter for disturbing the contemplation of domenichinos art since here was a witness that heroines of romance were no mere myths but that beings of ivory and rose sapphire eyes and golden hair might actually walk the earth  the doctor was pleasant and friendly and after luncheon the whole party started together to do st pauls whence mr prendergast undertook to take cilla home but in no haste to return to the lonely house  she joined in the lionizing and made a great impression by her familiarity with london old and new  little store as she had set by honors ecclesiology and antiquarianism she had not failed to imbibe a tincture sufficient to go a long way by the help of ready wit and she enchanted the doctor by her odd bits of information on the localities and by guiding him to outoftheway curiosities  she even carried the party to woolstonelane displayed the queen of sheba the cedar carving the merchants mark and had lifted out stows survey where sarah was delighted with ranelagh when the door opened and owen stood surprised and blank  poor fellow the voices had filled him with hope that he should find honor there  the visitors startled at thus intruding on his trouble and knowing him to be in profound disgrace would have gone but he understanding them to be mr prendergasts friends and glad of variety was eagerly courteous and hospitable detaining them by displaying fresh curiosities and talking with so much knowledge and brilliance that they were too well entertained to be in haste  lucilla accepting mrs prendergast as a friend was rejoiced that she should have such demonstration that her brother was a thorough gentleman and in truth owen did and said everything so well that no one could fail to be pleased and only as an afterthought could come the perception that his ease hardly befitted the circumstances and that he comported himself more like the master of the house than as a protege under a cloud  no sooner had he handed them into their vehicle than he sank into a chair and burst into one of the prolonged vehement fits of laughter that are the reaction of early youth unwontedly depressed  never had he seen such visages  they ought at once to be sketchedwould be worth any money to currie the architect for gurgoyles  for shame said lucilla glad however once more to hear the merry peal for shame to laugh at my master  im not laughing at old pendy his orifice is a mere crevice comparatively  the charm is in seeing it classifiedthe recent sloth accounted for by the ancient megatherium  the megatherium is my master  yes im governess to glumdalclitch  youve done it  yes i have  seventy pounds a year  he made a gesture of angry despair crying worse luck than i thought  better luck than i did  old pendy thrusting in his oar  id have put a stop to your absurdity at once if i had not been sure no one would be deluded enough to engage you and that you would be tired of looking out and glad to go back to your proper place at the holt before i sailed  my proper place is where i can be independent  faugh  if i had known it they should never have seen the roman coins there it is a lesson that nothing is too chimerical to be worth opposing  your opposition would have made no difference  he looked at her silently but with a half smile in lip and eye that showed her that the moment was coming when the mans will might be stronger than the womans  indeed he was so thoroughly displeased and annoyed that she durst not discuss the subject with him lest she should rouse him to take some strong authoritative measures against it  he had always trusted to the improbability of her meeting with a situation before his departure when between entreaty and command he had reckoned on inducing her to go home and this engagement came as a fresh blow making him realize what he had brought on those nearest and dearest to him  even praise of mrs prendergast provoked him as if implying lucillas preference for her above the tried friend of their childhood he was in his lowest spirits hardly speaking to his sister all dinnertime and hurried off afterwards to pour out his vexation to robert fulmort  poor robert what an infliction  to hear of such a step and be unable to interfere to admire yet not approve to dread the consequences and perceive so much alloy as to dull the glitter of the gold as well as to believe his own stern precipitation as much the cause as owens errors yet all the time to be the friend and comforter to the wounded spirit of the brother  it was a severe task and when owen left him he felt spent and wearied as by bodily exertion as he hid his face in prayer for one for whom he could do no more than pray  feelings softened during the fortnight that the brother and sister spent together  childishly as owen had undergone the relations and troubles of more advanced life pettishly as he had striven against feeling and responsibility the storm had taken effect  hard as he had struggled to remain a boy manhood had suddenly grown on him and probably his exclusion from hiltonbury did more to stamp the impression of his guilt than did its actual effects  he was eager for his new life and pleased with his employer promising himself all success and full of enterprise but his banishment from home and from honor clouded everything and as the time drew nearer his efforts to forget and be reckless gradually ceased  far from shunning lucilla as at first he was unwilling to lose sight of her and they went about together wherever his preparations called him so that she could hardly make time for stitching marking and arranging his purchases  one good sign was that though hitherto fastidiously expensive in dress and appointments he now grudged himself all that was not absolutely necessary in the endeavour to leave as large a sum as possible with mrs murrell  even in the tempting article of mathematical instruments he was provident though the polished brass shining steel and pure ivory in their perfection of exactitude were as alluring to him as ever gem or plume had been to his sister  that busy fortnight of chasing after the reasonable and good speeding about till they were footsore discussing purchasing packing and contriving united the brother and sister more than all their previous lives  it was over but too soon  the last evening was come the hall was full of tin cases and leathern portmanteaus marked o c s and of piles of black boxes large enough to contain the little lady whose name they bore southminster lay in the trent valley so the travellers would start together and lucilla would be dropped on the way  in the cedar parlour owens black knapsack lay open on the floor and lucilla was doing the last office in her power for him and that a sad one furnishing the russialeather housewife with the needles silk thread and worsted for his own mendings when he should be beyond the reach of the womankind who cared for him  he sat resting his head on his hand watching her in silence till she was concluding her work  then he said give me a bit of silk turned his back on her and stood up doing something by the light of the lamp she was kneeling over the knapsack and did not see what he was about till she found his hand on her head and heard the scissors close when she perceived that he had cut off one of her pale bright ringlets and saw his pocketbook open and within it a thick jetblack tress and one scanty downy tuft of baby hair  she made no remark but the tears came dropping as she packed and with a sudden impulse to give him the thing above all others precious to her she pulled from her bosom a locket hung from a slender gold chain and held it to him  owen will you have this  whose  my fathers  and my mothers  he gave it to me when he went to nice  owen took it and looked at it thoughtfully  no lucy he said i would not take it from you on any account  you have always been his faithful child  mind you tell me if any one remembers him in canada said lucilla between relief and disappointment restoring her treasure to the place it had never left before  you will find out whether he is recollected at his mission  certainly  but i do not expect it  the place is a great town now  i say lucy if you had one bit of poor honors hair  no you will never forgive me  i had some once made up in a little cross with gold ends but one day when she would not let me go to castle blanch i shied it into the river in a rage  she was touched at his being so spiritless as not even to say that she ought to have been thrown in after it  i wonder she said by way of enlivening him whether you will fall in with the auburnhaired charlecote  whereas canada is a bigger place than england the disaster may be averted i hope  a colonial heiratlaw might be a monstrous bore moreover it would cancel all that i cant but hope for that child  you might hope better things for him than expectations  he shall never have any  but it might come without  why lucy a few years in that country and i shall be able to give him the best of educations and release you from drudgery and when independent we could go back to the holt on terms to suit even your proud stomach and might make the dear old thing happy in her old age  if that holt were but out of your head  if i knew it willed to the county hospital shouldnt i wish as much to be with her as before  i mean to bring up my son as a gentleman with no ones help  but you see lucy it is impossible not to wish for ones child what one has failed in oneselfto wish him to be a better edition  i suppose not  for these first few years the old woman will do well enough for him poor child  robert has promised to look in on him  and mrs murrell is to write to me once a month  i shall make a point of seeing him at least twice a year  thank you and by the time he is of any size i shall have a salary  i may come back and we would keep house together or you might bring him out to me  that will be the hope of my life  ill not be deluded into reckoning on young ladies  you will be disposed of long before  dont owen  no never  never  never  i always wanted to know continued owen what became of calthorp  i left him behind at spitzwasserfitzung with a message that ends it for ever  i am afraid that defection is to be laid to my door like all the rest  if so i am heartily obliged to you for it  the shock was welcome that brought me home  a governess  oh i had rather be a scullerymaid than go on as i was doing there  then you did not care for him  never  but he pestered me rashe pestered me nobody cared for meii and she sobbed a long tearless sob  ha said owen gravely and kindly then there was something in the fulmort affair after all  lucy i am going away let me hear it for once  if i ever come back i will not be so heedless of you as i have been  if he have been using you ill  i used him ill said lucy in an inward voice  nothing more likely muttered owen in soliloquy  but how is it cilla cant you make him forgive  he does but as honor forgives you  you know it was no engagement  i worked him up to desperation last year  through phoebe i was warned that he would not stand my going to ireland  i answered that it was no concern of his i defied him to be able to break with me  they bothered me so that i was forced to go to spite them  he thoughti cant wonder at itthat i was irreclaimable he was staying here was worked on by the sight of this horrible district and between pique and goodness run mad has devoted self and fortune  he gave me to understand that he has made away with every farthing  i dont know if he would wish it undone  she spoke into the knapsack jerking out brief sentences  he didnt tell you he had taken a vow of celibacy  i should not think it worth while  then it is all right exclaimed owen joyously  do you think old fulmort wallowing in gold could see a son of his living with his curates as in the old sussex rhyme      there were three ghostisses     sitting on three postisses     eating of three crustisses  no depend on it the first alarm of robert becoming a ghost there will be a famous good fat living bought for him and then  no i shall have been a governess  they wont consent  pshaw  what are the fulmorts  he would honour you the more  no lucy and he drew her up from the floor and put his arm round her girls who stick to one as you have done to me are worth something and so is robert fulmort  you dont know what he has been to me ever since he came to fetch me  i didnt believe it was in his cloth or his nature to be so forbearing  no worrying with preachments not a bit of what a good boy am i always doing the very thing that was comfortable and considerate and making the best of it at hiltonbury  i didnt know how he could be capable of it but now i see it was for your sake  cheer up lucy you will find it right yet  lucilla had no conviction that he was right but she was willing to believe for the time and was glad to lay her head on his shoulder and feel while she could that she had something entirely her own  too soon it would be over  lengthen the evening as they would morning must come at last  it came the hurried breakfast pale looks and trivial words  robert arrived to watch them off mrs murrell brought the child  owen took him in his arms and called her to the study  robert sat still and said  i will do what i can  i think in case i had to write about the child you had better leave me your address  lucilla wrote it on a card  the tone quashed all hope  we trust to you she said  mr currie has promised to let me hear of owen said robert but no more passed  owen came back hasty and flushed wanting to be gone and have it over  the cabs were called and he was piling them with luggage robert was glad to be actively helpful  all were in the hall owen turned back for one more solitary gaze round the familiar room robert shook lucillas hand  o bid me good speed broke from her or i cannot bear it  god be with you  god bless you he said  no more  he had not approved he had not blamed  he would interfere no more in her fate  she seated herself and drew down her black veil a chill creeping over her  thank you robert for all was owens farewell  if you will say anything to phoebe from me tell her she is all that is left to comfort poor honor  goodbye was the only answer  owen lingered still  youll write  tell me of her honor i mean and the child  yes yes certainly  unable to find another pretext for delay owen again wrung roberts hand and placed himself by his sister keeping his head out as long as he could see robert standing with crossed arms on the doorstep  when the same afternoon mr parsons came home he blamed himself for having yielded to his youngest curate the brunt of the summer work never had he seen a man not unwell look so much jaded and depressed  nearly at the same time lucilla and her boxes were on the platform of the southminster station owens eyes straining after her as the train rushed on and she feeling positive pain and anger at the sympathy of dr prendergasts kind voice as though it would have been a relief to her tumultuous misery to have bitten him like uncle kit long ago  she clenched her hand tight when with oldworld courtesy he made her take his arm and with true consideration conducted her down the hill through the quieter streets to the calm shady precincts of the old cathedral  he had both a stall and a large town living and his abode was the gray freestone prebendal house whose two deep windows under their peaked gables gave it rather a catlike physiognomy  mrs prendergast and sarah were waiting in the hall each with a kiss of welcome and the former took the pale girl at once upstairs to a room full of subdued sunshine looking out on a green lawn sloping down to the river  at that sight and sound lucys face lightened  ah i know i shall feel at home here  i hear the waters voice  but she had brought with her a heavy cold kept in abeyance by a strong will during the days of activity and ready to have its way at once when she was beaten down by fatigue fasting and disappointment  she dressed and came down but could neither eat nor talk and in her pride was glad to attribute all to the cold though protesting with overeagerness that such indisposition was rare with her  she would not have suffered such nursing from honor charlecote as was bestowed upon her  the last month had made tenderness valuable and without knowing all kind mrs prendergast could well believe that there might be more than even was avowed to weigh down the young head and cause the fingers when unobserved to lock together in suppressed agony  while sarah only knew that her heroinelooking governess was laid up with severe influenza her mother more than guessed at the kind of battle wrestled out in solitude and was sure that more than brother more than friend had left her to that lonely suffering which was being for the first time realized  but no confidence was given when lucilla spoke it was only of owen and mrs prendergast returned kindness and forbearance  it was soothing to be dreamily in that summer room the friendly river murmuring the shadows of the trees lazily dancing on the wall the cathedral bells chiming or an occasional deep note of the organ stealing in through the open window  it suited well with the languor of sensation that succeeded to so much vehemence and excitement  it was not thought it was not resignation but a species of repose and calm as if all interest all feeling were over for her and as if it mattered little what might further befall her as long as she could be quiet and get along from one day to another  if it had been repentance a letter would have been written very unlike the cold announcement of her situation the scanty notices of her brother with which she wrung the heart that yearned after her at hiltonbury  but sorry she was for one part at least of her conduct and she believed herself reduced to that meek and correct state that she had always declared should succeed her days of gaiety when recovering from her indisposition she came down subdued in tone and anxious to fulfil what she had undertaken  ah if robert could see me now he would believe in me thought she to herself as she daily went to the cathedral  she took classes at school helped to train the st judes choir played handel for dr prendergast and felt absolutely without heart or inclination to show that selfsatisfied young curate that a governess was not a subject for such distant perplexed courtesy  sad at heart and glad to distract her mind by what was new yet innocent she took up the duties of her vocation zealously and quickly found that all her zeal was needed  her pupil was a girl of considerable abilitiesintellectual thoughtful and well taught and she herself had been always so unwilling a learner so willing a forgetter that she needed all the advantages of her grownup mind and rapidity of perception to keep her sufficiently beforehand with sarah whenever subjects went deep or far  if she pronounced like a native and knew what was idiomatic sarah with her clumsy pronunciation had further insight into grammar and asked perplexing questions if she played admirably and with facility sarah could puzzle her with the science of music if her drawing were ever so effective and graceful sarahs less sightly productions had correct details that put hers to shame and for mere honestys sake and to keep up her dignity she was obliged to work hard and recur to the good grounding that against her will she had received at hiltonbury  had her education been as superficial as that of her cousins she wrote to her brother sarah would have put her to shame long ago indeed nobody but the fennimore could be thoroughly up to that girl  perhaps all her endeavours would not have impressed sarah had not the damsel been thoroughly imposed on by her own enthusiasm for miss sandbrooks grace facility alertness and beauty  the power of doing prettily and rapidly whatever she took up dazzled the large and deliberate young person to whom the right beginning and steady thoroughness were essential and she regarded her governess as a sort of fairytoiling after her in admiring hopelessness and delighted at any small success  fully aware of her own plainness sarah adored miss sandbrooks beauty took all admiration of it as personally as if it been paid to her bullfinch and was never so charmed as when people addressed themselves to the governess as the daughter of the house  lucilla however shrank into the background  she was really treated thoroughly as a relation but she dreaded the remarks and inquiries of strangers and wished to avoid them  the society of the cathedral town was not exciting nor tempting and she made no great sacrifice in preferring her pretty schoolroom to the dinners and evening parties of the close but she did so in a very becoming manner and delighted sarah with stories of the great world and of her travels  there could be no doubt that father mother and daughter all liked and valued her extremely and she loved mrs prendergast as she had never loved woman before with warm filial confiding love  she was falling into the interests of the cathedral and the parish and felt them and her occupations in the morning satisfying and full of rest after the unsatisfactory whirl of her late life  she was becoming happier than she knew and at any rate felt it a delusion to imagine the post of governess an unhappy one  three years at southminster for sarah strenuously insisted that she would come out as late as possible would be all peace rest and improvement and by that time owen would be ready for her to bring his child out to him or else  little did she reck of the grave displeased yet far more sorrowful letter in which honor wrote you have chosen your own path in life may you find it one of improvement and blessing  but i think it right to say that though real distress shall of course always make what is past forgotten yet you must not consider hiltonbury a refuge if you grow hastily weary of your exertions  since you refuse to find a mother in me and choose to depend on yourself alone it must be in earnest not caprice    chapter xiv          these are of beauty rare           in holy calmness growing        of minds whose richness might compare           een with thy deep tints glowing     yet all unconscious of the grace they wear         like flowers upon the spray           all lowliness not sadness        bright are their thoughts and rich not gay           grave in their very gladness     shedding calm summer light over lifes changeful day                                                    to the fuchsias d  phoebe fulmort sat in her own room  the little round clock on the mantelpiece pointed to eleven  the fire was low but glowing  the clear gas shone brightly on the toilette apparatus and on the central table loaded with tokens of occupation but neat and orderly as the lines in the clasped volume where phoebe was dutifully writing her abstract of the days reading and observation in childishly correct miniature roundhand  the curtain was looped up and the moon of a frosty night blanched a square on the carpet beneath the window at which she often looked with a glistening gaze  her father and brother had been expected at dinnertime and though their detention was of frequent occurrence phoebe had deferred undressing till it should be too late for their arrival by the last train since they would like her to preside over their supper and she might possibly hear of robert whose doings her father had of late seemed to regard with less displeasure though she had not been allowed to go with miss charlecote to the consecration of his church and had not seen him since the horticultural show  she went to the window for a final look  white and crisp lay the path chequered by the dark defined shadows of the trees above was the sky pearly with moonlight allowing only a few larger stars to appear and one glorious planet  fascinated by the silent beauty she stood gazing wishing she could distinguish jupiters moons observing on the difference between his steady reflected brilliance and the sunlike glories of arcturus and aldebaran and passing on to the moral miss charlecote loved of the stars being with us all day unseen like the great cloud of witnesses  she hoped miss charlecote saw that moon for sunrise or set rainbow evening gleam new moon or shooting star gave phoebe double pleasure by comparing notes with miss charlecote and though that lady was absent helping mrs saville to tend her husbands mortal sickness it was likely that she might be watching and admiring this same fair moon  well that there are many girls who like phoebe can look forth on the creators glorious handiwork as such in peace and soothing in maiden meditation fancy free instead of linking these heavenly objects to the feverish fancies of troubled hearts  phoebe was just turning from the window when she heard wheels sounding on the frosty drive and presently a carriage appeared the shadow spectrally lengthened on the slope of the whitened bank  all at once it stopped where the roads diverged to the front and back entrances a black figure alighted took out a bag dismissed the vehicle and took the path to the offices  phoebes heart throbbed  it was robert  as he disappeared she noiselessly opened her door guardedly passed the baize door of the west wing descended the stairs and met him in the hall  neither spoke till they were in the library which had been kept prepared for the travellers  robert pressed her to him and kissed her fervently and she found voice to say what is it  papa  yes said robert  she needed not to ask the extent of the calamity  she stood looking in his face while the beginning once made he spoke in low quick accents paralysis  last night  he was insensible when edwards called him this morning  nothing could be done  it was over by three this afternoon  where asked phoebe understanding but not yet feeling  at his rooms at the office  he had spent the evening there alone  it was not known till eight this morning  i was there instantly mervyn and bevil soon after but he knew none of us  mervyn thought i had better come here  oh phoebe my mother  i will see if she have heard anything said phoebe moving quietly off as though one in a dream able to act move and decide though not to think  she found the household in commotion  robert had spoken to the butler and everywhere were knots of whisperers  miss fennimore met phoebe with her eyes full of tears tears as yet far from those of phoebe herself your mother has heard nothing she said i ascertained that from boodle who only left her dressingroom since your brothers arrival you had better let her have her nights rest  robert who had followed phoebe hailed this as a reprieve and thanked miss fennimore adding the few particulars he had told his sister  i hope the girls are asleep he said  sound asleep i trust said miss fennimore  i will take care of them and laying her hand on phoebes shoulder she suggested to her that her brother had probably not eaten all day then left them to return to the library together  there had been more time for robert to look the thought in the face than his sister  he was no longer freshly stunned he really needed food and ate in silence while she mechanically waited on him  at last he looked up saying i am thankful  a few months ago how could i have borne it  i have been sure he understood you better of late said phoebe  sunday week was one of the happiest days i have spent for years imagine my surprise at seeing him and acton in the church  they took luncheon with us looked into the schools went to evening service and saw the whole concern  he was kinder than ever i knew him and acton says he expressed himself as much pleased  i owe a great deal to bevil acton and i know to you  now i know that he had forgiven me  you robin  there was nothing to forgive  i can fancy poor mervyn feeling dreadfully but you always dutiful except for the higher duty  hush phoebe  mine was grudging service  i loved opposition and there was an evil triumph in the annoyance i gave  you are not regretting your work  o no  not the work but the manner  oh that the gift of the selfwilled son be not corban  robert indeed you had his approval  you told me so  he was seeing things differently  it was so new to him that his business could be thought hurtful that he was displeased at first or rather mervyn made him seem more displeased than he was  you only make me the more repent  had i been what i ought at home my principles would have been very differently received  i dont know said phoebe there was little opportunity  we have been so little with them  oh phoebe it is a miserable thing to have always lived at such a distance from them that i should better know how to tell such tidings to any old woman in my district than to my mother  their consultations were broken by miss fennimore coming to insist on phoebes sleeping in preparation for the trying morrow  robert was thankful for her heedfulness and owned himself tired dismissing his sister with a blessing that had in it a tone of protection  how changed was phoebes peaceful chamber in her eyes  nothing had altered but a fresh act in her life had begunthe first sorrow had fallen on her  she would have knelt on for hours leaning dreamily on the new sense of the habitual words our father had not miss fennimore come kindly and tenderly to undress her insisting on her saving herself and promising not to let her oversleep herself treating her with wise and soothing affection and authority that was most comfortable  little danger was there of her sleeping too late  all night long she lay with dry and open eyes while the fire groaning sank together and faded into darkness and the moonbeams retreated slowly from floor to wall and were lost as gray cold dawn began to light the window  phoebe had less to reproach herself with than any one of mr fulmorts children save the poor innocent maria but many a shortcoming many a moment of impatience or discontent many a silent impulse of blame were grieved over and every kindness she had received shot through her heart with mournful gladness and warmth filling her with yearning for another embrace another word or even that she had known that the last goodbye had been the last that she might have prized itoh how intensely  then came anxious imaginings for the future such as would not be stilled by the knowledge that all would settle itself over her head  there were misgivings whether her mother would be properly considered fears of the mutual relations between her brothers a sense that the family bond was loosed and confusion and jarring might ensue but as her mind recoiled from the shoals and the gloom the thought revived of the pilot amid the waves of this troublesome world  she closed her eyes for prayer but not for sleep  repose even more precious and soothing than slumber was grantedthe repose of confidence in the everlasting arms and of confiding to them all the feeble and sorrowful with whom she was linked it was as though in the words of her own clasped book her god were more to her than ever truly a very present help in trouble and as the dawn brightened for a day so unlike all others her heart trembled less and she rose up with eyes heavy and limbs weary but better prepared for the mornings ordeal than even by sleep ending in a wakening to the sudden shock  when miss fennimore vigilantly met her on leaving her room and surveyed her anxiously to judge of her health and powers there was a serious sweet collectedness in air and face that struck the governess with loving awe and surprise  the younger girls had known their father too little to be much affected by the loss  maria stared in roundeyed amaze and bertha though subdued and shocked for a short space revived into asking a torrent of questions culminating in should they do any lessons  whereto miss fennimore replied with a decided affirmative and though phoebes taste disapproved she saw that it was wiser not to interfere  much fatigued robert slept late but joined his sister long before the dreaded moment of hearing their mothers bell  they need not have been fearful of the immediate effect mrs fulmorts perceptions were tardy and the endeavours at preparation were misunderstood till it was needful to be explicit  a long stillness followed broken at last by phoebes question whether she would not see robert  not till i am up my dear she answered in an injured voice do pray see whether boodle is coming with my warm water  her mind was not yet awake to the stroke and was lapsing into its ordinary mechanical routine her two breakfasts and protracted dressing occupied her for nearly two hours after which she did not refuse to see her son but showed far less emotion than he did while he gave the details of the past day  her dull apathetic gaze was a contrast with the young mans gush of tears and the caresses that phoebe lavished on her listless hand  phoebe proposed that robert should read to hershe assented and soon dozed awaking to ask plaintively for boodle and her afternoon cup of tea  so passed the following days her state nearly the same and her interest apparently feebly roused by the mourning but by nothing else  she did not like that phoebe should leave her but was more at ease with her maid than her son and though he daily came to sit with her and read to her he was grieved to be unable to be of greater use while he could seldom have phoebe to himself  sorely missing miss charlecote he took his meals in the west wing where his presence was highly appreciated though he was often pained by berthas levity and marias imbecility  the governess treated him with marked esteem and consideration strikingly dissimilar to the punctilious but almost contemptuous courtesy of her behaviour to the other gentlemen of the family and after her pupils were gone to bed would fasten upon him for a discussion such as her soul delighted in and his detested  secure of his ground he was not sure of his powers of reasoning with an able lady of nearly double his years and more than double his reading and readiness of speech yet he durst not retreat from argument lest he should seem to yield the cause that he was sworn to maintain in season and out of season  it was hard that his own troubles and other peoples should alike bring him in for controversy on all the things that end in ism  he learnt by letter from sir bevil acton that his father had been much struck by what he had seen in cecilyrow and had strongly expressed his concern that robert had been allowed to strip himself for the sake of a duty which if it were such at all belonged more to others  there might have been wrongheaded haste in the action but if such newfangled arrangements had become requisite it was unfair that one member of the family alone should bear the whole burthen  sir bevil strongly supported this view and mr fulmort had declared himself confirmed in his intention of making provision for his son in his will as well as of giving him a fair allowance at present  there must have been warnings of failing health of which none had been made aware for mr fulmort had come to town partly to arrange for the safe guardianship of poor maria and her fortune  an alteration in his will upon the death of one of the trustees had been too long neglected and perhaps some foreboding of the impending malady had urged him at last to undertake what had been thus deferred  each of the daughters was to have 10000 pounds the overplus being divided between them and their eldest brother who would succeed both to the business and on his mothers death to the beauchamp estate while the younger had already received an ample portion as heir to his uncle  mr fulmort however had proposed to place robert on the same footing with his sisters and sir bevil had reason to think he had at once acted on his design  such thorough forgiveness and approval went to roberts heart and he could scarcely speak as he gave phoebe the letter to read  when she could discuss it with him after her mother had fallen asleep for the night she found that his thoughts had taken a fresh turn  if it should be as bevil supposes he said it would make an infinite difference  and after waiting for an answer only given by inquiring looks he continuedas she is now it would not be a violent change i do not think she would object to my present situation  oh robert you will not expose yourself to be treated as before  that would not be  there was no want of attachment merely overconfidence in her own power  not over confidence it seems murmured phoebe not greatly charmed  i understood how it had been when we were thrown together again he pursued  there was no explanation but it was far worse to bear than if there had been  i felt myself a perfect brute  i beg your pardon if i cant be pleased just yet said phoebe  you know i did not see her and i cant think she deserves it after so wantonly grieving you and still choosing to forsake miss charlecote  for that i feel accountable said robert sadly  i cannot forget that her determination coincided with the evening i made her aware of my position  i saw that in her face that has haunted me ever since  i had almost rather it had been resentment  i hope she will make you happy said phoebe dolefully thinking it a pity he should be disturbed when settled in to his work and forced by experience to fear that lucy would torment him  i do not do it for the sake of happiness he returned  i am not blind to her faults but she has a grand generous character that deserves patience and forbearance  besides the past can never be cancelled and it is due to her to offer her whatever may be mine  there may be storms but she has been disciplined poor dear and i am more sure of myself than i was  she should conform and my work should not be impeded  grimly he continued to anticipate hurricanes for his wedded life and to demonstrate that he was swayed by justice and not by passion but it was suspicious that he recurred constantly to the topic and seemed able to dwell on no other  if phoebe could have been displeased with him it would have been for these reiterations at such a time  not having been personally injured she pardoned less than did either robert or miss charlecote she could not foresee peace for her brother and though she might pity him for the compulsion of honour and generosity she found that his auguries were not intended to excite compassionate acquiescence but cheerful contradiction such as both her good sense and her oppressed spirits refused  if he could talk about nothing better than lucy when alone with her she could the less regret the rarity of these opportunities  the gentlemen of the family alone attended the funeral the two elder sisters remaining in town whither their husbands were to return at night  mrs fulmort remained in the same dreary state of heaviness but with some languid heed to the details and interest in hearing from maria and bertha from behind the blinds what carriages were at the door and who got into them  phoebe with strong effort then controlled her voice to read aloud till her mother dozed as usual and she could sit and think until robert knocked to summon her to the reading of the will  you must come he said i know it jars but it is mervyns wish and he is right  on the stairs mervyn met her took her from robert and led her into the drawingroom where she was kindly greeted by the brothersinlaw and seated beside her eldest brother  as a duty she gave her attention and was rewarded by finding that had he been living her hero mr charlecote would have been her guardian  the will dated fifteen years back made humfrey charlecote esquire trustee and executor jointly with james crabbe esquire the elderly lawyer at present reading it aloud  the intended codicil had never been executed had any one looked at the downcast face it would have been with wonder at the glow of shy pleasure thrilling over cheeks and brow  beauchamp of course remained with the heiress mrs fulmort to whom all thereto appertaining was left the distillery and all connected with it descended to the eldest son john mervyn fulmort the younger children received 10000 pounds apiece and the residue was to be equally divided among all except the second son robert mervyn fulmort who having been fully provided for was only to receive some pictures and plate that had belonged to his great uncle  the lawyer ceased  sir bevil leant towards him and made an inquiry which was answered by a sign in the negative  then taking up some memoranda mr crabbe announced that as far as he could yet discover the brother and five sisters would divide about 120000 pounds between them so that each of the ladies had 30000 pounds of her own and bowing to phoebe he requested her to consider him as her guardian  the admiral highly pleased offered her his congratulations and as soon as she could escape she hastened away followed by robert  never mind phoebe he said taking her hand the kindness and pardon were the same the intention as good as the deed as far as he was concerned  perhaps you were right  the other way might have proved a stumblingblock  speak as he would he could not govern the tone of his voice nor the quivering of his entire frame under the downfall of his hopes  phoebe linked her arm in his and took several turns in the gallery with him  oh robin if i were but of age to divide with you  no phoebe that would be unfit for you and for me  i am only where i was before  i knew i had had my portion  i ought not to have entertained hopes so unbefitting  but oh phoebe that she should be cast about the world fragile sensitive as she is  phoebe could have said that a home at the holt was open to lucilla but this might seem an unkind suggestion and the same moment sir bevil was heard impetuously bounding up the stairs  robert where are you he called from the end of the gallery  i never believed you could have been so infamously treated  hush said robert shocked i cannot hear this said  you know it was only want of time  i am not talking of your father  he would have done his best if he had been allowed  it is your brotherhis own confession mind  he boasted just now that his father would have done it on the spot but for his interference and expected thanks from all the rest of us for his care of our interests  what is the use of telling such things acton said robert forcing his voice to calm rebuke and grasping the baluster with an ironlike grip  the use  to mark my detestation of such conduct  i did my best to show him what i thought of it and i believe even bannerman was astounded at his coolness  ill take care the thing is made public  ill move heaven and earth but ill get you preferment that shall show how such treatment is looked upon  i beg you will do nothing of the kind exclaimed robert  i am heartily obliged to you acton  you gained me the certainty of forgiveness without which i should have felt a curse on my work  for the rest i complain of nothing  i have had larger means than the others  i knew i was to look for no more  i prefer my own cure to any other and reflection will show you that our family affairs are not to be made public  at any rate your mother might do something  let me speak to her what not now  then i will come down whenever phoebe will summon me  not now nor ever said robert  even if anything were in her power she could not understand and she must not be harassed  we will talk that over on our way to town said sir bevil  i start at once  i will not see that fellow again nor i should think would you  i stay till saturday week  you had better not  you have been abominably treated but this is no time for collisions  you agree with me phoebe his absence would be the wisest course  phoebe knows that annoyance between mervyn and me is unhappily no novelty  we shall not revert to the subject and i have reasons for staying  you need not fear said phoebe robert always keeps his temper  or rather we have the safeguard of being both sullen not hot said robert  besides mervyn was right  i have had my share and have not even the dignity of being injured  the need of cooling his partisan was the most effective means of blunting the sharp edge of his own vexation  hearing mervyn cross the hall he called to offer to take his share in some business which they had to transact together  wait a moment was the answer and as sir bevil muttered a vituperation of mervyns assurance he said decidedly now once for all i desire that this matter be never again named between any of us  let no one know what has taken place and let us forget all but that my father was in charity with me  it was more than sir bevil was with almost any one and he continued to pace the gallery with phoebe devising impossible schemes of compensation until the moment of his departure for london  robert had not relied too much on his own forbearance  phoebe met her two brothers at dinnerone gloomy the other melancholy but neither altering his usual tone towards the other  unaware that robert knew of his fathers designs nor of their prevention mervyn was totally exempt from compunction thinking indeed that he had saved his father from committing an injustice on the rest of the family for the sake of a fanatical tormentor who had already had and thrown away more than his share  subdued and saddened for the time mervyn was kind to phoebe and fairly civil to robert so that there were no disturbances to interfere with the tranquil intercourse of the brother and sister in their walks in the woods their pacings of the gallery or lowvoiced conferences while their mother dozed  true to his resolve robert permitted no reference to his late hopes but recurred the more vigorously to his parish interests as though he had never thought of any wife save st matthews church  home affairs too were matters of anxious concern  without much sign of sorrow or even of comprehension of her loss it had suddenly rendered the widow an aged invalid  the stimulus to exertion removed there was nothing to rouse her from the languid torpor of her nature mental and physical  invalid habits gave her sufficient occupation and she showed no preference for the company of any one except phoebe or her maid to whose control her passive nature succumbed  at boodles bidding she rose dressed ate drank and went to bed at phoebes she saw her other children heard robert read or signed papers for mervyn  but each fresh exertion cost much previous coaxing and subsequent plaintiveness and when phoebe anxious to rouse her persuaded her to come downstairs her tottering steps proved her feebleness and though her sons showed her every attention she had not been in the drawingroom ten minutes before a nervous trembling and faintness obliged them to carry her back to her room  the family apothecary a kind old man declared that there was nothing seriously amiss and that she would soon recover her tone  but it was plain that much would fall on phoebe and robert was uneasy at leaving her with so little assistance or comfort at hand  he even wrote to beg his eldest sister to come for a few weeks till his mothers health should be improved but sir nicholas did not love the country in the winter and augusta only talked of a visit in the spring  another vexation to robert was the schoolroom  during the last few months bertha had outgrown her childish distaste to study and had exerted her mind with as much eagerness as governess could desire her translations and compositions were wonders of ease and acuteness she had plunged into science had no objection to mathematics and by way of recreation wandered in german metaphysics  miss fennimore rather discouraged this line knowing how little useful brain exercise she herself had derived from kant and his compeers but this check was all that was wanting to give bertha double zest and she stunned robert with demonstrations about her i and her not i and despised him for his contempt of her grand discoveries  he begged for a prohibition of the study but miss fennimore thought this would only lend it additional charms and added that it was a field which the intellect must explore for itself and not take on the authority of others  when this answer was reported through phoebe robert shrugged his shoulders alarmed at the hotbed nurture of intellect and these concessions to mental independence only balanced by such loose and speculative opinions as miss fennimore had lately manifested to him decidedly he said there ought to be a change of governess and system  but phoebe tears springing into her eyes implored him not to press it she thoroughly loved her kind clearheaded conscientious friend who had assisted her so wisely and considerately through this time of trouble and knew how to manage maria  it was no time for a fresh parting and her mother was in no state to be harassed by alterations this robert allowed with a sigh though delay did not suit with his stern uncompromising youthfulness and he went on to say you will bear it in mind phoebe  there and elsewhere great changes are needed  this great disorderly household is a heavy charge  acting for my mother as you will have to do how are you to deal with the servants  none of them come in my way except dear old lieschen and boodle and mrs brisbane and they are all kind and thoughtful  surface work phoebe  taking my mothers place as you do now you will or ought to become aware of the great mischiefs below stairs and i trust you will be able to achieve a great reformation  i hope phoebe looked startled and hesitated  surely robert you do not think i ought to search after such things  would it be dutiful so young as i am  perhaps you are right said robert only phoebe phoebe never let toleration harden you to be indifferent to evil  i hope not said phoebe gravely  my poor child you are in for a world of perplexities  i wish i had not to leave you to them  every labyrinth has a clue said phoebe smiling as miss fennimore says when she gives us problems to work  only you know the terms of the problem must be stated before the solution can be made out so it is of no use to put cases till we know all the terms  right phoebe  sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof  i cannot see the evil yet said phoebe the trouble has brought so much comfort  that happy sunday with you and my own year of being with them both have been such blessings  last year how much worse it would have been for us all when i scarcely knew mamma or mervyn and could not go about alone nor to church  and miss charlecote will soon come home there is so much cause for thankfulness that i cant be afraid  robert said no more but felt that innocent buoyancy a mystery to his lowerpitched spirit  never very gay or merry phoebe had a fund of happiness and a power of finding and turning outwards the bright side which made her a most comfortable companion    chapter xv       happy are they that learn in him        though patient suffering teach     the secret of enduring strength        and praise too deep for speech     peace that no pressure from without        no strife within can reacha l waring  well was it for phoebe that she had been trained to monotony for her life was most uniform after robert had left home  her schoolroom mornings her afternoons with her mother her evenings with mervyn were all so much alike that one week could hardly be distinguished from another  berthas vagaries and mervyns periodical journeys to london were the chief varieties certainly not her mothers plaintiveness her brothers discontent or the sacrifice of her own inclinations which were pretty certain to be traversed but then as she said something else happened that did as well as what she had wished  one day when mervyn had been hunting and had come home tired he desired her to give him some music in the evening  she took the opportunity of going over some fine old airs which the exigencies of drawingroom display had prevented her from practising for some time presently she found him standing by her his face softer than usual where did you get that phoebe  it is haydns  i learnt it just after miss fennimore came  play it again i have not heard it for years  she obeyed and looked at him  he was shading his face with his hand but he hardly spoke again all the rest of the evening  phoebes curiosity was roused and she tried the effect of the air on her mother whose great pleasure was her daughters music since a piano had been moved into her dressingroom  but it awoke no association there and thank you my dear was the only requital  while the next evening she was wondering whether to volunteer it mervyn begged for it and as she finished asked what does old gay say of my mother now  he thinks her decidedly better and so i am sure she is  she has more appetite  she really ate the breast of a partridge today  he says nothing of a change  she could not bear the journey  it strikes me that she wants rousing  shut up in a great lonely house like this she has nothing cheerful to look at  she would be much better off at brighton or some of those places where she could see people from the windows and have plenty of twaddling old dowager society  i did ask mr gay about the sea but he thought the fatigue of the journey and the vexing her by persuading her to take it would do more harm than the change would do good  i did not mean only as a change  i believe she would be much happier living there with this great place off her hands  it is enough to depress any ones spirits to live in a corner like a shrivelled kernel in a nut  go away exclaimed phoebe  mervyn it is her home  it is her own  well i never said otherwise he answered rather crossly but you know very well that it is a farce to talk of her managing the house or the estate either  it was bad enough before but there will be no check on any one now  i thought you looked after things  am i to spend my life as a steward  no if the work is to be in my hands i ought to be in possession at once so as to take my place in the county as i ought and cut the city business  the place is a mere misfortune and encumbrance to her as she is and she would be ten times happier at a wateringplace  mervyn what do you mean  you have all the power and consequence here and are fully master of all but why should not poor mamma live in her own house  cant you conceive that a man may have reasons for wishing to be put in possession of the family place when he can enjoy it and she cant dont look at me with that ridiculous face  i mean to marry  now cant you see that i may want the house to myself  you are engaged  not exactly  i am waiting to see my way through the bother  who is it  tell me about it mervyn  i dont mind telling you but for your life dont say a word to any one i would never forgive you if you set my ladies bannerman and acton at me  phoebe was alarmed  she had little hope that their likings would coincide his manner indicated defiance of opinion and she could not but be averse to a person for whose sake he wished to turn them out  well was all she could say and he proceeded i suppose you never heard of cecily raymond  of moorcroft she asked breathing more freely  sir johns daughter  no his niece  it is a spooney thing to take up with ones tutors daughter but it cant be helped  ive tried to put her out of my head and enter on a more profitable speculation but it wont work  is she very prettyprettier than lucilla sandbrook asked phoebe unable to believe that any other inducement could attach him  not what you would call pretty at all except her eyes  not a bit fit to make a figure in the world and a regular little parsoness  thats the deuce of it  it would be mere misery to her to be taken to london and made to go into society so i want to have it settled for if she could come here and go poking into cottages and schools she would want nothing more  then she is very good  you and she will be devoted to each other  and youll stand up for her i know and then a fig for their two ladyships  you and i can be a match for juliana if she tries to bully my mother  not that it matters  i am my own man now but cecily is crotchety and must not be distressed  then i am sure she would not like to turn mamma out said phoebe stoutly  dont you see that is the reason i want to have it settled beforehand if she were a party to it she would never consent she would be confoundedly scrupulous and we should be all worried to death  come you just sound my mother you can do anything with her and it will be better for you all  you will be bored to death here seeing no one  i do not know whether it be a right proposal to make  right  if the place had been my fathers it would be a matter of course  that makes the whole difference  and even so would not this be very soon  of course you know i am proposing nothing at once  it would not be decent i suppose to marry within the halfyear but poor little thing i cant leave her in suspense any longer  you should not have played that thing  then you know that she cares for you  he laughed consciously at this home question  it must be a long time since you were at mr raymonds  eight years but i have made flying visits there since and met her at her uncles  poor little thing she was horribly gone off last time and very ungracious but we will find a remedy  then you could not gain consent to it  it never came to that  i never committed myself  but why not  if she was so good and you liked her and they all wanted you to marry i cant see why you waited if you knew too that she liked youi dont think it was kind mervyn  ah women always hang by one another  see here phoebe it began when i was as green as yourself a mere urchin and she a little unconscious thing of the same age  well when i got away i saw what a folly it wasa mere throwing myself away  i might have gone in for rank or fortune as i liked and how did i know that i was such a fool that i could not forget her  if charles charteris had not monopolized the jewess i should have been done for long ago  and apart from that i wasnt ready for domestic joys especially to be darby to such a pattern little joan who would think me on the highway to perdition if she saw bells life on the table or heard me bet a pair of gloves  you cant have any affection for her cried phoebe indignantly  didnt i tell you she spoilt the taste of every other transaction of the sort  and what am i going to do now  when she has not a halfpenny and i might marry anybody  if you cared for her properly you would have done it long before  im a dutiful son he answered in an indifferent voice that provoked phoebe to say with spirit i hope she does not care for you after all  past praying for kind sister  sincerely ive been sorry for it i would have disbelieved it but the more she turns away the better i know it so you see after all i shall deserve to be ranked with your hero bevil acton  mervyn you make me so angry that i can hardly answer  you boast of what you think she has suffered for you all this time and make light of it  it wasnt my fault if my poor father would send such an amiable youth into a large family  men with daughters should not take pupils  i did my best to cure both her and myself but i had better have fought it out at once when she was younger and prettier and might have been more conformable and not so countrified as youll grow phoebe if you stay rusting here nursing my mother and reading philosophy with miss fennimore  if you set up to scold me you had better make things easy for me  phoebe thought for a few moments and then said i see plainly what you ought to do but i cannot understand that this makes it proper to ask my mother to give up her own house that she was born to  i suppose you would call it childish to propose your living with us but we could almost form two establishments  my dear child cecily would go and devote herself to my mother  i should never have any good out of her and she would get saddled for life with maria  maria is my charge said phoebe coldly  and what will your husband say to that  he shall never be my husband unless i have the means of making her happy  ay there would be a frenzy of mutual generosity and she would be left to us  no im not going to set up housekeeping with maria for an ingredient  there is the underwood  designed by nature for a dowagerhouse  that would do very well for you and my mother though cheltenham or brighton might be better  yes it might do  you would be half a mile nearer your dear miss charlecote  thank you said phoebe a little sarcastically but repenting she added mervyn i hope i do not seem unkind and selfish but i think we ought to consider mamma as she cannot stand up for herself just now  it is not unlikely that when mamma hears you are engaged and has seen and grown fond of miss raymond she may think herself of giving up this place but it ought to begin from her not from you and as things are now i could not think of saying anything about it  from what you tell me of miss raymond i dont think she would be the less likely to take you without beauchamp than with it indeed i think you must want it less for her sake than your own  upon my word mrs phoebe you are a cool hand exclaimed mervyn laughing but you promise to see what can be done as soon as ive got my hand into the matter  i promise nothing said phoebe i hope it will be settled without me for i do not know what would be the most right or most kind but it may be plainer when the time comes and she who is so good will be sure to know  o mervyn i am very glad of that  phoebe sought the west wing in such a tingle of emotion that she only gave miss fennimore a brief good night instead of lingering to talk over the day  indignation was foremost  after destroying roberts hopes for life here was mervyn accepting wedded happiness as a right and after having knowingly trifled with a loving heart for all these years coolly deigning to pick it up and making terms to secure his own consequence and freedom from all natural duties and to thrust his widowed mother from her own home  it was phoebes first taste of the lesson so bitter to many that her parents home was not her own for life and the expulsion seemed to her so dreadful that she rebuked herself for personal feeling in her resentment and it was with a sort of horror that she bethought herself that her mother might possibly prefer a wateringplace life and that it would then be her part to submit cheerfully  poor miss charlecote would not she miss her little moonbeam  yes but if this cecily were so good she would make up to her  the pang of suffering and dislike quite startled phoebe  she knew it for jealousy and hid her face in prayer  the next day was sunday and mervyn made the unprecedented exertion of going twice to church observing that he was getting into training  he spent the evening in dwelling on cecily raymond who seemed to have been the cheerful guardian elder sister of a large family in narrow circumstances and as great a contrast to mervyn himself as was poor lucilla to robert her homeliness and seriousness being as great hindrances to the elder brother as fashion and levity to the younger it was as if each were attracted by the indefinable essence apart from all qualities that constitutes the self and haydns air learnt long ago by cecily as a surprise to her father on his birthday had evoked such a healthy shoot of love within the last twentyfour hours that mervyn was quite transformed though still rather unsuitably sensible of his own sacrifice and of the favour he was about to confer on cecily in entering on that inevitable period when he must cease to be a gentleman at large  on monday he came down to breakfast ready for a journey as phoebe concluded to london  she asked if he would return by the next hunting day  he answered vaguely then rousing himself said i say phoebe you must write her a cordial sisterly sort of letter you know and you might make bertha do it too for nobody else will  i wrote to juliana on friday  juliana  are you mad  oh miss raymond  but you told me you had said nothing  you have not had time since friday night to get an answer  foolish child no but i shall be there tonight or tomorrow  you are going to sutton  yes and as i told you i trust to you to write such a letter as to make her feel comfortable  well whats the use of having a governess if you dont know how to write a letter  yes mervyn ill write only i must hear from you first  i hate writing  i tell you if you writelet me see on wednesday you may be sure it is all over  no mervyn i will not be so impertinent said phoebe and the colour rushed into her face as she recollected the offence that she had once given by manifesting a brothers security of being beloved  it would be insulting her to assume that she had accepted you and write before i knew especially after the way you have been using her  pshaw she will only want a word of kindness but if you are so fanciful will it do if i put a cover in the post  there and when you get it on wednesday morning you write straight off to cecily and when you have got the notion into my mothers understanding you may write to me and tell me what chance there is of beauchamp  what chance of beauchamp  the words made phoebes honest brow contract as she stood by the chimneypiece while her brother went out into the hall  thats all he cares for she thought  poor mamma  but oh how unkind  i am sending him away without one kind wish and she must be goodso much better than i could have hoped  out she ran and as he paused to kiss her bright cheek she whispered goodbye mervyn good speed  i shall watch for your cover  she received another kiss for those words and they had been an effort for those designs on beauchamp weighed heavily on her and the two tasks that were left to her were not congenial  she did not know how to welcome a strange sister for whose sake the last of the mervyns was grudged her own inheritance and still less did she feel disposed to harass her mother with a new idea which would involve her in bewilderment and discussion  she could only hope that there would be inspiration in mervyns blank cover and suppress her fever for suspense  wednesday cameno cover blank or unblank  had he been taken with a fit of diffidence and been less precipitate than he intended  womanhood hoped so and rather enjoyed the possibility of his being kept a little in suspense  or suppose he had forgotten his cover and then should think the absence of a letter her fault  thursdaystill no tidings should she venture a letter to him  no lovers were inexplicable people and after all what could she say  perhaps he was only waiting for an opportunity and if cecily had been ungracious at the last meeting she might not afford one  day after day wore on and still the postbag was emptied in vain and phoebes patience was kept on tenterhooks till when a full fortnight had passed she learnt through the servants that mr mervyns wardrobe and valet grooms and horses had been sent for to london  so he had been refused and could not bear to tell her so  and here she was disappointed and pitying and as vexed with miss raymond as if it had not been no more than he deserved  but poor mervyn he had expected it so little and had been so really attached that phoebe was heartily grieved for him and longed to know how he bore it  nay with all the danger of removal the flatness of the balked excitement was personally felt and phoebe would have been glad in her monotonous life of something to hope or to fear  her greatest pleasure was in miss charlecotes return  the long watch over her old friend was over  honor had shared his wifes cares comforted and supported her in her sorrow and had not left her till the move from her parsonage was made and she was settled among her own relations  much as honor had longed to be with phoebe the savilles had nearer claims and she could not part with them while there was any need of her  indeed mr saville as once the husband of sarah charlecote the brotherinlaw of humfrey and her own friend and adviser was much esteemed and greatly missed  she felt as if her own generation were passing away when she returned to see the hatchment upon beauchamp and to hear of the widows failing health  knowing how closely phoebe was attending her mother honor drove to beauchamp the first day after her return and had not crossed the hall before the slender black figure was in her arms  friends seem as though they must meet to know one another again and begin afresh after one of the great sorrows of life has fallen on either side and especially when it is a first grief a first taste of that cup of which all must drink  as much of the child as could pass from phoebes sweet simple nature had passed in those hours that had made her the protector and nurse of her mother and though her open eyes were limpid and happy as before and the contour of the rounded cheek and lip as youthful and innocent yet the soft gravity of the countenance was deepened and there was a pensiveness on the brow as though life had begun to unfold more difficulties than pleasures  and honor charlecote  that ruddy golden hair once owens pride was mingled with many a silvery thread and folded smoothly on a forehead paler older but calmer than once it had been  sorrow and desertion had cut deeply and worn down the fair comeliness of heathful middle age but something of compensation there was in the less anxious eye from which had passed a certain restless strained expression and if the face were more habitually sad it was more peaceful  she did not love less those whom she had seen but he whom she had not seen had become her rest and her reliance and in her year of loneliness and darkness a trust a support a confiding joy had sprung up such as she had before believed in but never experienced  her best her all those had been words of devotional aspiration before they were realities at last  and it was that peace that breathed into her fresh energy to work and love on unwearied by disappointment but with renewed willingness to spend and be spent to rejoice with those who rejoiced to weep with them that wept to pray and hope for those who had wrung her heart  her tears were flowing as she tenderly embraced phoebe and the girl clung fast to her not weeping but full of warm sweet emotion  dear miss charlecote now you are come i have help and comfort  dear one i have grieved to be away but i could not leave poor mrs saville  indeed i know you could not and it is better to have you now than even at the time  it is a new fresh pleasure when i can enjoy it better and i feel as if we had a right to you nowsince you know what i told you said phoebe with her pretty shy loverlike colouring  that you are humfreys wardmy legacy from him  good said honora ratifying the inheritance with a caress doubly precious to one so seldom fondled  though i am afraid she added that mr crabbe would not exactly recognize my claim  oh i dont want you for what mr crabbe can do for us but it does make me feel right and at ease in telling you of what might otherwise seem too near home  but he was intended to have taken care of us all and you always seem to me one with him  phoebe stopped short startled at the deep bright girlish blush on her friends cheek and fearing to have said what she ought not but honor recovering in a moment gave a strange bright smile and tightly squeezed her hand  one with him  dear phoebe thank you  it was the most undeserved unrequited honour of my life that he would have had it so yes i see how you look at me in wonder but it was my misfortune not to know on whom or what to set my affections till too late  no dont try to repent of your words  they are a great pleasure to me and i delight to include you in the charges i had from himthe nice children he liked to meet in the woods  ah i wish i could remember those meetings  robert does and i do believe roberts first beginning of love and respect for what was good was connected with his fondness for mr charlecote  i always regard bertha as a godchild inherited from him like charlecote raymond whom i saw ordained last week  i could not help going out of my way when i found i might be present and take his sister susan with me  you went  yes susan had been staying with her uncle at sutton and met me at oxford  i am glad we were able to go  there was nothing that i more wished to have seen  irrepressible curiosity could not but cause phoebe to ask how lately miss raymond had been at sutton and as miss charlecote answered the question she looked inquisitively at her young friend and each felt that the other was initiated  whether the cousin ought to have confided to miss charlecote what she had witnessed at sutton was an open question but at least honor knew what phoebe burnt to learn and was ready to detail it  it was the old story of the parish priest taking pupils and by dire necessity only half fulfilling conflicting duties to the sacrifice of the good of all  overworked between pupils and flock while his wife was fully engrossed by children and household cares the moment had not been perceived when their daughter became a woman and the pupils sport grew to earnest  not till mervyn fulmort had left sutton for the university were they aware that he had treated cecily as the object of his affection and had promised to seek her as soon as he should be his own master  how much was in his power they knew not but his way of life soon proved him careless of deserving her and it was then that she became staid and careworn and her youth had lost its bloom while forced in conscience to condemn the companion of her girlhood yet unable to take back the heart once bestowed though so long neglected  but when mervyn declaring himself only set at liberty by his fathers death appeared at sutton cecily did not waver and her parents upheld her decision that it would be a sin to unite herself to an irreligious man and that the absence of principle which he had shown made it impossible for her to accept him  susan described her as going about the next morning looking as though some one had been killing her but going through her duties as calmly and gently as ever though preyed on by the misery of the parting in anger and the threat that if he were not good enough for her he would give her reason to think so  honor had pity on the sister and spared her those words but phoebe had wellnigh guessed them and though she might esteem cecily raymond could not but say mournfully that it was a last chance flung away  not so my dear  what is right comes right  a regular life without repentance is sometimes a more hopeless state than a wilder course and this rejection may do him more good than acceptance  it is right i know said phoebe  i could advise no one to take poor mervyn but surely it is not wrong to be sorry for him  no indeed dear child  it is only the angels who do not mourn though they rejoice  i sometimes wonder whether those who are forgiven yet have left evil behind them on earth are purified by being shown their own errors reduplicating with time and numbers  dear miss charlecote do not say so  once pardoned surely fully sheltered and with no more punishment  vain speculation indeed answered honor  yet i cannot help thinking of the welcome there must be when those who have been left in doubt and fear or shipwreck come safely into haven above all for those who here may not have been able to fetch home their banished  phoebe pressed her hand and spoke of trying whether mamma would see her  ah thought honora neither of us can give perfect sympathy  and it is well  had my shortsighted wish taken effect that sweet face might be clouded by such grief as poor cecily raymonds  mrs fulmort did see miss charlecote and though speaking little herself was gratified by the visit and the voices talking before her gave her a sense of sociability  this preference enabled phoebe to enjoy a good deal of quiet conversation with her friend and honora made a point of being at beauchamp twice or three times a week as giving the only variety that could there be enjoyed  of mervyn nothing was heard and house and property wanted a head  matters came to poor mrs fulmort for decision which were unheardof mysteries and distresses to her even when phoebe instructed by the steward did her utmost to explain and tell her what to do  it would end by feeble bewildered looks and tears starting on the pale cheeks and i dont know my dear  it goes through my head  your poor papa attended to those things  i wish your brother would come home  tell them to write to him  they wrote and phoebe wrote but in vain no answer came and when she wrote to robert for tidings of mervyns movements entreating that he would extract a reply he answered that he could tell nothing satisfactory of his brother and did not know whether he were in town or not while as to advising his mother on business he should only make mischief by so doing  nothing satisfactory  what could that imply  phoebe expected soon to hear something positive for berthas teeth required a visit to london and miss fennimore was to take her to lady bannermans for a week during which the governess would be with some relations of her own  phoebe talked of the snugness of being alone with her mother and maria and she succeeded in keeping both pleased with one another  the sisters walked in the park and brought home primroses and periwinkles which their mother tenderly handled naming the copses they came from well known to her in childhood though since her marriage she had been too grand to be allowed the sight of a wild periwinkle  in the evening phoebe gave them music sang infantschool hymns with maria tried to teach her piquet and perceived the difference that the absence of berthas teasing made in the poor girls temper  all was very quiet but when good night was said phoebe felt wearied out and chid herself for her accesses of yawning nay she was shocked at her feeling of disappointment and tedium when the return of the travellers was delayed for a couple of days  when at length they came the variety brightened even mrs fulmort and she was almost loquacious about some mourning pockethandkerchiefs with chessboard borders that they were to bring  the girls all drank tea with her bertha pouring out a whole flood of chatter in unrestraint for she regarded her mother as nobody and loved to astonish her sisters so on she went a slight hitch in her speech giving a sort of piquancy to her manner  she had dined late every day she had ridden with sir bevil in the park her curly hair had been thought to be crepe she had drunk champagne she would have gone to the opera but the actons were particular and said it was too soonso tiresome one couldnt do anything for this mourning  phoebe in an admonitory tone suggested that she had seen the british museum  oh yes i have it all in my notebook  only imagine phoebe sir nicholas had been at athens and knew nothing about the parthenon  and gourmet as he is and so long in the mediterranean he had no idea whether the spartan black broth was made with sepia  my dear began her mother young ladies do not talk learning in society  such a simple thing as this mamma every one must know  but they are all so unintellectual  not a book about the bannermans house except soyer and the london directory and even bevil had never read the old red sandstone nor sir charles lyell  i have no opinion of the science of soldiers or sailors  you have told us nothing of julianas baby interposed phoebe  shes exactly like the goddess pasht in the sydenham palace  juliana does not like her a bit because she is only a girl and bevil quite worships her  everything one of them likes the other hates  they are a study of the science of antipathies  you should not fancy things bertha  it is no fancy every one is observing it  augusta says she has only twice found them together in their own house since christmas and mervyn says it is a warning against virulent constancy  then you saw mervyn anxiously asked phoebe  only twice  he is at deadly feud with the actons because bevil takes roberts part and has been lecturing him about the withdrawing all the subscriptions  what asked phoebe again  oh i thought robert told you all but there has been such a row  i believe poor papa said something about letting robert have an evening school for the boys and young men at the distillery but when he claimed it mervyn said he knew nothing about it and wouldnt hear of it and got affronted so he withdrew all the subscriptions from the charities and everything else and the boys have been mobbing the clergy and juliana says it is all roberts fault  and did you see robert  very little  no one would come to such an old fogys as sir nicholas that could help it  bertha my dear young ladies do not use such words observed her mother  oh mamma you are quite behindhand  slang is the thing  i see my line when i come out  it would not do for you phoebenot your stylebut i shall sport it when i come out and go to the actons  i shall go out with them  augusta is too slow and lives with nothing but old admirals and gourmands but ill always go to juliana for the season phoebe wear my hair in the eugenie style and be piquante  perhaps things will be altered by that time  oh no  there will be no retrograde movement  highly educated women have acquired such a footing that they may do what they please  are we highly educated women asked maria  i am sure you ought to be my dear  nothing was grudged for your education said her mother  well then ill always play at bagatelle and have a german band at the door quoth maria conclusively  did you go to st matthews again interrupted phoebe  yes bevil took me  it is the oddest place  a white brick wall with a red cross built into it over the gate and the threshold is just a step back four or five hundred years  a court with buildings all round church schools and the curates rooms  such a sittingroom the floor matted and a great oak table with benches where they all dine schoolmaster and orphan boys and all and the best boy out of each class  it is a common room like one at a college explained phoebe  robert has his own rooms besides  such a hole continued bertha  it is the worst of all the curates sittingrooms looking out into the nastiest little alley  it was a shame he did not have the first choice when it is all his own  perhaps that is the reason he took the worst said phoebe  a study in extremes said bertha  their dinner was our luncheonthe very plainest boiled beef the liquor given away and at dinner at the bannermans there were more fine things than bevil said he could appreciate and augusta looking like a fullblown dahlia  i was always wanting to stick pins into her arms to see how far in the bones are  i am sure i could bury the heads  here seeing her mother look exhausted phoebe thought it wise to clear the room and after waiting a few minutes to soothe her left her to her maid  bertha had waited for her sister and clinging round her said well phoebe arent you glad of us  have you seen a living creature  miss charlecote twice mr henderson once besides all the congregation on sunday  matteroffact phoebe  perhaps you can bear it but does not your mind ache as if it had been held down all this time  so that it cant expand to your grand intellect said phoebe  it is no great selfconceit to hope one is better company than maria but come before we fall under the dominion of the queen of the west wing i have a secret for you  then after a longer stammer than usual how should you like a french sisterinlaw  nonsense bertha  ah youve not had my opportunities  ive seen herboth of them juliana says the mother is his object augusta the daughter  the mother is much the most brilliant but then she has a husbanda mere matter of faith for no one ever sees him  mervyn is going to follow them to paris thats certain as soon as the epsom day is over  you saw them  only in the parkoh no not in a room  their ladyships would never call on madame la marquise she is not received you know  i heard the sisters talk it all over when they fancied me reading and wonder what they should do if it should turn out to be the daughter  but then juliana thinks mervyn might never bring her home for he is going on at such a tremendous rate that it is the luckiest thing our fortunes do not depend on the business  phoebe looked quite appalled as she entered the schoolroom not only at mervyns fulfilment of his threat but at berthas flippancy and shrewdness  hitherto she had been kept ignorant of evil save what history and her own heart could tell her  but these ten days had been spent in so eagerly studying the world that her girlish chatter was fearfully precocious  a little edged tool said miss fennimore when she talked her over afterwards with phoebe  i wish i could have been with her at lady bannermans  it is an unsafe age for a glimpse of the world  i hope it may soon be forgotten  it will never be forgotten said miss fennimore  with so strong a relish for society such keen satire and reasoning power so much developed i believe nothing but the devotional principle could subdue her enough to make her a wellbalanced woman  how is that to be infusedthat is the question  it is indeed  i believe pursued the governess that devotional temper is in most cases dependent upon uncomprising exclusive faith  i have sometimes wondered whether bertha coming into my hands so young as she did can have imbibed my distaste to dogma though as you know i have made a point of noninterference  i should shudder to think of any doubts in poor little berthas mind said phoebe  i believe it is rather that she does not think about the matter  i will read butlers analogy with her exclaimed miss fennimore  i read it long ago and shall be glad to satisfy my own mind by going over it again  it is full time to endeavour to form and deepen berthas convictions  i suppose said phoebe almost to herself that all naughtiness is the want of living faith  but miss fennimore instead of answering had gone to another subject  i have seen st matthews phoebe  and robert cried phoebe  bertha did not say you were with her  i went alone  no doubt your brother found me a great infliction but he was most kind and showed me everything  i consider that establishment a great fact  phoebe showed her gratification  i heard him preach continued miss fennimore  his was a careful and able composition but it was his sermon in brick and stone that most impressed me  such actions only arise out of strong conviction  now the work of a conviction may be only a proof of the force of the will that held it and thus the effect should not establish the cause  but when i see a young man brought up as your brother has been throwing himself with such energy selfdenial and courage into a task so laborious and obscure i must own that such is the construction of the human mind i am led to reconsider the train of reasoning that has led to such results  and miss fennimores sincere admiration of robert was phoebes one item of comfort  gladly she shared it with miss charlecote who on her side knew more than she told phoebe of the persecution that robert was undergoing from a vestry notoriously under the influence of the fulmort firm whose interest it was to promote the vice that he came to withstand  even the lads employed in the distillery knew that they gratified their employer by outrages on the clergy and their adherents and there had been moments when robert had been exposed to absolute personal danger by mobs stimulated in the ginshops their violence against his attacks on their vicious practices being veiled by a furious party outcry against his religious opinions  he meanwhile set his face like a rock and strong resolute and brave went his own way so unmoved as apparently almost to prefer his own antagonistic attitude and bidding fair to weary out his enemies by his coolness or to disarm them by the charities of which st matthews was the centre  as phoebe never read the papers and was secluded from the worlds gossip it was needless to distress her with the knowledge of the malignity of the one brother or the trials of the other so honor obeyed robert by absolute silence on this head  she herself gave her influence her counsel her encouragement and above all her prayers to uphold the youth who was realizing the dreams of her girlhood  it might be that the impress of those very dreams had formed the character she was admiring  many a weak and fragile substance moulded in its softness to a noble shape has given a clear and lasting impress to a firm and durable material either in the heat of the furnace or the ductility of growth  so robert and phoebe children of the heart that had lost those of her adoption cheered these lonely days by their need of her advice and sympathy  nor was she without tasks at home  mr henderson the vicar was a very old man and was constantly growing more feeble and unequal to exertion he had been appointed by the squire before last and had the indolent conservative orthodoxy of the old school regarding activity as a perilous innovation and resisting all miss charlecotes endeavours at progress in the parish  she had had long patience till when his strength failed she ventured to entreat him to allow her to undertake the stipend of a curate but this was rejected with displeasure and she was forced to redouble her own exertions but neither reading to the sick visiting the cottages teaching at school nor even setting up a nightschool in her own hall availed to supply the want of an active pastor and of a resident magistrate  hiltonbury was in danger of losing its reputation as a pattern parish which it had retained long after the death of him who had made it so the younger race who had since grown up were not such as their fathers had been and the disorderly household at beauchamp had done mischief the primitive manners the simplicity and feudal feeling were wearing off and poor honor found the whole charge laid to her few modern steps in education  if hiltonbury were better than many of the neighbouring places yet it was not what it had been when she first had known it and she vexed herself in the attempt to understand whether the times or herself were the cause  even her old bailiff brooks did not second her  he had more than come to the term of service at which the servant becomes a master and had no idea of obeying her when he thought he knew best  backward as were her notions of modern farming they were too advanced for him and either he would not act on them at all or was resolved against their success when coerced  there was no dismissing him and without mr saville to come and enforce her authority honor found the old man so stubborn that she had nearly given up the contest except where the welfare of men not of crops was concerned  a maidens reign is a dreary thing when she tends towards age  and honor often felt what it would have been to have had owen to back her up and infuse new spirit and vigour  the surly ploughboy who omitted to touch his cap to the lady little imagined the train of painful reflections roused by this small indication of the altering spirit of the place    chapter xvi       even in our ashes glow the wonted firesgray  my dear i did not like the voice that i heard just now  i am sure i was not out of temper  indeed  well i am sure any one would be vexed  cannot you tell me what was the matter without being sure so often  i am surethere mamma i beg your pardoni am sure i did not mean to complain  only sarah neither your voice has such a ring nor are you so sure when nothing has gone wrong  what was it  it is that photography mamma  miss sandbrook is so busy with it  i could not copy in my translation that i did yesterday because she had not looked over it and when she said she was coming presently i am afraid i said it was always presently and never present  i believe i did say it crossly and i am sorry i denied it and poor sarahs voice was low and meek enough  coming  where is she  in the dark chamber doing a positive of the cathedral  mrs prendergast entered the schoolroom outside which she had been holding this colloquy  the powerful sun of high summer was filling the room with barred light through the venetian blinds and revealing a rather confused mass of the appliances of study interspersed with saucers of water in which were bathing paper photographs and every shelf of books had a fringe of others on glass set up to dry  on the table lay a paper of hooks a threetailed artificial minnow and another partly clothed with silver twist a flybook and a quantity of feathers and silks  i must tell francis that the schoolroom is no place for his fishingtackle exclaimed mrs prendergast  o mamma it is miss sandbrooks  she is teaching him to dress flies because she says he cant be a real fisherman without and the trout always rise at hers  it is quite beautiful to see her throw  that delicate little hand is so strong and ready  a door was opened and out of the housemaids closet defended from light by a yellow blind at every crevice came eager exclamations of famous capital the tower comes out to perfection and in another moment lucilla sandbrook in all her bloom and animation was in the room followed by a youth of some eighteen years francis beaumont an indian nephew of mrs prendergast  hit off at last isnt it aunt  those dogtooth mouldings will satisfy even the uncle  really it is very good said mrs prendergast as it was held up to the light for her inspection  miss sandbrook has bewitched the camera continued he  do you remember the hideous muddles of last summer  but oh miss sandbrook we must have one more the sun will be off by and by  only ten minutes said lucilla in a deprecating tone  you must not keep me a second more let the sun be in ever such good humour  come sarah come and show us the place you said would be so good  it is too hot said sarah bluntly and i cant waste the morning  well you patternpupil ill come presently  indeed i will mrs prendergast  let me see this translation sarah said mrs prendergast as the photographers ran downstairs  she looked over it carefully and as the ten minutes had passed without sign of the governesss return asked what naturally followed in the mornings employment  italian reading mamma but never mind  find the place my dear  it is only while francis is at home  oh i wish i had not been cross and though sarah usually loved to read to her mother she was uneasy all the time watching the door and pausing to listen at the most moving passages  it was full half an hour before the voices were heard returning and then there was a call directly sarah the dark chamber was shut up and all subsided  mrs prendergast stayed on in spite of an imploring glance from her daughter and after an interval of the mysterious manipulations in the closet the photograph was borne forth in triumph  lucilla looked a little abashed at finding mrs prendergast in presence and began immediately there mr beaumont you see  i hope mrs prendergast is going to banish you forthwith you make us shamefully idle  yes said mrs prendergast gravely i am going to carry him off at once and make a law against future invasions  francis attempted loud appeals but his aunt quashed them with demeanour that showed that she was in earnest and drove him away before her  indeed miss sandbrook said sarah with affectionate compunction i did not mean to speak so loud and so crossly  my dear said lucilla leaning back and fanning herself with her hat we all know that we reverse the laws of teacher and pupil  small blame to you if you were put out and now i hope your mamma will keep him to herself and that i shall have time to get cool  there read me some french it is a refreshing processor practise a little  i declare that boy has dragged me in and out so often that i havent energy to tell a noun from a verb  mrs prendergast had hardly descended to the drawingroom before her husbands voice called her to the study where he stood his broad mouth distended by a broader smile his eyes twinkling with merriment  old woman his favourite name for her do you know what a spectacle i have been witnessing and as she signed inquiry mrs sprydone with numerous waggings of the head and winkings of the eyes inveigled me into her den to seeguess  francis and miss sandbrook in the cloister photographing  old woman you are a witch  i knew what they were about as well as mrs sprydones agony to open my eyes  so your obstinate blindness drove her to me  she thought it right that i should be aware the close it seems is in a fever about that poor girl  what do you know  is it all gossip  i know there is gossip as a law of nature but i have not chosen to hear it  then you think it all nonsense  not all  well what then  the good ladies seem terribly scandalized by her dress  is there any harm in that  i always thought it very becoming  exactly so said his wife smiling  if it is too smart cant you give her a hint  when she left off her mourning she spoke to me saying that she could not afford not to wear out what she already had  i quite agreed and though i could wish there were less stylishness about her it is pleasant to ones own eye and i see nothing to object to  im sure it is no concern of the ladies then  and how about this lad one of their wild notions is not it  i have heard her tell him halfadozen times that she was six years his elder  fourandtwenty is just the age that younglooking girls like to boast of  i am not afraid on her account she has plenty of sense and principle and i believe too there is a very sore spot in her heart poor girl  she plays with him as a mere boy but he is just at the time of life for a passion for a woman older than himself and his devotion certainly excites her more than i could wish  ill tell you what peter didnt like it at all  peter was certainly not in a gracious mood when he was here last week i could not make out whether seeing her a governess were too much for him or whether he suspected me of illusing her  no no it was rivalry between him and master francis said the doctor laughing  how he launched out against young mens conceit when francis was singing with her  sheer jealousy  he could see nothing but dilapidation dissent and dirt at laneham and now has gone and refused it  refused lanehamthat capital college livingwith no better dependence than his fellowship and such a curacy as wrapworth  indeed he has  heres his letter  you may read it and give it to miss sandbrook if you likehe seems quite dispirited  too old to enter on a new field of duties read mrs prendergast indignantly  why he is but fortyfour  what did he think of us for coming here  despised me for it said the doctor smiling  never mind he will think himself younger as he grows olderand one cant blame him for keeping to wrapworth as long as the old dean of  lives especially as those absentee charterises do so much harm  he does not expect them to give him the living  they ought i am sure after his twenty years labour there already  not they  mr charteris gratuitously wrote to tell him that on hearing of his burying that poor young mrs sandbrook there all scruples had been removed and the next presentation was offered for sale  you need not tell miss sandbrook so  certainly not but pray how does peter mean to avoid the new field of duty if he be sure of turning out on the deans death  oh i seefinish his days at his college if the changes at the university have not rendered it insupportable to one who remembers elder and better days  poor peter  well these are direful consequences of miss sandbrooks fit of flightiness  yes ill show her the letter it might tame her a little and poor thing i own i liked her better when she was soft and subdued  ha  then you are not satisfied  dont go  let me know how it is  i am sure sarah is distracted about hermore than even francis  i would not part with her for a great deal not only on peters account but on her own and sarahs but these ladies have raked up all manner of charteris scandal and we are quite in disgrace for bringing her here  yes said mrs prendergast while we lived at our dear old country home i never quite believed what i heard of jealous illnature but i have seen how it was ever since those christmas parties when certainly people paid her a great deal of attention  who would notthe prettiest most agreeable young woman there  it may be vexatious to be eclipsed not only in beauty but in style by a strange governess said mrs prendergast  that set all the mothers and daughters against her and there have been some spiteful little attempts at mortifying her which have made sarah and me angry beyond description  all that they say only impels me towards her  she is a rare creature most engaging but i do sometimes fear that i may have spoilt her a little for she has certainly not done quite so well of late  at first she worked hard to keep in advance of sarah saying how she felt the disadvantage of superficial learning and desultory habits she kept in the background and avoided amusements but i suppose reaction is natural with recovered spirits and this summer she has taken less pains and has let francis occupy her too much andwhat i like least of allher inattention brings back the old rubs with sarahs temper  you must take her in hand  if she were but my daughter or niece  i thought you had made her feel as such  this sort of reproof is the difficulty and brings back the sense of our relative positions  however the thing is to be done as much for her sake as for our own  lucilla knew that a lecture was impending but she really loved and esteemed mrs prendergast too much to prepare to champ the bit  that ladys warmth and simplicity and above all the largeness of mind that prevented her from offending or being offended by trifles had endeared her extremely to the young governess  not only had these eight months passed without the squabble that owen had predicted would send her to hiltonbury in a week but cilla had decidedly though insensibly laid aside many of the sentiments and habits in which poor honors opposition had merely confirmed her  the effect of the sufferings of the past summer had subdued her for a long time the novelty of her position had awed her and what mrs prendergast truly called the reaction had been so tardy in coming on that it was a surprise even to herself  sensible that she had given cause for displeasure she courted the teteatete and herself began thusi beg your pardon for my idleness  it is a fatal thing to be recalled to the two passions of my youthfishing and photography  my husband will give francis employment in the morning said mrs prendergast  it will not do to give sarahs natural irritability too many excuses for outbreaks  she never accepts excuses said lucilla though i am sure she might i have been a sore trial to her diligence and methodicalness and her soul is too much bent on her work for us to drag her out to be foolish as would be best for her  so it might be for her but my dear pardon me i am not speaking only for sarahs sake  with an odd jerk of head and hand cilly exclaimed oh the old storythe other fflirting is it  i never said that  i never thought that cried mrs prendergast shocked at the word and idea that had never crossed her mind  if not said cilla it is because you are too innocent to know flirting when you see it  dear mrs prendergast i didnt think you would have looked so grave  i did not think you would have spoken so lightly but it is plain that we do not mean the same thing  in fact you in your quietness think awfully of that which for years was to me like breathing  i thought the taste was gone for ever but you seeand her sad sweet expression pleaded for heryou have made me so happy that the old self is come back  there was a silence broken by this strange girl saying well what are you going to do to me  only said the lady in her sweet full impressive voice to beg you will indeed be happy in giving yourself no cause for selfreproach  im past that said lucilla with a smile on her lip and a tear in her eye  ive not known that sensation since my father died  my chief happiness since that has lain in being provoking but you have taken away that pleasure  i couldnt purposely vex you even if i were your adopted child  without precisely knowing the full amount of these words mrs prendergast understood past bitterness and present warmth and gratified to find that at least there was no galling at their mutual relations responded with a smile and a caress that led lucilla to continueas for the word that dismayed you i only meant to acknowledge an unlucky propensity to be excited about any nonsense in which any man kind is mixed up  if sarah would take to it i could more easily abstain but you see her coquetries are with nobody more recent than horace and dante  i cannot wish it to be otherwise with her said mrs prendergast gravely  no  it is a bad speculation said lucilla sadly  she will never wish half her life could be pulled out like defective crochet nor wear out good peoples forbearance with her antics  i did think they were outgrown and beat out of me and that your nephew was too young but i suppose it is ingrain and that i should be flattered by the attentions of a hebaby of six months old  but ill do my best mrs prendergast i promise you ill not be the schoolmistress abroad in the morning and you shall see what terms i will keep with mr beaumont  mrs prendergast was less pleased after than before this promise  it was again that freedom of expression that the girl had learnt among the charterises and the ideas that she accepted as mere matters of course that jarred upon the matron whose secluded life had preserved her in far truer refinement  she did not know how to reply and as a means of ending the discussion gave her mr prendergasts letter but was amazed at her reception of it  passed the living  famous  he will stick to wrapworth to the last gasp  that is fidelity  pray tell him so from me  you had better send your message through dr prendergast  we cannot but be disappointed though i understand your feeling for wrapworth and we are sorry for the dispirited tone about the letter  well he may be all alone there and seeing poor castle blanch going to rack and ruin  i could cry about it whenever i think of it but how much worse would it have been if he had deserted too  as long as he is in the old vicarage there is a home spot to me in the world  oh i thank him i do thank him for standing by the old place to the last  it is preposterous thought mrs prendergast  i wont tell the doctor  he would think it so foolish in him and improper in her i verily believe it is her influence that keeps him at wrapworth  he cannot bear to cross her wishes nor give her pain  well i am thankful that sarah is neither beautiful nor attractive  sincere was lucillas intention to resume her regular habits and put a stop to francis beaumonts attentions but the attraction had already gone so far that repression rendered him the more assiduous and often bore the aspect if it were not absolutely the coyness of coquetry while deprecating from her heart any attachment on his part her vanity was fanned at finding herself in her present position as irresistible as ever and his eagerness to obtain a smile or word from her was such an agreeable titillation that everything else became flat and her hours in the schoolroom an imprisonment  sarahs methodical earnestness in study bored her and she was sick of restraint and application  nor was this likely to be merely a passing evil for franciss parents were in india and southminster was his only english home  nay even when he had returned to his tutor lucilla was not restored to her better self  her craving for excitement had been awakened and her repugnance to mental exertion had been yielded to  the routine of lessons had become bondage and she sought every occasion of variety seeking to outshine and dazzle the ladies of southminster playing off castle blanch fascinations on curates and minor canons and sometimes flying at higher game even beguiling the dean himself into turning over her music when she sang  she had at first by the use of all her fullgrown faculties been just able to keep sufficiently ahead of her pupil but her growing indolence soon caused her to slip back and not only did she let sarah shoot ahead of her but she became impatient of the girls habits of accuracy and research she would give careless and vexatious answers insist petulantly on correcting by the ear make light of sarah and her grammar and hastily reject or hurry from the maps dictionaries and cyclopaedias with which sarahs training had taught her to read and learn  but her dislike of trouble in supporting an opinion did not make her the less pertinacious in upholding it and there were times when she was wrathful and petulant at sarahs presumption in maintaining the contrary even with all the authorities in the bookshelves to back her  sarahs temper was not her prime quality and altercations began to run high  each dispute that took place only prepared the way for another and mrs prendergast having taken a governess chiefly to save her daughter from being fretted by interruptions found that her annoyances were tenfold increased and irritations were almost habitual  they were the more disappointing because the girl preserved through them all such a passionate admiration for her beautiful and charming little governess that except in the very height of a squabble she still believed her perfection and was her most vehement partisan even when the wrong had been chiefly on the side of the teacher  on the whole in spite of this return to old faults lucilla was improved by her residence at southminster  defiance had fallen into disuse and the habit of respect and affection had softened her and lessened her pride there was more devotional temper and a greater desire after a religious way of life  it might be that her fretfulness was the effect of an uneasiness of mind which was more hopeful than her previous fierce selfsatisfaction and that her aberrations were the last efforts of old evil habits to reestablish their grasp by custom when her heart was becoming detached from them  be that as it might mrs prendergasts first duty was to her child her second to the nephew intrusted to her and love and pity as she might she felt that to retain lucilla was leading all into temptation  her husband was slow to see the verification of her reluctant opinion but he trusted to her and it only remained to part as little harshly or injuriously as might be  an opening was afforded when in october mrs prendergast was entreated by the widow of one of her brothers to find her a governess for two girls of twelve and ten and two boys younger  it was at a countryhouse so much secluded that such temptations as at southminster were out of reach and the younger pupils were not likely to try her temper in the same way as sarah had done  so mrs prendergast tenderly explained that sarah being old enough to pursue her studies alone and her sister mrs willis beaumont being in distress for a governess it would be best to transfer miss sandbrook to her  lucilla turned a little pale but gave no other sign only answering thank you and yes at fit moments and acceding to everything even to her speedy departure at the end of a week  she left the room in silence more stunned than even by roberts announcement and with less fictitious strength to brave the blow that she had brought on herself  she repaired to the schoolroom and leaning her brow against the windowpane tried to gather her thoughts but scarcely five minutes had passed before the door was thrown back and in rushed sarah passionately exclaiming  its my fault  its all my fault  oh miss sandbrook dearest miss sandbrook forgive me  oh my temper my temper  i never thoughtill go to papa  ill tell him it is my doing  he will nevernever be so unjust and cruel  sarah stand up let me go please said lucy unclasping the hands from her waist  this is not right  your father and mother both think the same and so do i  it is just that i should go  you shant say so  it is my crossness  i wont let you go  ill write to peter  he wont let you go  sarah was really beside herself with despair and as her mother advanced and would have spoken turned round sharply dont dont mamma i wont come away unless you promise not to punish her for my temper  you have minded those horrid wicked gossiping ladies  i didnt think you would  sarah said lucilla resolutely going mad in this way just shows that i am doing you no good  you are not behaving properly to your mother  she never acted unjustly before  that is not for you to judge in the first place and in the next she acts justly  i feel it  yes sarah i do i have not done my duty by you and have quarrelled with you when your industry shamed me  all my old bad habits are come back and your mother is right to part with me  there there mamma do you hear that sobbed sarah imploringly when she speaks in that way can you still  oh i know i was disrespectful but you cantyou cant think that was her fault  it was said lucilla looking at mrs prendergast  i know she has lost the selfcontrol she once had  sarah this is of no use  i would go now if your mother begged me to stayand that she added with her firm smile she is too wise to do  if you do not wish to pain me and put me to shame do not let me have any more such exhibitions  pale ashamed discomfited sarah turned away and not yet able to govern herself rushed into her room  poor sarah said her mother  you have rare powers of making your pupils love you miss sandbrook  if it were for their good sighed lucilla  it has been much for her good she is far less uncouth and less exclusive  and it will be more so i hope  you will still be her friend and we shall often see you here  lucillas tears were dropping fast and looking up she said with difficultydont mind this i know it is right i have not deserved the happy home you have given me here  where i am less happy i hope i may keep a better guard on myself  i thought the old ways had been destroyed but they are too strong still and i ought to suffer for them  never in all her days had lucilla spoken so humbly    chapter xvii       though shes as like to this one as a crab is like to an apple           i can tell what i can tellking lear  often a first grief where sorrow was hitherto been a stranger is but the foretaste to many another like the first hailstorm after long sunshine preluding a succession of showers the clouds returning after the rain and obscuring the sky of life for many a day  those who daily saw mrs fulmort scarcely knew whether to attribute her increasing invalidism to debility or want of spirits and hopes were built on summer heat till when it came it prostrated her strength and at last when some casual ailment had confined her to bed there was no rally  all took alarm a physician was called in and the truth was disclosed  there was no formed disease but her husbands death though apparently hardly comprehended had taken away the spring of life and she was withering like a branch severed from the stem  remedies did but disturb her torpor by feverish symptoms that hastened her decline and dr martyn privately told miss charlecote that the absent sons and daughters ought to be warned that the end must be very near  honor as lovingly and gently as possible spoke to phoebe  the girls eyes filled with tears but it was in an almost wellpleased tone that she said dear mamma i always knew she felt it  ah little did we think how deeply went the stroke that showed no wound  yes  she felt that she was going to him  we could never have made her happy here  you are content my unselfish one  dont talk to me about myself please implored phoebe  i have too much to do for that  what did he say  that the others should be written to  i will take my case and write in mammas room  immediate duty was her refuge from anticipation gentle tendance from the sense of misery and though her mothers restless feebleness needed constant waiting on her four notes were completed before posttime augusta was eating red mullet in guernsey juliana was on a round of visits in scotland mervyn was supposed to be in paris robert alone was near at hand  at night phoebe sent boodle to bed but miss fennimore insisted on sharing her pupils watch  at first there was nothing to do the patient had fallen into a heavy slumber and the daughter sat by the bed the governess at the window unoccupied save by their books  phoebe was reading miss maurices invaluable counsels to the nurses of the dying miss fennimore had the bible  it was not from a sense of appropriateness as in pursuance of her system of reexamination  always admiring the scripture in a patronizing temper she had gloried in critical inquiry and regarded plenary inspiration as a superstition covering weak points by pretensions to infallibility  but since her discussions with robert and her readings of butler with bertha she had begun to weigh for herself the internal intrinsic evidence of divine origin above all in the gospels which to her surprise enchained her attention and investigation as she would have thought beyond the power of such simple words  pilates question what is truth was before her  to her it was a link of evidence  without even granting that the writer was the fisherman he professed to be what short of shakesperian intuition could thus have depicted the roman of the early empire in equal dread of caesar and of the populace at once unscrupulous and timid contemning jewish prejudice yet with lingering mythological superstition trembling at the hint of a present deity in human form and lost in the bewilderment of the later greek philosophy greeting the word truth with the startled inquiry what it might be  what is truth  it had been the question of miss fennimores life and she felt a blank and a disappointment as it stood unanswered  a movement made her look up phoebe was raising her mother and miss fennimore was needed to support the pillows  phoebe my dear are you here  yes dear mamma i always am  phoebe my dear i think i am soon going  you have been a good child my dear i wish i had done more for you all  dear mamma you have always been so kind  they didnt teach me like honora charlecote she faltered on but i always did as your poor papa told me  nobody ever told me how to be religious and your poor papa would not have liked it  phoebe you know more than i do  you dont think god will be hard with me do you  i am such a poor creature but there is the blood that takes away sin  dear mother that is the blessed trust  the truth flashed upon miss fennimore as she watched their faces  will he give me his own goodness said mrs fulmort wistfully  i never did know how to think about himi wish i had cared more  what do you think phoebe  i cannot tell how to answer fully dear mamma said phoebe but indeed it is safe to think of his great lovingkindness and mercy  robert will be here tomorrow  he will tell you better  he will give me the holy sacrament said mrs fulmort and then i shall go  presently she moved uneasily  oh phoebe i am so tired  nothing rests me  there remaineth a rest gently whispered phoebeand miss fennimore thought the young face had something of the angel in itno more weariness there  they wont think what a poor dull thing i am there added her mother i wish i could take poor maria with me  they dont like her here and she will be teased and put about  no mother never while i can take care of her  i know you will phoebe if you say so  phoebe love when i see god i shall thank him for having made you so good and dear and letting me have some comfort in one of my children  phoebe tried to make her think of robert but she was exhausted dozed and was never able to speak so much again  miss fennimore thought instead of reading  was it the mere effect on her sympathies that bore in on her mind that truth existed and was grasped by the mother and daughter  what was there in those faltering accents that impressed her with reality  why of all her many instructors had none touched her like poor ignorant feebleminded mrs fulmort  robert arrived the next day  his mother knew him and was roused sufficiently to accept his offices as a clergyman  then as if she thought it was expected of her she asked for her younger daughters but when they came she looked distressed and perplexed  bless them mother said robert bending over her and she evidently accepted this as what she wanted but howwhat she added and taking the uncertain hand he guided it to the head of each of his three sisters and prompted the words of blessing from the failing tongue then as bertha rose he sank on his knees in her place bless me bless me too mother bless me and pardon my many acts of selfwill  you are goodyouyou are a clergyman she hesitated bewildered  the more reason mamma it will comfort him  and it was phoebe who won for her brother the blessing needed as balm to a bleeding heart  the others are away said the dying woman maybe if i had made them good when they were little they would not have left me now  while striving to join in prayer for them she slumbered and in the course of the night she slept herself tranquilly away from the world where even prosperity had been but a troubled maze to her  augusta arrived weeping profusely but with all her wits about her so as to assume the command and to provide for her own and her admirals comfort  phoebe was left to the mournful repose of having no one to whom to attend since miss fennimore provided for the younger ones and in the lassitude of bodily fatigue and sorrow she shrank from marias babyish questions and berthas levity and curiosity spending her time chiefly alone  even robert could not often be with her since mervyns absence and silence threw much on him and mr crabbe the executor and guardian and the bannermans were both exacting and selfimportant  the actons having been pursued by their letters from place to place in the highlands at length arrived and mervyn last of all only just in time for the funeral  phoebe did not see him till the evening after it when having spent the day nearly alone she descended to the late dinner and after the quietness in which she had lately lived and with all the tenderness from fresh suffering it seemed to her that she was entering on a distracting turmoil of voices  mervyn however came forward at once to meet her threw his arm round her and kissed her rather demonstratively saying my little phoebe i wondered where you were then putting her into a chair and bending over her we are in for the funeral games  stand up for yourself  she did not know in the least what he could mean but she was too sick at heart to ask she only thought he looked unwell jaded and fagged and with a heated complexion  he handed lady acton into the diningroom augusta following with sir bevil was going to the head of the table when he called out thats phoebes place  not before my elders phoebe answered trying to seat herself at the side  the sister at home is mistress of the house he sternly answered take your proper place phoebe  in much discomfort she obeyed and tried to attend civilly to sir nicholass observations on the viands hoping to intercept a few as she perceived how they chafed her eldest brother  at last on mervyn himself roundly abusing the flavour of the icepudding augusta not only defended it but confessed to having herself directed mrs brisbane to the concoction that morning  mrs brisbane shall take orders from no lady but miss fulmort while she is in my house thundered mervyn  phoebe in agony began to say she knew not what to sir bevil and he seconded her with equal vehemence and incoherency till by the time they knew what they were talking of they were with much interest discussing his little daughter scarcely turning their heads from one another till in the midst of dessert the voice of juliana was heardsir bevil sir bevil if you can spare me any attentionwhat was the name of that person at hampstead that your sister told me of  that person  what where poor anne acton was boarded  dr graham he called himself but i dont believe he was a physician  horrid vulgar fellow  excellent for the purpose though continued lady acton addressing herself as before to mr crabbe advertises for nervous or deficient ladies and boards them on very fair terms would take her quite off our hands  phoebe turned a wild look of imploring interrogation on sir bevil but a certain family telegraph had electrified him and his eyes were on the grapes that he was eating with nervous haste  her blood boiling at what she apprehended phoebe could endure her present post no longer and starting up made the signal for leaving the dinnertable so suddenly that augusta choked upon her glass of wine and carried off her last macaroon in her hand  before she had recovered breath to rebuke her sisters precipitation phoebe with boldness and spirit quite new to the sisters was confronting juliana and demanding what she had been saying about hampstead  only said juliana coolly that i have found a capital place there for mariaa dr graham who boards and lodges such unfortunates  sir bevil had an idiot cousin there who died  i shall write tomorrow  i promised that maria should not be separated from me said phoebe  nonsense my dear said augusta we could not receive her she can never be made presentable  you said phoebe  yes my dear did you not know  you go home with us the day after tomorrow and next spring i mean to bring you out and take you everywhere  the admiral is so generous  but the others said phoebe  i dont mind undertaking bertha said lady acton  i know of a good school for her and i shall deposit maria at dr grahams as soon as i can get an answer  really continued augusta phoebe will look very creditable by and by when she has more colour and not all this crape  perhaps i shall get her married by the end of the season only you must learn better manners first phoebenot to rush out of the diningroom in this way  i dont know what i shall do without my other glass of winewhen i am so low too  a fine mistress of the house indeed said lady acton  it is well mervyns absurd notion is impossible  what was that  to keep us all asked phoebe catching at the hope  not maria nor the governess  you need not flatter yourself said juliana he said he wouldnt have them at any price and as to keeping house alone with a man of his character even you may have sense to see it couldnt be for a moment  did robert consent to marias going to hampstead asked phoebe  robertwhat has he to do with it  he has no voice  he said something about getting the three boarded with some clergymans widow said augusta buried in some hole i suppose to make them like himselfgo to church every day and eat cold dinners on sunday  i should like to see bertha doing that said juliana laughing  but the agony of helplessness that had oppressed phoebe was relieved she saw an outlet and could form a resolution  home might have to be given up but there was a means of fulfilling her mothers charge and saving maria from the private idiot asylum and for that object phoebe was ready to embrace perpetual seclusion with the dullest of widows  she found her sisters discussing their favourite subjectmervyns misconduct and extravaganceand she was able to sit apart working and thinking of her line of action  only two days  she must be prompt and not wait for privacy or for counsel  so when the gentlemen came in and mr crabbe came towards her she took him into the window and asked him if any choice were permitted her as to her residence  certainly so nearly of age as you are  but i naturally considered that you would wish to be with lady bannerman with all the advantages of london society  but she will not receive maria  i promised that maria should be my charge  you have not consented to this hampstead scheme  her ladyship is precipitate half whispered the lawyer  i certainly would not till i had seen the establishment and judged for myself  no nor then said phoebe  come tomorrow and see her  she is no subject for an establishment  and i beg you will let me be with her i would much prefer being with any lady who would receive us both  very amiable said mr crabbe  ha interrupted mervyn you are not afraid i shall let augusta carry you off phoebe  she would give the world to get you but i dont mean to part with you  it is of no use to talk to her mervyn cried augustas loud voice from the other end of the room  she knows that she cannot remain with you robert himself would tell her so  robert knows better than to interfere said mervyn with one of his scowls  now then phoebe settle it for yourself  will you stay and keep house for me at home or be augustas companion  there the choice of hercules  virtue or vice he added trying to laugh  neither said phoebe readily  my home is fixed by marias  phoebe are you crazy broke out the three voices while sir nicholas slowly and sententiously explained that he regretted the unfortunate circumstance but marias peculiarities made it impossible to produce her in society and that when her welfare and happiness had been consulted by retirement phoebe would find a home in his house and be treated as lady bannermans sister and a young lady of her expectations deserved  thank you said phoebe then turning to her brother mervyn do you too cast off poor maria  i told you what i thought of that long ago said mervyn carelessly  very well then said phoebe sadly perhaps you will let us stay till some lady can be found of whom mr crabbe may approve with whom maria and i can live  lady acton sir bevils voice was low and entreating but all heard it  i am not going to encumber myself she answered  i always disliked girls and i shall certainly not make acton manor an idiot asylum  and mind added augusta you wont cone to me for the season  i have no notion of your leaving me all the dull part of the year for some gay widow at a wateringplace and then expecting me to go out with you in london  by heaven broke out mervyn they shall stay here if only to balk your spite  my sisters shall not be driven from pillar to post the very day their mother is put under ground  some respectable lady began robert  some horrid old harridan of a boardinghouse keeper shouted mervyn the louder for his interference  ay you would like it and spend all their fortunes on parsons in long coats  i know better  come here phoebe and listen  you shall live here as you have always done maria and all and keep the fennimore woman to mind the children  answer me will that content you  dont go looking at robert but say yes or no  mervyns innuendo had deprived his offer of its grace but in spite of the pang of indignation in spite of roberts eye of disapproval poor desolate phoebe must needs cling to her home and to the one who alone would take her and her poor companion  mervyn thank you it is right  right  what does that mean  if any one has a word to say against my sisters being under my roof let me hear it openly not behind my back eh juliana whats that  only that i wonder how long it will last sneered lady acton  and added robert there should be some guarantee that they should not be introduced to unsuitable acquaintance  you think me not to be trusted with them  i do not  mervyn ground his teeth answering very well sir i stand indebted to you  i should have imagined whatever your opinion of me you would have considered your favourite skyblue governess an immaculate guardian or can you be contented with nothing short of a sisterhood  robert said phoebe fearing lest worse should follow mervyn has always been good to us i trust to him  and her clear eyes were turned on the eldest brother with a grateful confidence that made him catch her hand with something between thanks and triumph as he said  well said little one  there sir are you satisfied  i must be replied robert  sir bevil able to endure no longer broke in with some intelligence from the newspaper which he had been perusing ever since his unlucky appeal to his lady  every one thankfully accepted this means of ending the discussion  well miss was julianas good night you have attained your object i hope you may find it answer  yes added augusta when mervyn brings home that frenchwoman you will wish you had been less tenacious  thats all an idea of yours said juliana  shell have punishment enough in master mervyns own temper  i wouldnt keep house for him no not for a week  stay till you are asked said augusta  phoebe could bear no more but slipped through the swingdoor reached her room and sinking into a chair passively let lieschen undress her not attempting to raise her drooping head nor check the tears that trickled conscious only of her broken wounded oppressed state of dejection into the details of which she durst not look  how could she when her misery had been inflicted by such hands  the mere fact of the unseemly broil between the brothers and sisters on such an evening was shame and pain enough and she felt like one bruised and crushed all over both in herself and maria while the one drop of comfort in mervyns kindness was poisoned by the strife between him and robert and the doubt whether robert thought she ought to have accepted it  when her maid left her she only moved to extinguish her light and then cowered down again as if to hide in the darkness but the soft summer twilight gloom seemed to soothe and restore her and with a longing for air to refresh her throbbing brow she leant out into the cool still night looking into the northern sky still pearly with the last reminiscence of the late sunset and with the pale large stars beaming calmly down  oh mother mother  well might you long to take your poor maria with youthere where the weary are at restwhere there is mercy for the weak and slow  home home we have none but with you  nay had she not a home with him whose love was more than mothers love whose soft stars were smiling on her now whose gentle breezes fanned her burning cheeks even as a still softer breath of comfort was stilling her troubled spirit  she leant out till she could compose herself to kneel in prayer and from prayer rose up quietly weary and able to rest beneath the fatherly wings spread over the orphan  she was early astir though with heavy swollen eyelids and anxious to avoid berthas inquiries till all should be more fully settled she betook herself to the garden to cool her brow and eyes  she was bathing them in the dewy fragrant heart of a fullblown rose that had seemed to look at her with a tearful smile of sympathy when a step approached and an arm was thrown round her and robert stood beside her  my phoebe he said tenderly how are you  it was a frightful evening  oh robert were you displeased with me  no indeed  you put us all to shame  i grieved that you had no more preparation but some of the guests stayed late afterwards i was hindered by business and then bevil laid hands on me to advise me privately against this establishment for poor maria  i thought it was juliana who pressed it  have you not learnt that whatever he dislikes she forwards  oh robert you can hinder that scheme from ever being thought of again  yes said robert there she should never have been even had you not made resistance  and robert may we stay here asked phoebe trembling  crabbe sees no objection he answered  do you robert  if you think we ought not i will try to change but mervyn is kind and it is home  i saw you thought me wrong but i could not help being glad he relented to maria  you were right  your eldest brother is the right person to give you a home  i cannot  it would have shown an evil suspicious temper if you had refused him  yet you do not like it  perhaps i am unjust  i own that i had imagined you all happier and better in such a home as mrs parsons or miss charlecote could find for you and though mervyn would scarcely wilfully take advantage of your innocence i do not trust to his always knowing what would be hurtful to you or bertha  it is a charge that i grudge to him for i do not think he perceives what it is  i could make you think better of him  i wonder whether i may  anythinganything to make me think better of him cried robert eagerly  i do not know it from him alone so it cannot be a breach of confidence said phoebe  he has been deeply attached not to a pretty person nor a rich nor grand one but she was very good and religiousso much so that she would not accept him  how recently  the attachment has been long the rejection this spring  my poor phoebe i could not tell you how his time has been passed since early spring  i know in part she said looking down but robin that arose from despair  oh how i longed for him to come and let me try to comfort him  and how is this to change my opinion asked robert except by showing me that no rightminded woman could trust herself with him  oh robert no  sisters need not change though others ought perhaps i meant you to see that he does love and honour goodness for itself and so that he will guard his sisters  i will think so phoebe  you deserve to be believed for you draw out his best points  for my own part the miserable habits of our boyhood have left a habit of acrimony of which repent as i will i cannot free myself  i gave way to it last night  i can be cool but i cannot help being contemptuous  i make him worse and i aggravated your difficulties by insulting him  he insulted you said phoebe  when i think of those words i dont know how i can stay with him  they fell short  they were nothing said robert  but it was the more unbefitting in me to frame my warning as i did  oh phoebe your prayers and influence have done much for me  help me now to treat my brother so as not to disgrace my calling  youwhen you freely forgive all the injuries he has done you  if i freely forgave i suppose i should love and he murmured sadly he that hateth his brother is a murderer  phoebe shrank but could not help thinking that if the spirit of cain existed among them it was not with the younger brother  when she next spoke it was to express her fear lest miss fennimore should refuse to remain since the position would be uncomfortable  her talent was thrown away on poor maria and bertha had been very vexing and provoking of late  phoebe greatly dreaded a change both from her love for her governess and alarm lest a new duenna might be yet more unwelcome to mervyn and she was disappointed to see that robert caught at the hope that the whole scheme might be baffled on this score  phoebe thought a repetition of the dinnertable offence would be best obviated by taking her place as teamaker at once  mervyn first came down and greeted her like something especially his own  he detected the red blistered spot on her cheek and exclaimed eh did they make you cry  never mind the house will soon be clear of them and you my little queen  you have nothing to say against it  has any one been putting things in your head and he looked fiercely at his brother  no mervyn robert and i both think you very kind and that it is the right thing  yes said robert no arrangement could be more proper  i am sorry mervyn if my manner was offensive last night  i never take offence it is not my way said mervyn indifferently almost annoyed that his brother had not spirit to persevere in the quarrel  after the breakfast where the elder sisters were cold and distant and sir bevil as friendly as he durst mervyns first move was to go in conjunction with mr crabbe to explain the arrangement to miss fennimore and request her to continue her services  they came away surprised and angry miss fennimore would consider of it  even when mervyn to spare himself from some stranger who might prove a greater nuisance had offered a hundred in addition to her present exorbitant salary she courteously declined and repeated that her reply should be given in the evening  mervyns wrath would have been doubled had he known the cause of her delay  she sent maria to beg robert to spare her half an hour and on his entrance dismissing her pupils she said mr fulmort i should be glad if you would candidly tell me your opinion of the proposed arrangement  i mean seeing his hesitation of that part which relates to myself  i do not quite understand you he said  i mean whether as the person whose decision has the most worth in this family you are satisfied to leave your sisters under my charge  if not whatever it may cost me to part with that sweet and admirable phoebe and her voice showed unwonted emotion i would not think of remaining with them  you put me in a very strange position miss fennimore i have no authority to decide  they could have no friend more sincerely anxious for their welfare or so welcome to phoebes present wishes  perhaps not but the question is not of my feelings nor theirs but whether you consider my influence pernicious to their religious principles  if so i decline their guardians terms at once  after a pause she added pleased at his deliberation it may assist you if i lay before you the state of my own mind  she proceeded to explain that her parents had been professed unitarians her mother loving and devout to the hereditary faith beyond which she had never lookedmr fulmort she said nothing will approve itself to me that condemns my mother  he began to say that often where there was no wilful rejection of truth saving grace and faith might be vouchsafed  you are charitable she answered in a tone like sarcasm and went on her father a literary man of high ability set aside from work by illhealth thought himself above creeds  he had given his daughter a mans education had read many argumentative books with her and died leaving her liberally and devoutly inclined in the spirit of popes universal prayerjehovah jove or lord  it was all aspiration to the lord of nature the forms adaptations to humanity kaleidoscope shapes of halfcomprehended fragments each with its own beauty and only becoming worthy of reprobation where they permitted moral vices among which she counted intolerance  what she thought reasonablechristianity modified by the worlds progresswas her tenet and she had no scruple in partaking in any act of worship while naturally conscientious and loving all the virtues she viewed the terrors of religion as the scourge of the grovelling and superstitious or if suffering existed at all it could be only as expiation conducting to a condition of high intellect and perfect morality  no other view least of all that of a vicarious atonement seemed to her worthy of the beneficence of the god whom she had set up for herself  thus had she rested for twenty years but of late she had been dissatisfied  living with phoebe though the child was not naturally intellectual there was no avoiding the impression that what she acted and rested on was substantial truth  the same with others said miss fennimore meaning her auditor himself  and again i cannot but feel that devotion to any system of faith is the restraint that bertha is deficient in and that this is probably owing to my own tone  these examples have led me to go over the former ground in the course of the present spring and it has struck me that if the divine being be not the mere abstraction i once supposed it is consistent to believe that he has a character and willindividuality in shortso that there might be one single revelation of absolute truth  i have not thoroughly gone through the subject but i hope to do so and when i mark what i can only call a supernatural influence on an individual character i view it as an evidence in favour of the system that produced it  my exposition of my opinions shocks you i knew it would  but knowing this and thinking it possible that an undoubting believer might have influenced bertha are you willing to trust your sisters to me  let me ask one questionwhy was this explanation never offered before to those who had more right to decide  my tenets have seldom been the subject of inquiry  when they have i have concealed nothing and twice have thus missed a situation  but these things are usually taken for granted and i never imagined it my duty to volunteer my religious sentiments since i never obtruded them i gave no scandal by objecting to any form of worship and concerned myself with the moral and intellectual not the religious being  could you reach the moral without the religious  i should tell you that i have seldom reared a pupil from childhood mine have been chiefly from fifteen to eighteen whose parents required their instruction not education from me and till i came here i never fully beheld the growth and development of character  i found that whereas all i could do for phoebe was to give her method and information leaving alone the higher graces elsewhere derived with bertha my efforts were inadequate to supply any motive for overcoming her natural defects and i believe that association with a person of my sceptical habit has tended to prevent phoebes religion from influencing her sister  this is the reason you tell me  partly and likewise because i esteem you very differently from my former employers and know that your views for your sisters are not like those of the persons with whom i have been accustomed to deal  you know that i have no power  it rests entirely with my brother and mr crabbe  i am perfectly aware of it but i could not allow myself to be forced on your sisters by any family arrangement contrary to the wishes of that member of it who is most qualified to judge for them  thank you miss fennimore i will treat you as openly as you have treated me  i have often felt indignant that my sisters should be exposed to any risk of having their faith shaken and this morning i almost hoped to hear that you did not consent to mervyns scheme  but what you have said convinces me that whatever you may have been previously you are more likely to strengthen and confirm them in all that is good than half the people they would meet  i know that it would be a heavy affliction to phoebe to lose so kind a friend it might drive her from the home to which she clings and separate bertha at least from her and under the circumstances i cannot wish you to leave the poor girls at present  he spoke rather confusedly but there was more consent in manner than words  thank you she replied fervently  i cannot tell you what it would cost me to part with phoebe my living lesson  only let the lesson be still unconscious  i would not have it otherwise for worlds  the calm reliance that makes her a ministering spirit is far too lovely to be ruffled by a hint of the controversies that weary my brain  if it be effect of credulity the effects are more beauteous than those of clear eyesight  you will not always think it credulity  there would be great rest in being able to accept all that you and she do miss fennimore answered with a sigh in finding an unchanging answer to what is truth  yet even your gospel leaves that question unanswered  unanswered to pilate but those who are true find the truth i verily trust that your eyes will become cleared to find it  miss fennimore you know that i am unready and weak in argument and you have often left me no refuge but my positive conviction but i can refer you to those who are strong  if i can help you by carrying your difficulties to others or by pointing out books i should rejoice  you cannot argueyou can only act said miss fennimore smiling as a message called him away  the schoolroom had been left undisturbed for the sisters were otherwise occupied  by mr fulmorts will the jewels excepting certain mervyn heirlooms were to be divided between the daughters and their two ladyships thought this the best time for their choice though as yet they could not take possession  phoebe would have given the world that the sets had been appropriated so that mervyn and mr crabbe should not have had to make her miserable by fighting her battles insisting on her choosing and then overruling her choice as not of sufficiently valuable articles while bertha profited by the lesson in harpyhood and regarded all claimed by the others as so much taken from herself and poor maria clasped on every bracelet one by one threaded every ring on her fingers and caught the same lustre on every diamond delighting in the grand exhibition and in her own share which by general consent included all that was clumsy and illset  no one had the heart to disturb her but phoebe felt that the poor thing was an eyesore to them all and was hardly able to endure augustas compliment after all phoebe she is not so bad you may make her tolerably presentable for the country  lady acton patronized bertha in opposition to phoebe and sir bevil was glad to have one sister to whom he could be goodnatured without molestation  the young lady heartily weary of the monotony of home was much disappointed at the present arrangement phoebe had become the envied elder sister instead of the companion in misfortune and juliana was looked on as the sympathizing friend who would fain have opened the prison doors that phoebe closed against her by making all that disturbance about maria  it is all humbug about maria said juliana  much phoebe will let her stand in her way when she wants to come to london for the seasonbut ill not take her out i promise her  but you will take me cried bertha  youll not leave me in this dismal hole always  never fear bertha  this plan wont last six months  mervyn and phoebe will get sick of one another and augusta will be ready to take her inshe is pining for an errand girl  ill not go there to read cookery books and meet old fogies  you will have me juliana and we will have such fun together  when you are come out perhapsand you must cure that stammer  i shall die of dulness before then  if i could only go to school  i wouldnt be you with maria for your most lively companion  it is much worse than when we used to go down into the drawingroom now we never see any one but miss charlecote and phoebe is getting exactly like her  what all her sanctimonious ways  i thought so  and to make it more aggravating miss fennimore is going to get religious too  she made me read all butlers analogy and wants to put me into paley and she is always running after robert  middleaged governesses always do run after young clergymenespecially the most outres  and now she snaps me up if i say anything the least comprehensive or speculative or if i laugh at the conventionalities phoebe learns at the holt  yesterday i said that the progress of common sense would soon make people cease to connect dulness with mortality or to think a serious mistiness the sole evidence of respect and i was caught up as if it were high treason  you must not get out of bounds in your talk bertha or sound unfeeling  i cant help being original said bertha  i must evolve my ideas out of my individual consciousness and assert my independence of thought  juliana laughed not quite following her sisters metaphysical tone but satisfied that it was antiphoebe she answered by observing an intolerable fuss they do make about that girl  and she is not a bit clever continued bertha  i can do a translation in half the time she takes and have got far beyond her in all kinds of natural philosophy  she flatters mervyn thats the thing but she will soon have enough of that  i hope he wont get her into some dreadful scrape thats all  what sort of scrape asked bertha gathering from the smack of the hope that it was something exciting  oh you are too much of a chit to knowbut i say bertha write to me and let me know whom mervyn brings to the house  with somewhat the like injunction only directed to a different quarter robert likewise left beauchamp  as he well knew would be the case nothing in his own circumstances was changed by his mothers death save that he no longer could call her inheritance his home  she had made no will and her entire estate passed to her eldest son from whom robert parted on terms of defiance rather understood than expressed  he took leave of his birthplace as one never expecting to return thither and going for his last hour at hiltonbury to miss charlecote poured out to her as many of his troubles as he could bear to utter  and said he i have given my approval to the two schemes that i most disapproved beforehandto mervyns giving my sisters a home and to miss fennimores continuing their governess  what will come of it  do not repent robert was the answer  depend upon it the great danger is in rashly meddling with existing arrangements especially by a strain of influence  it is what the young are slow to learn but experience brings it home  with you to watch them i will fear the less  miss charlecote wondered whether any disappointment of his own added to his depression and if he thought of lucilla    chapter xviii       my sister is not so defenceless left     as you imagine  she has a hidden strength     which you remember notcomus  phoebe was left to the vacancy of the orphaned house to a blank where her presence had been gladness and to relief more sad than pain in parting with her favourite brother and seeing him out of danger of provoking or being provoked  to have been the cause of strife and object of envy weighed like guilt on her heart and the tempest that had tossed her when most needing peace and soothing left her sore and suffering  she did not nurse her grief and was content that her mother should be freed from the burthen of existence that had of late been so heavy but the missing the cherished recipient of her care was inevitable and she was not of a nature to shake off dejection readily nor to throw sorrow aside in excitement  mervyn felt as though he had caught a lark and found it droop instead of singing  he was very kind almost oppressively so he rode or drove with her to every ruin or view esteemed worth seeing ordered books for her and consulted her on improvements that pained her by the very fact of change  she gave her attention sweetly and gratefully was always at his call and amused his evenings with cards or music but she felt herself dull and sad and saw him disappointed in her  then she tried bringing in bertha as entertainment for both but it was a downright failure  bertha was far too sharp and pert for an elder brother devoid both of wit and temper and the only consequence was that she fathomed his shallow acquirements in literature and the natural sciences and he pronounced her to be eaten up with conceit and the most intolerable child he ever sawan irremediable insult to a young woman of fifteen nor could bertha be brought forward without disappointing maria whose presence mervyn would not endure and thus phoebe was forced to yield the point and keep in the background the appendages only tolerated for her sake  greatly commiserating berthas weariness of the schoolroom she tried to gratify the governess and please her sisters by resuming her studies but the motive of duty and obedience being gone these were irksome to a mind naturally meditative and practical and she found herself triumphed over by bertha for forgetting whether lucca were guelf or ghibelline putting oolite below red sandstone or confusing the definition of ozone  she liked bertha to surpass her but inattention she regarded as wrong in itself as well as a bad example and her apologies were so hearty as quite to affect miss fennimore  mervyns attentions wore off with the days of seclusion  by the third week he was dining out by the fourth he was starting for goodwood half inviting phoebe to come with him and assuring her that it was just what she wanted to put her into spirits again  poor phoebewhen mr henderson talking to miss fennimore and bertha at the same time insisting on decandolles system to miss charlecote had seemed to create a distressing whirl and confusion  miss fennimore smiled both with pleasure and amusement as phoebe asked her permission to walk to the holt and be fetched home by the carriage at night  dont laugh at me said phoebe  i am so glad to have some ones leave to ask  i will not laugh my dear but i will not help you to reverse our positions  it is better we should both be accustomed to them  it seems selfish to take the carriage for myself said phoebe but i think i have rather neglected miss charlecote for mervyn and i believe she would like to have me alone  the solitude of the walk was a great boon and there was healing in the power of silencethe repose of not being forced to be lively  summer flowers had passed but bryony mantled the bushes in luxuriant beauty and kingly teazles raised their diademed heads and exultingly stretched forth their sceptred arms  purple heather mixed with fragrant thyme blue harebells and pale bents of quivergrass edged the path and thistledown drifting from the chalk uplands lay like snow in the hollows or danced like living things on the path before her  a brood of goldfinches with merry twitter and flashing wings flitted round a tall milk thistle with variegated leaves and a little farther on just at the opening of a glade from the path she beheld a huge dragonfly banded with green black and gold poised on wings invisible in their rapid motion and hawking for insects  she stood to watch collecting materials to please miss charlecote and make a story for maria  stand still  he is upon you  she saw miss charlecote a few yards off nearly on allfours in the thymy grass  only a grasshopper  ive only once seen such a fellow  he makes portentous leaps  there on your flounce  i have him  no  he went right over you  ive got him under my handkerchief  put your hand in my pockettake out a little widemouthed bottle  thats it  get in sir it is of no use to bite  theres an airhole in the cork  isnt he a beauty  o the lovely green  what saws he wears on his thighs  see the delicate pink lining  what horns and a quaint face like a horses  the appearance of them is as the appearance of horses  not that this is a locust only a gryllus happily for us  what is the difference  long or short horns since bertha is not here to make me call them antennae  i must take him home to draw as soon as i have gathered some willow for my puss  you are coming home with me  i meant to drink tea with you and be sent for in the evening  good child  i was almost coming to you but i was afraid of mervyn how has it been my dear  phoebes he is very kind was allowed to stand for the present and honora led the way by a favourite path which was new to phoebe making the circuit of the holt sometimes dipping into a hollow over which the lesser scabious cast a tint like the gray of a cloud sometimes rising on a knoll so as to look down on the rounded tops of the trees following the undulations of the grounds and beyond them the green valley winding stream and harvest fields melting into the chalk downs on the horizon to phoebe all had the freshness of novelty with the charm of familiarity and without the fatigue of admiration required by the showplaces to which mervyn had taken her  presently miss charlecote opened the wicket leading to an oak coppice  there was hardly any brushwood  the ground was covered with soft grass and round elastic cushions of gray lichen  there were a few brackens and here and there the crimson midsummer men but the copsewood consisted of the redundant shoots of the old gnarled knotted stumps covered with handsome foliage of the pale seagreen of later summer and the leaves far exceeding in size those either of the sapling or the fullsized treevigorous playfulness of the poor old wounded stocks  ah said honor pausing here i found my purple emperor sunning himself his glorious wings wide open looking black at first but turning out to be of purplevelvet of the opaque mysterious beauty which seems nobler than mere lustre  did you keep him  i thought that was against your principles  i only mocked him by trying to paint him  he was mine because he came to delight me with the pleasure of having seen him and the remembrance of him that pervades the path  it was just where humfrey always told me the creatures might be found  was mr charlecote fond of natural history asked phoebe shyly  not as natural history but he knew bird beast insect and tree with a friendly hearty intimacy such as cockney writers ascribe to peasants but which they never have  while he used the homeliest names a dishwasher for a wagtail cuckoos breadandcheese for woodsorrel partly i believe to tease me he knew them thoroughly nests haunts and all  phoebe could not help quoting the old lines he prayeth well that loveth well both man and bird and beast  yes and some persons have a curious affinity with the gentle and good in creationwho can watch and even handle a birds nest without making it be deserted whom bees do not sting and horses dogs and cats love so as to reveal their best instincts in a way that seems fabulous  in spite of the lyra innocentium i think this is less often the case with children than with such grown people aslike your guardian phoebehave kept something of the majesty and calmness of innocence  phoebe was all in a glow with the pleasure of hearing him so called but bashful under that very delight she said perhaps part of solomons wisdom was in loving these things since he knew the plants from the cedar to the hyssop  and spoke of nature so beautifully in his song but i am afraid as he grew old he must have lost his healthful pleasure in them when he was lifted up  or did he only make them learning and ornament instead of a joy and devotion said phoebe thinking of the difference between berthas love and miss charlecotes  nor does he say that he found vanity in them though he did in his own gardens and pools of water  no the longer i live the more sure i am that these things are meant for our solace and minor help through the trials of life  i assure you phoebe that the crimson leaf of a herbrobert in the hedge has broken a strain of fretful repining and it is one great blessing in these pleasures that one never can exhaust them  phoebe saw that miss charlecote was right in her own case when on coming in the grasshoppers name and history were sought and there followed an exhibition of the puss for whom the willow had been gathered namely a grassgreen caterpillar with a kittens face a curious upright head and shoulders and two purple tails whence on irritation two pink filaments protrudedlashes for the ichneumons as honora explained  the lonely womans interest in her quaint pet showed how thickly are strewn round us many a calm and innocent mode of solace and cheerfulness if we knew but how to avail ourselves of it  honora had allowed the conversation to be thus desultory and indifferent thinking that it gave greater rest to phoebe and it was not till the evening was advancing that she began to discharge herself of an urgent commission from robert by saying phoebe i want you to do something for me  there is that little dames school in your hamlet  it is too far off for me to look after i wish you would  robin has been writing to me about parish work said phoebe sadly perhaps i ought but i dont know how and i cant bear that any change in our ways should be observed and the tears came more speedily than honor had expected  dear child she said there is no need for that feeling  parish work at least in a lay family must depend on the amount of home duty  in the last years of my dear mothers life i had to let everything go and i know it is not easy to resume still less to begin but you will be glad to have done so and will find it a great comfort  if it be my duty i must try said phoebe dejectedly and i suppose it is  will you come and show me what to do  i never went into a cottage in my life  i have spoken too soon thought honor yet robert urged me and besides the evil of neglecting the poor the work will do her good but it breaks ones heart to see this meek mournful obedience  while we are alone continued phoebe i can fix times and do as i please but i cannot tell what mervyn may want me to do when he is at home  do you expect that he will wish you to go out with him asked honora  not this autumn she answered but he finds it so dull at home that i fully expect he will have his friends to stay with him  phoebe let me strongly advise you to keep aloof from your brothers friends  when they are in the house live entirely in the schoolroom if you begin at once as a matter of course he will see the propriety and acquiesce  you are not vexed  thank you i believe it is all right  robert will be the more at ease about us  i only do not like to act as if i distrusted mervyn  it would not be discreet for any girl so young as you are to be entertaining her brothers sporting friends  you could hardly do so without acquiring the same kind of reputation as my poor lucys rashe which he would not wish  thank you said phoebe more heartily  you have shown me the way out of a difficulty  i need not go into company at all this winter and after that only with our old country neighbours  honora was infinitely relieved at having bestowed this piece of advice on which she had agreed with robert as the only means of insuring phoebes being sheltered from society that mervyn might not esteem so bad for his sister as they did  the quietness of mervyns absence did much for the restoration of phoebes spirits  the dames school was not delightful to her she had not begun early enough in life for ease but she did her tasks there as a duty and was amply rewarded by the new enjoyment thus afforded to maria the importance of being surrounded by a ring of infants teaching the alphabet guiding them round the gooseberry bush or leading their songs and hymns was felicity indescribable to maria  she learnt each name and with the reiteration that no one could endure save phoebe and faithful lieschen rehearsed the individual alphabetical acquirements of every one she painted pictures for them hemmed pinafores and was happier than she had ever been in her life as well as less fretful and more manageable and she even began to develop more sense and intelligence in this direction than she had seemed capable of under the dreary round of lessons past her comprehension  it was a great stimulus to phoebe and spurred her to personal parish work going beyond the soup and subscriptions that might have bounded her charities for want of knowing better  of course the worst and most plausible people took her in and miss charlecote sometimes scolded sometimes laughed at her but the beginning was made and robert was pleased  mervyn did bring home some shooting friends but he made no difficulties as to the seclusion that miss charlecote had recommended for his sister accepting it so easily that phoebe thought he must have intended it from the first  from that time he was seldom at home without one or more guestsan arrangement that kept the young ladies chiefly to the west wing and always when in the garden forced them to be on their guard against stumbling upon smoking gentlemen  it was a latehoured noisy company and the sounds that reached the sisters made the younger girls curious and the governess anxious  perhaps it was impossible that girls of seventeen and fifteen should not be excited by the vicinity of moustaches and beards whom they were bidden to avoid and even the alternate french and german which miss fennimore enforced on bertha more strongly than ever merely produced the variety of her descanting on their knebelbarten or on lheure a guelle les voix de ces messieursla entonnaient sur le grand escalier till miss fennimore declared that she would have latin and greek talked if there were no word for a gentleman in either  there were always stories to be told of berthas narrow escapes of being overtaken by them in garden or corridor till maria infected by the panic used to flounder away as if from a beast of prey and being as tall as and considerably stouter than phoebe with the shuffling gait of the imbecile would produce a volume of sound that her sister always feared might attract notice and irritate mervyn  honora charlecote tried to give pleasure to the sisters by having them at the holt and would fain have treated bertha as one of the inherited godchildren  but bertha proved by reference to the brass tablet that she could not be godchild to a man who died three years before her birth and it was then perceived that his sponsorship had been to an elder bertha who had died in infancy of water on the head and whom her parents in their impatience of sorrow had absolutely caused to be forgotten  such a delusion in the exact phoebe could only be accounted for by her tenderness to mr charlecote and it gave bertha a subject of triumph of which she availed herself to the utmost  she had imbibed a sovereign contempt for miss charlecotes capacity and considered her as embodying the passive individual who is to be instructed or confuted in a scientific dialogue  so she lost no occasion of triumphantly denouncing all cataclysms of the globe past or future of resolving all nature into gases or arguing upon dualitya subject that fortunately usually brought on her hesitation of speech a misfortune of which miss fennimore and phoebe would unscrupulously avail themselves to change the conversation  the bad taste and impertinence were quite as apparent to the governess as to the sister and though bertha never admitted a doubt of having carried the day against the old world prejudices yet miss fennimore perceived not only that miss charlecotes notions were not of the contracted and unreasonable order that had been ascribed to her but that liberality in her pupil was more uncandid narrow and selfsufficient than was credulity in miss charlecote  honor was more amused than annoyed at these discussions she was sorry for the silly conceited girl though not in the least offended nor disturbed but phoebe and miss fennimore considered them such an exposure that they were by no means willing to give bertha the opportunity of launching herself at her senior  the state of the household likewise perplexed phoebe  she had been bred up to the sight of waste ostentation and extravagance and they did not distress her but her partial authority revealed to her glimpses of dishonesty detected falsehoods destroyed her confidence in the housekeeper her attempts at charities to the poor were intercepted her visits to the hamlet disclosed to her some of the effects on the villagers of a vicious disorderly establishment and she understood why a careful mother would as soon have sent her daughter to service at the lowest publichouse as at beauchamp  mervyn had detected one of the footmen in a flagrant act of peculation and had dismissed him but phoebe believed the evil to have extended far more widely than he supposed and made up her mind to entreat him to investigate matters  in vain however she sought for a favourable moment for he was never alone  the intervals between other visitors were filled up by a mr hastings who seemed to have erected himself into so much of the domesticated friend that he had established a bowing and speaking acquaintance with phoebe bertha no longer narrated her escapes of encounters with him and being the only one of the gentlemen who ever went to church he often joined the young ladies as they walked back from thence  phoebe heartily wished him gone for he made her brother inaccessible she only saw mervyn when he wanted her to find something for him or to give her a message and if she ventured to say that she wanted to speak to him he promisedsome time or otherwhich always proved sine die  he was looking very ill his complexion very much flushed and his hand heated and unsteady and she heard through lieschen of his having severe morning headaches and fits of giddiness and depression but these seemed to make him more unable to spare mr hastings as if life would not be endurable without the billiards that she sometimes heard knocking about half the night  however the anniversary of mr fulmorts death would bring his executor to clear off one branch of his business and mervyns friends fled before the coming of the grave old lawyer all fixing the period of their departure before christmas  nor could mervyn go with them he must meet mr crabbe and phoebes heart quite bounded at the hope of being able to walk about the house in comfort and say part of what was on her mind to her brother  whose writing is this said phoebe to herself as the letters were given to her two days before the clearance of the house  i ought to know itit is  no  yes indeed it ispoor lucy  where can she be what can she have to say  the letter was dateless and phoebes amaze grew as she read      dear phoebe      you know it is my nature to do odd things so never mind that but     attend to me as one who knows too well what it is to be motherless     and undirected  gossip is longtongued enough to reach me here in     full venom as i know and trust but it makes my blood boil till i     cant help writing a warning that may at least save you pain  i know     you are the snowdrop poor owen used to call you and i know you have     honor charlecote for philosopher and friend but she is nearly as     unsophisticated as yourself and if report say true your brother is     getting you into a scrape  if it is a fact that he has jack hastings     dangling about beauchamp he deserves the lot of my unlucky charteris     cousins  mind what you are about phoebe if the man is there  he     is plausible clever has no end of amusing resources and keeps his     head above water but i know that in no place where there are     womankind has he been received without there having been cause to     repent it  i hope you may be able to laughif not it may be a     wholesome cure to hear that his friends believe him to have secured     one of the heiresses at beauchamp  there phoebe i have said my     say and i fear it is cutting and wounding but it came out of the     love of a heart that has not got rid of some of its old feelings and     that could not bear to think of sorrow or evil tongues busy about     you  that i write for your sake not for my own you may see by my     making it impossible to answer                                                         lucilla sandbrook  if you hold council with honor over thisas if you are wise you willyou may tell her that i am learning gratitude to her  i would ask her pardon if i could without servility  secured one of the heiresses said phoebe to herself  i should like to be able to tell lucy how i can laugh  poor lucy how very kind in her to write  i wonder whether mervyn knows how bad the man is  shall i go to miss charlecote  oh no she is spending two days at moorcroft shall i tell miss fennimore  no i think not it will be wiser to talk to miss charlecote i dont like to tell miss fennimore of lucy  poor lucyshe is always generous  he will soon be gone and then i can speak to mervyn  this secret was not a serious burthen to phoebe though she could not help smiling to herself at the comical notion of having been secured by a man to whom she had not spoken a dozen times and then with the utmost coldness and formality  the next day she approached the letterbag with some curiosity  it contained one for her from her sister juliana a very unusual correspondent and phoebes mind misgave her lest it should have any connection with the hints in lucillas note  but she was little prepared for what she read                                                    acton manor dec 24th      my dear phoebe      although after what passed in july i cannot suppose that the     opinion of your elders can have any effect on your proceedings yet     for the sake of our relationship as well as of regard to     appearances i cannot forbear endeavouring to rescue you from the     consequences of your own folly and obstinacy  nothing better was to     be expected from mervyn but at your age with your pretences to     religion you cannot plead simplicity nor ignorance of the usages of     the world  neither sir bevil nor myself can express our amazement at     your recklessness thus forfeiting the esteem of society and     outraging the opinion of our old friends  to put an end to the     impropriety we will at once receive you here overlooking any     inconvenience and we shall expect you all three on tuesday under     charge of miss fennimore who seems to have been about as fit as     maria to think for you  it is too late to write to mervyn tonight     but he shall hear from us tomorrow as well as from your guardian     to whom sir bevil has written you had better bring my jewels and     the buhl clock from my mothers mantelshelf which i was to have     mrs brisbane will pack them  tell bertha with my love that she     might have been more explicit in her correspondence                                                  your affectionate sister                                                           juliana acton  when miss fennimore entered the room she found phoebe sitting like one petrified only just able to hold out the letter and murmurwhat does it mean  imagining that it could only contain something fatal about robert miss fennimore sprang at the paper and glanced through it while phoebe again faintly asked what have i done  lady acton is pleased to be mysterious said the governess  the kind sister she always was  dont say that exclaimed phoebe rallying  it must be something shocking for sir bevil thinks so too and the tears sprang forth  he will never think anything unkind of you my dear said miss fennimore with emphasis  it must be about mr hastings said phoebe gathering recollection and confidence  i did not like to tell you yesterday but i had a letter from poor lucy sandbrook  some friends of that man mr hastings have set it about that he is going to be married to me and phoebe laughed outright  if juliana has heard it i dont wonder that she is shocked because you know miss charlecote said it would never do for me to associate with those gentlemen and besides lucy says that he is a very bad man  i shall write to juliana and say that i have never had anything to do with him and he is going away tomorrow and mervyn must be told not to have him back again  that will set it all straight at acton manor  phoebe was quite herself again  she was too well accustomed to gratuitous unkindness and reproaches from juliana to be much hurt by them and perceiving as she thought where the misconception lay had no fears that it would not be cleared up  so when she had carefully written her letter to her sister she dismissed the subject until she should be able to lay it before miss charlecote dwelling more on honors pleasure on hearing of lucy than on the more personal matter  miss fennimore looking over the letter had deeper misgivings  it seemed to her rather to be a rebuke for the whole habit of life than a warning against an individual and she began to doubt whether even the seclusion of the west wing had been a sufficient protection in the eyes of the family from the contamination of such society as mervyn received or was it a plot of lady actons malevolence for hunting phoebe away from her home  miss fennimore fell asleep uneasy and perplexed and in her dreams beheld phoebe as the lady in comus fixed in her chair and resolute against a cup effervescing with carbonic acid gas proffered by jack hastings who thereupon gave it to bertha as she lay back in the dentists chair and both becoming transformed into pterodactyles flew away while miss fennimore was vainly trying to summon the brothers by electric telegraph  there was a whole bevy of letters for phoebe the following morning and first a kind sensible one from her guardian much regretting to learn that mr fulmorts guests were undesirable inmates for a house where young ladies resided so that though he had full confidence in miss fulmorts discretion and understood that she had never associated with the persons in question he thought her residence at home ought to be reconsidered and should be happy to discuss the point on coming to beauchamp so soon as he should have recovered from an unfortunate fit of the gout which at present detained him in town  miss fulmort might however be assured that her wishes should be his chief consideration and that he would take care not to separate her from miss maria  that promise and the absence of all mention of lucillas object of dread gave phoebe courage to open the missive from her eldest sister      my dear phoebe      i always told you it would never answer and you see i was right     if mervyn will invite that horrid man whatever you may do no one     will believe that you do not associate with him and you may never     get over it  i am telling everybody what children you are quite in     the schoolroom but nothing will be of any use but your coming away     at once and appearing in society with me so you had better send the     children to acton manor and come to me next week  if there are any     teal in the decoy bring some and ask mervyn where he got that     bartons dry champagne                                                  your affectionate sister                                                       augusta bannerman  she had kept roberts letter to the last as refreshment after the rest                                                  st matthews dec 18th      dear phoebe      i am afraid this may not be your first intimation of what may vex     and grieve you greatly and what calls for much cool and anxious     judgment  in you we have implicit confidence and your adherence to     miss charlecotes kind advice has spared you all imputation though     not i fear all pain  you may perhaps not know how disgraceful     are the characters of some of the persons whom mervyn has collected     about him  i do him the justice to believe that he would shelter you     from all intercourse with them as carefully as i should but i cannot     forgive his having brought them beneath the same roof with you  i     fear the fact has done harm in our own neighbourhood  people imagine     you to be associating with mervyns crew and a monstrous report is     abroad which has caused bevil acton to write to me and to crabbe  we     all agree that this is a betrayal of the confidence that you     expressed in mervyn and that while he chooses to make his house a     scene of dissipation no seclusion can render it a fit residence for     women or girls  i fear you will suffer much in learning this     decision for mervyns sake as well as your own  poor fellow if he     will bring evil spirits about him good angels must depart  i would     come myself but that my presence would embitter mervyn and i could     not meet him properly  i am writing to miss charlecote  if she     should propose to receive you all at the holt immediately until     crabbes most inopportune gout is over you had better go thither at     once  it would be the most complete vindication of your conduct that     could be offered to the county and would give time for considering     of establishing you elsewhere and still under miss fennimores care     for berthas sake as well as your own you must be prepared to leave     home and resign yourself to be passive in the decision of those bound     to think for you by which means you may avoid being included in     mervyns anger  do not distress yourself by the fear that any blame     can attach to you or to miss fennimore i copy bevils     expressionsassure phoebe that though her generous confidence may     have caused her difficulties no one can entertain a doubt of her     guileless intention and maidenly discretion  if it would not make     further mischief i would hasten to fetch her but if she will do me     the honour to accept her sisters invitation i hope to do all in my     power to make her happy and mark my esteem for her  these are his     words but i suppose you will hardly prefer acton manor though     should the holt fail us you might send the other two to the manor     and come to alburystreet as augusta wishes when we could consult     together on some means of keeping you united and retaining miss     fennimore who must not be thrown over as it would be an injury to     her prospects  tell her from me that i look to her for getting you     through this unpleasant business                                                     your ever affectionate                                                           r m fulmort  phoebe never spoke but handed each sheet as she finished it to her governess  promise me phoebe said miss fennimore as she came to roberts last sentence that none of these considerations shall bias you  make no struggle for me but use me as i may be most serviceable to you  phoebe instead of answering kissed and clung to her  what do you think of doing asked the governess  nothing said phoebe  you looked as if a thought had occurred to you  i only recollected the words your strength is to sit still said phoebe and thought how well they agreed with roberts advice to be passive  mr crabbe has promised not to separate us and i will trust to that  mervyn was very kind in letting us stay here but he does not want us and will not miss usand with those words quiet as they were came a gush of irrepressible tears just as a step resounded outside the door was burst open and mervyn hurried in purple with passion and holding a bundle of letters crushed together in his hand  i say he hoarsely cried whats all this  who has been telling infamous tales of my house  we cannot tell began phoebe  do you know anything of this he interrupted fiercely turning on miss fennimore  nothing sir  the letters which your sister has received have equally surprised and distressed me  then they have set on you phoebe  the whole pack in full cry as if it mattered to them whether i chose to have the old gentleman in the house so long as he did not meddle with you  i beg your pardon mr fulmort interposed the governess the remonstrance is quite just  had i been aware of the character of some of your late guests i could not have wished your sisters to remain in the house with them  are these your sentiments phoebe he asked sternly  i am afraid they ought to be she sadly answered  silly child so this pack of censorious women and parsons have frightened you into giving me up  sisters do not give up brothers mervyn  you know how i thank you for having me here but i could not amuse you or make it pleasant to you so there must be an end of it  so they hunt you out to be bullied by juliana or slaved to death by augusta which is it to be  or maybe robert has got his sisterhood cut and dried for you only mind he shant make away with your 30000 pounds while i live to expose those popish tricks  for shame mervyn cried phoebe all in a glow i will not hear robert so spoken of he is always kind and good and has taught me every right thing i know  oh very well and pray when does he summon you from among the ungodly will the next train be soon enough  dont mervyn  your friends go today dont they  mr crabbe does not desire any change to be made before he comes to see about it  may we not stay till that time and spend our christmas together  you must ask robert and juliana since you prefer them  no said phoebe with spirit it is right to attend to my elder sisters and robert has always helped and taught me and i must trust his guidance as i always have done  and i trust you too mervyn  you never thought you were doing us any harm  i may trust you still she added with so sweet and imploring a look that mervyn gave an odd laugh with some feeling in it  harm  great harm i have done this creature eh he said with his hand on her shoulder  few could do her harm mr fulmort said the governess but report may have done some mischief  who cares for report  i say phoebe we will laugh at them all  you pluck up a spirit stay with me and well entertain all the county and then get some great swell to bring you out in town and see what juliana will say  i will stay with you while you are alone and mr crabbe lets me said phoebe  old fool of a fellow  why couldnt my father have made me your guardian and then there would have been none of this row  one would think i had had her down to act barmaid to the fellows  and you never spoke to one did you phoebe  only now and then to mr hastings  i could not help it after the day he came into the study when i was copying for you  ah well that is nothingnobody minds old jack  i shall let them all know you were as safe as a turks wife in a harem and maybe old crabbe will hear reason if we get him down here alone without a viper at each ear as he had last time  with which words mervyn departed and miss fennimore exclaimed in some displeasure you can never think of remaining phoebe  i am afraid not said phoebe mervyn does not seem to know what is proper for us and i am too young to judge so i suppose we must go  i wish i could make him happy with music or books or anything a woman could do  if you please i think i must go over to the holt  i cannot settle to anything just yet and i shall answer my letters better when i have seen miss charlecote  in fact phoebe felt herself going to her other guardian but as she left the room bertha came hurriedly in from the garden with a plaid thrown round her  whatwhatwhats the matter she hastily asked following phoebe to her room  is there an end of all these mysteries  yes said phoebe miss fennimore is ready for you  as if that were all i wanted to know  do you think i did not hear mervyn storming like a lion  i am sorry you did hear said phoebe for it was not pleasant  it seems that it is not thought proper for us to live here while mervyn has so many gentlemanguests so with a sigh you will have your wish bertha  they mean us to go away  it is not my wish now said bertha pulling pins in and out of phoebes pincushion  i am not the child i was in the summer  dont go phoebe i know you can get your way if you try for it  i must try to be put in the right way bertha that is all i want  and you are going to the holt for the most precise narrowminded way you can get  i wish i were in your place phoebe  scarcely had phoebe driven from the door before she saw miss charlecote crossing the grass on foot and after the interchange of a few words it was agreed to talk while driving on towards elverslope  each was laden with the same subject for not only had honor heard from robert but during her visit to moorcroft she had become enlightened on the gossip that seldom reached the holt and had learnt that the whole neighbourhood was scandalized at the beauchamp doings and was therefore shy of taking notice of the young people there  she had been incredulous at first then extremely shocked and distressed and though in part convinced that more than she guessed had passed beyond the west wing she had come primed with a representation which she cautiously administered to phoebe the girl was more indignant on her brothers account than alarmed on her own  if that is the way the raymonds talk of mervyn cried she no wonder they made their niece cast him off and drive him to despair  it was no unkindness of the raymonds my dear  they were only sorry for you  i do not want them to be sorry for me they ought to be sorry for mervyn said phoebe almost petulantly  perhaps they are said honor  it was only in kindness that they spoke and they had almost anticipated my explanation that you were kept entirely apart  every gentleman hereabouts who has been at beauchamp has declared such to be the case  i should think so said phoebe mervyn knows how to take care of us better than that  but all ladies do not seem willing to believe as much shame on them said honor and tell me phoebe have people called on you  not many but i have not called on them since they left their cards of inquiry  i had been thinking whether i ought  we will consider  perhaps i had better take you round some day but i have been a very remiss protector my poor child if all be true that i am told of some of mervyns friends  it was an insult to have them under the same roof with you  will you look at this letter said phoebe  it is very kindit is from lucy  these plain words alone occurred to phoebe as a preparation for a letter that was sure to move miss charlecote greatly if only by the slight of not having written to her the most obvious person  but the flighty generosity and deep though inconsistent feeling were precious and the proud relenting of the message at the end touched honor with hope  they laughed at the report that had elicited lucillas letter but the reserve of the warning about mr hastings coming from the once unscrupulous girl startled honor even more than what she had heard at moorcroft  was the letter to be answered  yes by all means cried honor catching at any link of communication  she could discover lucillas address and was sure that even brief thanks and explanations from phoebe would be good for lucy  like miss fennimore honor was surprised by phoebes composure under her share of the evil report  the strictures which would have been dreadful to an older person seemed to fly over her innocent head their force either uncomprehended or unfelt  she yielded implicitly to the propriety of the change but her grief was at the family quarrel the leaving home and the unmerited degree of blame cast on mervyn not the aspersions on herself although as honor became vexed at her calmness she withheld none of them in the desire to convince her of the expediency of leaving beauchamp at once for the holt  no even though this was roberts wish phoebe could still not see the necessity as long as mervyn should be alone  if he should bring any of his discreditable friends she promised at once to come to miss charlecote but otherwise she could perceive no reason for grieving him and astonishing the world by implying that his sisters could not stay in his house  she thought him unwell too and wished to watch him and on the whole did not regret her guardians gout which would give her a little more time at home and put off the discussion till there should be less anger  is this weak is it childish indifference thought honor or is it a spirit superior to the selfish personal dread that would proclaim its own injured innocence by a vehement commotion  phoebe rejoiced that she had secured her interview with her friend for when the guests were gone mervyn claimed her whole attention and was vexed if she were not continually at his back  after their teteatete dinner he kept her sitting over the dessert while he drank his wine she tried this opportunity of calling his attention to the frauds of the servants but he merely laughed his mocking laugh at her simplicity in supposing that everybodys servants did not cheat  miss charlecotes dont  dont they  haha  why shes the very mark for imposition and hypocrisy into the bargain  phoebe did not believe it but would not argue the point returning to that nearer home  nonsense phoebe he said its only a choice who shall prey upon one and if i have a set that will do it with a civil countenance and let me live out of the spoil ill not be bothered  i cannot think it need go on so  well it wont i shall break up the concern and let the house or something  let the house  oh mervyn i thought you meant to be a county man  let those look to that who have hindered me said mervyn fiercely swallowing one glassful and pouring out another  should you live in london  at jericho for aught i care or any one else  her attempt to controvert this remark brought on a tirade against the whole family which she would not keep up by reply and which ended in moody silence  again she tried to rise but he asked why she could not stay with him five minutes and went on absently pouring out wine and drinking it till as the clock struck nine the bottom of the decanter was reached when he let her lead the way to the drawingroom and there taking up the paper soon fell asleep then awoke at ten at the sound of her moving to go to bed and kept her playing piquet for an hour and a half  an evening or two of this kind convinced phoebe that even with mervyn alone it was not a desirable life  she was less shocked than a girl used to a higher standard at home might have been but that daily bottle and perpetual cards weighed on her imagination and she felt that her younger sisters ought not to grow up to such a spectacle  still her loving heart yearned over mervyn who was very fond of her and consulted her pleasure continually in his own peculiar and selfish way although often exceedingly cross to her as well as to every one else but this illtemper was so visibly the effect of low spirits that she easily endured and forgave it  she saw that he was both unwell and unhappy she could not think what would become of him when the present arrangement should be broken up but could only cling to him as long as she could pity him  it was no wonder that on the sunday honora seeing her enter the church could only help being reminded of the expression of that childsaint of raffaelle wandering alone through the dragonhaunted wood wistful and distressed yet so confident in the unseen guide and guardian that she treads down evils and perils in innocence unconscious of her full danger and of their full blackness    chapter xix       close within us we will carry strong collected calm and brave     the true panoply of quiet which the bad world never gave     very serpents in discretion yet as guileless as the dove     lo obedience is the watchword and the countersign is love                                                                w g tupper  on the next hunting day mervyn took phoebe with him to the meet upon a favourite common towards elverslope where on a fine morning ladies were as apt to be found as hounds and huntsmen so that she would be at no loss for companions when he left her  phoebe rode as she did everything else well quietly and firmly and she looked very young and fresh with her rounded rosy cheeks and chin her fair hair was parted back under a round hat her slenderly plump figure appeared to advantage mounted on her bright bay and altogether she presented a striking contrast to her brother  she had not seen him in hunting costume for nearly a year and she observed with pain how much he had lost his good looks his wellmade youthful air was passing away and his features were becoming redder and coarser but he was in his best humour goodnatured and as nearly gay as he ever was and phoebe enjoyed her fourmiles ride in the beauty of a warm decembers day the sun shining on dewy hedges and robins and thrushes trying to treat the weather like spring as they sang amid the rich stores of coral fruit that hung as yet untouched on every hawthorn or eglantine  the ladies mustered strong on the smooth turf of the chalk down bordering the copse which was being drawn  phoebe looked out for acquaintance but a few gentlemen coming up to greet her she did not notice as mervyn did that the girls with whom he had wished to leave her had become intent on some doings in the copse and had trotted off with their father  he made his way to the barouche where sat the grande dame of the county exchanged civilities and asked leave to introduce his sister  phoebe who had never seen the lady before thought nothing of the cold distant bow it was for mervyn who knew what her greetings could be to fume and rage inwardly  other acknowledgments passed but no party had approached or admitted phoebe and when the hounds went away she was still riding alone with her brother and a young officer she bade them not to mind her she would ride home with the servant and as all were in motion she had enough to do to hold in her horse while mervyn and his friend dashed forward and soon she found herself alone except for the groom the field were well away over the down the carriages driving off the mounted maidens following the chase as far as the way was fair and ladylike  phoebe had no mind to do so  her isolation made her feel forlorn and brought home miss charlecotes words as to the opinion entertained of her by the world  poor child something like a tear came into her eye and a blush to her cheek but never mind she thought they will believe miss charlecote and she will take care of me  if only mervyn will not get angry and make an uproar  i shall soon be gone away  when shall i come back  she rode up to the highest part of the down for a takeleave gaze  there lay elverslope in its basinlike valley scooped out in the hills with the purple bloom of autumnal haze veiling its red brick and slate there on the other side the copses and arable fields dipped and rose and rose and dipped again till the undulations culminated in the tall firtrees in the holt garden the landmark of the country and on the bare slope to the west beauchamps pillars and pediment made a stately speck in the landscape  home no longer thought phoebe there will be strangers thereand we shall be on the world  oh why cannot mervyn be like robert  how happy we could be  beauchamp had not been a perfect eden in itself but still it had all the associations of the paradise of her guileless childhood and to her the halo around it would always have the radiance of the loving spirit through which she viewed it  the undefined future was hard to bear but she thought of robert and of the promise that neither her sisters nor miss fennimore should be parted from her and tried to rest thankful on that comfort  she had left the down for the turnpike road the sounds of the hunt often reaching her with glimpses of men and dogs in the distance taking a direction parallel with her own  presently a red coat glanced through the hedge of one of the cross lanes as if coming towards the road and as she reached the opening at the end a signal was made to her to stop foreboding some accident she hastily turned up the narrow white muddy lane and was met by an elderly gentleman  dont be alarmed he said kindly only your brother seems rather unwell and i thought i had best see him under your charge  mervyn was by this time in sight advancing slowly and phoebe with rapid thanks rode on to meet him  she knew that dull confused dazzled eye belonged to his giddy fits and did not wonder at the halfuttered murmur rather in the imprecation line with which he spoke but the reel in his saddle terrified her greatly and she was dismayed to see that the gentleman had proceeded into the high road instead of offering further assistance  she presently perceived that the danger of falling was less real than apparent and that her brother could still keep his seat and govern his horse though nearly unable to look or speak  she kept close to him and was much relieved to find that the stranger had not returned to the sport but was leisurely following at some distance behind the groom  never had two miles seemed so long as under her frequent alarms lest mervyn should become unable to keep the saddle but at each moment of terror she heard the pace of the hunter behind quickened to come to her help and if she looked round she met an encouraging sign  when the lodge was reached and mervyn somewhat revived had ridden through the gates she turned back to give her warm thanks  a kind fatherly friendly face looked at her with a sort of compassion as putting aside her thanks the gentleman said quickly yet halfreluctantly have you ever seen him like this before  yes the giddiness often comes on in the morning but never so badly as this  i think it was from the rapid motion  has he had advice  i cannot persuade him to see any one  do you think he ought  i would send at once at the risk of his being angry  does dr martyn attend you  shall i leave a message as i go home  i should be most thankful  it may be nothing but you will be happier that it should be ascertained and with another kindly nod he rode off  mervyn had gone to his room and answered her inquiries at the door with a brief blunt better to be interpreted that he did not wish to be disturbed  she did not see him till dinnertime when he had a sullen headache and was gruff and gloomy  she tried to learn who the friend in need had been but he had been incapable of distinguishing anybody or anything at the moment of the attack and was annoyed at having been followed  what a pottering ass to come away from a run on a fools errand he said  some elverslope spy who will set it about the country that i had been drinking and cast that up to you and then he began to rail against the ladies singly and collectively inconsistently declaring it was phoebes own fault for not having called on them and that he would have augusta to beauchamp give a ball and supper and show whether miss fulmort were a person to be cut  this mode of vindication not being to miss fulmorts taste she tried to avert it by doubts whether augusta could be had and was told that show lady bannerman a bottle of bartons dry champagne and she would come to the worlds end  meantime phoebe must come out tomorrow for a round of visits whereat her heart failed her as a thrusting of herself where she was not welcome but he spoke so fiercely and dictatorially that she reserved her pleading for the morning when he would probably be too inert not to be glad of the escape  at last dr martyns presence in the drawingroom was announced to her she began her explanation with desperate bravery and though the first words were met with a scoffing grunt she found mervyn less displeased than she had fearednay almost glad that the step had been taken though he would not say so and made a great favour of letting her send the physician to him in the diningroom  after a time dr martyn came to tell her that he had found her brothers head and pulse in such a state as to need instant relief by cupping and that the young union doctor had been sent for from the village for the purpose  a constitutional fulness of blood in the head had been aggravated by his mode of life and immediate discipline severe regimen and abstinence from business or excitement were the only means of averting dangerous illness in fact his condition might at any time become exceedingly critical though perseverance in care might possibly prevent all absolute peril  he himself was thoroughly frightened  his own sensations and forebodings seconded the sentence too completely for resistance it was almost a relief to give way and his own method of driving away discomfort had so signally failed that he was willing to resign himself to others  phoebe assisted at the cupping valorously and handily  she had a civil speech from young mr jackson and mervyn as she bade him good night said i cant spare you now phoebe  not till you are better she answered  and so she told miss charlecote and wrote to robert but neither was satisfied  honora said it was unlucky  it might certainly be a duty to nurse mervyn if he were really ill and if he made himself fit company for her but it would not set her straight with the neighbourhood and robert wrote in visible displeasure at this complication of the difficulty  if mervyns habits had disordered his health it did not render his pursuits more desirable for his sisters  if he wanted phoebes attendance let him come to town with her to the bannermans but his ailments must not be made an excuse for detaining her in so unsuitable a position as that into which he had brought her  it was not so kind a letter as phoebe would have claimed from robert and it was the more trying as mervyn deprived of the factitious exhilaration that had kept him up and lowered by treatment was dispirited depressed incapable of being entertained cross at her failures yet exacting of her attendance  he had business at his office in the city that needed his presence so he insisted till the last morning upon going and then owned himself in no state to go farther than the study where he tried to write but found his brain so weak and confused that he could hardly complete a letter and was obliged to push over even the simplest calculation to phoebe  in vain she tried to divert his mind from this perilous exertion he had not taste nor cultivation enough to be interested in anything she could devise and harping upon some one of the unpleasant topics that occupied his thoughts was his only entertainment when he grew tired of cards or backgammon  phoebe sat up late writing to robert a more minute account of mervyns illness which she thought must plead for him and rather sad at heart she had gone to bed and fallen asleep when far on in the night a noise startled her  she did not suspect her own imagination of being to blame except so far as the associations with illness in the house might have recalled the sounds that once had been wont to summon her to her mothers room  the fear that her brother might be worse made her listen till the sounds became matters of certainty  springing to the window her eyes seemed to stiffen with amaze as she beheld in the clear full moonlight on the frosty sward the distinctlytraced shadow of a horse and cart the objects themselves were concealed by a clump of young trees but their forms were distinctly pictured on the turf and the conviction flashed over her that a robbery must be going forward  perils and dangers of this night indeed  one prayer one thought she remembered the great housebell above the attic stairs in the opposite wing at the other end of the gallery which led from the top of the grand staircase where the chief bedroom doors opened and a jet of gas burnt all night on the balustrade  throwing on her dressinggown she sped along the passage and pushing open the swingdoor beheld mervyn at the door of his own room and at the head of the stairs a man in whom she recognized the discarded footman raising a pistol  one swift boundher hand was on the gaspipe  all was darkness save a dim stripe from within the open door of her mothers former dressingroom close to where she stood  she seized the lock drew it close and had turned the key before the hand within had time to wrench round the inner handle  that same instant the flash and report of a pistol made her cry out her brothers name  hollo what did you put out the light for he angrily answered and as she could just distinguish his white shirt sleeves she sprang to him steps went hurriedly down the stairs  gone they both cried at once mervyn with an imprecation on the darkness adding go and ring the bell  ill watch here  she obeyed but the alarm had been given and the house was astir candlelight gleamed abovecries steps and exclamations were heard and she was obliged to hurry down to save herself from being run over two figures had joined mervyn the voice of one proclaiming her as bertha quivering with excitement  in there  my emeralds are in there open the door or he will make off with mymy emeralds  safe my child  dont stand before that door cried miss fennimore pulling phoebe back with a fond eager grasp  here some of you shouted mervyn to the men whose heads appeared behind the herd of maids come and lay hold of the fellow when i unlock the door  the women fell back with suppressed screams and readily made way for the men but they shuffled backed and talked of pistols and the butler suggested the policeman  the policemanhe lives two miles off cried bertha  hell go out of window with my emeralds  unlock the door mervyn  unlock it yourself said mervyn with an impatient stamp of his foot pshaw but thank you as miss fennimore put into his hand his doublebarrelled gun the first weapon she had foundunloaded indeed but even as a club formidable enough to give him confidence to unlock the door and call to the man to give himself up  the servants huddled together like sheep but there was no answer  he called for a light  it was put into his hand by phoebe and as he opened the door was blown out by a stream of cold air from the open window  the thief was gone  everybody was ready to press in and look for him in every impossible place but he had evidently escaped by the leads of the portico beneath not however with my emeraldshe had only attempted the lock of the jewel cabinet  phoebe hurried to see whether maria had been frightened and finding her happily asleep followed the rest of the world downstairs where the servants seemed to be vying with each other in the magnitude of the losses they announced while mervyn was shouting himself hoarse with passionate orders that everything should be left alonedoors windows platechests and allfor the inspection of the police and human nature could not resist lifting up and displaying signs of the robbery every moment in the midst of the storm of vituperation thus excited  mervyn could hardly attend to phoebes mention of the cart but as soon as it reached his senses he redoubled his hot commands to keepers and stablemen to set off in pursuit and called for his horse to ride to elverslope to give information at the police station and telegraph office  phoebe implored him to rest and send a messenger but he roughly bade her not to be so absurd commanded again that nothing should be disturbed or if she would be busy that she should make out a list of all that was missing  grateful indignantly thought miss fennimore as phoebe was left leaning on a pillar in the portico watching him ride away the pale light of the yellow setting moon giving an almost ghostly appearance to her white drapery and wistful attitude  putting an arm round her the governess found her shivering from head to foot and pale and cold as marble her knees knocked together when she walked and her teeth chattered as she strove to smile but her quietness still showed itself in all her movements as she returned into the hall and reached the welcome support of a chair beside the rekindled fire  miss fennimore chafed her hands and she looked up smiled and said thank you  then you were frightened after all phoebe cried bertha triumphantly  was ii dont know said phoebe as in a dream  what when you dont know what you are talking of and are still trembling all over  i cant tell  i think what came on me then was thankfulness  i am sure we may be thankful that our jewels are the only things safe  oh bertha you dont know then that the man was taking aim at mervyn and the shudder returned  there phoebe for the sake of candour and psychology confess your terror  indeed bertha said phoebe with a smile on her tremulous lip it is very odd but i dont think i was afraid there was a feeling of shadowing wings that left no room for terror  that enabled you to think and act asked miss fennimore  i didnt think it came to me said phoebe  pray let me go bertha dear you had better go to bed  pray lie down miss fennimore  she moved slowly away her steps still unsteady and her cheeks colourless but the sweet light of thankfulness on her face while bertha said in her moralizing tone it is a curious study to see phoebe taking her own steady nerves and power of resource for something external to herself and being pious about it  miss fennimore was not gratified by her apt pupils remark  if phoebes conduct do not fill you with reverence both for her and that which actuates her i can only stand astonished she said  bertha turned away and erected her eyebrows  no one could go to bed and before five oclock phoebe came down dressed for the day and set to work with the butler and the inventory of the plate to draw up an account of the losses  not merely the plate in common use was gone but the costly services and ornaments that had been the glory of old mr fulmorts heart and the locks had not been broken but opened with a key the drawingrooms had been rifled of their expensive bijouterie and the foray would have been completely successful had it included the jewels  there were no marks of a violent entrance windows and doors were all fastened as usual with the single exception of the back door which was found ajar but with no traces of having been opened in an unusual manner though the heavy bolts and bars would have precluded an entrance from the outside even with a false key  early in the day mervyn returned with the superintendent of police  he was still too much excited to rest and his heavy tread reechoed from floor to floor as he showed the superintendent round the house calling his sister or the servants to corroborate his statements or help out his account of what he had hardly seen or comprehended  thus he came to phoebe for her version of the affair in the gallery of which he only knew his own sharethe noise that had roused him the sight of the burglar the sudden darkness the report of the pistol and the witness of his dangerthe bulletwas in the wall nearly where his head had been  when phoebe had answered his questions he gazed at her and exclaimedhallo why phoebe it seems that but for you parson robert would be in possession here and burst into a strange nervous laugh ending by coming to her and giving a hearty kiss to her forehead ere hurrying away to report her evidence to the policeman  when all measures had been taken intelligence sent back to the station and a search instituted in every direction mervyn consented to sit down to breakfast but talked instead of eating telling phoebe that even without her recognition of james smithson the former footman the superintendent would have attributed the burglary to a person familiar with the house provided with facsimiles of all the keys except those of the jewels as well as sufficiently aware of the habits of the family to make the attempt just before the jewels were to be removed and when the master was likely to be absent  the appearance of the back door had led to the conclusion that the thieves had been admitted from within a london detective had therefore been sent for who was to come in the guise of a clerk from the distillery bringing down the books to mr fulmort and phoebe was forbidden to reveal his true character to any one but miss fennimore  so virulently did mervyn talk of smithson that phoebe was sorry she had recognized him and became first compassionate then disconcerted and shocked  she rose to leave the room as the only means of silencing him he got up to come after her abusing the law because housebreaking was not a hanging matter his face growing more purple with passion every moment but his steps suddenly failed his exclamation transferred his fury to his own giddiness and phoebe flying to his side was only just in time to support him to a couch  it was the worst attack he had yet had and his doctors coming in the midst of it used prompt measures to relieve him and impressed on both him and his sister that everything would depend on perfect quiet and absence from all disturbance and he was so much exhausted by the reaction of his excitement loss of blood and confusion of head that he attempted little but long fretful sighs when at length he was left to her  after much weariness and discomfort he fell asleep and phoebe ventured to creep quietly out of the library to see miss charlecote who was hearing the nights adventures in the schoolroom  scarcely however had honor had time to embrace the little heroine whose conduct had lost nothing in miss fennimores narration when a message came from elverslope  it was the day of the petty sessions and a notable bad character having been taken up with some suspicious articles upon him the magistrates were waiting for mr fulmort to make out the committal on his evidence  i must go instead said phoebe after considering for a moment  my dear exclaimed honor you do not know how unpleasant it will be  mervyn must sleep said phoebe and if this be an innocent man he ought to be cleared at once  if it be not improper i think i ought to go  may i looking at the governess who suggested her speaking to the superintendent and learning whether her brother had been absolutely summoned  it proved to be only a verbal message and the superintendent urged her going telling her that her evidence would suffice for the present and that she would be the most important witness at the assizeswhich he evidently considered as a great compliment  miss charlecote undertook to go and take care of her young friend and they set off in silence phoebe leaning back with her veil down and honor perceiving that she needed this interval of quiet repose watching her with wonder  had it been honors own case she would have hung back out of dislike to pursuing an enemy and from dread of publicity but these objections had apparently not occurred to the more simple mind only devising how to spare her brother and while honor would have been wretched from distrust of her own accuracy and her habits of imperfect observation would have made her doubt her own senses and memory she honoured phoebes careful training in seeing what she saw and hearing what she heard without cross lights or counter sounds from imagination once phoebe inquired in a low awestruck voice shall i be put on oath  most likely my dear  phoebes hands were pressed together as though in preparation for a religious rite  she was not dismayed but from her strict truth at all times she was the more sensible of the sacredness and solemnity of the great appeal  an offence on so large a scale had brought a throng of loiterers to the door of the townhall and honor felt nervous and out of place as way was made for the two ladies to mount the stairs to the justiceroom but there she was welcomed by several of the magistrates and could watch phoebes demeanour and the impression it made on persons accustomed to connect many strange stories with the name of miss fulmort  that air of maidenly innocence the girlish form in deep mourning the gentle seriousness and grave composure of the young face the simple selfpossessed manner and the steady distinct tones of the clear soft voice were as honor felt producing an effect that was shown in the mood of addressing her always considerate and courteous but increasing in respect and confidence  and as phoebe raised her eyes the chairmans facethe first to meet her glancewas the kind ruddy one set in iron gray hair that she remembered as belonging to the hunter who had sacrificed the run to see mervyn safely home  the mutual recognition and the tone of concern for his illness made her feel in the presence of a friend and she was the more at ease in performing her part  to her great relief the man in custody was unknown to her  james smithson she said was taller and had a longer face and she had not seen him whom she had locked into the dressingroom  however she identified a gold and turquoise letterweight and the setting of a seal whence the stone with the crest had been extracted both of which had been found in the mans pocket together with some pawnbrokers tickets which represented a buhlclock and other articles from beauchamp  she was made to give an account of the robbery  honor had never felt prouder of any of her favourites than of her while listening to the modest simple but clear and circumstantial recital and watching how much struck the country gentlemen were by the girl who had been of late everywhere pitied or censured  the statement over she was desired to answer a few questions from captain morden the chief of the constabulary force who had come from the county town to investigate the affair  taking her aside he minutely examined her on the appearance of some of the articles mentioned in the inventory on the form of the shadow of the horse and cart on the thieves themselves and chiefly on smithson and how she could be so secure of the identity of the robber in the peajacket with the footman in powder and livery  i can hardly tell said phoebe but i have no doubt in my own mind  was he like this asked captain morden showing her a photograph  certainly not  nor this  no  nor this  yes that is smithson in plain clothes  right miss fulmort  you have an eye for a likeness  these fellows have such a turn for having their portraits done that in these affairs we always try if the shilling photographers have duplicates  this will be sent to town by the next train  i am not sure that i should have known it if i had not seen it before  indeed  should you object to tell me under what circumstances  at the photographers at the time he was at hiltonbury said phoebe i went to him with one of my sisters and we were amused by finding many of the likenesses of our servants  smithson and another came in to be taken while we were there and we afterwards saw this portrait when calling for my sisters  anotheranother servant said the keen captain  yes one of the maids  her name if you please  indeed said phoebe distressed as she saw this jotted down  i cannot bring suspicion and trouble on any one  you will do no such thing miss fulmort  we will only keep our eye on her  neither she nor any one else shall have any ground for supposing her under suspicion but it is our duty to miss no possible indication will you oblige me with her name  she is called jane but i do not know her real name said phoebe with much reluctance and in little need of the injunction to secrecy on this head  the general eagerness to hunt down the criminals saddened her and she was glad to be released with thanks for her distinct evidence  the kind old chairman then met her quite with an air of fatherly protection such as elderly men often wear towards orphaned maidens and inquired more particularly for her brothers health  she was glad to thank him again for having sent the physician when his aid was so needful and she was in so much difficulty  a bold stroke he said smiling i thought you might throw all the blame on me if it were needless  needlessoh it may have saved him  is that the carriage  i must get home as soon as i can  yes i am sure you must be anxious but i hope to see more of you another time  lady raymond must come and see if you cannot find a day to spend with my girls  lady raymond  so this was sir john mervyns foe and maligner  was he repenting at the sight of what he had done  yet he really looked like a very good kind old man and seemed satisfied with the very shabby answer he obtained to a speech that filled honor with a sense of her young friends victory  there was phoebe reestablished in the good graces of the neighbourhood favoured by the very elite of the county for goodness sought by those who had never visited at beauchamp in the days of its gaiety and ostentation  ungrateful child not to be better pleasedonly saying that she supposed she should go away when her brother should be well again and not seeing her way to any day for moorcroft  was she still unforgiving for mervyns rejection or had she a feeling against visiting those who had not taken notice of her family before  mervyn met phoebe in the hall still looking very ill with his purple paleness his heavy eyes and uncertain steps and though he called himself all right since his sleep it was with a weary gasp that he sank into his chair and called on her for an account of what she had done his excitement seemed to have burnt itself out for he listened languidly and asked questions by jerks dozing halfway through the answer and wakening to some fresh inquiry once it wasand did the old sinner take any notice of you  the prisoner  nonsense  old raymond  of course he was in the chair  he was very kind  it was he who came home from the hunt with us the other day  ha i said it was some old woman of a spy wanting to get up a story against me  nay i think he felt kindly for he talked of lady raymond calling and my spending a day at moorcroft  oh so the godly mean to rescue you do they  i did not accept  perhaps they will never think of it again  no his ladies will not let him sneered mervyn  nevertheless his last words that night were so the raymonds have asked you  he was in a more satisfactory state the next day feeble but tamed into endurance of medical treatment and almost indifferent about the robbery as though his passion were spent and he were tired of the subject however the police were alert  the man whom they had taken up was a squatter in the forest notorious as a poacher and thief and his horse and cart answered to phoebes description of the shadow  he had been arrested when returning with them from the small seaport on the other side of the forest in the next county and on communicating with the authorities there search at a dealers in marine stores had revealed hampers filled with the beauchamp plate as yet unmelted  the spoils of lesser bulk had disappeared with smithson and the other criminal    chapter xx       mascarilleoh oh je ne prenois pas garde           tandis que sans songer a mal je vous regarde           votre oeil en tapinois me derobe mon coeur           au voleur au voleur au voleur au voleur      cathosah voila qui est pousse dans le dernier galant                                                  les precieuses ridicules  the detective arrived looking so entirely the office clerk as to take in mervyn himself at first sight and the rest of the world understood that he was to stay till their master could go over the accounts with him  as housekeepers room company his attentions were doubly relished by the housemaids and jealousy was not long in prompting the revelation that jane hart had been smithsons sweetheart and was supposed to have met him since his dismissal  following up this trail the detective proved to his own satisfaction that she had been at a ball at a publichouse in the next village the night before the hunt and had there met both smithson and the poacher  this however he reserved for mervyns private ear still watching his victim in the hope that she might unconsciously give some clue to the whereabouts of her lover  the espionage diverted mervyn and gave him the occupation for his thoughts that he sorely needed but it oppressed phoebe and she shrank from the sight of the housemaid as though she herself were dealing treacherously by her  phoebe said mervyn mysteriously coming into the library where his tardy breakfast was spread that villain smithson has been taken up at liverpool and heres a letter for you to look at  fenton has captured a letter to that woman hart who he found was always wanting to go to the postbut he cant make it out and i thought it was german so i brought it to you  it looks as if old lieschen  no no it cant be cried phoebe  ill clear it up in a moment  but as she glanced at the letter the colour fled from her cheek  well what is it said mervyn impatiently  oh mervyn and she put her hands before her face  come the fewer words the better  out with it at once  mervyn  it is to bertha  she stood transfixed  what cried mervyn  to bertha repeated phoebe looking as if she could never shut her eyes  bertha  what a billetdoux the little precocious pussycat and he laughed to phoebes increased horror  if it could only be a mistake said she but here is her name  it is not german only english in german writing  oh bertha bertha  well but who is the fellow  let me look said mervyn  it is too foolish said phoebe guarding it in the midst of her cold chills of dismay  there is no surnameonly john  ah heres j h oh mervyn could it be mr hastings  no such thing  john  why my names johneverybodys name is john thats nothing  but mervyn i was warned said phoebe her eyes again dilating with dismay that mr hastings never was received into a house with women without there being cause to repent it  experience might have taught you how much slanderous gossip to believe by this time  i believe it is some trumpery curate she has been meeting at miss charlecotes school feasts  for shame mervyn cried phoebe in real anger  curates like thirty thousand as much as other men said mervyn sulkily  after all said phoebe controlling herself what signifies most is that poor bertha should have been led to do such a dreadful thing  if ever i take charge of a pack of women again  but lets hear what the rascal says to her  i do not think it is fair to read it all said phoebe glancing over the tender passages  poor child how ashamed she will be  but listen and she read a portion as if meant to restrain the girls impatience promising to offer a visit to beauchamp or if that were refused till the captives were carried off assuring her there would be ways and means at acton manor where a little coldness from the baronet always secured the ladys good graces  acton manor was in mr hastings neighbourhood and mervyn struck his own knee several times  hum ha  was not some chaff going on one day about the heiresses boxed up in the west wing  some one set you all down at a monstrous figurea hundred thousand apiece  i wonder if he were green enough to believe it hastings  no it cant be  here well have the impudent child down and frighten it out of her  but first how are we to put off that fellow fenton  make up something to tell him  making up would be of no use said phoebe he is too clever  tell him it is a family matter  mervyn left the room and phoebe hid her face in her hands thunderstruck and endeavouring to disentangle her thoughts perturbed between shame indignation and the longing to shield and protect her sister  she had not fully realized her sisters offence so new to her imagination when she was roused by mervyns return saying that he had sent for bertha to have it over  starting up she begged to go and prepare her sister but he peremptorily detained her and oh be kind to her was all that she could say before in tripped bertha looking restless and amazed but her retrousse nose round features and wavy hair so childish that the accusation seemed absurd  so mervyn felt it and in vain drew in his feet made himself upright and tried to look magisterial  bertha he began bertha i have sent for you berthait is not possiblewhats that pointing to the letter as though it had been a stain of ink which she had just perpetrated  alarmed perhaps but certainly not confounded bertha put her hands before her and demurely saidwhat do you mean  what do you mean bertha by such a correspondence as this  if you know that letter is for me why did you meddle with it she coolly answered  upon my word this is assurance cried mervyn  give me my letter repeated bertha reaching out for it  no one else has a right to touch it  if there be nothing amiss said phoebe coming to the relief of her brother who was almost speechless at this audacity why receive it under cover to a servant  because prejudice surrounds me stoutly replied bertha with barely a hitch in her speech as if making a grand stroke but seeing her brother smile she added in an annihilating tone practical tyranny is exercised in every family until education and intellect effect a moral emancipation  what said mervyn education teaching you to write letters in german hand  fine results  i tell you if you were older the disgrace of this would stick to you for life but if you will tell the whole truth about this scoundrel and put an end to it we will do the best we can for you  she made up a disdainful mouth and said thank you  after all said mervyn turning to phoebe it is a joke  look at her she is a baby  you need not have made such a rout  this is only a toyletter to a little girl very good practice in german writing  i am engaged to john hastings heart and hand said bertha in high dignity little knowing that she thus first disclosed the name  yes people talk of children being their little wives said mervyn but you are getting too old for such nonsense though he does not think you so  it is the joint purpose of our lives said bertha  mervyn gave his scoffing laugh and again addressing phoebe said if it were you now or any one with whom he was not in sport it would be a serious matter  the fellow got himself expelled from harrow then was the proverb of even a german university ran through his means before he was fiveandtwenty is as much at home in the queens bench as i am in this study has been outlawed lived on rouge et noir at baden till he got whitewashed when his mother died and since that has lived on betting or making himself agreeable to whoever would ask him  many thanks on the part of your intimate friend said bertha with suppressed passion  mervyn stamped his foot and phoebe defended him with men may associate with those who are no companions for their sisters bertha  contracted minds always accept malignant reports was the reply  report said mervyn i know it as well as i know myself then recollecting himself but she does not understand it is of no use to talk to children  take her away phoebe and keep her in the nursery till mr crabbe comes to settle what is to be done with her  i insist on having my letter said bertha with womanly grandeur  let her have it  it is not worth bothering about a mere joke said mervyn leaning back wearied of the struggle in which provoking as he was he had received some home thrusts  phoebe felt bewildered and as if she had a perfect stranger on her hands though berthas high tone was after all chiefly from her extremity and by way of reply to her brothers scornful incredulity of her exalted position  she was the first to speak on leaving the library pray phoebe how came you to tamper with peoples letters  phoebe explained  from mervyn and his spy one could expect no delicacy said bertha but in you it was treachery  no bertha said phoebe i was grieved to expose you but it was my duty to clear the innocent by examining the letter and mervyn had a right to know what concerned you when you were under his charge  it is our business to save you and a letter sent in this way does not stand on the same ground as one coming openly under your own name  but i did not read it to him berthanot all  if you had said bertha more piqued than obliged by this reserve he would have known it was in earnest and not childish nonsense  you saw that it was earnest phoebe and her defiant voice betrayed a semidistrust  i am afraid it looked very much so said phoebe but bertha that would be saddest of all  i am afraid he might be wicked enough to be trying to get your fortune for indeeddont be very much vexed dearest i am only saying it for your goodyou are not old enough nor formed nor pretty enough really to please a man that has seen so much of the world  he never met so fresh or original or so highly cultivated a mind said bertha besides as to features there may be different opinions  but bertha how could you ever see him or speak to him  hearts can find more ways than you dream of said bertha with a touch of sentiment we had only to meet for the magnetism of mind to be felt  argument was heartless work  flattery and the glory of her conquest had entirely filled the childs mind and she despised mervyn and phoebe far too much for the representations of the one or the persuasions of the other to have the smallest weight with her  evidently weariness of her studies and impatience of discipline had led her to lend a willing ear to any distraction and to give in to the intercourse that both gratified and amused herself and outwitted her governess and thence the belief in the power of her own charms and preference for their admirer were steps easier than appeared credible to phoebe  from listening in helpless amaze to a miserable round of pertness and philosophy phoebe was called downstairs to hear that mervyn had been examining jane hart and had elicited from her that after having once surprised mr hastings and miss bertha in conversation she had several times conveyed notes between them and since he had left beauchamp she had posted two letters to him from the young lady but this was the first answer received directed to herself to be left at the postoffice to be called for  earnest enough on his part said mervyn a regular speculation to patch up his fortunes  well i knew enough of him as i told you but i was fool enough to pity him  he became silent and so did phoebe  she had been too much overset to look the subject fairly in the face and his very calmness of voice and the absence of abusive epithets were a token that he was perfectly appalled at what he had brought on his sisters  they both sat still some minutes when she saw him lean back with his hand to his head and his eyes closed  theres a steeple chase he said as phoebe laid her cool hand on his burning brow and felt the throbbing of the swollen veins of his temples  both knew that this meant cupping and they sent in haste for the hiltonbury doctor but he was out for the day and would not return till evening  phoebe felt dull and stunned as if her decision had caused all the mischief and more and more were following on and her spirit almost died within her at mervyns interjection of rage and suffering  though they curse yet bless thou had of necessity been her rule while clinging to this brother a mental ejaculation had become habitual and this time it brought reaction from her forlorn despondency  she could do something  twice she had assisted in cupping and she believed she could perform the operation  no failure could be as hurtful as delay and she offered to make the attempt  mervyn growled at her folly yawned groaned looked at his watch counted the heavy hours and supposed she must do as she chose  her heart rivalled his temples in palpitation but happily without affecting eye voice or hand and with lieschens help the deed was successfully done almost with equal benefit to the operator and the patient  success had put new life into her the troubles had been forgotten for the moment and recurred not as a shameful burthen caused by her own imprudence but as a possible turningpoint a subject for action not for despair and phoebe was herself again  whats that you are writing asked mervyn starting from a doze on the sofa  a letter to robert she answered reluctantly  i suppose you will put it in the times  no woman can keep a thing to herself  i would tell no one else but i wanted his advice  oh i dare say  phoebe saw that to persist in her letter would utterly destroy the repose that was essential in mervyns state and she laid aside her pen  going to do it out of sight he petulantly said  no but at any rate i will wait till miss fennimore has talked to bertha  she will be more willing to listen to her  because this is the result of her emancipating education  ha  no but bertha will attend to her and cannot say her notions are servile and contracted  if you say any more i shall get up and flog them both  miss fennimore is very wise said phoebe  why what has she taught you but the ologies and the rights of women  the chief thing she teaches said phoebe is to attend to what we are doing  mervyn laughed but did not perceive how those words were the key of phoebes character  sir john and lady raymond and miss raymond in the drawingroom  unappreciating the benefit of changing the current of thought phoebe lamented their admission and moved reluctantly to the great rooms where the guests looked as if they belonged to a more easy and friendly region than to that world of mirrors damask and gilding  sir john shook hands like an old friend but his wife was one of those homely ladies who never appear to advantage in strange houses and phoebe had not learnt the art of lady of the house talk besides feeling a certain chilliness towards mervyns detractors which rendered her stiff and formal  to her amaze however the languishing talk was interrupted by his entrance he who regarded sir john as the cause of his disappointment he who had last met susan raymond at the time of his rejection he whom she had left prostrate among the sofa cushions he had absolutely exerted himself to brush his hair and put on coat and boots yet how horribly ill and nervous he looked totally devoid of his usual cool assurance uncertain whether to shake hands with the two ladies and showing a strange restless eagerness as though entirely shaken off his balance  matters were mended by his entrance  phoebe liked lady raymond from the moment she detected a sign to the vehement sir john not to keep his host standing during the discussion of the robbery and she ventured on expressing her gratitude for his escort on the day of the hunt  then arose an entreaty to view the scene of the midnight adventure and the guests were conducted to the gallery shown where each party had stood the gaspipe the mark of the pistolshot and the door was opened to display the cabinet and the window of the escape  to the intense surprise of her brother and sister bertha was examining her emeralds  she came forward quite at her ease and if she had been ten years a woman could not more naturally have assumed the entertainment of lady raymond talking so readily that phoebe would have believed the mornings transactions a delusion but for mervyns telegraph of astonishment  the visitors had been at the holt and obtained a promise from miss charlecote to spend the ensuing saturday week at moorcroft  they begged the sisters to accompany her  phoebe drew back though mervyn hurried out declarations of his not wanting her and the others never going out till she hardly knew how it had been decided but as the guests departed she heard mervyn severely observing to berthano certainly i should not send you to keep company with any wellbehaved young ladies  thank you i have no desire to associate with commonplace girls said bertha marching off to the west wing  you will go phoebe said mervyn  indeed if i did it would be partly for the sake of giving change to bertha and letting her see what nice people really are  are you crazy phoebe  i would not have bertha with her impudence and her pedantry go among the raymondsno not for the bank of england  those words darted into phoebes mind the perception why mervyn was in his strange way promoting her intercourse with moorcroft not only as stamping her conduct with approval of people of their worth and weight but as affording him some slight glimmering of hope  she could not but recollect that the extra recklessness of language which had pained her ever since his rejection had diminished ever since her report of sir johns notice of her at the justice room  sisterlike she pitied and hoped but the more immediate care extinguished all the rest and she was longing for miss fennimores sympathy though grieving at the pain the disclosure must inflict  it could not be made till the girls were gone to bed and at halfpast nine phoebe sought the schoolroom and told her tale  there was no answer but an almost convulsive shudder her hand was seized and her finger guided to the line which miss fennimore had been reading in the greek testamentby their fruits ye shall know them  rallying before phoebe could trace what was passing in her mind she shut the book turned her chair to the fire invited phoebe to another and was at once the clearheaded metaphysical governess ready to discuss this grievous marvel  she was too generous by nature not to have treated her pupils with implicit trust and this trust had been abused  looking back she and phoebe could recollect moments when bertha had been unaccounted for and must have held interviews with mr hastings  she had professed a turn for twilight walks in the garden and remained out of doors when the autumn evenings had sent the others in and on the sunday afternoons when phoebe and maria had been at church miss fennimore reproached herself exceedingly with having been too much absorbed in her own readings to concern herself about the proceedings of a pupil whose time on that day was at her own disposal  she also thought that there had been communications by look and sign across the pew at church and she had remarked though phoebe had been too much occupied with her brother to perceive the restlessness that had settled on bertha from the time of the departure of mervyns guests and had once reproved her for lingering as she thought to gossip with jane hart in her bedroom  and now said miss fennimore she should have a thorough change  send her to school calling it punishment if you please but chiefly for the sake of placing her among laughing girlish girls of the same age and above all under a thoroughly religious mistress of wide intelligence and who has never doubted  but we were all to keep together dear miss fennimoreyou  one whose mind has always been balancing between aspects of truth may instruct but cannot educate  few minds can embrace the moral virtues unless they are based on an undoubted foundation connected with present devotional warmth and future hopes and fears  i see this now i once thought excellence would approve itself for its own sake to others as it did to myself  i regarded bertha as a fair subject for a full experiment of my system with good disposition good abilities and few counter influences  i meant to cultivate selfrelying unprejudiced effective good sense and seewith prejudices have been rooted up restraints  education seems to me to have little to do with what people turn out said phoebe  look at poor miss charlecote and the sandbrooks  depend upon it phoebe that whatever harm may have ensued from her errors in detail those young people will yet bless her for the principle she worked on  you can none of you bless me for having guided the hands of the watch and having left the mainspring untouched  miss fennimore had been like helvetius and the better class of encyclopaedists enamoured of the moral virtues but unable to perceive that they could not be separated from the christian faith and she learnt like them that when doctrine ceased to be prominent practice went after it  bertha was her jacobinand seemed doubly so the next morning when an interview took place in which the young lady gave her to understand that she like phoebe was devoid of the experience that would enable them to comprehend the sacred mutual duty of souls that once had spoken woman was no longer the captive of the seraglio nor the chronicler of small beer  intellectual training conferred rights of choice superior to conventional ties and as to the infallible discernment of that fifteen year old judgment had not she the sole premises to go upon she who alone had been admitted to the innermost of that manly existence  i always knew jack to be a clever dog said mervyn when this was reported to him but his soft sawder to a priggish metaphysical baby must have been the best fun in the world  mervyns great desire was to keep berthas folly as great a secret as possible and by his decision she was told that grace should be granted her till mr crabbes arrival when unless she had renounced what he called her silly childs fancy stringent measures would be taken and she would be exposed to the family censure  so said bertha you expect to destroy the attraction of souls by physical force  and phoebe wrote to robert a sorrowful letter chiefly consisting of the utmost pleadings for mervyn and bertha that her loving heart could frame she was happier when she had poured out her troubles but grieved when no answer came by the next post  roberts displeasure must be greatand indeed but too justly sosince all this mischief was the consequence of the disregard of his wishes  yet justice was hard between brothers and sisters especially when mervyn was in such a suffering state threatened constantly by attacks of his complaint which were only warded off by severe and weakening treatment  phoebe was so necessary to his comfort in waiting on him and trying to while away his tedious hours of inaction and oppression that she had little time to bestow upon bertha nor indeed was talking of any use as it only gave the young lady an occasion for pouring forth magniloquent sentiments utterly heedless of the answers  sad lonely and helpless were phoebes feelings but she was patient and still went on step by step through the strange tangle attending to mervyn hour by hour always with a gentle cheerful word and smile and never trusting herself even when alone to think of the turmoil and break up that must ensue on her guardians arrival  all was darkness and perplexity before her but submission and trust were her refuge and each day of waiting before the crisis was to her feelings a gain    chapter xxi       o fy gar ride and fy gar rin     and haste ye to find these traitors agen     for shees be burnt and hees been slein        the wearifu gaberlunzie man     some rade upon horse some ran afit     the wife was wud and out of her wit     she couldna gang nor yet could she sit        but aye did curse and banking james v  mervyn and phoebe were playing at billiards as a means of inducing him to take exercise enough to make him sleep  the governess and the two girls were gone to the dentists at elverslope  the winters day was closing in when there was a knock at the door and they beheld miss fennimore deadly white and maria who flew up to phoebe cryingberthas gone phoebe  the next uptrain stops at elverslope at 830 said the governess staring in mervyns face as though repeating a lesson  a carriage will be here by seven  i will bring her home or never return  gone  it was inexcusable in me sir said miss fennimore resting a hand on the table to support herself  i thought it needlessly galling to let her feel herself watched and at her request let her remain in the waitingroom while her sister was in the dentists hands  when after an hour maria was released she was gone  alone cried phoebe  alone i hope  i went to the station the train had been ten minutes gone but a young lady alone in mourning and with no luggage but a little bag had got in there for london  happily they did not know her and it was the parliamentary train which is five hours on the road  i telegraphed at once to your brother to meet her at the terminus  i have no hope said mervyn doggedly seating himself on the table his feet dangling  he will be in the lowest gutter of whittingtonia where no one can find him  the fellow will meet that miserable child go off to ostend this very night marry her before tomorrow morning theres an end of it  where does mr hastings lodge sir  nowhere that i know of  there will be no end of time lost in tracing him  no train before 830  ill go in at once and have a special  they cannot put on one before nine because of the excursion trains for the cattleshow  i should not have been in time had i driven to catch the express at w said miss fennimore in her clear voice of desperation  the 830 reaches town at 1123  will you give me the addresses where i may inquire sir  you  i am going myself  you would be of no use said mervyn in a stunned mechanical way and looking at his watch he went to give orders  he should not go phoebe  in his state the mere journey is a fearful risk  it cant be helped said phoebe  i shall go with him  you stay to take care of maria  there will be robert to help us and as the governess would have spoken farther she held up her hands in entreatyo pray dont say anything  i cant go on if i do anything but act  yet in the endeavour to keep her brother quiet and to husband his powers phoebes movements and words had rather an additional gentleness and deliberation and so free from bustle was her whole demeanour that he never comprehended her intention of accompanying him till she stepped into the carriage beside him  whats this  you coming  i will give you no trouble  well you may help to manage the girl and he lay back relieved to be off but already spent by the hurry of the last two hours  phoebe could sit andnonot think except that robert was at the other end of the line  the drive seemed to have lasted half the night ere the lamps of elverslope made constellations in the valley and the green and red lights of the station loomed out on the hill  they drove into the circle of gaslights among the vaporous steeds of omnibuses and flies and entered the station phoebes veil down and mervyn shading his dazzled eyes from the glare  they were half an hour too soon and while waiting it occurred to phoebe to inquire whether a telegram for beauchamp had been received  even so and they must have crossed the express but a duplicate was brought to them  safe  we shall be at elverslope at 1020 pm  assuredly phoebe did not faint for she stood on her feet and mervyn never perceived the suspension of senses which lasted till she found him for the second time asking whether she would go home or await the travellers at elverslope  home she said instinctively in her relief forgetting all the distress of what had taken place so that her sensations were little short of felicity and as she heard the 830 train roaring up she shed tears of joy at having no concern therewith  the darkness and mervyns silence were comfortable for she could wipe unseen her showers of tears at each gust of thankfulness that passed over her and it was long before she could command her voice even to ask her companion whether he were tired  no he said but the tone was more than halfsullen and at the thought of the meeting between the brothers poor phoebes heart seemed to die within her  against their dark looks and curt sayings to one another she had no courage  when they reached home she begged him to go at once to bed hoping thus to defer the meeting but he would not hear of doing so and her only good augury was that his looks were pale languid and subdued rather than flushed and excited  miss fennimore was in the hall and he went towards her saying in a friendly tone so miss fennimore you have heard that this unlucky child has given us a fright for nothing  the voice in which she assented was hoarse and scarcely audible and she looked as if twenty years had passed over her head  it was all owing to your promptitude said mervyn a capital thought that telegram  i am glad said miss fennimore but i do not lose sight of my own negligence  it convinces me that i am utterly unfit for the charge i assumed  i shall leave your sisters as soon as new plans can be formed  why ill be bound none of your pupils ever played you such a trick before  miss fennimore only looked as if this convinced her the more but it was no time for the argument and phoebe caressingly persuaded her to come into the library and drink coffee with them judging rightly that she had tasted nothing since morning  afterwards phoebe induced mervyn to lie on the sofa and having made every preparation for the travellers she sat down to wait  she could not read she could not work she felt that tranquillity was needful for her brother and had learnt already the soothing effect of absolute repose  indeed one of the first tokens by which miss fennimore had perceived character in phoebe was her faculty of being still  only that which has substance can be motionless  there she sat in the lamplight her head drooping her hands clasped on her knee her eyes bent down not drowsy not abstracted not rigid but peaceful  her brother lay in the shade watching her with a halffascinated gaze as though a magnetic spell repressed all inclination to work himself into agitation  the stillness became an effort at last but it was resolutely preserved till the frostbound gravel resounded with wheels  phoebe rose mervyn started up caught her hand and squeezed it hard  do not let him be hard on me phoebe he said  i could not bear it  she had little expected this  her answer was a mute caress and she hurried out but in a tumult of feeling retreated behind the shelter of a pillar and silently put her hand on roberts arm as he stepped out of the carriage  wait he whispered holding her back  hush  i have promised that she shall see no one  bertha descended unassisted her veil down and neither turning to the right nor the left crossed the hall and went upstairs  robert took off his overcoat and hat took a light and followed her signing that phoebe should remain behind  she found mervyn at the library door like herself rather appalled at the apparition that had swept past them  she put her hand into his with a kind of common feeling that they were awaiting a strict judge  robert soon reappeared and in a preoccupied way kissed the one and shook hands with the other saying she has locked her door and says she wants nothing  i will try again presentlynot you phoebe i could only get her home on condition she should see no one without her own consent  so you had my telegram  we met it at the station  how did you find her  had the man been written to asked robert  no said mervyn we thought it best to treat it as childish nonsense not worth serious notice or in facti was not equal to writing  the weary dejected tone made robert look up contrary to the brothers usual habit of avoiding one anothers eye and he exclaimed i did not know  you were not going to london tonight  worse staying at home murmured mervyn as leaning on a corner of the mantelshelf he rested his head on his hand  i was coming with him said phoebe i thought if he gave directions you could act  robert continued to cast at him glances of dismay and compunction while pursuing the narrative  hastings must have learnt by some means that the speculation was not what he had imagined for though he met her at paddington  he did  she had telegraphed to him while waiting at swindon  he found her out before i did but he felt himself in a predicament and i believe i was a welcome sight to him  he begged me to do him the justice to acquit him of all participation in this rash step and said he had only met bertha with a view to replacing her in the hands of her family  how it would have been without me i cannot tell but i am inclined to believe that he did not know how to dispose of her  she clung to him and turned away from me so decidedly that i was almost grateful for the line he took and he was obliged to tell her with many fine speeches that he could not expose her to share his poverty and when the poor silly child declared she had enough for both he told her plainly that it would not be available for six years and he could not let hertenderly nurtured etc etc  then supposing me uninformed he disclaimed all betrayal of your confidence and represented all that had passed as sport with a child which to his surprise she had taken as earnest  poor bertha exclaimed phoebe  pray where did this scene take place asked mervyn  on the platform but it was far too quiet to attract notice  what you had no fits nor struggles  i should think not smiled phoebe  she stood like a statue when she understood him and when he would audaciously have shaken hands with her she made a distant courtesy quite dignified  i took her to the waitingroom and put back her veil she was crimson and nearly choking but she repelled me and never gave way  i asked if she would sleep at an inn and go home tomorrow she said no  i told her i could not take her to my place because of the curates  ill go to a sisterhood she said and when i told her she was in no mood to be received there she answered i dont care  then i proposed taking her to augusta but that was worse and at last i got her to come home in the dark on my promise that she should see no one till she chose  not a word has she since uttered  could he really have meant it all in play said phoebe yet there was his letter  i see it all said mervyn  i was an ass to suppose such needy rogues could come near girls of fortune without running up the scent  as i told phoebe i know they had some monstrous ideas of the amount which i never thought it worth my while to contradict  i imagine old jack only intended a promising little flirtation capable of being brought to bear if occasion served but otherwise to be cast aside as childs play nobody could suspect such an inflammable nature with that baby face but it seems she was ready to eat her fingers with dulness in the schoolroom and had prodigious notions of the rights of woman so she took all he said most seriously and met him more than halfway  then he goes to london gets better information looks at the will in doctors commons maybe finds it a slowish speculation and wants to let her down easy whereof she has no notion writes two letters to his one as we know gets desperate and makes this excursion  robert thoughtfully said yes and phoebe though she did not like to betray it mentally owned that the intercepted letter confirmed mervyns opinion being evidently meant to pacify what was inconveniently ardent and impassioned without making tangible promises or professions  the silence was broken by mervyn  there  i shall go to bed  phoebe when you see that poor child tell her not to be afraid of me for the scrape was of my making so dont be sharp with her  i hope not said robert gravely i am beginning to learn that severity is injustice not justice  good night mervyn i hope this has not done you harm  i am glad not to be at paddington this minute said mervyn  you will stay and help us through this business  it is past us  i will stay as long as i can if you wish it  phoebes fervent thank you was for both  she had never heard such friendly tones between those two though mervyns were still half sullen and chiefly softened by dejection and weariness  why phoebe cried robert as the door closed how could you not tell me this  i thought i had told you that he was very unwell  unwell  i never saw any one so much altered  he is at his best when he is pale  the attacks are only kept off by reducing him and he must be materially better to have no threatening after such a day as this  well i am glad you have not had the letter that i posted only today  i knew you were displeased said phoebe and you see you were quite right in not wishing us to stay here but you forgive us nowmervyn and me i mean  dont couple yourself with him phoebe  yes i must for we both equally misjudged and he blames himself more than any one  his looks plead for him as effectually as you can do phoebe and rebuke me for having fancied you weak and perverse in remaining after the remonstrance  i do not wonder at it said phoebe but it is over now and dont let us talk about it  i want nothing to spoil the comfort of knowing that i have you here  i have a multitude of things to say but you look sleepy  yes i am afraid i am  i should like to sit up all night to make the most of you but i could not keep awake  childlike she no sooner had some one on whom to repose her care than slumber claimed its due and she went away to her thankful rest treasuring the thought of roberts presence and resting in the ineffable blessing of being able to overlook the thorns in gratitude for the roses  bertha did not appear in the morning  robert went to her door and was told that she would see no one and phoebes entreaties for admission were met with silence till he forbade their repetition  it only hardens her he said we must leave her to herself  she will not eat she will be ill  if she do not yield at dinnertime lieschen shall carry food to her but she shall not have the pleasure of disappointing you  sullenness must be left to weary itself out  is not this more shame than sullenness  true shame hides its face and confessessullen shame hides like adam if hers had not been stubborn it would have melted at your voice  she must wait to hear it again till she have learnt to crave for it  he looked so resolute that phoebe durst plead no longer but her heart sank at the thought of the obstinate force of poor berthas nature persistence was innate in the fulmorts and it was likely to be a severe and lasting trial whether robert or bertha would hold out the longest since he had captured her however all were relieved tacitly to give her up to his management and at dinnertime on his stern assurance that unless she would accept food the door would be forced she admitted some sandwiches and tea and desired to have her firing replenished but would allow no one to enter  robert at mervyns earnest entreaty arranged to remain over the sunday the two brothers met shyly at first using phoebe as a medium of communication but they drew nearer after a time in the discussion of the robbery and robert presently found means of helping mervyn by letterwriting and taking business off his hands to which phoebe was unequal  both concurred in insisting that phoebe should keep her engagement to the raymonds for the morrow as the only means of preventing berthas escapade from making a sensation and by night she became satisfied that not only would the brothers keep the peace in her absence but that a days teteatete might rather promote their good understanding  still she was in no mood to enjoy when she had to leave berthas door still unopened and the only comfort she could look to was in the conversation with miss charlecote on the way  from her there was no concealing what had happened and to phoebes surprise she was encouraging  from an external point of view she could judge better than those more nearly concerned and her elder years made her more conscious what time could do  she would not let the adventure be regarded as a lasting blight on berthas life  had the girl been a few years older she could never have held up her head again but as it was honor foretold that by the time she was twenty the adventure would appear incredible  it was not to be lightly passed over but she must not be allowed to lose her selfrespect nor despair of regaining a place in the family esteem  phoebe could not imagine her ever recovering the being thus cast off by her first love  my dear believe me it was not love at all only mystery and the rights of woman  her very demonstrativeness shows that it was not the heart but the vanity  phoebe tried to believe and at least was refreshed by the sympathy so as to be able to her own surprise to be pleased and happy at moorcroft where sir john and his wife were full of kindness and the bright household mirth of the sons and daughters showed phoebe some of the benefit miss fennimore expected for bertha from girl friends  one of the younger ones showed her a present in preparation for cousin cecily and embarked in a list of the names of the cousinhood at sutton and though an elder sister decidedly closed young harriets mouth yet afterwards phoebe was favoured with a sight of a photograph of the dear cousin and inferred from it that the young ladys looks were quite severe enough to account for her cruelty  the having been plunged into a new atmosphere was good for phoebe and she brought home so cheerful a face that even the news of berthas continued obstinacy could not long sadden it in the enjoyment of the sight of robert making himself necessary to mervyn and mervyn accepting his services as if there had never been anything but brotherly love between them  she could have blessed bertha for having thus brought them together and felt as if it were a dream too happy to last  what an accountant robert is said mervyn  it is a real sacrifice not to have him in the business  what a thing we should have made of it and he would have taken all the bother  we have done very well today was roberts account i dont know what can have been the matter before except my propensity for making myself disagreeable  phoebe went to bed revolving plans for softening bertha and was fast asleep when the lock of her door was turned  as she awoke the terrors of the robbery were upon her far more strongly than at the actual moment of its occurrence but the voice was familiar though thin weak and gasping  o phoebe ive done it  ive starved myself  i am dying and the sound became a shrill cry  the dark  o save me there was a heavy fall and phoebe springing to the spot where the white vision had sunk down strove to lift a weight cold as marble without pulse or motion  she contrived to raise it and drag it with her into her own bed though in deadly terror at the icy touch and prone helplessness and she was feeling in desperation for the bellrope when to her great relief light and steps approached and robert spoke  alas his candle only served to show the ghastly senseless face  she has starved herself said phoebe with affright  a swoon dont be afraid said robert who was dressed and had evidently been watching  try to warm her i will fetch something for her we shall soon bring her round  a swoon only a swoon phoebe was forced to reiterate to herself to keep her senses and check the sobbing screams that swelled in her throat during the hourlike moments of his absence  she rose and partly dressed herself in haste then strove to chafe the limbs but her efforts only struck the deathly chill more deeply into her own heart  he brought some brandy with which they moistened her lips but still in vain and phoebes dismay was redoubled as she saw his terror  it must be fainting he repeated but i had better send for jackson may god have mercy on us allthis is my fault  her lips move gasped phoebe as she rubbed the temples with the stimulant  thank god and again they put the spoon to her lips as the nostrils expanded the eyes opened and she seemed to crave for the cordial  but vainly robert raised her in his arms and phoebe steadied her own trembling hand to administer it there were only choking sobbing efforts for words resulting in hoarse shrieks of anguish  mervyn and miss fennimore entering nearly at the same moment found phoebe pale as death urging composure with a voice of despair and robert with looks of horror that he could no longer control holding up the sinking child her face livid her eyes strained  i cant i cant she cried with frightful catches of her breath i shall die and the screams recurred  mervyn could not bear the spectacle for an instant and fled only to return to listen outside  miss fennimore brought authority and presence of mind  hysterical she said  there lay her down dont try again yet  it is hunger whispered the trembling phoebe but miss fennimore only signed to be obeyed and decidedly saying be quiet bertha dont speak the habit of submission silenced all but the choking sobs  she sent robert to warm a shawl ordered away the frightened maids and enforced stillness which lasted till bertha had recovered breath when she sobbed out again robert  where is he  i shall die  he must pray i cant die  miss fennimore bade robert compose his voice to pray aloud and what he read tranquillized all except mervyn who understood this to mean the worst and burst away to sit cowering in suspense over his fire  miss fennimore then offered bertha a morsel of roll dipped in port wine but fasting and agitation had really produced a contraction of the muscles of the throat and the attempt failed  bertha was dreadfully terrified and phoebe could hardly control herself but she was the only person unbanished by miss fennimore  even roberts distress became too visible for the absolute calm by which the governess hoped to exhaust the hysteria while keeping up vitality by outward applications of warmth and stimulants and from time to time renewing the endeavour to administer nourishment  it was not till two terrible hours had passed that phoebe came to the schoolroom and announced to her brothers that after ten minutes doze bertha had waked and swallowed a spoonful of arrowroot and wine without choking  she could not restrain her sobs and wept uncontrollably as mervyn put his arm round her  he was the most composed of the three for her powers had been sorely strained and robert had suffered most of all  he had on this day suspected that bertha was burning the provisions forced on her but he had kept silence believing that she would thus reduce herself to a more amenable state than if she were angered by compulsion and long before serious harm could ensue  used to the sight of famine he thought inanition would break the spirit without injuring the health  many a time had he beheld those who professed to have tasted nothing for two days trudge off tottering but cheerful with a soupticket and he had not calculated on the difference between the children of want and the delicately nurtured girl full of overwrought feeling  though he had been watching in loving intercession for the unhappy child and had resolved on forcing his way to her in the morning he felt as if he had played the part of the archbishop of pisa and that had she perished in her fearful determination her blood would have been on himself  he was quite overcome and forced to hurry to his own room to compose himself ere he could return to inquire further but there was little more to hear  miss fennimore desired to be alone with the patient phoebe allowed herself to be laid on the sofa and covered with shawls mervyn returned to his bed and robert still watched  there was a great calm after the storm and phoebe did not wake till the dim wintry dawn was struggling with the yellow candlelight and a consultation was going on in low tones between robert and the governess both wan and haggard in the uncomfortable light and their words not more cheering than their looks  bertha had become feverish passing from restless talking sleep to startled painful wakening and miss fennimore wished dr martyn to be sent for  phoebe shivered with a cold chill of disappointment as she gathered their meaning and coming forward entreated the watchers to lie down to rest while she relieved guard but nothing would persuade miss fennimore to relinquish her post and soon phoebe had enough to do elsewhere for her own peculiar patient mervyn was so ill throughout the morning that she was constantly employed in his room and robert looking on and trying to aid her hated himself doubly for his hasty judgments  maria alone could go to church on that sunday morning and her version of the state of affairs brought miss charlecote to beauchamp to offer her assistance  she saw dr martyn and undertook the painful preliminary explanation and she saw him again after his inspection of bertha  thats a firstrate governess  exactly so  an educational hotbed why cant people let girls dress dolls and trundle hoops as they used to do  i have never thought bertha oppressed by her lessons  so much the worse  those who cant learn or wont learn take care of themselves  those who have a brain and use it are those that suffer  to hear that poor child blundering algebra in her sleep might be a caution to mothers  did you ever see her before so as to observe the little hesitation in her speech  no they should have mentioned that  it is generally very slight but one of themi think mariatold me that she always stammered more after lessons  the blindness of people  as if that had not been a sufficient thermometer to show when they were overworking her brain  why not one of these fulmorts has a head that will bear liberties being taken with it  can you let us hope that this whole affair came from an affection of the brain  the elopement  no i cant flatter you that health or sanity were in fault there  nor is it delirium now the rambling is only in sleep  but the three days fast  two days was it not  three  she took nothing since breakfast on thursday  have you made out how she passed the last two days  i wrung out some account  i believe this would never have occurred to her if her brother had given her a sandwich at paddington but she came home exhausted into a distaste for food which other feelings exaggerated into a fancy to die rather than face the family  she burnt the provisions in a rage at their being forced on her and she slept most of the timetorpor without acute suffering  last night in sleep she lost her hold of her resolution and woke to the sense of selfpreservation  an infinite mercy  not that the spirit is broken all her strength goes to sullenness and i never saw a case needing greater judgment  now that she is reduced the previous overwork tells on her and it will be a critical matter to bring her round  who can be of use here  not the married sisters i suppose  miss fulmort is all that a girl can be at nineteen or twenty but she wants age  you think it will be a bad illness  it may not assume an acute form but it may last a good while and if they wish her to have any health again they must mind what they are about  honora felt a task set to her  she must be phoebes experience as far as her fifty years could teach her to deal with a little precocious rationalist in a wild travestie of thekla  ich habe geliebt und gelebet was the farewell laid on berthas table  what a thekla and what a max  o profanation  but honor felt bertha a charge of her own and her aid was the more thankfully accepted that the patient was quite beyond phoebe  she had too long rebelled against her sister to find rest in her guardianship  phoebes voice disposed her to resistance her advice to wrangling and miss fennimore alone had power to enforce what was needful and so devoted was she that honor could scarcely persuade her to lie down to rest for a few hours  honor was dismayed at the change from the childish espiegle roundness of feature to a withered scathed countenance singularly old and mournfully contrasting with the mischievouslooking waves and rings of curly hair upon the brow  premature playing at passion had been sport with edged tools  sleeping the talk was less however of the supposed love than of science and metaphysics waking there was silence between weakness and sullenness  thus passed day after day always in the same feverish lethargic oppression which baffled medical skill and kept the sick mind beyond the reach of human aid and so uniform were the days that her illness seemed to last for months instead of weeks  miss fennimore insisted on the nightwatching for her share  phoebe divided with her and lieschen the morning cares and miss charlecote came in the forenoon and stayed till night but slept at home whither maria was kindly invited but phoebe did not like to send her away without herself or lieschen and robert undertook for her being inoffensive to mervyn  in fact she was obliging and unobtrusive only speaking when addressed and a willing messenger  mervyn first forgot her presence then tolerated her saucer eyes then found her capable of running his errands and lastly began to care to please her  honora had devised employment for her by putting a drawer of patchwork at her disposal and suggesting that she should make a workbag for each of roberts 139 school girls and the occupation this afforded her was such a public benefit that robert was content to pay the tax of telling her the destination of each individual bag and being always corrected if he twice mentioned the same name  when mervyn dozed in his chair she would require from robert stories of his scholars and it even came to pass that mervyn would recur to what had then passed as though he had not been wholly asleep  mervyn was chiefly dependent on his brother for conversation entertainment and assistance in his affairs and though not a word passed upon their differences and no professions were made the common anxiety and mervyns great need of help had swept away all traces of unfriendliness  not even when children in the nursery had they been so free from variance or bitterness as while waiting the issue of their sisters illness both humbled both feeling themselves in part the cause each anxious to cheer and console the otherone weak subdued dependentthe other considerate helpful and eager to atone for past harshness  strange for brothers to wait till the ages of twentynine and twentyseven to find out that they really did prefer each other to every one else in spite of the immense differences between their characters and habits  i say asked mervyn one day when resting after having brought on giddiness and confusion by directing robert how to answer a letter from the office what would you do with this bore of a business if it came to you  get rid of it said robert surveying him with startled eyes  ayesell it and get the devilry as you call it multiplied to all infinity  close it  boil soup in the coppers bake loaves in the furnaces  it makes you look at me perilouslyand a perilous game you would find it most likely to swallow this place and all the rest  why you who had the making of a man of business in you might reflect that you cant annihilate property without damage to other folks  i did not reflect said robert gravely the matter never occurred to me  what is the result of your reflection now  nothing at all was the somewhat impatient reply  i trust never to have to consider  get it out of my hands at any sacrifice so as it may do the least harm to others  had i no other objection to that business i should have no choice  your cloth  well thats a pity for i see how it could be mitigated so as to satisfy your scruples and mervyn whose head could work when it was not necessary detailed a scheme for gradually contracting the most objectionable traffic and adopting another branch of the trade  excellent said robert assenting with delight at each pause  you will carry it out  i  im only a reprobate distiller  there it ended and robert must have patience  the guardian mr crabbe came as soon as his gout would permit and hemmed and grunted in reply to the strange narrative into which he had come to inquire  acting was as yet impossible mervyn was forbidden to transact business and bertha was far too ill for the removal of the young ladies to be attempted  miss fennimore did indeed formally give in her resignation of her situation but she was too necessary as a nurse for the time of her departure to be fixed and mr crabbe was unable to settle anything definitively  he found robertwho previously had spurred him to strong measuresbent on persuading him to lenity and especially on keeping phoebe with mervyn and after a day and night of perplexity the old gentleman took his leave promising to come again on berthas recovery and to pacify the two elder sisters by representing the condition of beauchamp and that for the present the incumbent of st matthews and miss charlecote might be considered as sufficient guardians for the inmates  or if their ladyships thought otherwise he said with a twinkle in his eye why did they not come down themselves  mervyn made a gesture of horror but all knew that there was little danger  augusta was always so low at the sight of illness and unless phoebe had been the patient out of sight juliana would not have brought her husband obvious as would have been the coming of an elder sister when the sickness of the younger dragged on so slowly and wearily  no one went through so much as miss fennimore  each hour of her attendance on bertha stamped the sense of her own failure and of the fallacies to which her life had been dedicated  the sincerity honour and modesty that she had inculcated had been founded on selfesteem alone and when they had proved inadequate to prevent their breach their outraged relics had prompted the victim to despair and die  intellectual development and reasoning powers had not availed one moment against inclination and selfwill and only survived in the involuntary murmurs of a disordered nervous system  all this had utterly overthrown that satisfaction in herself and her own moral qualities in which miss fennimore had always lived she had become sensible of the deep flaws in all that she had admired in her own conduct and her reason being already prepared by her long and earnest study to accept the faith in its fulness she had begun to crave after the atoning mercy of which she sorely felt the need  but if it be hard for one who has never questioned to take home individually the efficacy of the great sacrifice how much harder for one taught to deny the godhead which rendered the victim worthy to satisfy eternal justice  she accepted the truth but the gracious words would not reach her spirit they were to her as a feast in a hungry mans dream  robert alone was aware of the struggles through which she was passing and he could do little in direct aid of her the bookseven the passages of scripture that he found for herseemed to fall short it was as though the sufferer in the wilderness lay in sight of the brazen serpent but his eyes were holden that he could not see it  only the governesss strong and untaxed health could have carried her through her distress and fatigue for she continued to engross the most trying share of the nursing anxious to shield phoebe from even the knowledge of all the miseries of berthas nights when the poor child would start on her pillow with a shriek gaze wildly round trembling in every limb the dew starting on her brow face wellnigh convulsed teeth chattering and strange incoherent words  a dream only a dream she murmured recovering consciousness  what was only a dream asked miss fennimore one night  oh nothing but she still shivered then striving to catch hold of the broken threads of her philosophy how ones imagination is a prey totowhat is it  toto old impressionswhen one is weak  what kind of impressions asked miss fennimore resolved to probe the matter  bertha whose defect of speech was greatly increased by weakness was long in making her answer comprehensible but miss fennimore gathered it at last and it made her spirit quake for it referred to the terrors beyond the grave  yet she firmly answered  such impressions may not always result from weakness  i thought cried bertha rising on her elbow i thought that an advanced state of civilization dispenses with sectariani mean superstitiousliteral threats  no civilization can change those decrees nor make them unmerited said miss fennimore sadly  how repeated bertha frowning  you too  you dont mean that  you are not one of the narrow minds that want to doom their fellowcreatures for ever  her eyes had grown large round and bright and she clutched miss fennimores hand gasping say not for ever  my poor child did i ever teach you it was not  you thought so cried bertha enlightened people think so  o sayonly say it does not last  bertha i cannot  god forgive me for the falsehoods to which i led you the realities i put aside from you  bertha gave a cry of anguish and sank back exhausted damps of terror on her brow but she presently cried out if it would not last  i cant bear the thought  i cant bear to live but i cant die  oh who will save me  to miss fennimores lips rose the words of st paul to the jailer  believe believe cried bertha petulantly believe what  believe that he gave his life to purchase your safety and mine through that eternity  and miss fennimore sank on her knees weeping and hiding her face  the words which she had gazed at and listened to in vain longing hadeven as she imparted themtouched herself in their fulness  she had seen the face of truth when at mrs fulmorts deathbed she had heard phoebe speak of the blood that cleanseth from all sin  then it had been a moments glimpse  she had sought it earnestly ever since and at length it had come to nestle within her own bosom  it was not sight it was touchit was embracing and holding fast  alas the sight was hidden from bertha  she moodily turned aside in vexation as though her last trust had failed her  in vain did miss fennimore feeling that she had led her to the brink of an abyss of depth unknown till she was tottering on the verge lavish on her the most tender cares  they were requited with resentful gloom that the governess felt to be so just towards herself that she would hardly have been able to lift up her head but for the new reliance that gave peace to deepening contrition  that was a bad night and the day was worse  bertha had more strength but more fever and the muchenduring phoebe could hardly be persuaded to leave her to miss charlecote at dusk and air herself with her brothers in the garden  the weather was close and misty and honora set open the door to admit the air from the open passage window  a low soft lulling sound came in so much softened by distance that the tune alone showed that it was an infant school ditty sung by maria while rocking herself in her low chair over the schoolroom fire  turning to discover whether the invalid were annoyed by it honor beheld the hard keen little eyes intently fixed until presently they filled with tears and with a heavy sigh the words broke forth oh to be as silly as she is  as selig you mean said honor kindly  it is the same thing she said with a bitter ring in her poor worn voice  no it is not weakness that makes your sister happy  she was far less happy before she learnt to use her powers lovingly  with such earnestness that her stuttering was very painful to hear she exclaimed miss charlecote i cant recollect thingsi get puzzledi dont say what i want to say  tell me is not my brain softening or weakening  you know maria had water on the head once and her accents were pitiably full of hope  indeed my dear you are not becoming like maria  if i were said bertha certainly showing no such resemblance i suppose i should not know it  i wonder whether maria be ever conscious of her ich said she with a weary sigh as if this were a companion whence she could not escape  dear child your ich would be set aside by living to others who only seek to make you happier  i wish they would let me alone  if they had there would have been an end of it  an endno indeed my poor child  there cried bertha thats what it is to live  to be shuddered at  no bertha i did not shudder at the wild delusion and indiscretion which may be lived down and redeemed but at the fearful act that would have cut you off from all hope and chained you to yourself and such a self for ever never to part from the shame whence you sought to escape yes surely there must have been pleading in heaven to win for you that instants relenting  rescued twice over there must be some work for you to do something to cast into shade all that has passed  it will not destroy memory she said with hopeless indifference  no but you may be so occupied with it as to rise above your present pain and humiliation and remember them only to gather new force from your thankfulness  what that i was made a fool of cried bertha with sharpness in her thin voice  that you were brought back to the new life that is before you  though bertha made no answer honor trusted that a beginning had been made but only to be disappointed for the fever was higher the next day and bertha was too much oppressed for speech  the only good sign was that in the dusk she desired that the door should be left open in case maria should be singing  it was the first preference she had evinced the brothers were ready to crown maria and she sang with such goodwill that phoebe was forced to take precautions fearing lest the harmony should lose the modest charm of not too much  there ensued a decided liking for marias company partly no doubt from her envied deficiency and her ignorance of the extent of berthas misdemeanour partly because there was less effort of mind in intercourse with her  her pleasure in waiting on her sister was likewise so warm and grateful that bertha felt herself conferring a favour and took everything from her in a spirit very different from the dull submission towards miss fennimore or the peevish tyranny over phoebe  towards no one else save miss charlecote did she show any favour for though their conversation was never even alluded to it had probably left a pleasant impression and possibly she was entertained by honors systematic habit of talking of the world beyond to the other nurses in her presence  but these likings were far more scantily shown than her dislikes and it was hard for her attendants to acquiesce in the physicians exhortations to be patient till her spirits and nerves should have recovered the shock  even the entrance of a new housemaid threw her into a trepidation which she was long in recovering and any proposal of seeing any person beyond the few who had been with her from the first occasioned trembling entreaties and tears  phoebe after her brief heroineship had lapsed into quite a secondary position  in the reaction of the brothers feeling towards each other they almost left her out  both were too sure of her to be eager for her and besides as bertha slowly improved mervyns prime attention was lavished on the endeavour to find what would give her pleasure  and in the sick room miss fennimore and miss charlecote could better rule while maria was preferred as a companion  honor often admired to see how content phoebe was to forego the privilege of waiting on her sister preparing pleasures and comforts for her in the background and committing them to the hands whence they would be most welcome without a moments grudge at her own distastefulness to the patient  she seemed to think it the natural consequence of the superiority of all the rest and fully acquiesced  sometimes a tear would rise for a moment at berthas rude petulance but it was dashed off for a resolute smile as if with the feeling of a child against tears and she as plainly felt the background her natural position as if she had never been prominent from circumstances  whatever was to be done she did it and she was far more grateful to mervyn for loving robert and enduring maria than for any preference to herself  always finding cause for thanks she rejoiced even in the delay caused by berthas illness and in roberts stay in his brothers home where she had scarcely dared to hope ever to have seen him again  week after week he remained constantly pressed by mervyn to delay his departure and not unwillingly yielding since he felt that there was a long arrear of fraternal kindness to be made up and that while st matthews was in safe hands he might justly consider that his paramount duty was to his brother and sisters in their present need  at length however the lent services claimed him in london and affairs at beauchamp were so much mended that phoebe owned that they ought no longer to detain him from his parish although bertha was only able to be lifted to a couch took little notice of any endeavour to interest her and when he bade her farewell hardly raised eye or hand in return    chapter xxii       when all is done or said        in th end this shall you find     he most of all doth bathe in bliss        that hath a quiet mindlord vaux  robert had promised to return in the end of march to be present at the assizes when the burglars would be tried and he did not come alone mr crabbe judged it time to inspect beauchamp and decide for his wards and lady bannerman between julianas instigations her own pride in being connected with a trial and her desire to appropriate phoebe decided on coming down with the admiral to see how matters stood and to give her vote in the family council  commissions from mervyn had pursued robert since his arrival in town all for berthas amusement and he brought down by special orders a musicalbox all leechs illustrations and a small maltese dog like a spunglass lion which augusta had in vain proposed to him to exchange for her pug which was getting fat and wheezy and would amuse bertha just as well  lady bannerman hardly contained her surprise when maria as well as mervyn and phoebe met her in the hall seemingly quite tame and at her ease  mervyn looked better and in answer to inquiries for bertha answered oh getting on decidedly we have her in the garden she might drive out only she has such a horror of meeting any one but her spirits are better i really thought she would have laughed yesterday when maria was playing with the kitten  ha the dog have you got him robert  well if this does not amuse her i do not know what will  and at the first possible moment mervyn maria and the maltese were off through the open window  robert asked what phoebe thought of mervyn she said he was much stronger but the doctor was not satisfied that the mischief was removed and feared that a little want of care or any excitement might bring on another attack  she dreaded the morrow on his account  yes said the elder sister i dont wonder  a most atrocious attempt i declare i could hardly make up my mind to sleep in the house  mind you swear to them all my dear  i only saw smithson clearly  oh never mind if they have not done that they have done something quite as bad and i should never sleep a night again in peace if they got off  was it true that they had packed up all the liqueurs  phoebe exonerated them from this aggravated guilt  i say my dear would you tell the butler to bring up some of the claret that was bought at mr rollestones auction  i told sir nicholas that he should taste it and i dont like to mention it to poor mervyn as he must not drink wine  there is some up said phoebe mervyn fancies that bertha liked it  my dear you dont give bertha that claret you dont know what poor papa gave for it  if bertha would only enjoy anything mervyn would be overjoyed  yes it is as juliana says it is nothing but spoiling that ails her said augusta  did you say she was in the garden  i may as well go and see her  this phoebe withstood with entreating looks and representations that bertha had as yet seen no fresh face and was easily startled but her sister insisted that she was no stranger and could do no harm till phoebe had no choice but to run on and announce her in the hope that surprise might lessen the period of agitation  in the sunniest and most sheltered walk was a wheeled chair over which miss fennimore held a parasol while mervyn and maria were anxiously trying to win some token of pleasure from the languid inanimate occupant to whom they were displaying the little dog  as the velvetbordered silk crimson shawl and purple bonnet neared the dark group a nervous tremor shot through the sick girls frame and partly starting up she made a gesture of scared entreaty but lady bannermans portly embrace and kind inquiries were not to be averted  she assured the patient that all was well since she could get out of doors the air would give her a famous appetite and if she was able to drink claret she would be strong enough in a day or two to come up to juliana in london where change and variety would set her up at once  bertha scarcely answered but made an imperious sign to be drawn to the west wing and as phoebe succeeded in turning augustas attention to the hothouses mervyn beckoned to robert rather injudiciously for his patient was still tremulous from the first greeting  her face had still the strangely old appearance her complexion was nearly white her hair thin and scanty the almost imperceptible cast of the eye which had formerly only served to give character to her arch expression had increased to a decided blemish and her figure which had shot up to womans height seemed to bend like a reed as mervyn supported her to the sofa in the schoolroom  with nervous fright she retained his hand speaking with such long helpless hesitation that robert caught only the words juliananever  never never answered mervyn dont fear  well prevent that robert tell her that she shall not fall into julianas handsno nor do anything against her will  only after repeated assurances from both brothers that augusta should not carry her off in her present state did she rest tranquilly on the sofa while mervyn after waiting on her assiduously with touching tenderness as if constantly imploring her to be pleased applied himself to playing with the dog watching her face for some vestige of interest and with so much gratification at the slightest sign of amusement as to show how melancholy must have been the state compared with which this was improvement  after slowly attaining her present amount of convalescence she had there stopped short without progress in strength or spirits and alarms constantly varying for her head spine and lungs as if the slightest accidental cause might fix permanent disease in either quarter and to those who daily watched her and knew the miserable effects produced by the merest trifles it was terrible to think that her destination was in the hands of a comparative stranger urged on by the dull augusta and the acid juliana  mervyn needed no severer penalty for having forfeited his right to protect his sisters attached to them and devoted to bertha as the anxieties of the spring had rendered him  the sight of bertha had so far modified lady bannermans scheme that she proposed herself to conduct the three to brighton and there remain till the london season when the two younger could be disposed of in some boardingschool and phoebe conducted to alburystreet  mr crabbe did not appear averse to this offer and there was a correctness about it which rendered it appalling to those who had not phoebes quiet trust that no part of it would be allowed to happen unless it were good for them  and she found her eldest brother so much subdued and less vituperative that she thought him quite obliged by her experienced counsel on his housekeeping and cookery breaking up his present establishment and letting the house for a year during which she promised him all facilities for meeting a young widow the wealth of whose stockbroking husband would be exactly what his business and estate required and would pay off all his debts  phoebe saw indications on mervyns countenance which made it no surprise that he was in such a condition in the morning that only copious loss of blood and the most absolute rest to the last moment enabled him to go to w for the trial  miss charlecote had undertaken the care of bertha that miss fennimore might take charge of maria who was exceedingly eager to see her brother and sister give evidence  there is no need to dwell on the proceedings  it was to phoebe on a larger scale what she had previously gone through  she was too much occupied with the act before god and her neighbour to be selfconscious or to think of the multitudes eagerly watching her young simple face or listening to her grave clear tones  a dim perception crossed lady bannermans mind that there really might be something in little phoebe when she found the sheriffs wife the grande dame of the hunting field actually shedding tears of emotion  as soon as mervyns own evidence had been given he had been obliged to go to the inn and lie down and phoebe wished to join him there and go home at once  both robert and sir john raymond were waiting for her at the door of the witnessbox and the latter begged to introduce the sheriff who pressed her to let him take her back into court to lady bannerman his wife wished so much to see her there and at luncheon  and when phoebe declared that she must return to her brother she was told that it had been settled that she was to come with sir nicholas and lady bannerman to dine and sleep at the sheriffs next day after the assize was over to meet the judges  phoebe was almost desperate in her refusals and was so little believed after all that she charged robertwhen the sheriff had taken leaveto assure augusta of the impossibility of her accepting the invitation  sir john smiled saying lady caroline scarcely deserved her and added here is another who wishes to shake hands with you and this time i promise that you shall not be persecutedmy brother  he was a thin spare man who might have been taken for the elder brother with a gentle dreamy expression and soft tender voice such as she could not imagine being able to cope with pupils  he asked after her brothers health and she offered to ascertain whether mervyn felt well enough to see him but he thanked her saying it was better not  it could not have been his doing thought phoebe as she went upstairs  how strongminded cecily must be  i wonder whether she would have done bertha good  whose voice was that exclaimed mervyn at his door above  sir john raymond and his brother  are they coming in  no they thought it might disturb you  phoebe was glad that these answers fell to the share of the unconscious robert  mervyn sat down and did not revert to the raymonds through all the homeward journey  indeed he seemed unequal to speaking at all went to his room immediately and did not appear again when the others came home bringing tidings that the verdict was guilty and the sentence penal servitude  lady bannerman had further made a positive engagement with the sheriffs lady and was at first incredulous then highly displeased at phoebes refusal to be included in it  she was sure it was only that phoebe was bent on her own way and thought she should get it when left at home with her guardian and her brothers  poor phoebe she did not so much as know what her own way was  she had never so much wished for her wise guardian but in the meantime the only wisdom she could see was to wait patiently and embrace whatever proposal would seem best for the others though with little hope that any would not entail pain and separation from those who could spare her as ill as she could spare them  dr martyn was to come over in the course of the ensuing day to examine bertha and give her guardian his opinion of her state  there was little danger of its being favourable to violent changes for augusta made a descent on the schoolroom after dinner and the morbid agitation thus occasioned obliged miss fennimore to sit up with the patient till one oclock  in the morning the languor was extreme and the cough so frequent that the fear for the lungs was in the ascendant  but augusta knowing of all this believed her visit to have been most important and immediately after breakfast summoned robert to a conference that he might be convinced that there must be no delay in taking measures for breaking up the present system  we must hear what dr martyn says  i never thought anything of dr martyn since he advised me to leave off wine at supper  as juliana says a physician can always be taken in by an artful woman and he is playing into her hands  into whose said robert unable to suppose it could be phoebes  come robert you ought not to let yourself be so blinded  i am sure it is more for your interest than my own but i see you are as simple as ever  juliana said any one could hoodwink you by talking of altarcloths and anglosaxons  anglocatholics possibly  well it is all the same  it is those nonsensical distinctions rather than your own interests but when you are cut out and depend upon it she will lose no time in his state of health  of whom or what are you talking  i never thought well of her pretending to drink nothing but water and with that short dry way that i call impertinence but i never thought she could be so lost till last night  why when i thought i would just go and see how the child wasthere after calling himself too ill to come in to dinner there sat mervyn actually drinking tea  i promise you they looked disconcerted  well they might be  bertha suffered half the night from that sudden visit  and you believe that robert  well it is a convenient blind  but if you wont we shall do our best to shame them and if she dares it we shall never visit her  thats all  her drift here becoming revealed to robert his uncontrollable smile caused augusta to swell with resentment  aye nothing on earth will make you own yourself mistaken or take the advice of your elders though you might have had enough of upholding phoebes wilfulness  well what do you want me to do  to join us all in seeing that miss fennimore leaves the house before us then i will take the girls to brighton and you and the actons might keep watch over him and if he should persist in his infatuationwhy in the state of his head it would almost come to a commission of lunacy juliana said so  i have no doubt of it said robert gravely  i am obliged to you both augusta  as you observe i am the party chiefly concerned therefore i have a right to request that you will leave me to defend my interests as i shall see best and that you will confide your surmise to no one else  robert was not easily gainsaid when he spoke in that tone and besides augusta really was uncertain whether he did not seriously adopt her advice but though silenced towards him she did not abstain from lamenting herself to miss charlecote who had come by particular request to consult with dr martyn and enforce his opinion on mr crabbe honora settled the question by a laugh and an assurance that mervyn had views in another direction but augusta knew of so many abortive schemes for him and believed him to be the object of so many reports that she treated this with disdain and much amused honora by her matronly superiority and london patronage  dr martyn came to luncheon and she endeavoured to extort from him that indulgence hurt bertha and that mervyn needed variety  failing in this she remembered his antisupper advice and privately warned mr crabbe against him  his advice threw a new light on the matter  he thought that in a few weeks time bertha ought to be taken to switzerland and perhaps spend the winter in the south of france  travelling gave the best hope of rousing her spirits or bracing her shattered constitution but the utmost caution against fatigue and excitement would be requisite she needed to be at once humoured and controlled and her morbid repugnance to new attendants must be respected till it should wear off of its own accord  surely this might be contrived between sister governess and german nurse and if mr fulmort himself would go too it would be the best thing for his health which needed exemption from business and excitement  here was playing into the governesss hands  mindful of julianas injunctions lady bannerman announced her intention of calling heaven and earth together rather than sanction the impropriety and set off for her party at the sheriffs in a mood which made phoebe tremble lest the attractions of ortolans and burgundy should instigate the tremendous sacrifice of becoming chaperon  mervyn thought the doctors sentence conclusive as to miss fennimores plans but to his consternation it made no change in them except that she fixed the departure of the family as the moment of parting  though her manner towards him had become open and friendly she was deaf to all that he could urge declaring that it was her duty to leave his sisters and that the change when once made would be beneficial to bertha by removing old associations  in despair he came to miss charlecote begging her to try her powers of persuasion for the sake of poor bertha now his primary object whom he treated with spoiling affection  he was quite powerless to withstand any fancy of bertha in her present state and not only helpless without miss fennimore but having become so far used to her that for his own sake he could not endure the notion of a substitute  find out the objection he said that at least i may know whether to punch augustas head  honora gratified him by seeking an interview with the governess though not clear herself as to the right course and believing that her advice had she any to give would go for very little with the learned governess miss fennimore was soft and sad but decided and begging to be spared useless arguments  whether lady bannerman had insulted her by hinting her suspicions honor could not divine for she was firmly entrenched within her previous motive namely that it would be wrong to remain in a family where first her system and then her want of vigilance had produced such results  and to the representation that for her own sake the present conjuncture was the worst in which she could depart she replied that it mattered not since she saw her own deficiencies too plainly ever to undertake again the charge of young ladies and only intended to find employment as a teacher in a school  say no more she entreated and above all do not let phoebe persuade me and there were tears on either cheek  indeed i believe her not having done so is a most unselfish act of deference to your judgment  i know it for a sign of true affection  you who know what she is can guess what it costs me to leave her above all now that i am one in faith with her and could talk to her more openly than i ever dared to do she whose example first showed me that faith is a living substance  yes miss charlecote i am to be received into the church at st wulstans where i shall be staying as soon as i have left beauchamp  overcome with feeling honora hastily rose and kissed the governesss forehead her tears choking her utterance  butbut she presently said that removes all possible doubt  does not robert say so  he does said miss fennimore but i cannot think so  after having miserably infused my own temper of rationalism how could i as a novice and learner fitly train that poor child  besides others of the family justly complain of me and i will not be forced on them  no nor let my newlywon blessing be alloyed by bringing me any present advantage  i honour youi agree with you said miss charlecote sadly but it makes me the more sorry for those poor girls  i do not see what is to be done  a stranger will be worse than no one to both the invalids lieschen has neither head nor nerve and though i do not believe phoebe will ever give way bertha behaves very ill to her and the strain of anxiety may be too much for such a mere girl barely twenty  she may suffer for it afterwards if not at the time  i feel it all sighed miss fennimore but it would not justify me in letting myself be thrust on a family whose confidence in me has been deceived  nobody could go with them but you miss charlecote  me how much obliged mervyn would be laughed honora  it was a wild wish such as crosses the mind in moments of perplexity and distress but no one else could be so welcome to my poor bertha nor be the motherly friend they all require  forgive me miss charlecote but i have seen what you made of phoebe in spite of me and my system  so honor returned to announce the illsuccess of her mission  there said mervyn goodness knows what will become of us  bertha would go into fits at the sight of any stranger and such a hideous old catamaran as juliana will be sure to have in pickle will be the death of her outright  i think miss charlecote had better take pity on us  oh mervyn impossible cried phoebe shocked at his audacity  i protest said mervyn nothing else can save you from some nasty halfbred companion  faugh  now miss charlecote would enjoy the trip put maria and bertha to bed and take you to operas and pictures and churches and you would all be off my hands  for shame mervyn cried phoebe crimson at his cavalier manner  it is the second such compliment i have received phoebe said honor miss fennimore does me the honour to tell me to be her substitute  then if she says so said mervyn it is our only rescue  if honor laughed it was not that she did not think  as she crossed the park she felt that each bud of spring beauty each promised crop each lamb each village child made the proposal the more unwelcome yet that the sense of being rooted and hating to move ought to be combated  it might hardly be treating humfreys goodly heritage aright to make it an excuse for abstaining from an act of love and since brooks attended to her so little when at home he could very well go on without her  not that she believed that she should be called on to decide  she did not think mervyn in earnest nor suppose that he would encumber himself with a companion who could not be set aside like a governess and was of an age more proper and efficient than agreeable  his unceremonious manner proved sufficiently that it was a mere joke and he would probably laugh his loud scoffing laugh at the old maid taking him in earnest  yet she could not rid herself of the thought of phoebes difficulties and in poor bertha she had the keen interest of nurse towards patient  once before she thought have i gone out of the beaten track upon impulse  cruel consequences  yet do i repent  not of the act but of the error that ensued  then i was eager young romantic  now i would rather abstain i am old and sluggish  if it is to be it will be made plain  i do not distrust my feeling for phoebeit is not the jealous hungering love of old and i hope to be able to discern whether this be an act of charity  at least i will not take the initiative  i did so last time  honors thoughts and speculations were all at beauchamp throughout the evening and the early morning till her avocations drove it out of her mind  she was busy trying hard to get her own way with her bailiff as to the crops when she was interrupted by tidings that mr fulmort was in the drawingroom and concluding it to be robert she did not hurry her argument upon guano  on entering the room however she was amazed at beholding not robert but his brother cast down in an armchair and looking thoroughly tired out  mervyn  i did not expect to see you  yes i just walked over  i thought i would report progress  i had no notion it was so far  and in fact he had not been at the holt since as a pert boy he had found it slow  honor was rather alarmed at his fatigue and offered varieties of sustenance which he declined returning with eager nervousness to the subject in hand  the bannermans he said had offered to go with bertha and phoebe but only on condition that maria was left at a boardinghouse and a responsible governess taken for bertha  moreover augusta had told bertha herself what was impending and the poor child had laid a clinging trembling grasp on his arm and hoarsely whispered that if a stranger came to hear her story she would die  alas it might be easier than before  he had promised never to consent  but what can i do he said with a hand upon either temple they heed me no more than maria  robert had absolutely half consented to leave his cure in the charge of another and conduct his brother and sisters but this plan did not satisfy the guardian who could not send out his wards without some reliable female  he swung the tassel of the sofacushion violently as he spoke and looked imploringly at honora but she though much moved felt obliged to keep her resolution of not beginning  very hard he said that when there are but two women in the world that that poor child likes she can have neither and then gaining hope from something in her face he exclaimed after all i do believe you will take pity on her  i thought you in joke yesterday  i thought it too good to be true  i am not so cool as phoebe thought me  but really he said assuming an earnest rational gentlemanly manner you have done so much for us that perhaps it makes us presume and though i know it is preposterous yet if it were possible to you to be long enough with poor bertha to bring her round again i do believe it would make an infinite difference  what does phoebe say asked honor  phoebe poor child she does not know i am come  she looks as white as death and got up a smile that was enough to make one cry but she told me not to mind for something would be sure to bring it right and so it will if you will come  but mervyn you dont consider what a nuisance i shall be to you  mervyn looked more gallant than robert ever could have done and said something rather foolish but anxiety quickly made him natural again and he proceeded after all they need not bother you much  phoebe is of your own sort and maria is inoffensive and bertha will have lieschen and iill take my own line and be as little of a bore as i can youll go  ifif it will do  that odd answer was enough  mervyn already leaning forward with his arms on his knees held out one hand and shaded his eyes with the other as half with a sob he said there then it is all right  miss charlecote you cant guess what it is to a man not to be trusted with his own sisters  these words made that bete noire john mervyn fulmort nearly as much a child of her own as his brother and sister for they were in a tone of selfblamenot of resentment  she was sufficiently afraid of him to respect his reserve moreover he looked so ill and harassed that she dreaded his having an attack and heartily wished for phoebe so she only begged him to rest till after her early dinner when she would convey him back to beauchamp and then left him alone while she went to look her undertaking in the face rather amused to find herself his last resource and surprised to find her spirit of enterprise rising her memories of alps lakes cathedrals and pictures fast assuming the old charm that had erst made her long to see them again  and with phoebe  really it would be almost a disappointment if the scheme failed  when she again met her unwonted guest he plunged into plans routes and couriers treating her as far more completely pledged than she chose to allow and eating as heartily as he dared and more so than she thought phoebe would approve  she was glad to have him safe at his own door where phoebe ran to meet them greatly relieved for she had been much disturbed by his absence at luncheon  miss charlecote  did you meet him  i went after herand mervyn boyishly caught his sister round the waist and pushed her down into a curtseymake your obedience she is going to look after you all  going with us cried phoebe with clasped hands  to see about it began honor but the words were strangled in a transported embrace  dearest dearest miss charlecote  oh i knew it would all come right if we were patient but oh that it should be so right  oh mervyn how could you  ah you see what it is not to be fainthearted  and phoebe whose fault was certainly not a faint heart laughed at this poor jest as she had seldom laughed before with an abandon of gaiety and joyousness the quiet girl was absolutely thrown off her balance laughed and cried thanked and exclaimed moved restlessly and spoke incoherently  oh may i tell bertha she asked  no ill do that said mervyn  it is all my doing  run after him phoebe said honor  dont let bertha think it settled  and bertha was of course disappointingly indifferent  lady bannermans nature was not capable of great surprise but miss charlecotes proposal was not unwelcome  i did not want to go she said though dear sir nicholas would have made any sacrifice and it would have looked so for them to have gone alone  travelling with an invalid is so trying and phoebe made such a rout about maria that mr crabbe insisted on her going  but you like the kind of thing  honor undertook for her own taste for the kind of thing and her ladyship continued yes you must find it uncommonly dull to be so much alone where did juliana tell me she had heard of lucy sandbrook  she is in staffordshire answered honor gravely  ah yes with mrs willis beaumont i remember  juliana made a point of letting her know all about it and how you were obliged to give her up  i hope not exclaimed honor alarmed  i never gave her up  there is no cause but her own spirit of independence that she should not return to me tomorrow  oh indeed said augusta carelessly letting the subject drop after having implanted anxiety too painful to be quelled by the hope that lady actons neighbourhood might have learnt how to rate her words  mr crabbe was satisfied and complimentary robert rejoiced and grateful and bertha for the first time set her will upon recovering and made daily experiments on her strength thus quickly amending though still her weakness and petulance needed the tenderest management and once when a doubt arose as to miss charlecotes being able to leave home she suddenly withered up again with such a recurrence of unfavourable symptoms as proved how precarious was her state  it was this evidence of the necessity of the arrangement that chiefly contributed to bring it to pass  when the pressure of difficulty lessened mervyn was half ashamed of his own conquest disliked the obligation and expected to be bored by the old girl as to phoebes intense disgust he would speak of miss charlecote  still in essentials he was civil and considerate and honor carefully made it evident that she did not mean to obtrude herself and expected him to sit loose to the female part of the company  divining that he would prefer the start from home not to be simultaneous and also favouring poor berthas shuddering horror of the direct line of railway to london she proposed that the ladies should work their way by easy journeys on cross lines to southampton whilst mervyn settled his affairs at the office and then should come to them with robert who had made it possible to take an easter holiday in which to see them safe to their destination in switzerland  phoebe tried to acquiesce in miss charlecotes advice to trust mervyns head to roberts charge and not tease him with solicitude but the being debarred from going to london was a great disappointment  she longed for a sight of st matthews and what would it not have been to see the two brothers there like brothers indeed  but she must be content with knowing that so it was  mervyns opposition was entirely withdrawn and though he did not in the least comprehend and was far from admiring his brothers aims still his name and his means were no longer withheld from supporting roberts purposes because he was such a good fellow it was a shame to stand in his way  she knew too rather by implication than confession that mervyn imagined his chief regrets for the enormous extravagance of the former year were because he had thus deprived himself of the power of buying a living for his brother as compensation for having kept him out of his fathers will  whether mervyn would ever have made the purchase and still more whether robert would have accepted it was highly doubtful but the intention was a step for which to be thankful and phoebe watched the growing friendliness of the long estranged pair with constantly new delight and anticipated much from mervyns sight of st matthews with eyes no longer jaundiced  she would gladly too have delayed the parting with miss fennimore who had made all her arrangements for a short stay with her relatives in london and then for giving lessons at a school  to phoebes loyal spirit it seemed hard that even miss charlecotes care should be regarded as compensating for the loss of the home friend of the last seven years and the closer dearer link was made known as she sat late over the fire with the governess on easter sunday evening their last at beauchamp  silent hitherto miss fennimore held her peace no longer but begged phoebe to think of one who on another sunday would no longer turn aside from the altar  phoebe lifted her eyes full of hope and inquiry and as she understood exclaimed o i am glad  i knew you must have some deep earnest reason for not being with us  you never guessed  i never tried  i saw that robert knew so i hoped  and prayed  yes you belonged to me  do i belong to you now  nay more than ever now  then my child you never traced my unsettled faithmy habit of testing mystery by reason never perplexed you  phoebe thought a moment and said i knew that robert distrusted though i never asked why  there was a time when i used to try to sift the evidence and logic of all i learnt and i was puzzled where faiths province began and reasoning ended  but when our first sorrow came all the puzzles melted and it was not worth while to argue on realities that i felt  since that i have read more and seen where my own ignorance made my difficulties and i have prizedyes adored the truths all the more because you had taught me to appreciate in some degree their perfect foundation on reasoning  strange said miss fennimore that we should have lived together so long acting on each other yet each unconscious of the others thoughts i see now  what to you was not doubt but desire for a reason for your hope became in poor bertha not disbelief but contempt and carelessness of what she did not feel  i shall never have a sense of rest till you can tell me that she enters into your faith  i am chiefly reconciled to leaving her because i trust that in her enfeebled dependent state she may become influenced by miss charlecote and by you  i cannot argue with her said phoebe  when she is well she can always puzzle me i lose her when she gets to her ego  you are the only one who can cope with that  the very reason for keeping away  dont argue  live and act  that was your lesson to me  phoebe did not perceive and miss fennimore loved her freedom from selfconsciousness too well even for gratitudes sake to molest her belief that the conversion was solely owing to roberts powers of controversy  that one fleeting glimpse of inner life was the true farewell  the actual parting was a practical matter of hurry of trains and separation of parcels with maria too busy with the maltese dog to shed tears or even to perceive that this was a final leavetaking with one of those whom she best loved    chapter xxiii       tak down tak down the mast of gowd     set up the mast of tree     it sets not a forsaken lady     to sail so gallantlyannie of lochroyan  quaint little whitecapped objects  the st wulstans girls marching to st pauls  ah the banner i helped to work  how well i remember the contriving that crozier upon it  how well it has worn  sweet honey must be in london it was the sight she most grudged missing  so thought lucilla sandbrook as a cab conveyed her through the whittingtonian intricacies  her residence with mrs willis beaumont was not a passage in her life on which she loved to dwell  neither party had been well content with the other though deference to mrs prendergast had held them together  the lady herself was worthy and kindhearted but dull and tedious and lucilla used to animation and intellect had wearied excessively of the platitudes which were meant as friendly conversation while her keen remarks and power of drollery and repartee were just sufficiently perceived to be dreaded and disliked  the children were like their mother and were frightened and distressed by her quickness and unreasonable expectations  their meek demure heaviness and complacency even at their sports made her positively dislike them all but one scapegrace boy in favour with no one and whom she liked more from perverseness and compassion than from any merits of his own  lady actons good offices gave the widow a tangible cause such as was an absolute satisfaction for her antipathy and shook the implicit trust in mrs prendergasts recommendation that had hitherto overridden her private sentiments yet still habitual awe of her sisterinlaw and her own easiness and dread of change left things in the same state until a crisis caused by a grand disturbance among the children  in the nice matter of meting out blame mammas partiality and the childrens ungenerosity left an undue share upon the scapegrace his indignant partisan fought his battles not wisely but too well lost temper and uttered sarcastic home truths which startled and stung the lady into the request for which she could hardly have nerved herself in cooler moments namely that they might part  this settled each secretly felt that there was something to be regretted and both equally wished that a new engagement should be made before the termination of the present should be made known at southminster  for this purpose every facility had been given for miss sandbrooks coming to town personally to answer two ladies to whom she had been mentioned  a family in the neighbourhood had already been tried but had declined her and mrs beaumont had shown her the note so stylish such strange stories afloat  lucilla felt it best to break upon new ground and wounded and depressed had yet resentment enough to bear her through boldly  she wished to inspect owens child and wrote to ask mrs murrell to give her a bed for a couple of nights venturing on this measure because in the old womans monthly report she had mentioned that mr fulmort had gone abroad for a fortnight  it had not been an exhilarating evening  small children were not much to lucillas taste and her nephew was not a flattering specimen  he had the whitened drawnup appearance of a child who had spent most of his life in a london cellar with a pinched little visage and preternaturallooking black eyes a squeaky little fretful voice and all the language he had yet acquired decidedly cockney  moreover he had the habits of a spoilt child and that a vulgar one and his grandmother expected his aunt to think him a prodigy  there was a vacant room where lucilla passed as much of her time as she could without an assumption of superiority but she was obliged to spend the evening in the small furnitureencumbered parlour and hear by turns of her nephews traits of genius of the merits of the preachers in catalley and the histories of the lodgers  the motherly mrs murrell had invited any of the young men whose hearts might be touched to attend her simple family worship and to lucillas discomfiture and her triumph a youth appeared in the evening and the young lady had her doubts whether the expounding were the attraction  it was a relief to quit the close underground atmosphere even for a cab and an inspecting lady must be better than that old woman thought poor lucy as heartily weary of mrs murrells tongue and her own graciousness she rattled through the streets  those long ranks of charity children renewed many an association of old  the festival which had been the annual event of honor charlecotes youth she had made the same to her children and cilla had not despised it till recently thoughts of better days of homefeelings of tenderness began to soften her  she had spent nearly two years without the touch of a kindred hand and for many months past had been learning what it was to be looked at by no loving eye  she was on her way to still greater strangers  no wonder her heart yearned to the gentle voice that she had once spurned and wellnigh in spite of herself she muttered  really i do think a kiss of poor honors would do me good  i have a great mind to go to her when i come back from kensington  if i have taken a situation she cannot suppose that i want anything from her  it would be very comfortable i should hear of owen  i will go  even if she be not in town i could talk to mrs jones and sit a quarter of an hour in the cedar room  it would be like meeting owen it would be rest and home  she felt quite happy and pleased with herself under this resolution but it was late before she could put it in practice  the lady at kensington rather started on entering the room where she had been waiting nearly an hour  i thought she said apologetically did my servant say miss sandbrook  lucilla assented and the lady a little discomposed asked a few questions furtively surveying her all the time seemed confused then begged her to take some luncheon  it was so long since mrs murrells not very tempting breakfast that the invitation was welcome even though the presence of a gentleman and an elderly lady showed that it was a pretext for a family inspection and again she detected the same start of surprise and a glance passing round the circle such as made her glad when afterwards an excuse was made for leaving her alone that she might apply to the glass to see whether anything were amiss in her dress  then first she remarked that hers was not the governess air  she had long felt very virtuous for having spent almost nothing on her clothes eking out her former wardrobe to the utmost and the loose dovecoloured jacket over her black silk skirt betrayed parisian make as did the exquisite rose once worn in her hair and now enlivening the white ribbon and black lace of the cheap straw bonnet far back upon the rippling hair turned back from her temples and falling in profuse ringlets  it was her ordinary unpremeditated appearance but she perceived that to these good people it was startlingly stylish and she was prepared for the confused intimation that there was no need for entering upon the discussion of terms  she had been detained too late to make her other call and the processions of tired children showed her that the service at st pauls was over  the depression of disappointment inclined her the more to the loving old face and she caused herself to be set down at the end of woolstonelane feeling as if drawn by a magnet as she passed the well known warehouse walls and as if it were home indeed when she reached the court door  it would not yield to her intimate manipulation of the old latcha bad sign and the bell reechoed in vacancy  again and again she rang each moment of exclusion awakening a fresh yearning towards the cedar fragrance every stare of passerby making her long for the safe shelter of the baywindowed parlour  at last a step approached and a greeting for the friendly old servant was on her tongues end  alas a strange face met her eye elderly respectable but guarded  miss charlecote was not at home not in town not at hiltonburygone abroad whither was not known  mrs jones  dead more than a year ago  every reply was followed by an attempt to close the door and it needed all lucys native hardihood all her ardent craving for her former home to venture on an entreaty to be admitted for a few minutes  she was answered that the house might be shown to no one without orders from mr parsons  her heart absolutely fainted within her as the heavy door was closed on her making her thoroughly realize her voluntary renunciation of home and protection and the dreariness of the world on which she had cast herself  anxiety on honors behalf began to awaken  nothing but illness could have induced her to leave her beloved holt and in the thought of her sick lonely and untended by the children she had fostered cilla forgave her adoption forgave her forgiveness forgave everything in the impulse to hasten to her to requite the obligation by the tenderest care  she had actually set off to the parsonage in quest of intelligence when she recollected that she might appear there as a discarded governess in quest of her offended patroness and her pride impelled her to turn back but she despatched mrs murrells little maid with a note saying that being in town for a day and hearing of miss charlecotes absence on the continent she could not help begging to be certified that illness was not the cause  the reply was brief and formal and it only altered lucillas uneasiness for mrs parsons merely assured her of miss charlecotes perfect health and said she was gone abroad with the fulmort family where there had been a good deal of illness  in her displeasure and desire to guard honora from becoming a prey to the unworthy sandbrooks mrs parsons never guessed at the cruelty of her own words and at the conclusion drawn from them  robert fulmort likewise absent  no doubt his health had broken down and honor was taking phoebe to be with him  she examined mrs murrell and heard of his activity indeed but of his recent absences from his parish and by and by the good woman bethought her of a report that mr fulmort was from home on account of his health  oh the misery of not daring to make direct inquiry  but the hard practical world was before her and the new situation was no longer a matter of wilful choice but of dire necessity  she would not be hastily thrust from her present post and would be lovingly received at southminster in case of need but she had no dependence save on her own exertions and perverse romance had died away into desolateness with strange desperate vehemence and determination not again to fail she bought the plainest of capfronts reduced her bonnet to the severest dowdiness hid straightened tightened the waving pale gold of her hair folded her travellingshawl oldwomanishly cast aside all the merely ornamental and glancing at herself muttered i did not know i could be so insignificant  little owen stared as if his beautiful aunt had lost her identity and mrs murrell was ready to embrace her as a convert to last nights exposition  perhaps the trouble was wasted for the lady mrs bostock did not seem to be particular  she was quite young easily satisfied and only eager to be rid of an embarrassing interview of a kind new to her the terms were fixed and before many weeks had passed lucilla was settled at a cottage of gentility in sight of her thames but on the essex side where he was not the same river to her and she found herself as often thinking that those tainted waters had passed the garden in woolstonelane as that they had sparkled under wrapworth bridge  it was the greatest change she had yet undergone  she was entirely the governess never the companion of the elders  her employers were mercantile wrapped up in each other busy and gay  the husband was all day in london and when the evenings were not given to society preferred spending them alone with his wife and children  in his absence the nursery absorbed nearly all the time the mother could spare from her company and her household  the children who were too old for playthings were consigned to the firstrate governess and only appeared in the evening  lucilla never left her schoolroom but for a walk or on a formal request to appear in the drawingroom at a party a solitude which she at first thought preferable to mrs willis beaumonts continued small chatter especially as the children were pleasant brisk and lovable having been well broken in by their swiss bonne  necessity had trained cilly in selfrestraint and the want of surveillance made her generous nature the more scrupulous in her treatment of her pupils she taught them diligently kept good order won their affection and gave them some of her own but nothing could obviate her growing weariness of holding intercourse with no mind above eleven years old  trouble and anxiety she had known before and even the terrible heartache that she carried about with her might have failed to wear down a being constituted as she was without the long solitary evenings and the total want of companionship  the first shock had been borne by the help of bustle and change and it was only as weeks passed on that care and depression grew upon her  lessons walks childrens games were oppressive in turn and though the last goodnight was a welcome sound yet the solitude that ensued was unspeakably forlorn reading she had never loved even had this been a house of books the children were too young to need exertion on her part to keep in advance of them and their routine lessons wore out her energies too much for her to turn to her own resources  she did little but repair her wardrobe work for the boy in whittingtonstreet and let thoughts drift through her mind  that deathbed scene at hyeres which had so often risen unbidden to her mind as she lay on her crib was revived again but it was not her father whose ebbing life she watched  it was one for whom she durst not ask save by an inquiry from her brother who had never dropped his correspondence with honora but owen was actively employed and his locality and habits were so uncertain that his letters were often astray for long together  his third year of apprenticeship had begun and lucillas sole hope of a change from her present dreary captivity was in his either returning with mr currie or finding employment and sending for her and his child to canada  by that time she thought europe will contain nothing to me  nay what does it contain that i have a right to care for now  i dont delude myself  i know his look and manner  his last thought will be for his flock at st matthews not for her who drove him to the work that has been killing him  oh no he wont even forgive me for he will think it the greatest service i could have done him  her eyes were hot and dry what a relief would tears have been    chapter xxiv       enid my early and my only love     i thought but that your father came between     in former days you saw me favourably     and if it were so do not keep it back     make me a little happier let me know ittennyson  the foreign tour proved a great success  the summer in the alps was delightful  the complete change gave bertha new life bodily strength first returning and then mental activity  the glacier system was a happy exchange for her ego and she observed and enjoyed with all the force of her acute intelligence and spirit of inquiry while phoebe was happy in doing her duty by profiting by all opportunities of observation in taking care of maria and listening to mervyn and miss charlecote enjoyed scenery poetry art and natural objects with relish keener than even that of her young friends who were less impressible to beauty in every shape  mervyn behaved very well to her knowing himself bound to make the journey agreeable to her he was constantly kind to bertha and in the pleasure of her revival submitted to a wonderful amount of history and science  all his grumbling was reserved for the private ear of phoebe whose privilege it always was to be his murmuring block and who was only too thankful to keep to herself his discontents whenever his route was not chosen and often when it was his disgusts with inns railroads and sights and his impatience of all pursuits save berthas  many a time she was permitted to see and hear nothing but how much he was bored but on the whole the growls were so mitigated compared with what she had known that it was almost contentment and that he did not absolutely dislike their habits was plain from his adherence to the ladies though he might have been quite independent of them  berthas distortion of eye and hesitation of speech though much modified always recurred from fatigue excitement or meeting with strangers orstill worsewith acquaintance  the difficulty of utterance distressed her far more than if she had been subject thereto from infancy and increased her exceeding repugnance to any sort of society beyond her own party  the question whether she were fit to return home for the winter was under debate when at geneva early in september tidings reached the travellers that produced such a shock as to settle the point  juliana acton was dead  it had been a very short attack of actual illness but disease had long been secretly preying on herand her asperity of disposition might be accounted for by constant unavowed suffering  it was a great blow  her unpleasant qualities were all forgiven in the dismay of learning what their excuse had been for those who have so lived as to make themselves least missed are perhaps at the first moment the more mourned by good hearts for that very cause  augusta was so much terrified on her own account that she might almost have been made a hydropathist on the spot and robert wrote that poor sir bevil was perfectly overwhelmed with grief and selfreproach giving himself no credit for his exemplary patience and forbearance but bitterly accusing himself of hardness and neglect  these feelings were shared in some degree by all the others and mervyn was especially affected  there had been much to soften him since his parents death and the sudden loss of the sister with whom he had always been on terms of scorn and dislike shocked him excessively and drew him closer to the survivors sobering him and silencing his murmurs for the time in real grief and awe  bertha likewise was thoroughly overcome not so much by these feelings as by the mere effect of the sudden tidings on her nervous temperament and the overclouding of the cheerfulness that had hitherto surrounded her  this added to a day of overfatigue and exposure brought back such a recurrence of unfavourable symptoms that a return to an english winter was not to be thought of  the south of france was decided upon at once and as lucilla had truly divined honor charlecotes impulse led them to hyeres that she might cast at least one look at the grave in the strangers corner of the cypressgrown burialground where rested the beloved of her early days the father of the darlings of her widowed heartloved and lost  she endured her absence from home far better than she had expected so much easier was it to stay away than to set off and so completely was she bound up with her companions loving phoebe like a parent and the other two like a nurse and really liking the brother  all took delight in the winter paradise of hyeres that fragment of the east set down upon the french coast and periodically peopled with a motley multitude of visitors from all the lands of europe all invalids or else attendants on invalids  bertha still shrank from all contact with society and the ladies for her sake lived entirely apart but mervyn made acquaintance and sometimes went out on short expeditions with other gentlemen or to visit his mercantile correspondents at marseilles or other places on the coast  it was while he was thus absent that the three sisters stood one afternoon on the paved terrace of the hotel des isles dor which rose behind them in light coloured stone of a kind of italianlooking architecture commanding a lovely prospect the mountains on the toulon side though near melting into vivid blue and white cloud wreaths hanging on their slopes  in front lay the plain covered with the peculiar graytinted olive foliage overtopped by date palms and sloping up into rounded hills covered with dark pines the nearest to the sea bearing on its crest the church de lermitage  the sea itself was visible beyond the olives bordered by a line of etangs or pools and white heaps of salt and broken by a peninsula and the three isles dor it was a view of which bertha seemed never able to have enough and she was always to be found gazing at it when the first ready for a walk  what are you going to sketch phoebe she said as the sisters joined her  how can you on such a day as this with the air as it were loaded with cheiranthus smell  it makes one lazy to think of it  it seems to be a duty to preserve some remembrance of this beautiful place  it may be a pity to miss it but as for the duty  what not to give pleasure at home and profit by opportunities  it is too hard to carry about an embodiment of miss fennimores rules why have you no individuality phoebe  must i not sketch then said phoebe smiling  you are very welcome if you would do it for your pleasure not as an act of bondage  not as bondage said phoebe it is only because i ought that i care to do so at all  and thats the reason you only make maps of the landscape  it was quite true that phoebe had no accomplished turn and what had been taught her she only practised as a duty to the care and cost expended on it and these were things where all her might was no equivalent for a spark of talent  ought alone gave her the zest that bertha would still have found in ought not  it is all i can do she said and miss fennimore may like to see them so bertha i shall continue to carry the sketchbook by which the english woman is known like the man by his murray  miss charlecote has letters to write so we must go out by ourselves  the provencal natives of hyeres had little liking for the foreigners who thronged their town but did not molest them and ladies walked about freely in the lovely neighbourhood so that honor had no scruple in sending out her charges unaccompanied except by lieschen in case the two others might wish to dispose of maria while they engaged in some pursuit beyond her powers  poor lieschen a plump prussian grown portly on beauchamp good living had little sympathy with the mountain tastes of her frauleins and would have wished all hyeres like the shelf on the side of the hill where stood their hotel whence the party set forth for the place des palmiers so called from six actual palms bearing but not often ripening dates  two sides were enclosed by houses on a third an orange garden sloped down the descent the fourth where the old town climbed straight up the hill was regarded by poor lieschen with dread and she vainly persuaded maria at least to content herself with joining the collection of natives resting on the benches beneath the palms  how willingly would the good german have produced her knitting and sought a compatriot among the nurses who sat gossiping and embroidering while maria might have played among their charges who were shovelling about or pelting each other with the tiny white seawashed pebbles that thickly strewed the place  but maria with the little maltese dog in her arms to guard him from a hailstorm of the pebbles was inexorably bent on following her sisters and bertha had hurried nervously across from the strangers so that lieschen must pursue those light steps through the winding staircase streets sometimes consisting of broad shallow steps sometimes of actual flights of steep stairs hewn out in the rock leading to a length of level terrace where through garden gates orange trees looked out dividing the vantage ground with houses and rocksup farther past the almost desolate old church of st paulfarther againtill beyond all the houses they came forth on the open mountainside with a crest of rock far above surmounted by the ruins of a castle said to have been fortified by the saracens and taken from them by charles martel  it was to this castle that phoebes sketching duty was to be paid and maria and bertha expressed their determination of climbing up to it in hopes as the latter said of finding charles martels original hammer  lieschen puffing and panting already looked horrified and laughingly they bade her sit down and knit whilst they set out on their adventure  phoebe smiled as she looked up and uttered a prognostic that made bertha the more defiant exhilarated as she was by the delicious compound of sea and mountain breeze and by the exquisite view the roofs of the town sloping rapidly down and the hills stretching round clothed in pine woods into which the gray olivettes came stealing up while beyond lay the sea intensely blue and bearing on its bosom the three isles dor flushed with radiant colour  the sisters bravely set themselves to scramble among the rocks each surface turned to the seabreeze exquisitely and fantastically tinted by coloured lichens and all interspersed with the classical acanthus noble leaves the juniper and the wormwood  on they went winding upwards as bertha hoped but also sideways and their circuit had lasted a weary while and made them exhausted and breathless when looking round for their bearings they found themselves in an enchanted maze of gray rocks half hidden in myrtle beset by the bristly battledores of prickly pear and shaded by cork trees  above was the castle perched up and apparently as high above them as when they began their enterprise below was a steep descent clothed with pines and adorned with white heaths the place was altogether strange they had lost themselves bertha began to repent of her adventure and maria was much disposed to cry  never mind maria said bertha we will not try to go any higher see here is the dry bed of a torrent that will make a famous path down there thats right  what a picture it is what an exquisite peep of the sea between the boughs  what now what frightens you  the old woman she looks so horrid  the witch for the lost children  no no maria she is only gathering fir cones and completing the picture in her red basquine brown jacket and great hat  i would ask her the way but that we could not understand her provencal  oh dear i wish phoebe was here i wish we were safe  if i ever come mountainclimbing again with you at my heels  take care theres no danger if you mind your feet and we must come out somewhere  the somewhere when the slope became less violent was among vineyards and olivettes no vestige of a path through them only a very small cottage picturesquely planted among the rocks whence proceeded the sounds of a cornetapiston  as bertha stood considering which way to take a dog flew out of the house and began barking  this brought out a man who rudely shouted to the terrified pair that they were trespassing they would have fled at once up the torrentbed bad as it was for ascent but there was a derisive exclamation and laugh and halfadozen men halftipsy came pouring out of the cottage bawling to colibri the rough shaggy white dog that seemed disposed to spring at the maltese in berthas arms  the foremost shouting in french for the sisters to stop pointed to what he called the way and bertha drew maria in that direction trusting that they should escape by submission but after going a little distance she found herself at the edge of a bare deep dry ravine steep on each side almost so as to be impassable  the path only ran on the other side  there was another shout of exultation and laughter at the english girls consternation  at this evident trick of the surly peasants maria shook all over and burst into tears and bertha gathering courage turned to expostulate and offer a reward but her horrible stammer coming on worse than ever produced nothing but inarticulate sounds  monsieur there is surely some mistake said a clear voice in good french from the path on the other side and looking across the sisters were cheered by an unmistakable english brown hat  the peasants drew back a little believing that the young ladies were not so unprotected as they had supposed and the first speaker with something like apology declared that this was really the path and descending where the sides were least steep held out his hand to help bertha  the lady whose bank was more practicable came down to meet them saying in french with much emphasis that she would summon those gentlemen to their assistance if desired words that had considerable effect upon the enemy  poor maria was in such terror that she could hardly keep her footing and the hands both of bertha and the unknown friend were needed to keep her from affording still more diversion to the peasants by falling prostrate the lady seemed intuitively to understand what was best for both and between them they contrived to hush her sobs and repress her inclination to scream for phoebe and thus to lead her on each holding a hand till they were at a safe distance and bertha whose terror had been far greater than at the robbery at home felt that she could let herself speak when she quivered out an agony of trembling thanks  i am glad you are safe from these vile men said the lady kindly though they could hardly have done anything really to hurt you  frenchmen should not laugh at english girls cried bertha  oh i wish my brothers were here and she turned round with a fierce gesture  phoebe phoebe i want phoebe and lieschen was marias cry  can i help you find your party was the next question and the voice had a gentle winning tone that reassured maria who clung tight to her hand exclaiming dont go away and though for months past the bare proposal of encountering a stranger would have made bertha almost speechless she felt a soothing influence that enabled her to reply with scarcely a hesitation  on comparing notes it was discovered that the girls had wandered so far away from their sister that they could only rejoin her by reentering the town and mounting again and their new friend seeing how nervous and agitated both still were offered to escort them only giving notice to her own party what had become of her  she had come up with some sketching acquaintance and not drawing herself had like the sisters been exploring among the rocks when she had suddenly come on them in the distress which had so much shaken them that reluctant to lose sight of their guardian they accompanied her till she saw one of her friends and then waited while she ran down with the announcement  how ridiculous it is in me muttered bertha to herself discontentedly she will think us wild creatures  i wish we were not both so tall  and embarrassment together with the desire to explain deprived her so entirely of utterance that maria volunteered bertha always speaks so funnily since she was ill  rather a perplexing speech for the lady to hear but instead of replying she asked which was their hotel and bertha answering she turned with a start of surprise and interest as if to see their faces better adding i have not seen you at the table dhote and under the strange influence of her voice and face bertha was able to answer no  as maria says i have been very silly since my illness in the winter andand they have given way to me and let me see no one  but we shall see you you are in our hotel cried maria  do come and let me show you all my swiss costumes  thank you if and she paused perhaps a little perplexed by maria and bertha added in the most womanly voice that she could muster my sister and miss charlecote will be very glad to see youvery much obliged to you  then maria who was unusually demonstrative put another question  are you ill  bertha says everybody here is ill  i hope you are not  no thank you was the reply  i am here with my uncle and aunt  it is my uncle who has been unwell  bertha afraid that maria might blunder into a history of her malady began to talk fast of the landscape and its beauties  the stranger seemed to understand her desire to lead away from herself and readily responded with a manner that gave sweetness to all she said  she was not very younglooking and marias notion might be justified that she was at hyeres on her own account for there was hardly a tint of colour on her cheek she was exceedingly spare and slender and there was a wasted worn look about the lower part of her face and something subdued in her expression as if some great lasting sorrow had passed over her her eyes were large brown soft and full of the same tender pensive kindness as her voice and smile and perhaps it was this air of patient suffering that above all attracted bertha in the soreness of her wounded spirit just as the affectionateness gained maria with the instinct of a child  however it might be phoebe who had become uneasy at their absence and only did not go to seek them from the conviction that nothing would set them so completely astray as not finding her at her post was exceedingly amazed to be hailed by them from beneath instead of above and to see them so amicably accompanied by a stranger  maria went on in advance to greet the newlyrecovered sister and tell their adventure and bertha as she saw phoebes pretty grateful selfpossessed greeting rejoiced that their friend should see that one of the three at least knew what to say and could say it  as they all crept down together through the rugged streets phoebe felt the same strange attraction as her sisters accompanied by a puzzling idea that she had seen the young lady before or some one very like her  phoebe was famous for seeing likenesses and never forgetting a face she had once seen her recognitions were rather a proverb in the family and she felt her credit almost at stake in making out the countenance before her but it was all in vain and she was obliged to resign herself to discuss the pyrenees where it appeared that their new friend had been spending the summer  at the inndoor they parted she going along a corridor to her aunts rooms and the three fulmorts hurrying simultaneously to miss charlecote to narrate their adventure  she was as eager as they to know the name of their rescuer and to go to thank her and ringing for the courier sent him to make inquiries  major and mrs holmby and their niece was the result and the next measure was miss charlecotes setting forth to call on them in their apartments and all the three young ladies wishing to accompany hereven bertha  what could this encounter have done to her phoebe withdrew her claim at once and persuaded maria to remain with the promise that her new friend should be invited to enjoy the exhibition of the book of swiss costumes and very soon she was admiring them after having received an explanation sufficient to show her how to deal with marias peculiarities  mrs holmby a commonplace goodnatured woman evidently knew who all the other party were and readily made acquaintance with miss charlecote who had on her side the same strange impression of knowing the name as phoebe had of knowing the face  bertha who slept in the same room with phoebe awoke her in the morning with the question what do you think is miss holmbys name  i did not hear it mentioned  no but you ought to guess  do you not see how names impress their own individuality  you need not laugh i know they do  could you possibly have been called augusta and did not katherine quite pervade miss fennimore  well according to your theory what is her name  it is either eleanor or cecily  indeed cried phoebe what put that into your head  her expressionno her entire wesen  something homely simple a little oldfashioned and yet refined  it is odd said phoebe pausing  what is odd  you have explained the likeness i could not make out  i once saw a photograph of a cecily with exactly the character you mention  it was that of which she reminded me  cecily  who could it have been  one of the raymond cousinhood  what oclock is it  oh dont get up yet phoebe i want to tell you miss holmbys history as i make it out  she said she was not ill but i am convinced that her uncle and aunt took her abroad to give her change not after illness but sorrow  yes i am sure she has known trouble  and said bertha stifling her voice so that her sister could hardly hear that sorrow could have been only of one kind  patient waiting is stamped on her brow  she is trying to lift up her head after cruel disappointment  oh i hope he is dead  and to phoebes surprise and alarm the poor little fortuneteller burst into tears and sobbed violently  there could be no doubt that her own disappointment rather than that which she ascribed to a stranger prompted this gush of feeling but it was strange for in all the past months the poor childs sorrow and shame had been coldly hardly silently borne  the new scenes had thrust it into abeyance and spirits and strength had forced trouble aside but this was the only allusion to it since her conversation with miss charlecote on her sick bed and the first sign of softening  phoebe durst not enter into the subject but soothed and composed her by caresses and cheerfulness but either the tears or perhaps their original causethe fatigue and terror of the previous dayhad entirely unhinged her and she was in such a nervous trembling state and had so severe a headache that she was left lying down under lieschens charge when the others went to the english chapel  her urgent entreaty was that they would bring miss holmby to her on their return  she had conceived almost a passion for this young lady secluded as she had been no intercourse beyond her own family had made known to her the pleasure of a friendship and her mind in its revival from its long exhaustion was full of ardour in the enthusiasm of a girls adoration of a fullgrown woman  the new and softening sensation was infinite gain even by merely lessening her horror of society and when the three churchgoers joined the holmby party on their way back from the chapel they begged as a kindness to an invalid for a visit to bertha  it was granted most readily as if equally pleasant to the giver of the kindness and to the receiver and the two young maidens walked home together  phoebe could not but explain their gratitude to any one who could rouse bertha saying that her spirits had received a great shock and that the effects of her illness on her speech and her eyes had made her painfully bashful  i am so glad was the hurried rather quivering answer  i am glad if i can be of any use  phoebe was surprised while gratified by the eager tenderness of her meeting with bertha who quite revived was in the sittingroom to greet her and seemed to expand like a plant in the sunshine under the influence of those sweet brown eyes  her liveliness and drollery awoke and her sister was proud that her new friend should see her cleverness and intelligence but all the time the likeness to that photograph continued to haunt phoebes mind as she continued to discover more resemblances and to decide that if such were impressed by the christian name bertha was a little witch to detect it  afternoon came and as usual they all walked seawards  as bertha said they had had enough of the heights and tried going towards the sea as their new friend wished although warned by the fulmorts that it was a long walk the etangs or great saltpools spoiling the coast as a beach  but all were brave walkers and exercise always did bertha good they had lovely views of the town as they wound about the hills and admired its old streets creeping up the hill and the two long wings stretching on either side  an iron cross stood up before the old church relieved by the exquisite radiance of the sunset sky  ah said honor i always choose to believe that is the cross to which the legend belongs  tell it please miss charlecote cried maria  and honor told a veritable legend of hyeresa moorish princess who had been secretly baptized and educated as a christian by her nurse a christian slave was beloved by a genie  she regarded him with horror pined away and grew thin and pale  her father thought to raise her spirits by marrying her and bestowed her on the son of a neighbouring king sending her off in full procession to his dominions  on the way however lay a desert where the genie had power to raise a sandstorm with which he overwhelmed the suite and flew away with the princess but he could not approach her she kept him at bay with the sign of the cross until enraged he drove her about on a whirlwind for three days and finally dashed her dead upon this coast  there she lay fair as an almond blossom and royally robed and the people of hyeres took her up and gave her honourable burial  when the king her father heard of it he offered to reward them with a cross of gold of the same weight as his daughter but said the townsmen oh king if we have a cross of gold the moors will come and slay us for its sake therefore give us the gold in coin and let the cross be of iron  and there it stands said the guest looking up  i hope it does said honor confronting as usual the commonsense led pupils of miss fennimore with her willing demicredulity  it is a beautiful story was the comment and like other traditions full of unconscious meaning  a speech this as if it had been made to delight honor whose eyes were met by a congratulatory glance from phoebe  at the farther words it is very strikingthe evil spirits power ending with the slaying the body never harming the soul nor bending the will  bending the will is harming the soul said phoebe  nay was her companions answer the fatal evil is when both wills are bent  phoebe was too singleminded too singlewilled at once to understand this till miss charlecote whispered a reference to st pauls words of deep experience to will is present with me  i see she said she might even have preferred the genie but as long as her principle and better will resisted she was safe from herself as well as from him  liked the nasty genie said maria who had listened only as to a fairy tale  why phoebe genies come out of bottles and go away in smoke lieschen told me  no indeed said bertha in a low voice of feeling piteous in one of her years if so it needed no outward whirlwind to fling her dead on the coast  and there she found peace answered the guest with a suppressed but still visible sign of weariness  oh it was worth the whirlwind  phoebe was forced to attend to maria whose imagination had been a good deal impressed and who was anxious to make another attempt on a pilgrimage to castle and cross  when mervyn comes back maria we may try  the guest who was speaking stopped short in the midst  had she been infected by berthas hesitation  she began again and seemed to have forgotten what she meant to have said  however she recovered herself and there was nothing remarkable through the rest of the walk but on coming indoors she managed to detain phoebe behind the others saying lightly miss fulmort you have not seen the view from my window phoebe followed to her little bedroom and gazed out at the lovely isles bathed in light so as to be almost transparent and the ship of war in the bay all shadowy and phantomlike  she spoke her admiration warmly but met with but a half assent  the owner of the room was leaning her head against the glass and with an effort for indifference said did i hear thatthat you were expecting your brother  you are cecily exclaimed phoebe instead of answering  and cecily turning away from the window leant against the wall for support and her pale face crimsoning said i thought you did not know  my sisters do not said phoebe but he told me whenwhen he hoped  and now you will help me said cecily hurrying out her words as if overpowering one of her wills  you will i know  i have promised my father and uncle to have nothing to do with him  do not let me be taken by surprise  give me notice that i may get aunt holmby away before he comes  oh must it be so cried phoebe  he is not like what he used to be  i have promised repeated cecily and grasping phoebes wrist she added you will help me to keep my promise  i will said phoebe in her grave reliable voice and cecily drew a long breath  there were five minutes of silence while phoebe stood studying cecily and thinking how much injustice she had done to her how little she had expected a being so soft and feeling in her firmness and grieving the more at mervyns loss  cecily at last spoke when will he come  we cannot tell most likely not for a week perhaps not for a fortnight it depends on how he likes corsica  i think my aunt will be willing to go said cecily  my uncle has been talking of nice  then must we lose you said phoebe when you are doing bertha so much good  i should like to be with you while i can if i may said cecily her eyes full of tears  did you know us at first said phoebe  i knew you were in this hotel and after your sisters had spoken and i saw berthas face i was sure who she was  i thought no one was with you but miss charlecote and that no one knew so that i might safely indulge myself  the word was out before she could recall it and trying as it were to hide it she said but how if you knew what had passed did you not sooner know it was i  because we thought your name was holmby  did you indeed  you did not know that my aunt holmby is my mothers sister  she kindly took me when my uncle was ordered to spend this winter abroad  you were ill and tried  bertha read that in your face  oh when you see how much difference  i must not see  do not talk of it or we must not be together and indeed it is very precious to me  she rested her head on phoebes shoulder and put an arm round her waist  only one thing i must ask she said presently is he well  quite well said phoebe  he has been getting better ever since we left home  then you did not know he was with us  no  it is not right for me to dwell on those things and they never mention any of you to me  but you will write to us now  you will not desert bertha  you do not know how much you are doing for her  dear child  she is so like what he was when first he came  if you could guess what she has suffered and how fond he is of her you would not turn away from her  you will let her be your friend  if it be right said cecily with tearful eyes but her mouth set into a steadfast expression as resolute as sweetly sad  you know better what is right than i do said phoebe i who feel for him and bertha  but if you have not heard from him for so long i think there are things you ought to know  at home at home said cecily there it may be right to listen  here i am trusted alone and i have only to keep my promise  tell me when i am at home and it will make me happy  though nonsense my wizened old face is enough to cure him and she tried to laugh  phoebe regretted what she had said of berthas impression and believed that the gentle worn face ought to be far more touching than the most radiant charms but when she strove to say that it was not beauty that mervyn loved she was hushed at once and by the same mild authority turned out of the room  well for her that she could tell her story to miss charlecote without breach of confidence  honors first impulse was displeasure with the aunt who she was sure had let her speak of though not to miss holmby without correcting her and must purposely have kept the whole raymond connection out of sight  depend upon it phoebe she said she will keep her niece here  poor cecily what will she do  i wish they would go for i feel sure that she will think it her duty to hold out against him till she has her fathers sanction she will seem hard and he  do not reckon too much on him phoebe  yes it is a hard saying but men care so much for youth and beauty that he may find her less attractive  he may not understand how superior she must have become to what she was when he first knew her  take care how you plead his cause without being sure of his sentiments  in fact honor thought cecily raymond so infinitely above mervyn fulmort at his very best that she could not regard the affair as hopeful under any aspect and the parties concerned being just at the time of life when a woman becomes much the elder of a man of the same years she fully expected that cecilys loss of bloom would entirely take away his desire to pursue his courtship  the next event was a diplomatic call from mrs holmby to sound miss charlecote whose name she knew as a friend both of the fulmorts and moorcroft raymonds and who she had feared would use her influence against so unequal a match for the wealthy young squire  when convinced of her admiration of cecily the good aunt proceeded to condemn the raymond pride  they called it religion but she was not so taken in what reasonable person heeded what a young man might have done when he was sowing his wild oats  no it was only that the baronet blood disdained the distillery whereas the fulmorts represented that good old family the mervyns and it was a very fine estate was not it  she had no patience with such nonsense not she  all sir johns doing for between themselves poor dear george raymond had no spirit at all and was quite under his brothers thumb  such a family and such a thing as it would be for them to have that girl so well married  she would not take her away  the place agreed with the major and she had told cecily she could not think of leaving it  phoebe saw how close a guard cecily must have learnt to keep on herself for not a tone nor look betrayed that she was suffering unusual emotion she occupied herself quietly and was most tenderly kind to bertha and maria exerting herself to converse with bertha and to enter into her pursuits as cheerfully as if her mind was disengaged  sometimes phoebe fancied that the exceeding gentleness of her voice indicated when she was most tried but she attempted no more teteatetes and miss charlecotes conjecture that in the recesses of her heart she was rejoiced to be detained by no fault of her own remained unverified phoebe resigned cecily for the present to berthas exclusive friendship competition would have been unwise even if the forbidden subject had not been a restraint where the secret was known while to soothe and cherish bertha and settle her mind to begin life again was a welcome and fitting mission for cecily and inclination as well as discretion therefore held phoebe aloof preventing maria from interfering and trusting that cecily was becoming berthas mr charlecote  mervyn came back sooner than she had expected him having soon tired of corsica  his year of illhealth and of her attendance had made him dependent on her he did not enter into novelty or beauty without bertha and his old restless demon of discontent made him impatient to return to his ladies  so he took phoebe by surprise walking in as she was finishing a letter to augusta before joining the others in the olivettes  well phoebe hows bertha  ready to leave this hotvapourbath of a hole  i dont know what you will say to it now she answered looking down and a little tremulous  who do you think is here  not hastings  if he dares to show his nose here ill get him hissed out of the place  no no something very different  well make haste he said in the grim voice of a tired man  she is herececily raymond  what of that  he sat down folded his arms and crossed his ankles the picture of dogged indifference  mervyn  what does it matter to me who comes or goes  dont stop to rehearse arrivals but ring for something to eat  an atrocious mistral  my throat is like a turnpike road  call it january  it is a mockery  phoebe obeyed him but she was in a ferment of wrath and consternation and clear of nothing save that cecily must be prepared for his appearance  she was leaving the room when he called her to ask what she was doing  i am going to tell the others that you are come  where are they  in the olive yards behind the hotel  dont be in such a hurry and ill come  thank you but i had better go on before  miss raymond is with them  it makes no odds to her  stop a minute i tell you  what is the matter with her  said with some uneasiness hidden by gruffness  she is not here for her own health but major holmby is rheumatic  oh that intolerable woman is here is she  then you may give miss charlecote notice to pack up her traps and well set off tomorrow  if a desire to box a mans ears ever tingled in phoebes fingers it was at that moment  not trusting herself to utter a word she went upstairs put on her hat and walked forth feeling as if the earth had suddenly turned topsyturvy with her and as if she could look no one in the face  set off tomorrow  he might tell miss charlecote himself she would not  yet after all he had been rejected  his departure might not torture cecily like the sight of his indifference  but what despair for bertha thought phoebe as she saw the friends pacing the paths between the rows of olives while miss charlecote and maria were gathering magnificent blue violets  at the first hint miss charlecote called to bertha who came reluctantly while phoebe with almost sickening pity murmured her tidings to cecilyadding i do not think he is coming out  he is having something to eat in hopes that this tardiness might be a preparation  she was relieved that bertha rushed back again to monopolize miss raymond and overwhelm her with schemes for walks under mervyns escort  cecily let her talk but made no promises and the soft gentleness of those replies thrilled as pangs of pain on phoebes pitying heart  as they walked homewards mervyn himself appeared slowly sauntering towards them  the younger sisters sprang to meet him cecily fell back to miss charlecote  phoebe held her breath and scarcely durst look there was a touch of the hand a greeting then bertha pounced on her brother to tell the adventure of the ravine and cecily began to set maria off about the flowers in her nosegay  phoebe could only come close to miss charlecote and squeeze her hand vehemently  the inndoor was reached and mervyn waiting till cecily came up said with grave formality i hear my sisters are indebted to you for your assistance in a very unpleasant predicament  she bowed and he bowed  that was all and they were in their several apartments  phoebe had never felt in such a fever  she could discern character but love was but an external experience to her and she could not read the riddle of mervyns repudiation of intercourse with their fellowinmates and his restlessness through the evening checking bertha for boring about her friend and then encouraging her to go on with what she had been saying  at last however bertha voluntarily ceased her communications and could be drawn out no farther and when the candle was put out at night she electrified phoebe with the remark it is mervyn and you know it so you may as well tell me all about it  phoebe had no choice but compliance advising bertha not to betray her knowledge and anxious to know the conclusions which this acute young woman would draw from the present conjuncture  but bertha was too fond of both parties not to be full of unmitigated hope  oh phoebe she said with cecily there i shall not mind going home i shall not mind anything  if only she will be there  stuff phoebe  the more mervyn sulks the more it shows that he cares for her and if she cares for him of course it will come right  do you remember what she said about the two wills contending  well if she ever did think mervyn the genie she has crossed him once twice thrice till she may turn him from urgan into ethert brand  she thinks it her duty not to hear that she has  oh oh from you who know all about it but didnt i tell her plenty about mervyns kindness to me  yes indeed i did  i couldnt help it you know  it did not seem true to let anybody begin to be my friend unless she knewall that  so i told herand oh phoebe she was so dear and nice better than ever after that continued bertha with what sounded like sobs and then you know she could not help hearing how good and patient he was with meonly growing kinder and kinder the more tiresome i was  she must feel that phoebe must not she  and then she asked about robert and i told her how mervyn has let him get a chaplain to look after the distillery people and the institute that that old ginpalace is to be made into  those were just the things i was longing to tell her  she could not stop me you know because i knew nothing cried bertha triumphantly  are not you satisfied phoebe  i ought to be if i were sure of his feelings  dont plunge about so berthaand i am not sure either that she will believe him yet to be a religious man  dont say that phoebe  i was just going to begin to like religion and think it the only true key to metaphysics and explanation of existence but if it sticks between those two i shall only see it as a weak rigid superstition parting those who were meant for one another  phoebe was strongly tempted to answer but the little travelling clock struck and thus acted as a warning that to let bertha pursue an exciting discussion at this time of night would be ruinous to her nerves the next day  so with a goodnight the elder sister closed her ears and lay pondering on the newly disclosed stage in berthas mind which touched her almost as closely as the fate of her brothers attachment  the ensuing were days of suppressed excitement chiefly manifested by the yawning fits that seized on bertha whenever no scene in the drama was passing before her  in fact the scenes presented little  cecily was not allowed to shut herself up and did nothing remarkable though avoiding the walks that she would otherwise have taken with the fulmort party and when she found that bertha was aware of her position firmly making silence on that head the condition of their interviews  mervyn let her alone and might have seemed absolutely indifferent but for the cessation of all complaints of hyeres and for the noteworthy brightness obligingness and good humour of his manners  even in her absence though often restless and strangely watchful he was always placable and goodtempered never even scolding phoebe and in her presence though he might not exchange three words or offer the smallest service there was a repose and content on his countenance that gave his whole expression a new reading  he was looking particularly well fined down into alertness by his disciplined life and hill climbing his complexion cleared and tanned by mountain air and the habits and society of the last year leaving an unconscious impress unlike that which he used to bring from his former haunts  phoebe wondered if cecily remarked it  she was not aware that cecily did not know him without that restful look  phoebe came to the conclusion that cecily was persuaded of the cessation of his attachment and was endeavouring to be thankful and to accustom herself to it  after the first she did not hide herself to any marked degree and probably to silence her aunt allowed that lady to take her on one of the grand monday expeditions when all the tolerably sound visiting population of hyeres were wont to meet to the number of thirty or forty and explore the scenery  exquisite as were the views these were not romantic excursions the numbers conducing to gossip and chatter but there were some who enjoyed them the more in consequence and mervyn who had been loudest in vituperation of his first found the present perfectly delightful although the chief of his time was spent in preventing mrs holmbys crossgrained donkey from lying down to roll and administering to the lady the chocolate drops that he carried for berthas sustenance cecily meantime being far before with his sisters where mrs holmby would gladly have sent him if bodily terror would have permitted her to dismiss her cavalier  miss charlecote and phoebe being among the best and briskest of the female walkers were the first to enter the town and there in the place des palmiers looking about him as if he were greatly amazed at himself they beheld no other than the wellknown figure of sir john raymond standing beside the major who was sunning himself under the palmtrees  miss charlecote how are you  how dye do miss fulmort  is your sister quite well again  wheres my little niece  only a little way behind with bertha  well we never thought to meet in such a place did we  what a country of stones i have come over today enough to break the heart of a farmer and the very sheep are no better than goats  vineyards  what they call vineyards are old black stumps that ought to be grubbed up for firewood  nay i was struck by the wonderful cultivation of every available inch of ground  it speaks well for the provencals if we judge by the proverb autant vaut lhomme que vaut sa terre  ah there she comes and he hastened to join cecily while the deserted bertha coming up to her sister muttered wretched girl  i hear she had written to him to fetch her home  that was what made her stay so quietly was it  no one could accuse mervyn of indifference who saw the blank look that overspread his face on hearing of sir johns arrival but he said not a word only hurried away to dress for the table dhote  the first notice the anxious ladies had that the tedious dinner was broken up was a knock at their door and cecilys entrance looking exceedingly white and speaking very low  i am come to wish you goodbye she said uncle john has been so kind as to come for me and i believe we shall set out tomorrow  maria alone could dare to shriek out oh but you promised to show me how to make a crown of my pink heaths and i have been out with lieschen and gathered such beauties  if you will come with me to my room i will show you while i pack up said cecily reducing bertha to despair by this most effectual barrier to confidence but she entreated leave to follow since seeing cecily playing with maria was better than not seeing her at all  after some time mervyn came in flushed and breathless and honor kindly made an excuse for leaving him alone with phoebe  after diligently tossing a book from one hand to the other for some minutes he observed sotto voce thats a more decent old fellow than i gave him credit for  who sir john  aye  and that was the whole result of the teteatete  he was in no mood for questions and marched out of the room for a moonlight cigar  phoebe only remained with the conviction that something had happened  miss charlecote was more fortunate  she had met the baronet in the passage and was accosted by him with do you ever do such a thing as take a turn on that terrace  it was a welcome invitation and in no more time than it took to fetch a shawl the two old friends were pacing the paved terrace together  well what do you think of him began sir john  there must be more good in him than i thought  much more than i thought  he has been speaking to me and i cant say but that i was sorry for him though why it should have gone so hard with so sensible and good a girl as cecily to give up such a scamp i never could guess  i told george that seeing what i saw of him and knowing what i knew i could think it nothing better than a sacrifice to give her to him  exactly what i thought  after the way he had used her tootalking nonsense to her and then playing fast and loose trying his luck with half the young ladies in london and then fancying she would be thankful to him as soon as he wanted a wife to keep house  poor child that would not have weighed with her a moment thoughit puts me out of patience to know how fond she is of himbut for his scampishness which made it a clear duty to refuse him  very well she behaved poor thing but you see how she pined awaythough her mother tells me that not a fretful word was ever heard from her as active and patient and cheerful as ever  then the holmbys took her abroad the only thing to save her health but i never trusted the woman and when by and by she writes to her father that fulmort was coming and her aunt would not take her away george i said never mind ill go at once and bring her homeshe shall not be kept there to be torn to pieces between her feelings and her duty  and now i am come i declare i dont know what to be ati should think nothing of it if the lad only talked of reformingbut he looks so downcast and owns so honestly that we were quite right and then that excellent little sister of his is so fond of him and you have stood his company this whole yearthat i declare i think he must be good for something  now you who have looked on all his life just say what you think of himsuch a way as he went on in last year toothe crew that he got about him  phoebe thinks that was the consequence of his disappointment  a man that could bring such a lot into the same house with that sister of his had no business to think of cecily  he has suffered for it and pretty severely and i do think it has done him good  you must remember that he had great disadvantages  which didnt hinder his brother from turning out well  robert went to a public school and there she perceived she was saying something awkward but sir john half laughed and assented  quite right miss charlecote private pupils are a delusion  george never had one without a screw loose about him  parish priests were never meant for tutorsand ive told my boy charlie that the one thing ill never consent to is his marrying on pupilsand doing two good things by halves  it has well nigh worried his uncle to death and cecily into the bargain  robert was younger and the elders were all worse managed  besides mervyns position as it was treated made him discontented and uncomfortable and this attachment which he was tootooi can find no word for it but contemptibleto avow must have preyed on his temper and spirits all the time he was trying to shake it off  he was brought up to selfishness and nothing but what he underwent last year could have shaken him out of it  then you think he is shaken out of it  where bertha is concerned i see that he istherefore i should hope it with his wife  well well i suppose what must be must be  not that i have the least authority to say anything but i could not help telling the poor fellow thus muchthat if he went on steadily for a year or so and continued in the same mind i did not see why he should not ask my brother and cecily to reconsider it  then it will be for them to decide you know  for them  as if sir john were not in character as well as name the guiding head of the family  and now he added you will let me come to your rooms this evening for mrs holmby is in such displeasure with me that i shall get nothing but black looks  besides i want to see a little more of that nice girl his sister  ah sir john if ever you do consent it will be more than half for love of phoebe  well for a girl like that to be so devoted to himher brother though he beshows there must be more in him than meets the eye  thats just the girl that i would not mind johns marrying    chapter xxv       turn again whittingtonbow bells  may had come round again before robert fulmort stood waiting at the waterloo station to welcome the travellers who had been prohibited from putting berthas restored health to the test of east winds  it was a vista of happy faces that he encountered as he looked into the carriage window yet the first questions and answers were grave and mournful  is mr henderson still alive asked honora  no he sank rapidly and died on sunday week  i was at the funeral on saturday  right i am glad you went  i am sorry i was away  it was deeply felt  nearly all the clergy in the archdeaconry and the entire parish were present  who is taking care of the parish  charlecote raymond has been coming over for the sundays and giving great satisfaction  i say robert wheres the bannerman carriage  phoebe is to be victimized theremores the pity interposed mervyn  there is their brougham  i meant to drive to alburystreet with her said robert gazing at his brother as if he scarcely knew him without the characteristic knitting of the brow under a grievance the scowl or the halfsneering smile and with the cleared and lightened air that he had worn ever since that little spark of hope had been left to burn and shine undamped by dissipation or worldly policy  bertha also was changed  she had grown tall and womanly her looks beyond her age and if her childish vivacity were gone the softened gravity became her much better  it was phoebes report however for which he chiefly longed and he was soon seated beside her on the way to alburystreet while the others betook themselves citywards  so phoebe it is all right and you are satisfied  satisfied grateful thankful to the utmost said phoebe fervently i think i never was so happy as all through the latter part of the journey  you think well of bertha  i cannot call her restored for she is far more than she was before that meeting with cecily raymond did for her what we could not do and she is growing to be more than we knew how to wish for  her spirits  never high and easily shaken  her nerves are not strong yet and she will never i fear be quite girlishly careless and merry but she is grave and sweet  she does not shrink from people now and when i saw her among other girls at paris she seemed older much deeper and altogether superior  does she think seriously  she thinks and reads but it is not easy to guess what she thinks for she keeps silence and has happily quite left off arguing with miss charlecote  i believe cecily has great influence over her and i think she will talk a great deal to miss fennimore  robin do you think we could have dear miss fennimore again  i do not know what mr parsons would say to you  as you know she told him that she wanted to do the most useful work he could trust to her so he has made her second mistress at the dayschool for his tradesmens daughters and what they would do without her i cannot think  she must have very insufficient pay  yes but i think she is glad of that and she had saved a good deal  i give you notice that i shall try hard to get her if mr crabbe will only let us be as we were before  do you think there is any hope for us  i cannot tell  i suspect that he will not consent to your going home till mervyn is married and augusta wants very much to have you for the season at least  mervyn and miss charlecote both say i ought to see a little of the london world and she promises to keep maria and bertha till we see our way  i should not like them to be without me anywhere else  you have not told me of poor bevil  you must have seen him often  yes he clings very much to me poor fellow and is nearly as much cast down as at first  he has persuaded himself that poor juliana always continued what he thought her when they met in their youth  perhaps she had the germs of it in her but i sometimes hardly know which way to look when he is talking about her and then i take shame to myself for the hard judgments i cannot put away even now  poor juliana said phoebe saddened by her own sense that the difficulties of her present position were lessened by the removal of this sister  and little elizabeth  she is a nice little thing and her father hardly lets her out of his sight  i have sometimes speculated whether he might not ask you to keep house for him but last time i saw him i fancied that he was inclined to hold aloof from you  i had rather he did not ask us said phoebe  why so  because i am afraid bertha would not look up to him if she lived with him said phoebe  robert smiled having himself become conscious of that weakness in his good brotherinlaw which phoebe felt but did not name  and now phoebe said robert suddenly changing the subject i have something for you to do i want you to call on miss sandbrook  on her astonished look he explained that he had made it his business frequently to see owen sandbrooks child and of late to give it some religious teaching  while thus engaged he had been surprised by the entrance of lucilla looking wretchedly ill and exhausted and though she had rallied her spirits after the first moment talked of having come up from essex for a days holiday of shopping and seeing her nephew and had inquired eagerly and warmly for miss charlecote he had been sufficiently uneasy about her to go afterwards to mrs murrell from whom he had learnt that she had avowed having consulted a physician in the morning and had procured her address  and now said robert i want you with whom she has never quarrelled to call on her as an old friend just come into her neighbourhood and find out what was the doctors opinion  i am sure she is destroying herself  the whole was said with perfect simplicity without shrinking from phoebes eye as though he had absolutely forgotten what sentiments he had once entertained and phoebe could neither in kindness nor humanity refuse to be the means of reopening communication with the voluntary exile  she proposed to write and offer a call but robert fearing to rouse the old perverse pride recommended that there should be no preparation  indeed the chances of an independent expedition seemed likely to be scanty for lady bannerman pounced on her sister as a truant bondslave who when captured was to be useful all day and go to parties all night  i have told all my friends that i was going to introduce my sister and what expectations you have she said  see here are two cards for tomorrow night lady jane hewett and mrs gosling the young widow that i want mervyn to meet you know  clear 5000 pounds a year and such a charming house  real firstrate suppers not like lady janes breadandbutter and catlap as sir nicholas says just handed round we would never go near the place but as i said to sir nicholas any sacrifice for my sister and she has a son you know a fine young man and if we manage well we shall be in time for carrie goslings supper so mind that phoebe and dont get engaged to too many dances  is there to be dancing  most likely  i hope you have something to wear  i provided myself at paris thank you  not mourning i trust  that will never do  nobody thinks of mourning for a sister more than six months and it makes me so low to think of poor juliana and this horrid complaint being in the family  it is quite a duty to keep ones spirits up  but theres robert always so lugubrious and poor sir bevil looks as deplorable and comes up to town with that poor little girl all in crape and wont eat any luncheon  i declare it gave me such a turn that i was obliged to have my little cordial before i could swallow a mouthful  and now you come in black it is quite provoking  you must and shall get some colours tomorrow  thank you what i have is white and lilac  on which neutral ground phoebe took her stand and the french style and fashion so impressed augustas maid that she forced her ladyship to accept even simplicity as the thing and to sink back rebuked for the barbarism of hinting at the enlivenment of pink ribbons or scarlet flowers  though thus fortified against shopping on her own account liberty even to go to see her sisters was denied her in augustas infinite disgust at the locality and consideration for the horses  she was forced to be contented with the report of mervyn who came to dinner and to go to the evening parties and who spoke of the girls as well and happy maria in her native element at the infant school and both in a perfect rapture at receiving miss fennimore whom their hostess had asked to spend the evening in woolstonelane  mervyn professed that he came entirely to see phoebes debut in her parisian costume and amused himself maliciously with endeavouring to delay the start from lady janes till too late for mrs goslings supper but phoebe who did not wish to enhance the sacrifice would not abet him and positively as he declared aided augusta in her wild goose chase  he contrived to have a good deal of conversation with phoebe in the course of the evening and she heard from him that old crabbe was more crusty than ever and would not hear of his taking his sisters home but said he that mattered the less considering that now they would be able to be at the parsonage  the parsonage  what did you not know the living was in miss charlecotes gift  do you mean that she has offered it to robert  yesnoat least she has told me of her intentions  highly proper in the old girl isnt it  they will settle it tonight of course  ill have the grounds laid out and make quite a pretty modern place of it it has quite taken a weight off my mind to know he is so well provided for  it will make us all very happy but i think he will be sorry for st matthews too  oh parsons think nothing of changes  he can appoint his own successor and ill not let things die away  and now phoebe is there anything you want to do  i will not have augusta tie you by the leg  i will look out a ladys horse tomorrow and come to ride with you or if you want to do anything you can have the brougham any day  thank you there is one thing i want very much to do and she explained  ha said mervyn a romantic meeting  if i remember right mr robin used to be much smitten with that little thing  dont reckon too much on the parsonage phoebe  what are we to do if both brothers turn us out smiled phoebe  dont talk of that  i should be glad enough to get you inand i am far enough from the other thing yet  so phoebe obtained the use of the brougham for the next day and set off for her long essex drive much against augustas will and greatly wondering what it would produce compassionate of course for poor lucilla yet not entirely able to wish that robert should resign the charge for which he was so eminently fitted even for the sake of hiltonbury and home  lucy must be altered indeed if he would not be happier without her  phoebe had written a few lines saying that hearing that lucy was so near she could not help begging to see her  this she sent in with her card and after a little delay was invited to come in  lucilla met her at the top of the stairs and at first phoebe only felt herself clasped clung to kissed fondled with a sudden gasping tearful eagerness  then as if striving to recall the ordinary tone lucilla exclaimedtherei beg your pardon for such an obstreperous greeting but i am a famished creature here you see and i did not expect such kindness  luckily some of my pupils are driving out with their mamma and i have sent the others to the nurse  now then take off your bonnet let me see you i want to look at a home face and you are as fresh and as innocent as if not a year had passed over you  lucilla fervently kissed her again and then holding her hand gazed at her as if unwilling that either should break the happy silence  meantime phoebe was shocked to see how completely roberts alarms were justified by lucys appearance  the mere absence of the coquettish ringlets made a considerable difference and the pale colour of the hair as it was plainly braided increased the wanness of her appearance  the transparent complexion had lost the lovely carnation of the cheek but the meandering veins of the temples and eyelids were painfully apparent and with the eyes so large and clear as to be more like veronicas than ever made the effect almost ghastly together with excessive fragility of the form and the shadowy thinness of the hand that held phoebes berthas fingers at her weakest had been more substantial than these small things which had however as much character and force in their grasp as ever  lucy i am sure you are ill  how thin you are  well then codliver oil is a base deception  never mind thatlet me hear of honorare you with her  no my sisters are but i am with augusta  then you do not come from her  no she does not know  you excellent phoebe what have you done to keep that bonny honest face all this time to refresh weary eyesbeing a little heroine too  well but the honorthe old sweet honeyis she her very self  indeed i hope so she has been so very kind to us  and found subjects in you not too crossgrained for her kindness to be palatable  ah a good hard plunge into the world teaches one what one left in the friendly ship  not that mine has been a hard one  i am not one of the pathetic governesses of fiction  every one has been kinder to me than i am worthbut oh to hear myself called lucy againand she hid her face on phoebes shoulder in another access of emotion  you used not to like it  my cilly days were over long ago  only one person ever used to call me cilla and she paused and went on afreshso it was for berthas sake and mervyns that honor escorted you abroad  so much robert told me but i dont understand it yet  it had haunted me the whole winter that robert was the only mr fulmort she could nurse and if he told you i was upset it was that i did not quite know whether he were ghost or body when i saw him there in the old place  no he only told me you were looking very ill and indeed  i could not ask him what concatenation made honor take mervyn under her wing like a hen hovering a vulture  it would be a long story said phoebe but bertha was very ill and mervyn much out of health and we were in great distress for an escort i think it was the kindest thing ever done and the most successful  has it been a comfort to her  owens letters must be i am sure  he will come home this autumn as soon as he has done laying out his railway and then i shall get him to beg leave for me to make a little visit to hiltonbury before we go out to canada  i could not go out without a good word from her  she and mr prendergast are all that remains of the old life  i say phoebe did you hear of those cousins of mine  it was one of the reasons i wished to see you  i thought you might like to hear of them  you saw them  miss charteris called on us at nice  sheoh lucy you will be surprisedshe is a plymouth sister  rasheold rashe  we reverse the old transformation butterflies into grubs cried lucy with somewhat spasmodic laughter  tell me how the wonder came about  i know little about it said phoebe  miss charlecote thought most likely it was the first earnest kind of religion that presented itself when she was craving for some such help  did honor make such a liberal remark  there i am sorry i said it but let me hear of dear old rashe  has it made her very grim  you know it is not an embellishing dress and she did look gaunt and haggard but still somehow we liked her better than ever before and she is so very good and charitable  ha  nice is a grand place for colporteurs and tracts  she would be a shining specimen there and dissipation religious or otherwise old rashe must have  not only in that line said phoebe suppressing a smile at the truth of the surmise but she is all kindness to sick english  she tried to convert you allconfess it  rashe converting dear old honor  oh of all comical conjunctions  miss charlecote hushed it down said phoebe and indeed nobody could be with her and think that she needed rousing to religious thoughts  by this attempt on honor i fear she has not succeeded with lolly whom poor owen used to call an eastern woman with no soul  she does everything for mrs charterisdresses her works for heri do believe cooks for her  they live a strange rambling life  i have heard lolly plays as deeply as charles does not she  all castle blanch mortgagedwould be sold but that uncle kit is in the entail  it breaks ones heart to hear it  they all live on generous old ratia i suppose  i believe she pays the bills when they move  we were told that it was a beautiful thing to see how patiently and resolutely she goes on bearing with them and helping them always in hopes that at last they may turn to better things  lucy was much touched  poor rashe she said there was something great in her  i have a great mind to write to her  they diverged into other subjects but every minute she became more open and confidential and as the guarded reserve wore off phoebe contrived to lead to the question of her spirits and health and obtained a fuller answer  till you try phoebe you cant guess the wear of living with minds that have got nothing in them but what you have put in yourself  there seems to be a fur growing over ones intellects for want of something to rub against  miss fennimore must often have felt that with us  no you were older and besides you have some originality in a sober way and dont imagine miss fennimore had the sore heart at the bottomthe foolishness that took to moaning after home as soon as it had cast it off past recall  oh lucy not past recall  not past pardon i am trying to hope  at least there are some people who the more unpardonable one is pardon the more readily  when owen comes home i mean to try  ah i saw you had been going through a great deal  no no dont charge my looks on sentiment said cilla hastily theres plenty to account for them besides  one never falls into those foibles when one is quite strong  then you have been unwell  not to the point of giving in  oh no  never say die was always my motto you know  to what point dear lucy  to that of feeling as if the entire creation was out of jointnot one child here and there but everybody was cross and i could not walk with the children and my bones ached and all that sort of thing  you had advice  yes i thought it economical to patch myself up in time so i asked for a holiday to go to the doctor  well  he did after the nature of doctors poked me about and asked if there were decline in the family and in spite of the smile the great blue eyes looked ghastly and he forbade exertion and ordered good living and codliver oil  then surely you should be taking care  so i am  these are very goodnatured people and im a treasure of a governess you know  i have refections ten times a day and might swim in port wine and the little swiss bonne walks the children and gives them an awful accent which their mamma thinks the correct thing  changerestyou should have them  i shall when owen comes  it is summertime and i shall hold on till then when it will be plenty of time to see whether this is nonsense  whether what is  about my lungs  dont look horrified  he could only trace the remains of a stupid old cold and if it were more i know of no fact of so little moment to anybody  you should not say that lucy it is wrong and cruel  it is your fault i did not want to have talked of it and in good time here comes half my flock  edie reggie flo come and show miss fulmort what my torments are  they ran in apparently on excellent terms with her and greeted her guest without shyness but after a little whispering and shoving the youngest spoke  edie and reggie want to know if she is the lady that put out the light  ah you heroine said lucy you dont know how often i have told of your doughty deeds  ay look at her she is the robberbaffler though now i look at her i dont quite believe it myself  but it is true asked the little girl puzzled  tell us all the story added the boy  yes tell us said lucilla  i read all your evidence so like yourself as it was but i want to know where you were sleeping  phoebe found her present audience strangely more embarrassing than the whole assize court perhaps because there the solemn purpose swallowed up the sense of admiration but she laughed at last at the boys disappointment at the escape of the thieves he would have fired a pistol through the keyhole and shot them  when she rose to go the children entreated her to stay and be seen by the others but this she was glad to escape though lucilla clung to her with a sort of anguish of longing yet stifled affection that would have been most painful to witness but for the hopes for her relief  phoebe ordered her brothers carriage in time to take her to breakfast in woolstonelane the next morning and before ten oclock honor had heard the account of the visit in essex  tearfully she thanked the trusty reconnoitrer as for a kindness to herself dwelling on the tokens of relenting yet trembling at the tidings of the malady  to write and recall her child to her motherly nursing was the foremost thought in her strange medley of grief and joy hope and fear  poor robert she said when she understood that he had organized phoebes mission i am glad i told him to give no answer for a week  mervyn told me how kind you were about hiltonbury  kind to myself my dear  it seems like a crime when i look at st matthews but when i think of you all and of home i believe it is right that he should have the alternative  and now if poor lucy come and it be not too late  did he say anything said phoebe  i only wrote to him i thought he had rather not let me see his first impulse so i told him to let me hear nothing till thursday evening  i doubted before now i feel sure he will take it  lucy has the oldest claim said phoebe thoughtfully wishing she could feel equally desirous of success in this affair as in that of mervyn and cecily  yes she was his first love before whittingtonia  did you mention the vacancy at hiltonbury  no there was so much besides to talk of  that is well for perhaps if she knew that spirit of hers might keep her aloof  i feel like padre cristoforo dispensing lucia from her vow if she will only get well  and a little happiness will do more than all the cods in hammerfest  phoebe we will have a chapelschool at the hamlet and a model kitchen at the school and robert will get hold of all the big boys  his london experience is exactly what we want to brighten hiltonbury and all our clergy  hiltonbury had a right to stand first with honora and whittingtonia had sunk into a mere trainingschool for her pattern parson  if there were a sigh to think that owen was exactly of the right age to have been ordained to hiltonbury she put it away for this was next best  her note to lucilla was penned with trembling caution and each word was reconsidered day and night in case the perverse temper might take umbrage  the answer came      my dear honor      it is beyond my deserts to be so kindly taken home  i have learnt     what that means now  i can be spared for a fortnight and as mr     bostock dines in town the day after tomorrow he will set me down     your affectionate                                                              l sandbrook  miss charlecote is like a person ten years younger observed bertha to phoebe when she came with the rest to quite a family party at alburystreet  robert alone was absent it being what augusta called a fast or something ie a meeting of st wulstans young mens institute  bertha heartily wished she could call herself a young man for her morbid sense of disgrace always recurred with those whom she knew to be cognizant of her escapade  however this evening made a change in her ladyships views or rather she had found phoebe no longer the mere submissive handmaid of schoolroom days but a young woman accustomed to liberty of action and independence of judgment and though perfectly obliging and unselfish never admitting augustas claims on her time to the exclusion of those of others of the family and quietly but decidedly carrying out her intentions  berthas shrinking silence and meekness of demeanour persuaded her sister that she would be more comfortable and her womanly appearance not only rendered the notion of school ridiculous but inspired the desire of bringing her out  phoebe might dedicate herself to maria if she pleased bertha should shine through the season under her sisters patronage  not since the adventure with the hyeres peasants had berthas tongue been so unmanageable as when she tried to protest against going into society and when mervyn came to her help augusta owned that such hesitation was indeed an objection but it might easily be cured by good management cordials would prevent nervousness and after all no one would care when a girl had such a fortune  poor bertha crept away feeling as if she could never open her mouth again  meanwhile mervyn and augusta amicably agreed on the excellence of hiltonbury parsonage as a home for the girls the latter only regretting what robert had sunk on his fancies at whittingtonia  i dont know that returned mervyn all i regret is that we never took our share it is a different thing now i assure you to see the turn out from the distillery since the lads have come under his teaching  i only hope his successor may do as well  well i dont understand about such things said augusta crossly poor papa never made such a rout about the hands  it would not have been thought good taste to bring them forward  if you wish to understand said mervyn maliciously you had better come and see  robert would be very glad of your advice for the kitchen he is setting goingsick cookery and cheap dinners  and pray who pays for them  robert has made himself a beggar  is it you  no those who eat  it is to be selfsupporting  i do nothing but lend the house  you dont remember it  it is the palace at the corner of richard alley  it is no concern of mine i know but what is to become of the business if you go giving away the houses  oh i am getting into the foreign and exportation line  it is infinitely less bother  ah well  i am glad my poor father does not see it  he would have said the business was going to the dogs  no he was fast coming into roberts views and i heartily wish i had not hindered him  augusta told her admiral that evening that there was no hope for the family since robert had got hold of mervyn as well as of the rest of them  people in society actually asked her about the schools and playground at mr fulmorts distillery there had been an educational report about them  quite disgusting  there passed a day of conflicting hope and fear soothed by the pleasure of preparation and at seven in the evening there came the ring at the house door and lucilla was once more in honoras arms  it was for a moment a convulsive embrace but it was not the same lingering clinging as when she met phoebe nor did she look so much changed as then for there was a vivid tint of rose on either cheek she had restored her hair to the familiar fashion and her eyes were bright with excitement  the presence of maria and bertha which miss charlecote had regretted was probably a relief for lucilla as she threw off her bonnet and sat down to the severe tea awaiting her talked much to them observed upon their growth noticed the little maltese dog and compared her continental experiences with berthas  to honor she scarcely spoke voluntarily and cast down her eyes as she did so making brief work of answers to inquiries and showing herself altogether disappointingly the old cilly  roberts absence was also a disappointment to honor though she satisfied herself that it was out of consideration  lucy would not go up to her room till bedtime and when honor accompanying her thither asked tender and anxious questions about her health she answered them not indeed petulantly as of old but with a strange absent manner as if it were duty alone that made her speak only when honor spoke of her again seeing the physician whom she had consulted she at first sharply refused then as if recollecting herself meekly said as you think fit but i had rather it was not the same  i thought he was your own preference said honor otherwise i should have preferred dr f  very well let it be said lucy hastily  the goodnights the kisses past and honor went away with a heavy load of thwarted hopes and baffled yearning at her heartyearnings which could be stilled only in one way  a knock  she started up and called come in and a small white ghostly figure glided in the hands tightly clasped together  lucy dear child you are ill  i dont know what is the matter with me said a husky stifled voice i meant iti wanted it  i longed after it when it was out of reach but now  what my dear asked honor appalled at the effort with which she spoke  your pardon and with a pressure of hands and contraction of the brow as of physical agony she exclaimed honor honor forgive me  honor held out her arms she flung herself prone into them and wept tears were with her an affection as violent as rare and her sobs were fearful heaving her little fragile frame as though they would rend it and issuing in short cries and gasps of anguish  honor held her in her arms all the time much alarmed but soothing and caressing and in the midst lucilla had not lost all selfcontrol and though unable to prevent the paroxysm restrained it as much as possible and never attempted to speak but when her friend laid her down her whole person still quivering with the long swell of the last uncontrollable sobbing she looked up with the sweetest smile ever seen by honor who could not help thinking that such a sight might have met the eyes of the mother who found the devil gone out and her daughter laid on the bed  the peace was such that neither could bear to speak for many seconds  at last lucy said dear honor  my dearest  lie down by me please put your arms round me  there  oh it is so comfortable  why did i never find it out before  i wish i could be a little child and begin again from the time my father made me over to you  lucy we all would begin again if we could  i have come to the perception how often i exasperated you  an angel who did his duty by me would have exasperated me in your place  yes that was one error of mine  i thrust myself in against the wishes of your nearest relative  my thanklessness has made you feel that  dont talk on dear oneyou are exhausting yourself  a little more i must say before i can sleep under your roof in peace then i will obey you in all things  honor these few years have shown me what your education did for me against my will  what would have become of me if i had been left to the poor castle blanch people  nothing could have saved me but my spirit of contradiction  no all that saved my fathers teaching from dying out in meall that kept me at my worst from the charteris standard all that has served me in my recent life was what you did for me  there i have told you only the truth  honor could only kiss her and whisper something of unlookedfor happiness and lucillas tears flowed again at the tenderness for which she had learnt to hunger but it was a gentle shower this time and she let herself be hushed into calmness till she slept peacefully on honors bed in honors arms as she had never done even as a young child honor watched her long in quiet gladness and thankfulness then likewise slept and when awakened at last by a suppressed cough looked up to see the two stars of blue eyes soft and gentle under their swollen lids gazing on her full of affection  i have wakened you lucy said  have you been awake long  not very but to lie and look at the old windows and smell the cedar fragrance and see you is better than sleep  still the low morning cough and the pallor of the face filled honor with anxiety and though lucilla attributed much to the nights agitation she was thoroughly languid and unhinged and fain to lie on the sofa in the cedar parlour owning that no one but a governess could know the full charm of doing nothing  the physician was the same who had been consulted by her father and well remembered the flaxenhaired child whom he had so cruelly detached from his side  he declared her to be in much the same reduced and enfeebled condition as that in which her father brought on his malady by reckless neglect and exposure and though he found no positive disease in progress he considered that all would depend upon anxious care and complete rest for the autumn and winter and he thought her constitution far too delicate for governess life positively forbidding her going back to her situation for another day  honor had left the room with him  she found lucilla with her face hidden in the sofa cushions but the next moment met a tremulous halfspasmodic smile  am i humbled enough she said  failed failed failed  one by my flirting two by my temper three by my health  i cant get my own living and necessity sends me home without the grace of voluntary submission  nay my child the very calling it home shows that it need not humble you to return  it is very odd that i should like it so much said lucy and now turning away as usual from sentiment what shall i say to mrs bostock what a wretch she will think me  i must go over and see all those children once more  i hope i shall have a worthy successor poor little rogues  i must rouse myself to write  not yet my dear  not while you can sit and talk  i have so much to hear of at home  i have never inquired after mr henderson  not dead  you have not heard  it was a very long gradual decay  he died on the 12th  indeed he was a kind old man and home will not be itself without his white head in the readingdesk  have you filled up the living  i have offered itand there was a pauseto robert fulmort  i thought so  he wont have it  honor durst not ask the grounds of this prediction and the rest of that family were discussed  it was embarrassing to be asked about the reports of last winter and lucys keen penetration soon led to full confidence  ah i was sure that a great flood had passed over that poor child  i was desperate when i wrote to phoebe for it seemed incredible that it should be either of the others but i might have trusted her  i wonder what will become of her  i have not yet seen the man good enough for her  i have seen oneand so have youbut i could not have spared him to her even if she had been in his time  truly lucilla was taken home when honor was moved to speak thus  for her sake honor had regretted that the return dinner to the alburystreet household and the brothers was for this day but she revived towards evening and joined the party looking far less pretty and piquante and her dress so quiet as to be only just appropriate but still a fair bright object and fitting so naturally into her old place that lady bannerman was scandalized at her presumption and miss charlecotes weakness  honor and phoebe both watched the greeting between her and robert but could infer nothing either from it or from their deportment at dinner both were so entirely unembarrassed and easy afterwards robert sought out phoebe and beguiled her into the window where his affairs had so often been canvassed  phoebe he said i must do what i fear will distress you and i want to prepare you  was it coming  but how could he have guessed that she had rather not  i feel deeply your present homeless condition  i wish earnestly that i could make a home for you  but phoebe once you told me you were content to be sacrificed to my foremost duty  i am she said  well then i love this smoky old black wife of mine and dont want to leave her even for my sisters  i never thought of your leaving her for your sisters but and as lucillas music effectually veiled all wordsi had thought that there might be other considerations  her eyes spoke the rest  i thought you knew that folly had passed away he said somewhat sternly  i trust that no one else has thought of it and he indicated miss charlecote  not when the offer was made to you but since she heard of my mission  then i am glad that on other grounds my mind was made up  no after a pause there is a great change  she is far superior to what she was in the days of my madness but it is over and never could be renewed  she herself does not desire it  phoebe was called to the piano not sorry that such should be roberts conviction and glad that he should not be disturbed in work that suited him so well as did st matthews but thinking him far too valuable for lucy not to suffer in losing her power over him  and did she  she was alone in the cedar parlour with honor the next day when the note was brought in announcing his refusal on the ground that while he found his strength and health equal to the calls of his present cure and his connection with the fulmort firm gave him unusual facilities in dealing with the workmen he did not think he ought to resign his charge for another for which many better men might be found  quite right i knew it said lucilla when honor had with some attempt at preparation shown her the note  how could you know it  because i saw a man in his vocation  a long silence during which cilly caught a pitying glance  please to put that out of your head she exclaimed  theres no pity no illusage in the case  i wilfully did what i was warned that he would not bear and there was an end of it  i had hoped not past recall  well if you will have the truth when it was done and not to be helped we were both very sorry i can answer at least for one but he had bound himself heart and soul to his work and does not care any longer for me what you the preacher of sacrifice wishing to see your best pupil throw up your pet work for the sake of a little trumpery crushed firefly  convict me out of my own mouth said honor sadly it will not make me like to see my firefly crushed  when the poor firefly has lit the lamp of learning for six idle children no other cause for dimness need be sought  no i was well and wicked in the height of the pain and long after it wore outfor wear out it didand i am glad he is too wise to set it going again  i dont like emotions  i only want to be let alone  besides he has got into such a region of goodness that his wife ought to be superexcellent  i know no one good enough for him unless you would have him  as usual honor was balked by bestowing sympathy and could only wonder whether this were reserve levity or resignation and if she must accept it as a fact that in the one the attachment had been lost in the duties of his calling in the other had died out for want of requital  for the present in spite of herself her feeling towards robert verged more on distant rather piqued admiration than on affection although he nearly approached the ideal of her own first love and owen sandbrooks teaching was through her bearing good fruit in him even while recoiling on her womans heart through owens daughter  mervyn was easily reconciled to the decision not only because his brother was even more valuable to him in london than in the country but because miss charlecotes next alternative was charlecote raymond sir johns second son a fine opentempered young man of thirty who had made proof of vigour and judgment in the curacy that he had just left and who had the farther recommendation of bearing the name of the former squire his godfather  anything called raymond was at present so welcome to mervyn that he felt himself under absolute obligations to robert for having left the field clear  when no longer prejudiced the sight of roberts practical labours struck him more and more and his attachment grew with his admiration  ill tell you what phoebe he said when riding with her  i have a notion of pleasing the parson  yesterday we got obstructed by an interminable procession of school children going out for a lark in the country by an excursion train and he began envying their keepers for being able to give them such a bath of country air  could we not let him do the same by his lot at beauchamp  oh mervyn what a mass of happiness you would produce  mass of humbug  i only want to please robin and have no trouble  i shant come near it  you only tell me what it will cost carriage provender and all and let me hear no more of it  he was destined to hear a good deal more  the proposal caused the utmost gratitude and satisfaction except that honor and robert doubted whether it were a proper moment for merrymaking at hiltonbury  they were in full consultation when in walked sir john raymond who could not help coming to town at once to express his thanks at having his son settled so near him  ere long he learnt what was under discussion and made the amendment that the place should be the forest the occasion the horticultural show  he knew of a capital spot for the whole troop to dine in even including the wulstonians proper whom honor wondering she had never thought of it before begged to include in the treat at her own expense  but conveyance from the station for nearly two thousand  never mind said sir john ill undertake for that  well make it a county concern and get the farmers to lend their wagons borrow all the breaks we can and i know of some old stagecoaches in dock  if theres not room for all they must ride and tye  it is only three miles from the little forest station and well make the train stop there  only young ladies you must work whittingtons cat upon all the banners for your kittens  lucilla clapped her hands and undertook that the whittingtonians should be marshalled under such an array of banners as never were seen before maria was in ecstasies and bertha was in the excitement forgetting her dread of confronting the county  but wheres miss phoebe asked sir john who had sat half an hour waiting in vain for her to appear and when he heard he declared his intention of calling on her  and where was mervyn himself  he was at the office whither robert offered to conduct the baronet and where mervyn heard more of his proposal than he had bargained for though perhaps not more than he liked  he was going to an evening party at the bannermans and seeing sir johns inclination to see phoebe proposed to call for him and take him there  what is the use phoebe demanded lady bannerman after the party was over of my getting all these young men on purpose to dance with you if you get up in a corner all the evening to talk to nobody but mervyn and old sir john  it can be nothing but perverseness for you are not a bit shy and you are looking as delighted as possible to have put me out  not to have put you out augusta but i am delighted  well at what  we are asked to stay at moorcroft thats one thing  stupid place  no wines no dinners said augusta and so ridiculous as you are  if the son is at home youll do nothing but talk to sir john  and if ever a girl ought to get married off i am sure it is you  how do you know what good use i may make of my opportunities  phoebe positively danced upstairs and indulged in a private polka round her bedroom  she had been told not only of the forest plan but that sir john was going to run down to his brothers at sutton the next day and that he had asked mervyn to come with him  mervyn had not this time promised to send her a blank cover  he thought he had very little present hope for the talk had been of a years probationof his showing himself a changed character etc  and not only was this only half that space but less than a month had been spent in england  this time he was not setting off as one about to confer a favour  phoebe heard no more for two days  at last as she was finishing her toilette to go out with augusta a hasty knock came to her door and mervyn entreated to be let in  his face told more than his tongue could utter  he had little guessed the intensity of the happiness of which he had so long deprived himself and cecilys acceptance had filled him with a flood of bliss tinctured however by the sense of his own unworthiness of her constant affection and increasing compunction for what he had made her endure  i dont know how she could do it or why she cared for such a miserable scamp breaking her heart all this time he exclaimed  you will make up for it now  i wish i may but bless me phoebe she is a perfect little nun and what is she to do with a graceless dog like me  you will see said phoebe smiling  what do you think then he demanded in some alarm  you know i cant take to the pious tack  will nothing else satisfy her  you are not the same as you were  you dont know what will happen to you yet said phoebe playfully  the carriage is ready maam my lady is waiting said a warning voice  i say quoth mervyn intercepting her not a word to my lady  it is all conditional you understandonly that i may ask again in a year or some such infernal time if i am i dont know whatbut they do i suppose  perhaps you will by that time  dear mervyn i am sorry but i must go or augusta will be coming here  he made a ludicrous gesture of shrinking horror but still detained her to whisper youll meet her at moorcroft they will have her for the forest todo  phoebe signed her extreme satisfaction and ran away  i am surprised at you phoebe you have kept me five minutes  some young ladies do worse said the admiral who was very fond of her and her time was not lost  i never saw her look better  i dont like such a pair of milkmaids cheeks looking so ridiculously delighted too said lady bannerman crossly  really phoebe one would think you were but just come up from the country and had never been to a concert before  those stupid little white marabouts in your hair again too  well said sir nicholas i take them as a complimentphoebe knows i think they become her  i dont say they are amiss in themselves but it is all obstinacy because i desire her to buy that magnificent ruby bandeau  how is any one to believe in her fortune if she dresses in that twopennyhalfpenny fashion  i declare i have a great mind to leave her behind  phoebe could almost have said pray do so much did she long to join the party in woolstonelane where the only alloy was that poor marias incapacity for secrecy forbade her hearing the good news  miss charlecote likewise was secretly a little scandalized at the facility with which the raymonds had consented to the match she thought mervyn improved but neither religious nor repentant and could not think cecily or her family justified in accepting him  something of the kind became perceptible to robert when they first talked over the matter together  it may be so he said but i really believe that mervyn will be more susceptible of real repentance when he has imperceptibly been led to different habits and ways of thinking  in many cases i have seen that the mind has to clear itself and leave old things behind before it has the capacity of perceiving its errors  repentance must precede amendment  some repentance must but even the sense of the inexpedience and inconvenience of evil habits may be the first step above them and in time the power of genuine repentance may be attained  still glad as i am for all your sakes i cannot understand it on cecilys part or how a girl of her tone of mind can marry where there can as yet be no communion of the highest kind  you would be sorry to see phoebe do so  very sorry  it is no example but there may be claims from the mere length of the attachment which seems to mark her as the appointed instrument for his good  besides she has not fully accepted him and after such change as he has made she might not have been justified in denying all encouragement  she did not seek such justification said honor laughing but surprised to find robert thus lenient in his brothers case after having acted so stern a part in his own    chapter xxvi       then robin hood took them both by the hands        and danced about the oak tree     for three merry men and three merry men        and three merry men we beold ballad  the case of the three sisters remained a difficulty  the bannermans professed to have washed their hands of them their advice not being taken and mr crabbe could not think himself justified in letting them return to the protection that had so egregiously failed  bertha was fretted by the uncertainty and became nervous and annoyed with phoebe for not showing more distressbut going on from day to day in the confidence that matters would arrange themselves  phoebe who had come of age during her foreign tour had a long conference with her guardian when he put her property into her hands the result was that she obtained his permission to inhabit with her sisters the underwood a sort of dowagerhouse belonging to beauchamp provided some elderly lady could be found to chaperon themmiss fennimore if they preferred her  miss fennimore was greatly touched with the earnestness of the united entreaties of her pupils and though regretting the field of usefulness in which she had begun to work could not resist the pleasure of keeping house with phoebe and resuming her studies with bertha on safer ground she could not however quit her employment without a halfyears notice and when mervyn went down for a day to beauchamp he found the underwood in such a woful state of disrepair that turn in as many masons carpenters and paperers as he would there was no hope of its being habitable before martinmas  therefore the intermediate time must be spent in visiting and though the headquarters were at the holt the raymonds of moorcroft claimed the first month and the promise of cecilys presence allured bertha thither though the fulmort mind had always imagined the house highly religious and dull  little had she expected to find it ringing with the wild noise and nonsense of a joyous home party of all ages full of freaks and frolics laughter and merriment  her ready wit would have made her shine brilliantly if her speech had been constantly at command but she often broke down in the midst of a repartee and was always in danger of suffering from overexcitement  maria too needed much watching and tenderness  every one was very kind to her but not exactly knowing the boundary of her powers the young people would sometimes have brought her into situations to which she was unequal if phoebe had not been constantly watching over her  between the two sisters phoebes visit was no sinecure  she was always keeping a motherly eye and hand over one or the other sometimes over both and not unseldom incurring berthas resistance under the petulance of overwrought spirits or anger at troublesome precautions  after cecilys arrival however the task became easier  cecily took bertha off her hands soothing and repressing those variable spirits and making a wise and gentle use of the adoration that bertha lavished on her keeping her cousins in order and obviating the fast and furious fun that was too great a change for girls brought up like the fulmorts  maria was safe whenever cecily was in the room and phoebe was able to relax her care and enjoy herself doubly for feeling all the value of the future sister  she thought miss charlecote and lucilla both looked worn and dispirited when one day she rode with sir john to see them and inspect the underwood as well as to make arrangements for the forest show  poor honora was seriously discomposed at having nothing to show there  it was the first time that the holt had failed to shine in its produce but old brooks had allowed the whole country round to excel so palpably in all farm crops and the gardener had taken things so easily in her absence that everything was mediocre and she was displeased and ashamed moreover brooks had controverted her strictest instructions against harbouring tenants of bad character he had mismanaged the cattle and his accounts were in confusion  he was a thoroughly faithful servant but like ponto and the pony he had grown masterful with age  honor found that her presiding eye had certainly done some good since going away had made things so much worse and she took sir john with her to the study to consult him on her difficulties  phoebe and lucilla were left together  i am afraid you are not much better said phoebe looking at the languid fragile little being and her depressed air  yes i am she answered in essentialsbut oh phoebe if you could only teach me to get on with honor  oh said phoebe with a tone of disappointment i hoped all was comfortable now  so it ought to be  i am a wretch that it is not but somehow i get tired to death  i should like it to be my own fault but with her i always have a sense of fluffiness  there is so much figurativeness and dreamy sentiment that one never gets to the firm clear surface  i thought that her great charm said phoebe  it is a pity to be so dull and unimaginative as i am  i like you best as you are  i know what to be at  besides her sensibility and poetry are a fund of happy youthfulness abroad her enjoyment was multiplied because every place was full of associations lighted up by her fancy  made unsubstantial by her fluff  no i cannot like mutton with the wool on  it is a shame though good creature as she is  i only wanted to make out the philosophy of the wearied worried condition that her conversation is so apt to bring on in me  i cant think it pure wickedness on my own part for i esteem and love and venerate the good soul with all my heart  i say phoebe were you never in an inward rage when she would say she would not let some fact be true for the sake of some mythical romantic figment  you smile  own that you have felt it  i have thought of miss fennimores theory that legends are more veritable exponents of human nature than bare facts  say it again phoebe  it sounds very grand  whipped cream is a truer exponent of milk than cheese especially when it tastes of soapsuds  is that it  it is a much prettier thing and not near so hard and dry said phoebe but you see you are talking in figures after all  the effect of example  look here my dear the last generation was that of mediaevalism ecclesiology chivalry symbolism whatever you may call it  married women have worked out of it  it is the middleaged maids that monopolize it  ours is that of common sense  i dont know that it is better or prettier said phoebe  and it may be worse  but how are the two to live together when there is no natural conformityonly undeserved benefits on one side and gratitude on the other  you will be more at ease when you are stronger and better said phoebe your brother will make you feel more natural with her  dont talk of it phoebe  think of the scene those two will get up and the showing him that terrible little cockney hoeing as the old woman calls him  if i could only break the neck of his hs before poor owen hears them  miss charlecote did say something of having him here but she thought you were not strong enough  justly judged  i shall have enough of him by and by if i take him out to canada  once i used to think that would be deliverance now it has become nothing but a gigantic trouble  if you are really equal to it you will not feel it so when the time comes  bertha was miserable at the thought of moving till just when she had come to the right point and then she grew eager for it  it was wonderful how much freshened lucy was by this brief contact with phoebes clear practical mind but only for the time  ever since her arrival at the holt she had sadly flagged though making every effort against her depression  there was something almost piteous in her obedience and submission  all the employments once pressed upon her and then spurned were solicitously resumed or if honor remonstrated against them as overfatiguing were relinquished in the same spirit of resigned meekness  her too visible desire to make an onerous atonement pressed with equal weight on both and the essential want of sympathy rendered the confidences of the one mysteries to the other  honora was grieved that her child had only returned to pine and droop charging much of her melancholy lassitude upon robert and waiting on her with solicitude and tenderness that were unhappily only an additional oppression and all lucillas aversion to solitude did not prevent her friends absence from being a relief  it was all that she could at present desire to be released from the effort of being companionable and be able to indulge her languor without remark her wayward appetite without causing distress and her dejection without caresses commiseration or secret imputations on robert  tidings came from vancouvers land of her uncles death by an accident long as it was since she had seen him the loss was deeply felt  she better appreciated what his care of her father had been and knew better what gratitude he deserved and it was a sore disappointment that he should not live to see her prove her repentance for all her flightiness and selfwill  moreover his death without a son would enable his nephew to alienate the family estate and lucy looked on this as direful shame and humiliation  still there was something soothing in having a sorrow that could be shared with miss charlecote and the tangible cause for depression and retirement was a positive comfort  trouble was the chief dread of her wearied spirit and though she had exerted herself to devise and work the banners she could not attempt being present at the grand forest show and marvelled to see honor set off with twice her years and more than twice her sorrows yet full of the fresh eagerness of youthful anticipation and youthful regrets at leaving her behind and at having nothing to figure at the show  but vegetables were not the order of that day the most memorable the forest had perhaps ever known since six bold lancastrian outlaws had there been hung on the very knoll where the flag of england was always hoisted superior to the flags of all the villages  the country population and the exhibitors were all early in the field and on the watch for the great feature of the daythe londoners  what cheering rent the air as the first vehicle from the little forest station appeared an old stagecoach clustered within and without by white bibs tippets and caps blue frocks and grave demure faces uncertain whether to be charmed or frightened at their elevation and reception and almost dazzled by the bright sunshine and pure air to their perception absolutely thin though heavy laden with the scents of newmown hay and trodden ferns  the horses are stopped down springs mr parsons from the box releases the staid mistress from within lifts or jumps down the twenty girls and watches them form in wellaccustomed file their banner at their head just pausing to be joined by the freight of a rattling omnibus the very roof laden with the like little puritan damsels  the conveyances turn back for another load the procession is conducted slowly away through the road lined by troops of country children regarding the costume as the latest london fashion and holding out many an eager gift of nosegays of foxgloves marigolds southernwood and white pinks  meanwhile break cart fly van barouche gig cart and wagon continue in turn to discharge successive loads twenty children to each responsible keeper white caps are over  behold the parish school of st wulstans  here is fashion  here are hats polkas and full short skirts but pale faces and small limbs  the country mothers cry oh and poor little dears they look very tuly and complacently regard their own sturdy sunburnt offspring at whose staring eyes and ponderous boots

once no ragged regiment but arrayed by their incumbents three sisters in lilac cotton and straw bonnets not concealing however the pinched and squalid looks of the denizens of the overcrowded lanes and alleys  that complaint cannot be made of these sixteen wearers of gray frocks and checked jackets  stunted indeed they are several with the expressionless almost featureless visages of hereditary misery others with fearfully refined loveliness but all are plump wellfed and at ease  they come from the orphanage of st matthews under the charge of the two ladies who walk with them leading two lesser younglings all but too small to be brought to the festival  yes these are the waifs and strays of home and parents absolutely unknown whom robert fulmort has gathered from the streetshis most hopeful conquest from the realm of darkness  here all neatly some stylishly dressed are the st wulstans young womens association girls from fifteen upwards who earn their own livelihood in service or by their handiwork but meet on sunday afternoons to read sing and go to church together have books lent out for the week or questions set for those who like them  it is miss fennimore who is the nucleus of the band she sits with them in church she keeps the books writes the questions and leads the singing and she is walking between her two chief friends answering their eager and intelligent questions about trees and flowers and directing their observation  boys boys boys  objects in flat caps and little round buttons atop kneebreeches and shorttailed coats funnier to look at than their whitecapped sisters gentlemanly choristers tidy sons of artisans and warehousemen ragged halftamed little street vagabonds all file past under curate schoolmaster or pupil teacher till the whole multitude is safely deposited in a large mead running into the heart of the forest and belonging to the ranger sir john raymond who has been busy there with all his family for the last three days  policemen guard the gates from intruders but all can look over the low hedge at the tents at either end the cord dividing boy from girl and the scattered hay on which the strangers move about mostly mazed by the strange sights sounds and smells and only the petted orphans venturing to tumble about that curious article upon the ground  two little sisters however evidently transplanted country children sit up in a corner where they have found some flowers fondling them and hugging them with ecstasy  the band strikes up and at the appointed signal grace is said by the archdeacon from the centre the children are seated on the grass and the nobility clergy and gentry rush to the tents and emerge with baskets of sandwiches of the largest dimensions or cans full of sir johns beer  the whittingtonians devour as those that have eaten nothing this morning the wulstonites as though country air gave great keenness of appetite the subdued silence of awe passes off and voices laughing and play begin to betray some real enjoyment and familiarity  such as are not too perfectly happy in the revelry of tumbling on the grass are then paraded through the show to gaze at peas currants and potatoes pyramids of geraniums and roses peeping through white paper thence the younger ones return to play in the field such of the elder ones as prefer walking are conducted through forest paths to gather flowers and to obtain a closer view of that oftdescribed sight a cornfield  some of the elder wulstonians get up a dance tall girls dancing together with the utmost enjoyment but at four oclock the band plays dulce domum the captains of twenties count heads and hunt up stragglers all gather together in their places plum buns and tea are administered till even these thirsty souls can drink no more  again the files are marshalled the banners displayed and the procession moves towards the little forest church a small lowwalled highroofed building enclosed by stately beeches making a sort of outer cathedral around the little elevation where it stood in its railedin churchyard  two thousand children besides spectators in a building meant for three hundred  how came it to be devised  there is a consultation among the clergy  they go from one portion to another of the wellgeneralled army and each division takes up a position on the ground strewn with dry beech leaves hassocks and mats are brought to the ladies a desk set at the gate and a chair for the archdeacon the choristers are brought near and the short outdoor service is begun  how glorious and full the responses as the voice of many waters and the chanted psalms the beautiful songs of degrees of the 27th of the month rise with new fulness and vividness of meaning among the tall trees and sunlit foliage  one lesson alone is read in charlecote raymonds fine powerful voice and many an eye is filled with tears at the words one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of us all as he gazes on the troops on troops of young and old rich and poor strangers and homeborn all held together in that great unity typified by the overshadowing sky and evidenced by the burst of the creed from every voice and every heart  then follow the versicles the collects the thanksgiving and the blessing and in a few warm kind words the archdeacon calls on all to keep the bond of peace and brotherly love and bade the strangers bear home with them the thought of the wonderful works of god  then      all people that on earth do dwell     sing to the lord with cheerful voice  arises from the congregation in all its simple exultant majesty forcing as it were every voice to break forth into singing unless it be choked by heartswelling  the last note has died away but there is a sweet hush as though lingering still ere breaking the sense that this is none other than the gate of heaven  rattle and rumble the vehicles are coming  the children rise and somewhere begins the indispensable cheer  the gentlemen take the lead three times three for mr fulmort  three cheers for sir john raymond  three for the forest show  shouting and waving of hats will never cease the gentlemen are as crazy as the boys and what will become of the train  tumble them inhoist up the girls while mankind is still vociferous whats all this coming in at the omnibus windows  stand back child you dont want to be set down in london  your nosegay is it  here are the prize nosegays prize potatoes prize currants prize everything showering in on the londoners to display or feast on at home  many a family will have a first taste of fresh country green meat tomorrow of such freshness that is as it may retain after eight hours of show and five of train  but all is compared  how the little girls hug their flowers  if any nosegays reach london alive they will be cherished to their last hour and maybe the leaves will live in prayerbooks for many a year  poor little things  it has been to them apparently a rather weary and oppressive pleasure too strange for the most part to be thoroughly enjoyed but it will live in their memories for many a day and as time goes on will clear itself from the bewilderment till it become one of the precious days that make gems on the thread of life  mervyn  where has he been all this time  true he once said he would see nothing of it and seems to have kept his word  he did not even acknowledge the cheers for mr fulmort  is not something visible behind the broad smooth bole of yonder beech tree  have mervyn and cecily been there all the time of the evening service  it is a remarkable fact that though nobody has told anybody every person who is curious and many who are not know who is to be mrs fulmort of beauchamp    chapter xxvii       when will you marry     say the bells of st mary     when i get rich     say the bells of shoreditch     when will that be     say the bells of stepney     i do not know     says the great bell of bownursery rhyme  there was some truth in lucillas view of herself and honor as belonging to two distinct classes of development  honor had grown up among those who fed on scott wordsworth and fouque took their theology from the british critic and their taste from pugin and moulded their opinions and practice on the past  lucilla and phoebe were essentially of the new generation that of kingsley tennyson ruskin and the saturday review  chivalry had given way to common sense romance to realism respect for antiquity to pitying patronage the past to the future perhaps the present has lost in reverence and refinement as much as it has gained in clearness and confidence  lucilla represented reaction therefore her attitude was antagonistic phoebe was the child of the newer system therefore she loved the elder one and sought out the likenesses to rather than the differences from her own tone of thought and well was it that she had never let slip her hold on that broad unchanging thread of truth the same through all changes making faith and principle one though the developments in practice and shades of thought shake off the essential wisdom on which it grew only to adopt some more fatal aberration of their own  thus standing between the two phoebe was a great help to both in understanding each other and they were far more at ease when she was with them  in october all three went to woolstonelane for a brief stay  honor wished that the physician should see lucilla before the winter and phoebe was glad to avail herself of the opportunity of choosing furniture and hiring servants for her new establishment free from the interference of lady bannerman who was of course at brighton  she had been obliged to let her sisters go to sutton without her as the little parsonage had not room for three guests besides lieschen who was more indispensable to maria than even herself and both the others were earnestly set upon accepting the invitation  cecily silenced her scruples by begging as a proof of acceptance as a sister that she might be intrusted with them and promising that in her own quiet home whence most of the family had been launched into life they should meet with none of the excitements of merry moorcroft and phoebe was obliged to resign her charge for these few weeks and trust from berthas lively letters that all was well  another cause which made honor and lucy anxious to be in london was the possibility of owens arrival  he had last been heard of on the shores of lake superior when he spoke of returning as soon as the survey for a new line of railway should have been completed and it was not unlikely that he might come even before his letter  news would await him that he would regret as much as did his sister  uncle kits death had enabled charles charteris or rather his creditors to advertise castle blanch for sale and lucilla who had a more genuine affection for the place than had any of the natives grieved extremely over the family disgrace that was causing it to pass into other hands  she had an earnest desire to take advantage of the display of the house and grounds to pay the scenes of her youth one last visit  the vehemence of this wish was her first recurrence to her old strength of will and honora beheld it as a symptom of recovery though dreading the long and fatiguing day of emotion  yet it might be taken as another token of improvement that she had ceased from that instinctive caution of feebleness which had made her shrink from all exertion or agitation  her chest was pronounced to be in a satisfactory state her health greatly improved and as there was no longer need for extra precaution the three ladies set forth together on the first fine day  the indian summer was in full glory every wood arrayed in brightness and as they drove from the wrapworth station the banks of the river were surpassingly lovely brown red and olive illuminated by sprays of yellow like fireworks and contrasting with the vivid green of the meadows and dark blue water  honor recollected the fairy boat that once had floated there and glancing at the pale girl beside her could not but own the truth of the similitude of the crushed firefly yet the fire of those days had scorched not lighted and it had been the mirth that tendeth to heaviness  cilla was gazing with all her soul in her eyes in silence  she was trying to revive the sense of home that once had made her heart bound at the first glimpse of wrapworth but her spirit leapt up no more  the familiar scene only impressed the sense of homelessness and of the severance of the last tie to her fathers parish her mothers native place  honor asked if she would stop in the village  not yet she said let us have the castle first  at the next turn they overtook mr prendergast and he was instantly at the carriagedoor exacting a willing promise of taking luncheon with him on the way back a rest for which honor was thankful sure as she was that this visit was costing lucy more than she had anticipated  without a word she beheld the green space of park scattered with groups of glowing trees the elms spangled with gold the maples blushing themselves away the parterre a gorgeous patchwork of scarlet lilac and orange the virginian creeper hanging a crimson mantle on the cloister there was something inexpressibly painful in the sight of all this beauty unheeded and cast away by the owners and displayed as a matter of bargain and sale  phoebe thought of the strange uncomfortable dream that it had been to her when she had before looked and wondered at the scene before her  she retraced roberts restless form in every window and thought how little she had then augured the fruit of what he had suffered  the rooms were opened and set out for inspection  honor and phoebe made it their duty to occupy the chattering maid a stranger to lucilla and leave her free to move through the apartments silent and very white as if it were a sacred duty to stand wherever she had stood to gaze at whatever her eyes had once met  presently she stood still in the diningroom her hand grasping the back of a chair as she looked up to a large picture of three children two boys and a girl fancifully dressed and playing with flowers  the waxen complexion fair hair and blue eyes of the girl were almost her own  this to be sold she said turning round and speaking for the first time  o yes maameverything unreservedly  that picture has been much admiredby the late sir thomas lawrence maamthe children of the late general sir christopher charteris  lucilla whiter than before walked quickly away  in a few seconds phoebe followed and found her leaning on the balustrade of the terrace her breathing heavily oppressed but she smiled coldly and sternly and tightened a stiff cold grasp on phoebes arm as she said  honor has her revenge phoebe  these are the kindred for whom i broke from her  well if charles sells his birthright and his own father i dont know how i can complain of his selling my mother  but lucy listen  miss charlecote was asking about the agent  i am sure she means to try to get it for you  i dare say  it is right that i should bear it  and the maid said that there had been a gentleman speaking about it and trying to secure it  she thought he had written to mr charteris about it  what gentleman and lucy was ready to spring back to inquire  miss charlecote asked and i believe it was mr prendergast  there was a bright though strange flickering of pleasure and pain over cillas face and her eyelids quivered as she said yesyesof course but he must nothe must not do it  he cannot afford it  i cannot let him  perhaps your cousin only needed to be reminded  i have no hope of him  besides he cannot help himself but at leasti say phoebe tell honor that it is kindness itself in her but i cant talk about it to her  and lucillas steps sprang upstairs as desirous to escape the sight and speech of all  after the melancholy round of deserted bedrooms full of bitter recollections lucilla again descended first and at the door met the curate  after a few words she turned and said mr prendergast would row us down to the vicarage if you liked  indeed my dear said honor unwillingly i am afraid of the cold on the water for you  then pray let me walk across the park she said imploringly and miss charlecote yielded rather than try her submission too severely though dreading her overfatigue and set off with phoebe in the fly  you are sure it is not too far for you asked the curate  quite  you know i always used to fly upon wrapworth turf  after some silencei know what you have been doing she said with a choking voice  about the picture  i am sorry you do  it is of no use for you to know that your cousin has no more heart than a lettuce run to seed  when i knew that before why may i not know that there are others not in the same case she said with full heart and eyes  because the sale must take place and the purchaser may be a brute so it may end in disappointment  it cant end in disappointment  it may be far beyond my means continued the curate as if he had been answering her importunities for a new doll  that i know it is she said  if it can be done at all the doing of it may be left to miss charlecoteit is an expiation i owe to her generous spirit  you would rather she did it than i he asked mortified  naydidnt i tell you that i let her do it as an expiation  does not that prove what it costs me  then why not he began  because she interrupted in the first place you have no idea of the price of lawrences portraits and in the second it is so natural that you should be kind to me that it costs even my proud spiritjust nothing at alland again she looked up to him with beamy tearful eyes and quivering smiling lip  what it is still a bore to live with miss charlecote cried he in his rough eagerness  dont use such words she answered smiling  she is all kindness and forgiveness and what can it be but my old vixen spirit that makes this hard to bear  cilla he said  well  cilla  well  i have a great mind to tell you why i came to southminster  to look at a living  to look at you  if i had found you pining and oppressed i had thought of asking if you could put up with your fathers old friend  she looked with eyes of wonder drew her arm away and stood still partly bewildered  you didnt she said half in interrogation  i saw my mistake you were too young and gay  but cilla he added more tremulously if you do wish for a home  dont dont she cried i cant have you talk as if i only wanted a home  and indeed i have none as yet he said  but do you indeed mean that you could think of itand he came nearer  it  nonsense  of you she vehemently exclaimed  how could you think of anything else  cilla he said in great agitation let me know what you are saying dont drive me crazy when it is not in the nature of things you should mean it  why not asked lucilla  it is only too good for me  is it true then he said as he took both her hands in his  is it true that you understand me and are willing to beto be my owndarling charge  oh it would be such rest  it was as if the stormtossed bird was folding its weary wing in perfect calm and confidence  nor could he contain his sudden joy but spoke incoherent words and wellnigh wept over her  how did you come to think of it exclaimed she as the first gush of feeling over they walked on arminarm  i thought of it from the moment when i hoped i might be a resource a comforter at least  not before was the rather odd question  no  the place was forlorn enough without you but i was not such a fool as to think of a young beauty and all that  all that meaning my wickedness said lucilla  tell me again  you always did like the sprite even when it was wicked only you were too good and rightminded  too old and too poor  she is old and poor now said cilla worn out and washed out into a mere rag  and you like her the better  not washed out he said as her countenance flushed into more than its wonted loveliness  i used to wish you hadnt such a face when those insolent fellows talked of youbut you will get up your looks again when i have the care of you  the first college livingthere are some that cant choose but drop before long  the worst is i am growing no younger  ah but i am growing older she cried triumphantly  all women from twentyfive to forty are of the same age as all men from thirty to fifty we are of just the same standing you see  seventeen years between us  nothing at all as you will see when i put on my cap and look staid  no no i cant spare all that yellow hair  yellow indeed if you dont know better what to call it the sooner it is out of sight the better  why what do you call it  flaxen to be sureblonde cendree if you like it betterthat is the colour of tow and ashes  she was like a playful kitten for the next quarter of a mile her prettiest sauciness returning in the exuberant confiding gladness with which she clung to the affection that at length satisfied her spirit but gravity came back to her as they entered the village  poor wrapworth she said you will soon pass to strangers  it is strange to know that yet to feel the old days returning for which i have pined ever since we were carried away from home and mr pendy  yes nothing is wanting but that we could remain here  never mind  we will make a better wrapworth for one another free from the stains of my castle blanch errors and sorrows  i am even glad of the delay  i want a little time to be good with poor dear honor now that i have heart and spirit to be good  and i grudge every week to her  i declare cilla you make me wish evil to my neighbour  then follow my example and be content with this present gladness  ha ha i wonder what theyll say at southminster  didnt i row them for using you so abominably  i have not been near them since  more shame for you  sarah is my best correspondent and no one ever did me so much good as mrs prendergast  i didnt ask her to do you good  you ought to have done so then for i should not be the happy woman i am now if she had not done me good because she could not help it  i hope they wont take it to heart  i hope they will  what  turning you out  oh i meant your throwing yourself away on a brokendown governess therelet us have done with nonsense  come in this way  it was through the churchyard past the three graves which were as trim as if lucilla had daily tended them  thank you she said then gazed in silence till with a sigh she exclaimed  poor edna  monument of my faults  what perverse determination of mine it was that laid her here  it was your generous feeling  do not miscall and embellish my perverse tyranny as much to defy the charterises as to do her justice  i am more ashamed now that i have the secret of your yielding she added with downcast eyes yet a sudden smile at the end  we will take that child home and bring him up said mr prendergast  if his father wishes it it will be right not as if it were the pleasantest of charges  thank you said cilla  three oclock  poor honor she must be starving  what about her stammered mr prendergast hanging back shyly  must she be told  not now said lucilla with all her alert readiness  i will tell her tonight  you will come in the first day you can  tomorrow  every possible day  honor had truly been uneasy fearing that lucilla was walking sitting down or fasting imprudently but the brilliant colour the joyous eyes and lively manner spoke wonderfully for the effects of native air  mr prendergast had become more absent and awkward than ever but his extra shyness passed unremarked and lucillas tact and grace supplied all deficiencies without obtrusiveness  always at home in the vicarage she made none of her former bantering display of familiarity but only employed it quietly to secure the guests having what they wanted and to awaken the host to his duties when he forgot that any one save herself needed attention  she was carried off before the river fog should arise and her abstracted silence all the way home was not wondered at although phoebe sitting opposite to her was at a loss to read the furtive smiles that sometimes unclosed her lips or the calm pensive look of perfect satisfaction on her features and honor could not comprehend her entire absence of fatigue after so trying a day and wondered whether it were really the old complaintwant of feeling  at night honor came to her room and beganmy dear i want to make a little explanation to you if you are not tired  oh noi had a little explanation to make to you she answered with a flush and a smile  perhaps it may be on the same subject and as cilla half laughed and shook her head she addedi meant to tell you that long agofrom the time i had the holti resolved that what remained of my income after the duties of my property were fulfilled should make a fund for you and owen  it is not much but i think you would like to have the option of anticipating a part in case it should be possible to rescue that picture  dear dear honor exclaimed cilla how very kindly you are doing it little did i think that charless heartlessness would have brought me so much joy and kindness  then you would like it to be done said honor delighted to find that she had been able so to administer a benefit as to excite neither offence nor resignation  we will take care that the purchaser learns the circumstances and he can hardly help letting you have it at a fair valuation  thanks thanks dear honor repeated lucy and now for my explanation  mr prendergast has asked me to marry him  had it been herself honor could not have been more astounded  my child impossible  why he might be your father  is it that you want a home lucy  can you not stay with me  i can and i will for the present sweetest honey said cilly caressingly drawing her arm round her  i want to have been good and happy with you but indeed indeed i cant help his being more to me  he is a very excellent man began bewildered honor but i cannot understand  his oddity  thats the very thing which makes him my own and nobody elses mr pendy  listen honor  sit down you dont half know him nor did i know my own heart till now  he came to us you know when my fathers health began to break after my mothers death  he was quite young only a deacon he lived in our house and he was with all his dear clumsiness a daughter to my father a nurse to us  i could tell you of such beautiful awkward tendernesses  how he used to help me with my sumsand tie owens shoes and mince his dinner for himand spare my father all that was possible  i am sure you know how we grieved after him  yes but  and now i know that it was he that i cared for at wrapworth  with him i never was wild and naughty as i was with others though i did not knowoh honor if i had but knownthat he always cared for the horrid little thing i was i could not have gone on so but he was too good and wise even while he did love me to think of this till i had been tamed and come back to you  i am sure i cant be so naughty now since he has thought of me  lucy dearest i am glad to see you so happy but it is very strange to me  it is such a sudden change said honor  no change  i never cared for any one half as much  lucy confounded at her apparent oblivion  it is true said lucy sitting down by her  perhaps i thought i did but if the other had ever been as much to me i could never have used him as i did  oh honor when a person is made of the stuff i am it is very hard to tell which is ones heart and which is ones flirtingmachine for the other thing does simulate all the motions and feel real true pain  but i know now that mr pendy was safe in my rear heart of hearts all the time though i never guessed it and thought he was only a sort of father but you see that was why i was always in awe of getting under roberts dominion and why i survived his turning me off and didnt at all wish him to bring it on again  no that you did not said honor in a cheered voice as if acquitting her  and i am sure if mr prendergast only looked like using me after my deserts as he did it would not be only a demidecline that i should get into said lucilla her eyes full of tears  oh honor think of his care of my father  kiss me and wish me joy in my fathers name and like him for when you know him you will see he is the only person in the wide world to whom you could safely trust your little torment  honor could not but be carried along to give the hearty kiss and motherly congratulation as they were sought and she saw that she must believe what lucy said of her own feelings incomprehensible though they were but she regretted to hear of the waiting for a college living and at the first impulse wished she had heard of this attachment before hiltonburys fate had been fixed  for shame honor as if you ought not to respect hiltonbury too much to tack it to my petticoat  but at least thank you for if you could once think of committing hiltonbury to him you must like it for me  i must like what is so evidently well for you my child  will you tell phoebe  not till we go home i think said cilla with a blush and as if to avoid farther discussion she bade honora good night  decidedly she wished robert to feel more than she would like to see or should he betray no feeling she had rather not be aware of it  but such news was already in town as to put to flight for a time at least the last remnants of coquetry  robert was in the house early in the morning and called miss charlecote to speak to him in the study  he had a packet of letters in his hand of which he gave one to herself a long one in owens writing but unfinished and undirected                                lakeville newcastle district august 14th      my dear honor      there is no saying how much i rejoice that i can write to you and     lucy again under the same roof  i hope soon to see you together     again and revive old times but we are delayed by the discovery that     the swamp lying full in the grand ottawa and superior line is     impracticable and would not only be the death of all the navvies     employed thereon but would swallow bodily the funds of the g o and     s company  so we are carrying our survey in other directions     before making out our report after which i hope to be permanently     engaged on the construction  this will give me three months to spend     at home in knitting up old links and considering how to dispose of     my poor little encumbrance till i can set him to make his way here     you or lucy would perhaps look out for some lady who takes indian     children or the like  i am my own man now and can provide the     wherewithal for my personal expenses are small and engineering is     well paid  lucy must not think of bringing him out for even at her     fastest the far west would be no place for her  let her think of     glendalough and realize that if she were here she would look back on     it as a temple of comfort civilization and civility and this place     is the last attempt at social habitation for 200 and odd miles  it     stands on a lake of its own with an indian name which no man can     speak and no man can spell  it is colonial to the highest degree     and inhabited by all denominations chiefly agreed in worshipping us     as priests of the g o and s line which is to make their fortune     and for their manners least said soonest mended though there are     some happy exceptions french canadian lowland scots etc and a     wiry hardworking parson whose parish extends nearly to lake     superior and whose remaining aroma of university is refreshing     there is also a very nice young lad whose tale may be a moving     example of what it is to come out here expecting to find in the     backwoods robinson crusoes life and that of the last of the mohicans     combined  that is it was not he but his father major randolf an     english officer who knowing nothing of farming less of canada and     least of all of speculation got a grant of land where he speculated     only to lose and got transferred to this forlorn tract only to     shiver with ague and die of swamp fever  during the twentyfive     years of this long agony he had contrived to have two wives the     first of whom left this son whom he educated as a scholar intending     to finish him in england when the tide should turn but whereas it     never did he must needs get a fresh partner into the whirlpool a     yankee damsel out of a boardinghouse  by the time she had had a     couple of children he died and the whole weight remains bound about     young randolfs neck tying him down to work for dear life in this     doleful spot without a farthing of capital no stock no anything     i came upon the clearing one day in the course of my surveying and     never did i see gone to the dogs more clearly written on any spot     the halfburnt or overthrown trees lying about overgrown with wild     vines and raspberries the snake fence broken down the loghouse     looking as if a touch would upset it and nothing hopeful but a     couple of patches of maize and potatoes and a great pumpkin climbing     up a stump  my horse and myself were done up so i halted and was     amazed at the greeting i received from the youth who was hard at     work on his hay singlehanded except for the two children tumbling     in it  the lady in her rockingchair was contrast enough to make me     heartily glad to find that she was his stepmother not his wife     since that i have seen a good deal of him he comes to lakeville     five miles across the bush and seven across the lake to church on     sunday and spends the day with the parson and mr currie has given     him work in our press of business and finds him so effective that     he wants to take him on for good but this cant be while he has got     these three stones about his neck for whom he works harder and lives     worse than any daylabourer at hiltonbury regular hand to mouth no     chance of making a start unless the company will fortunately decide     on the line i am drawing through the heart of his house which will     force them to buy him out of it  i go out tomorrow to mark the said     line for mr currie to report upon and will finish my letter to     travel with said report      aug 21stthanks to the fireking he has done for the ancient     loghouse though next time he mounts his hotcopper filly i do     not desire a second neckandneck race with him  a sprain of the     leg and contusion or confusion of the head are the extent of the     damage received and you will say that it is cheap considering all     things  i had done my 203 miles of marking and was coming back on     my last days journey debating whether to push on to lakeville that     night camp out or get a shakedown at randolfs bringing my own     provender for they live on hominy and milk except for what he can     shoot or catch  it was so dark that i had nearly fixed on sleeping     in the bush when it struck me that there must be an uncommonly fine     aurora but getting up a little rising ground where the trees were     thinner i observed it was to the southwest not the north  that     way there lies prairie land at this season one ocean of dry bents     fit to burn like tinder so that one spark would set fifty square     miles alight at once  all the sky in that quarter was the colour of     glowing copper but the distance was so enormous that danger never     occurred to me till i saw the deer scampering headlong the birds     awake and flying and my horse trembling and wild to be off  then i     remembered that the wind was full from that direction and not a bit     of water between nor all the way to the lakeville lake  i never     knew my beasts pace on the kingston road what it was through that     track all the rustling and scuttling of the beasts and birds     sounding round us the glare gaining on us and the scent of smoke     beginning to taint the wind  there was randolfs clearing at last     lonesome and still as ever and a light in the window  never was it     so hard to pull in a horse however i did so  he was still up     reading by a pine torch and in five minutes more the woman and her     children were upon the horse making for the lake  randolf took his     axe and pocketed a book or two and we dashed off together for a     long arm of swamp that he knew of running out from the lake  when     we got to the other end of the clearing i thought it was all up with     us  the wall of red roaring flame had reached the other side and     the flame was leaping from the top of one pine to another making     them one shape of quivering red like christmas evergreens in the     fire a huge tree perhaps standing up all black against the lurid     light another crashing down like thunder the ribbon of flame     darting up like a demon the whole at once standing forth a sheet of     blazing light  i verily believe i should have stood on fascinated     with the horror and majesty of the sight and feeling it vain to try     to escape when the burning wings were spreading to enclose the     clearing and us with it but randolf urged me on and we plunged     through the bush at the best speed we could make the smoke rolling     after us and the heat glowing like a furnace so as to consume all     power out of us  it was hell itself pursuing after us and roaring     for his prey the trees coming crashing down and shaking the earth     under our feet the flame absolutely running on before us upon the     dry grass and scrub and the scorching withering every drop of     moisture from us though not ten minutes before we had been     streaming at every pore      i saw green reeds before us heard randolf cry out thank god and     thought i was plunging after him when i found myself on the ground     and the branches of a hemlock covering me  happily they were but the     lesser boughs and not yet alight and at his own desperate peril     randolf came back with his axe and cut them off then dragged me     after him into the mud  never bath more welcome  we had to dispute     it with buffaloes deer all the beasts of the wood tame and cowed     with terror and through them we floundered on the cold of the water     to our bodies making the burning atmosphere the more intolerable     round our heads  at last we came to an island where we fell upon     the reeds so much spent that it was long before we found that our     refuge was shared by a bear and by randolfs old cow to the infinite     amaze of the bullfrogs  the fire king was a hundred yards off and     a fierce shower brought from other parts by his unwarrantable     doings began to descend and finally quenched him in such smoke that     we had to lie on our faces to avoid stifling  when the sun arose     there was lakeville in its woods on one side on the other the     blackest desolation conceivable  the population were all astir     mrs randolf had arrived safely and mr currie was about to set     forth in search of my roasted remains when they perceived the     signals of distress that we were making after randolf had done     gallant battle with the bear in defence of the old cow  he is a     firstrate hunter and despatched the fellow with such little aid as     i could give with a leg not fit to stand upon and when the canoes     came off to fetch us he would not leave the place till he had     skinned the beast  my leg is unserviceable at present and all my     bones feel the effect of the night in the swamp so i am to lay by     make the drawings and draw up the report while mr currie and     randolf do my work over again all my marks having been effaced by     his majesty the fire king and the clearing done to our hand  if i     could only get rid of the intolerable parching and thirst and the     burning of my brains  i should not wonder if i were in for a touch     of swamp fever  here owens letter broke off and honor begged in alarm for what robert evidently had in reserve  he had received this letter to her enclosed in one from mr currie desiring him to inform poor young sandbrooks friends of his state  by his account owens delay and surrender of his horse had been an act of gallant selfdevotion placing him in frightfully imminent danger whence only the cool readiness of young randolf had brought him off apparently with but slight hurts from the fall of the tree and exposure to the night air of the heated swamp  he had been left at lakeville in full confidence of restoration after a weeks rest but on returning from lake superior mr currie found him insensible under what was at first taken for an aggravated access of the local fever until as consciousness returned it became evident that the limbs on the left side were powerless  between a litter and water transport the sufferer was conveyed to montreal where the evil was traced to concussion of the brain from the blow from the tree the more dangerous because unfelt at first and increased by application to business  the injury of the head had deprived the limbs of motion and sensation and the medical men thought the case hopeless though likely to linger through many stages of feebleness of mind and body  under these circumstances mr currie being obliged to return home himself and unable to leave the poor young man in such a condition among strangers had decided on bringing him to england according to his own most eager desire as the doctors declared that the voyage could do no harm and might be beneficial  mr currie wrote from quebec where he had taken his passage by a steamer that would follow his letter in four days time and he begged robert to write to him at liverpool stating what should be done with the patient should he be then alive  his mind he said was clear but weak and his memory from the moment of his fall till nearly the present time a blank  he had begged mr currie to write to his sister or to miss charlecote but the engineer had preferred to devolve the communication upon mr fulmort  of poor owen he spoke with much feeling in high terms of commendation saying that he was a valuable friend and companion as well as a very right hand in his business and that his friends might be assured that he mr currie would watch over him as if he were his own son and that his temporary assistant mr randolf was devoted to him and had nursed him most tenderly from the first  four days time said honor when she had taken in the sense of these appalling tidings  we can be at liverpool to meet him  do not object robert  nothing else will be bearable to either his sister or me  it was of his sister that i was thinking said robert  do you think her strong enough for the risks of a hurried journey with perhaps a worse shock awaiting her when the steamer comes in  will you let me go alone  i have sent orders to be telegraphed for as soon as the asia is signalled and if i go at once i can either send for you if needful or bring him to you  will you not let me  he spoke with persuasive authority and honora half yielded  it may be better she said it may  a man may do more for him there than we could but i do not know whether poor lucy will let you or as a sudden recollection recurred to her whether she ought  poor owen is my friend my charge said robert  i believe you are right you kind robin said honor  the journey might be a great danger for lucy and if i went i know she would not stay behind  but i still think she will insist on seeing him  i believe not said robert at least if she regard submission as a duty  oh robin you do not know  poor child how am i to tell her  would you like for me to do so said robert in the quiet matterofcourse way of one to whom painful offices had become wellnigh natural  you  o robin if you she said in some confusion but at the moment the sound of the visitors bell startled her and she was about to take measures for their exclusion when looking from the window she saw that the curate of wrapworth had already been admitted into the court  the next moment she had met him in the hall and seizing his hand exclaimed in a hurried whisper i know  i know  but there is a terrible stroke hanging over my poor child  come in and help us to tell her  she drew him into the study and shut the door  the poor mans sallowness had become almost livid and in halfsobbing words he exclaimedis it so  then give her to me at once  i will nurse her to the last or save her  i knew it was only her being driven out to that miserable governess life that has been destroying her and he quite glared upon poor innocent honor as a murderess  mr prendergast i do not know what you mean  lucilla is nearly well again  it is only that we fear to give her some bad news of her brother  her brother  is that all said the curate in a tone of absolute satisfaction  i beg your pardon miss charlecote i thought i saw a doctor here and you were going to sentence my darling  you do see robert fulmort whom i thought you knew  so i do said mr prendergast holding out his hand  i beg your pardon for having made such a fool of myself but you see since i came to an understanding with that dear child i have not thought of anything else nor known what i was about  robert could not but look inquiringly at miss charlecote  yes she faltered mr prendergast has told youwhat i could notwhat i had not leave to say  yes put in mr prendergast in his overflowing felicity i see you think it a shocking match for such a little gem of beauty as that but you young men should have been sharper  theres no accounting for tastes and he laughed awkwardly  i am heartily glad said robertand voice look and grasp of the hand conveyed the fullest earnestnessi am exceedingly rejoiced that the dear little friend of all my life should be in such keeping  i congratulate you most sincerely mr prendergast  i never saw any one so well able to appreciate her  that is over thought honor how well he has stood it  and now she ventured to recall them to the subject in hand which might well hang more heavily on her heart than the sisters fate  it was agreed that lucilla would bear the intelligence best from mr prendergast and that he could most easily restrain her desire for going to liverpool  he offered himself to go to meet owen but honor could not quite forgive the is that all and robert remained constant to his former view that he as friend both of owen and mr currie would be the most effective so therefore it stood and lucilla was called out of the drawingroom to mr prendergast as honor and robert entered it  it was almost in one burst that phoebe learnt the brothers accident and the sisters engagement and it took her several moments to disentangle two such extraordinary events  i am very glad repeated robert as he felt rather than saw that both ladies were regarding him with concealed anxiety it is by far the happiest and safest thing for her  it is an infinite relief to my mind  i cant but be glad said honor but i dont know how to forgive her  that i can do very easily said robert with a smile on his thin lips that was very reassuring not only as a christian but as i believe nothing ever did me so much good  my fancy for her was an incentive which drew me on to get under better influences and when we threw each other overboard i could do without it  she has been my best friend not even excepting you miss charlecote and as such i hope always to be allowed to regard her  there phoebe you have had an exposition of my sentiments once for all and i hope i may henceforth receive credit for sincerity  miss charlecote felt that under the name of phoebe this last reproof was chiefly addressed to her and perhaps phoebe understood the same for there was the slightest of all arch smiles about her full lip and downcast eye and though she said nothing her complete faith in her brothers explanation and her christian forgiveness of lucilla did not quench a strong reserve of wondering indignation at the mixed preferences that had thus strangely settled down upon the old curate  she followed her brother from the room to ask whether she had better not leave woolstonelane in the present juncture  but there was nowhere for her to go beauchamp was shut up the cottage being painted sutton barely held the three present guests and her elder sister from home you cannot go without making a disturbance said robert besides i think you ought to stay with miss charlecote  lucilla is of no use to her and this unlucky owen is more to her than all the world besides you may comfort her  phoebe had no more to urge  she could not tell her brother that looks and words of owen sandbrook and in especial his last farewell which she was at that time too young and simple to understand had with her greater experience risen upon her in an aspect that made her desirous of avoiding him  but besides the awkwardness of such recollections at all they seemed cruel and selfish when the poor young man was coming home crippled and shattered only to die so she dismissed them entirely and set herself to listen and sympathize    chapter xxviii       old isle and glorious i have heard        thy fame across the sea     and know my fathers homes are thine        my fathers rest with theea cleveland lore  r m fulmort to miss charlecotethe carriage to meet the 6 pm train  that was all the intelligence that reached woolstonelane till the courtgates were opened and robert hurried in before the carriage much better he said only he is sadly knocked up by the journey  do not show yourselves till he is in his room  which is it  honora and lucilla hastened to point it out then drew back and waited honor supporting herself against the wall pale and breathless lucy hanging over the balusters fevered with suspense  she heard the tread the quick muttered question and answer she saw the heavy helpless weight carried in and as the steps came upwards she was pulled back into the sittingroom by honor at first almost by force then with passive dejected submission and held tight to the back of a chair her lip between her teeth as though withholding herself by force from springing forward as the familiar voice weak weary and uncertain met her ear  at length robert beckoned and she flew at first then slackened her pace awestruck  her brother lay on the bed with closed eyes  the form was larger more manly and robust than what she had known the powerful framework rendering the wreck more piteous and the handsome dark beard and moustache and crisp thick curls of hair made the straight wellcut features resemble an old picture of a cavalier nor had the bright sunburnt complexion lost the hue of health so that the whole gave the idea of present suffering rather than abiding illness  he seemed to her like a stranger till at her step he looked up and his dark gray eyes were all himself as he held out his hand and fondly spoke her name  she hung over him restraining her exclamations with strong force and even in the midst of her embrace he was saying honor  is honor here  trembling with emotion honor bent to kiss his brow and felt his arm thrown about her neck and the hairy lips kissing either cheek just as when smooth and babyish they had sought her motherly caress  may i come home he asked  they brought me without your leave  and you could not feel sure of your sweet honeys welcome  he smiled his old smile of fondness but dimmed by pain and languor and the heavy lids sank over his eyes but to be at once raised  lucy home honor  it is all i wanted he said you will be good to me such as i am  we will sit close to you my dear only you cannot talkyou must rest  yes  my head is very badmy eyes ache he said turning his head from the light with closed eyes and hand over them but then he addedone thing firstwhere is he  your little boy said lucilla  do you wish to see him  i will call him  no no i could not and his brow contracted with pain  no but did not i tell you all about himyour cousin honor  do pull the curtain round the light hurts me  convinced that his mind was astray there was no attempt at answering him and all were so entirely occupied with his comforts that phoebe saw and heard no one until robert came down telling her that owen had in fact improved much on the voyage but that the long days journey by train had brought on such severe and exhausting pain in the head that he could scarcely speak or look up and fatigue seemed to have confused the faculties that in the morning had been quite clear  robert was obliged to go to his seven oclock service and phoebe would fain have come with him but he thought she might be useful at home  miss charlecote is so much absorbed in owen he said that i do not think she heard a word about that young randolf  mr currie is gone to spend tomorrow and sunday with his father at birmingham but he let me have this young man to help to bring owen home  make miss charlecote understand that he is to sleep at my place  i will come back for him and he is not to be in her way  he is such a nice fellow  and phoebe i have no time but there is mrs murrell with the child in the study can you make her understand that owen is far too ill to see them tonight  keep them off poor lucy thats all  lucy thats all thought phoebe as she moved to obey  in spite of all he says lucy will always be his first thought next to st matthews nor do i know why i should mind it considering what a vast space there is between  now my pa is come shant i be a gentleman and ride in a carriage were the sounds that greeted phoebes ears as she opened the door of the study and beheld the small lean child dressed in all his best not one of the gray linen frocks that lucilla was constantly making for him but in a radiant tartan of such huge pattern that his little tunic barely contained a sample of one of each portentous check made up crosswise so as to give a most comical harlequin effect to his spare limbs and weird black eyes  the disappointment that phoebe had to inflict was severe and unwittingly she was the messenger whom mrs murrell was likely to regard with the most suspicion and dislike  come home along with me hoing my dear she said youll always find poor granny your friend even if your pas art is like the nether millstone as it was to your poor ma and as others may find it yet  i have no doubt mr sandbrook will see him when he is a little recovered after his journey said phoebe  no doubt maam  i dont make a doubt so long as there is no one to put between them  i have eard how the sight of an opeful son was as balm to the eyes of his father but if i could see mr fulmort  my brother is gone to church  it was he who sent me to you  mrs murrell had real confidence in robert whose friendliness had long been proved and it was less impossible to persuade her to leave the house when she learnt that it was by his wish but phoebe did not wonder at the dread with which an interview with her was universally regarded  in returning from this mission phoebe encountered the stranger in the lamplight of the hall intently examining the balustrade of the stairs  this is the drawingroom she courteously said seeing that he seemed not to know where to go  thank you he said following her  i was looking at the wood  what is it  we have none like it  it is irish bog oak and much admired  i suppose all english houses can scarcely be like this said he looking round at the carved wainscot  oh no this house is a curiosity  part was built before 1500  in the time of the indians  then smiling i had forgotten  it is hard to realize that i am where i have so long wished to be  am i actually in a room 360 years old  no this room is less ancient  here is the date 1605 on the panel  then this is such a house as milton might have grown up in  it looks on the thames  how could you tell that  my father had a map of london that i knew by heart and after we came under temple bar i marked the bearings of the streets  before that i was not clear  perhaps there have been changes since 1830 the date of his map  phoebe opened a map and he eagerly traced his route pronouncing the names of the historical localities with a relish that made her almost sorry for their present associations  she liked his looks  he seemed to be about two or three and twenty tall and wellmade with somewhat of the bearing of his soldierfather but broadshouldered and athletic as though his strength had been exercised in actual bodily labour  his clear light hazel eye was candid and well opened with that peculiar prompt vigilance acquired by living in a wild country both steady to observe and keen to keep watch  the dark chestnut hair covered a rather square brow very fair though the rest of the face was browned by sun and weather the nose was straight and sensible the chin short and firm the lips though somewhat compressed when shut had a look of goodhumour and cheerful intelligence peculiarly pleasant to behold  altogether it was a face that inspired trust  presently the entrance of the teathings obliged the map to be cleared away and phoebe while measuring out the tea said that she supposed miss charlecote would soon come down  then are not you a charlecote he asked with a tone of disappointment  oh no  i am phoebe fulmort  there is no charlecote left but herself  it was my mothers name and mine humfrey charlecote randolf sandbrook thought there was some connection between the families  phoebe absolutely started hurt for a moment that a stranger should presume to claim a name of such associations yet as she met the bright honest eyes feeling glad that it should still be a living name worthily borne  it is an old family name at hiltonbury and one very much honoured she said  that is well he said  it is good to have a name that calls one to live up to it  and what is more strange i am sure miss charlecote once had my mothers hair  beautiful ruddy gold  yes yes like no one else  i was wanting to do like poor sandbrook he looked up in her face and stroked her hair as she was leaning over him and said i dont like to miss my own curls  ah said phoebe half indignantly he should know when those curls were hidden away and grew silvery  he told me those things in part said the young man  he has felt the return very deeply and i think it accounts for his being so much worse tonightworse than i have seen him since we were at montreal  is he quite sensible  perfectly  i see the ladies do not think him so tonight but he has been himself from the first except that overfatigue or extra weakness affect his memory for the time and he cannot read or exert his mindscarcely be read to  and he is sadly depressed in spirits  and no wonder poor man said phoebe  but i cannot think it is as they told us at montreal  what  that the brain would go on weakening and he become more childish  now i am sure as he has grown stronger he has recovered intellect and intelligence  no one could doubt it who heard him three days ago advising me what branch of mathematics to work up  we shall hear tomorrow what dr f says  miss charlecote wrote to him as soon as we had my brothers telegram  i hope you are right  for you see continued the canadian eagerly injury from an external cause cannot be like original organic disease  i hope and trust he may recover  he is the best friend i ever had except mr henley our clergyman at lakeville  you know how he saved all our lives and he persuaded mr currie to try me and give me a chance of providing for my little brothers and their mother better than by our poor old farm  where are they asked phoebe  she is gone to her sister at buffalo  the price of the land will help them on for a little while there and if i can get on in engineering i shall be able to keep them in some comfort  i began to think the poor boys were doomed to have no education at all  did you always live at lakeville  no i grew up in a much more civilized part of the world  we had a beautiful farm upon lake ontario and raised the best crops in the neighbourhood  it was not till we got entangled in the land company five years ago that we were sold up and we have been sinking deeper ever sincetill the old cow and i had the farm all to ourselves  how could you bear it asked phoebe  well it was rather dreary to see one thing going after another  but somehow after i lost my own black mare poor minnehaha i never cared so much for any of the other things  once for all i got ashamed of my own childish selfishness  and then you see the worse things were the stronger the call for exertion  that was the great help  oh yes i can quite imagine thati know it said phoebe thinking how exertion had helped her through her winter of trial  you never were without some one to work for  no even when my father was goneand his voice was less clearthere was the less time to feel the change when the boys and their mother had nothing but me between them and want  and you worked for them  after a fashion he said smiling  spadehusbandry alone is very poor earthscratching and i dont really know whether between that and my gun we could have got through this winter  what a life exclaimed phoebe  realities indeed  it is only what many colonists undergo he answered if they do not prosper it is a very hard life and the shifting hopes render it the more trying to those who are not bred to it  and to those that are she asked  to those that are there are many compensations  it is a free outofdoors life and the glorious sense of extent and magnificence in our woods the sport one has there the beauty of our autumns and our white grand silent winters make it a life well worth living  and would these have made you content to be a backwoodsman all your life  i cannot tell he said  theyand the boyswere my delight when i was one  and after all i used to recollect it was a place where there was a clear duty to do and so perhaps safer than what fancy or choice would point at  but you are very glad not to be still condemned to it  heartily glad not to be left to try to prop up a tumbledown loghut with my own shoulder he laughed  this journey to england has been the great desire of my life and i am very thankful to have had it brought about  the conversation was broken off by roberts entrance  finding that it was nearly nine oclock he went upstairs to remind miss charlecote that tea had long been awaiting her and presently brought her back from the silent watch by owens side that had hitherto seemed to be rest and comfort to all the three  owen had begged that his cup might be sent up by his friend on whom he was very dependent and it was agreed that mr randolf should sleep in his room and remain as a guest at woolstonelane until mr currie should come to town  indeed miss charlecote relied on him for giving the physician an account of the illness which owen at his best could not himself describe and she cordially thanked him for his evidently devoted attendance going over every particular with him but still so completely absorbed in her patient as to regard him in no light but as an appendage necessary to her boy  how did you get on with the backwoodsman phoebe asked lucilla when she came down to tea  i think he is a sterling character said phoebe in a tone of grave deep thought not quite as if answering the question and with an observable deepening of the red of her cheek  you quaint goose said lucy with a laugh that jarred upon honor who turned round at her with a look of reproachful surprise  indeed honor dear she said in selfvindication i am not hardhearted  i am only very much relieved  i dont think half so badly of poor owen as i expected to do and if we can keep mrs murrell from driving him distracted i expect to see him mend fast  robert confirmed her cheerful opinion but their younger and better prognostications fell sadly upon honoras ear  she had been too much grieved and shocked to look for recovery and all that she dared to expect was to tend her darlings feebleness her best desire was that his mind might yet have power to embrace the hope of everlasting life ere he should pass away from her  let this be granted and she was prepared to be thankful be his decay never so painful to witness and attend  she could not let robert leave her that night without a trembling question whether he had learnt how it was with owen on this point  he had not failed to inquire of the engineer but he could tell her very little  owens conduct had been unexceptionable but he had made scarcely any demonstration or profession and on the few occasions when opinions were discussed spoke not irreverently but in a tone of one who regretted and respected the tenets that he no longer held  since his accident he had been too weak and confused to dwell on any subjects but those of the moment but he had appeared to take pleasure in the unobtrusive though decided religious habits of young randolf  there she must rest for the present and trust to the influence of home perhaps to that of the shadow of death  at least he was the child of many prayers and had not lucilla returned to her changed beyond her hopes  let it be as it would she could not but sleep in gratitude that both her children were again beneath her roof  she was early dressed and wishing the backwoodsman were anywhere but in owens room  however to her joy the door was open and owen called her in looking so handsome as he lay partly raised by pillows that she could hardly believe in his condition except for his weak subdued voice  yes i am much better this morning  i have slept off the headache and have been enjoying the old sounds  where is your friend  rushed off to look at st pauls through the shaking of doormats and pay his respects to the thames  he has none of the colonial nil admirari spirit but looks at england as a greek colonist would have looked at athens  i only regret that the reality must tame his raptures i told him to come back by breakfasttime  he will lose his way  not he  you little know the backwoods power of topography  even i could nearly rival some of the arab stories and he could guide you anywhereor after any given beast in the newcastle district  honor you must know and like him  he really is the new world charlecote whom you always held over our heads  i thought you called him randolf  that is his surname but his christian name is humfrey charlecote from his grandfather  his mother was the lady my father told you of  he saved an old bible out of the fire with it all in the flyleaf  he shall show it to you and it can be easily confirmed by writing to the places  i would have gone myself if i had not been the poor creature i am  yes my dear said honora i dare say it is so  i am very glad you found so attentive a friend  i am most thankful to him for his care of you  and you accept him as a relation said owen anxiously  yes oh yes said honor  would you like anything before breakfast  owen answered with a little plaintiveness  perhaps he was disappointed at this cold acquiescence but it was not a moment at which honor could face the thought of a colonial claimant of the holt  with owen helpless upon her hands she needed both a home and ample means to provide for him and his sister and child and the american heir an unwelcome idea twenty years previously when only a vague possibility was doubly undesirable when long possession had endeared her inheritance to her when he proved not even to be a true charlecote and when her own adopted children were in sore want of all that she could do for them  the evident relinquishment of poor owens own selfish views on the holt made her the less willing to admit a rival and she was sufficiently on the borders of age to be pained by having the question of heirship brought forward  and she knew what owen did not that if this youths descent were indeed what it was said to be he represented the elder line and that even humfrey had wondered what would be his duty in the present contingency  nonsense said she to herself  there is no need as yet to think of it  the place is my own by every right  humfrey told me so  i will take time to see what this youth may be and make sure of his relationship  then if it be right and just he shall come after me but i will not raise expectations nor notice him more than as owens friend and a distant kinsman  it would be fatally unsettling to do more  owen urged her no farther  either he had not energy to enforce any point for long together or he felt that the succession might be a delicate subject for he let her lead to his personal affairs and he was invalid enough to find them fully engrossing  the canadian came in punctually full of animation and excitement of which phoebe had the full benefit till he was called to help owen to dress  while this was going on robert came into the drawingroom to breathe after the hard task of pacifying mrs murrell  what are you going to do today phoebe he asked  have you got through your shopping  some of it  do you mean that you could come out with me  yes you will never get through business otherwise  then if you have an afternoon to spare could not we take mr randolf to the tower  why phoebe  he has only today at liberty and is so full of eagerness about all the grand old historical places that it seems hard that he should have to find his way about alone with no one to sympathize with himhalf the day cut up too with nursing owen  he seems to have no difficulty in finding his way  no but i really should enjoy showing him the old armour  he was asking me about it this morning  i think he knows nearly as much of it as we do  very well  i say phoebe would you object to my taking brown and claymy two head boys  i owe them a treat and they would just enter into this  phoebe was perfectly willing to accept the two head boys and the appointment had just been made when the doctor arrived  again he brought good hope  from his own examination of owen and from mr randolfs report he was convinced that a considerable amelioration had taken place and saw every reason to hope that in so young and vigorous a nature the injury to the brain might be completely repaired and the use of the limbs might in part at least return though full recovery could not be expected  he wished to observe his patient for a month or six weeks in town that the course of treatment might be decided after which he had better be taken to the holt to enjoy the pure air and be out of doors as much as the season would permit  to honor this opinion was the cause of the deepest most thankful gladness but on coming back to owen she found him sitting in his easychair with his hand over his eyes and his look full of inexpressible dejection and despondency  he did not however advert to the subject only saying now then let us have in the young pauper to see the old one  my dear owen you had better rest  no no let us do the thing  the grandmother too he said impatiently  i will fetch little owen but you really are not fit for mrs murrell  yes i am what am i good for but such things  it will make no difference and it must be done  my boy you do not know to what you expose yourself  dont i said owen sadly  lucilla even though mr prendergast had just come to share her anxieties caught her nephew on his way and popped her last newly completed pinafore over his harlequinism persuading him that it was most beautiful and new  the interview passed off better than could have been hoped  the fullgrown gravelooking man was so different from the mere youth whom mrs murrell had been used to scold and preach at that her own awe seconded the lectures upon quietness that had been strenuously impressed on her and she could not complain of his reception of his opeful son in form at least  owen held out his hand to her and bent to kiss his boy signed to her to sit down and patiently answered her inquiries and regrets asking a few civil questions in his turn  then he exerted himself to say i hope to do my best for him and for you mrs murrell but i can make no promises i am entirely dependent at present and i do not know whether i may not be so for life  whereat and at the settled mournful look with which it was spoken mrs murrell burst out crying and little owen hung on her almost crying too honor who had been lying in wait for owens protection came hastily in and made a clearance owen again reaching out his hand which he laid on the childs head so as to turn up the face towards him for a moment then releasing it almost immediately he rested his chin on his hand and honor heard him mutter under his moustache flibbertigibbet  when we go home we will take little owen with us said honor kindly it is high time he was taken from little whittingtonstreet  country air will soon make a differentlooking child of him  thank you he answered despondingly  it is very good in you but have you not troubles enough already  he shall not be a trouble but a pleasure  poor little wretch  he must grow up to work and to know that he must work while he can and owen passed his hand over those useless fingers of his as though the longing to be able to work were strong on him  honor had agreed with lucilla that father and son ought to be together and that little hoeings education ought to commence  cilla insisted that all care of him should fall to her  she was in a vehement passionate mood of selfdevotion more overset by hearing that her brother would be a cripple for life than by what appeared to her the less melancholy doom of an early death  she had allowed herself to hope so much from his improvement on the voyage that what to honor was unexpected gladness was to her grievous disappointment  mr prendergast arrived to find her half captious half desperate  see owen  oh no he must not think of it  owen had seen quite people enough today besides he would be letting all out to him as he had done the other day  poor mr prendergast humbly apologized for his betrayal but had not owen been told of the engagement  oh dear no  he was in no state for fresh agitations  indeed with him a miserable helpless cripple lucy did not see how she could go on as before  she could not desert himoh noshe must work for him and his child  work  why cilla you have not strength for it  i am quite well  i have strength for anything now i have some one to work for  nothing hurts me but loneliness  folly child  the same home that receives you will receive them  nonsense  as if i could throw such a dead weight on any ones hands  not on any ones said mr prendergast  but i see how it is cilla you have changed your mind  no said lucilla with an outbreak of her old impatience but you men are so selfish  bothering me about proclaiming all this nonsense just when my brother is come home in this wretched state  after all he was my brother before anything else and i have a right to consider him first  then cilla you shall be bothered no more said mr prendergast rising  if you want me well and goodyou know where to find your old friend if not and you cant make up your mind to it why then we are as we were in old times  goodbye my dear i wont fret you any more  no said he to himself as he paused in the court and was busy wiping from the sleeve of his coat two broad dashes of wet that had certainly not proceeded from the clouds the dear childs whole heart is with her brother now she has got him back again  ill not torment her any more what a fool i was to think that anything but loneliness could have made her accept mepoor darling  i think ill go out to the bishop of sierra leone  what can have happened to him thought phoebe as he strode past the little party on their walk to the tower  can that wretched little cilly have been teasing him  i am glad robert has escaped from her clutches  however phoebe had little leisure for such speculations in the entertainment of witnessing her companions intelligent interest in all that he saw  the walk itselffor which she had beggedwas full of wonder and the tower which roberts slight knowledge of one of the officials enabled them to see in perfection received the fullest justice both historically and loyally  the incumbent of st matthews was so much occupied with explanations to his boys that phoebe had the stranger all to herself and thus entered to the full into that unfashionable but most heartstirring of london sights the towers of julius from the traitors gate where elizabeth sat in her lionlike desolation to her effigy in her glory upon tilbury heaththe axe that severed her mothers slender neckthe pistolcrowned stick of her fatherthe dark cage where her favourite raleigh was mewedand the whole series of the relics of the disgraces and the glories of englands royal linewell fitted indeed to strike the imagination of one who had grown up in the new world without antiquity  if it were a satisfaction to be praised and thanked for this expedition phoebe had it for on her return she was called into owens room where his first words to her were of thanks for her goodnature to his friend  i am sure it was nothing but a pleasure she said  it happened that robert had some boys whom he wanted to take  somehow she did not wish owen to think she had done it on his own account  and you liked him asked owen  yes very much indeed she heartily said  ah i knew you would and he lay back as if fatigued  then as phoebe was about to leave him he addedi cant get my ladies to heed anything but me  you and robert must take pity on him if you please  get him to westminster abbey or the temple church or somewhere worth seeing tomorrow  dont let them be extortionate of his waiting on me  i must learn to do without him  phoebe promised and went  phoebe is grown what one calls a fine young woman instead of a sweet girl said owen to his sister when she next came into the room but she has managed to keep her innocent halfwondering look just as she has the freshness of her colour  well why not when she has not had one real experience said lucilla a little bitterly  none he asked with a marked tone  none she answered and he let his hand drop with a sigh but as if repenting of any half betrayal of feeling added she has had all her brothers and sisters at sixes and sevens has not she  do you call that a real experience said lucilla almost with disdain and the conversation dropped  owens designs for his friends sunday fell to the ground  the backwoodsman fenced off the proposals for his pleasure by his wish to be useful in the sickroom and when told of owens desire was driven to confess that he did not wish for fancy churchgoing on his first english sunday  there was enough novelty without that the cathedral service was too new for him to wish to hear it for the first time when there was so much that was unsettling  honor and even robert were a little disappointed  they thought eagerness for musical service almost necessarily went with church feeling and phoebe was the least in the world out of favour for the confession that though it was well that choirs should offer the most exquisite and ornate praise yet that her own countrybred associations with the plain unadorned service at hiltonbury rendered her more at home where the prayers were read and the responses congregational not choral  to her it was more devotional though she fully believed that the other way was the best for those who had begun with it  so they went as usual to the full service of the parish church where the customs were scrupulously rubrical without being ornate  the rest and calm of that sunday were a boon coming as they did after a bustling week  all the ensuing days phoebe was going about choosing curtains and carpets or hiring servants for herself or mervyn  she was obliged to act alone for miss charlecote on whom she had relied for aid was engrossed in attending on owen and endeavouring to wile away the hours that hung heavily on one incapable of employment or even attention for more than a few minutes together  so constantly were honor and lucy engaged with him that phoebe hardly saw them morning noon or night and after being out for many hours it generally fell to her lot to entertain the young canadian for the chief part of the evening  mr currie had arrived in town on the monday and came at once to see owen his lodgings were in the city where he would be occupied for some time in more formally mapping out and reporting on the various lines proposed for the g o and s line and finding how necessary young randolf still was to the invalid he willingly agreed to the proposal that while miss charlecote continued in london the young man should continue to sleep and spend his evenings in woolstonelane    chapter xxix       have you seen but a bright lily grow        before rude hands have touched it     have you marked but the fall of the snow        before the soil hath smutched itben jonson  at the end of a week mervyn made his appearance in a vehement hurry cecilys next sister an officers wife was coming home with two little children for a farewell visit before going to the cape and maria and bertha must make way for her  so he wanted to take phoebe home that afternoon to get the underwood ready for them  mervyn how can i go  i am not nearly ready  what can you have been doing then he exclaimed with something of his old temper  this house has been in such a state  well you were not wanted to nurse the sick man were you  i thought you were one that was to be trusted  what more is there to do  phoebe looked at her list of commissions and found herself convicted those patterns ought to have been sent back two days since  what had she been about  listening to mr randolfs explanations of the hiawatha scenery  why had she not written a note about that hideous hearthrug because mr randolf was looking over stowes survey of london methodical phoebe felt herself in disgrace and yet somehow she could not be sorry enough she wanted a reprieve from exile at hiltonbury alone and away from all that was going on  at least she should hear whether macbeth at the princesss theatre fulfilled mr randolfs conceptions of it and if mr currie approved his grand map of the newcastle district with the little trees that she had taught him to draw  perhaps it was the first time that mervyn had been justly angry with her but he was so much less savage than in his injustice that she was very much ashamed and touched and finally deeply grateful for the grace of this one day in which to repair her negligence provided she would be ready to start by seven oclock next morning  hard and diligently she worked and very late she came home  as she was on her way upstairs she met robert coming out of owens room  phoebe he said turning with her into her room what is the matter with lucy  the matter  do you mean that you have not observed how ill she is looking  no nothing particular  phoebe i cannot imagine what you have been thinking about  i thought you would have saved her and helped miss charlecote and you absolutely never noticed her looks  i am very sorry  i have been so much engaged  absorbed you should call it  who would have thought you would be so heedless of her  he was gone  still crazy about lucy was phoebes first thought her second another brother finding me heedless and selfish  what can be the matter with me  and when she looked at lucilla with observant eyes she did indeed recognize the justice of roberts anxiety and amazement the brilliant prettiness had faded away as if under a blight the eyes were sinking into purple hollows the attitude was listless the whole air full of suffering  phoebe was dismayed and consciencestricken and would fain have offered inquiries and sympathy but no one had more thoroughly than lucy the power of repulsion  no nothing was amissof course she felt the frost  she would not speak to honorthere was nothing to speak about and she went up to her brothers room  mr randolf was out with mr currie and phoebe still exceedingly busy writing notes and orders and packing for her journey did not know that there was an unconscious resolution in her own mind that her business should not be done till he came home were it at one oclock at night he did come at no unreasonable hour and found her fastening directions upon the pile of boxes in the hall  what are you doing  miss charlecote is not going away  no but i am going tomorrow  you  yes i must get into our new house and receive my sisters there the day after tomorrow  i thought you lived with miss charlecote  is it possible that you did not know what i have been doing all this week  were you not preparing a house for your brother  yes and another for myself  did you not understand that we set up housekeeping separately upon his marriage  i did not understand said humfrey randolf disconsolately  you told me you owed everything to miss charlecote  i am afraid your colonial education translated that into pounds s d  then you are not poor  no not exactly said phoebe rather puzzled and amused by his downcast air  but he exclaimed your brother is in business and mr fulmort of st matthews  mr fulmort of st matthews is poor because he gave all to st matthews said phoebe but our business is not a small one and the property in the country is large  he pasted on her last direction in disconsolate silence then reading miss fulmort the underwood hiltonbury elverslope station resumed with fresh animation at least you live near miss charlecote  yes we are wedged in between her park and our ownmy brothers i mean  that is all right then  she has asked me for christmas  i am very glad of it said phoebe  there thank you good night  is there nothing more that i can do for you  nothingno no dont hammer that down you will wake owen  good night goodbye i shall be gone by halfpast six  though phoebe said goodbye she knew perfectly well that the hours of the morning were as nothing to the backwoodsman and with spirits greatly exhilarated by the christmas invitation she went to bed much too sleepy to make out why her wealth seemed so severe a shock to humfrey randolf  the six oclock breakfast was well attended for miss charlecote was there herself as well as the canadian phoebe and mervyn who was wonderfully amiable considering the hour in the morning  phoebe felt in some slight degree less unfeeling when she found that lucillas fading looks had been no more noticed by miss charlecote than by herself but honor thought owens illness accounted for all and only promised that the doctor should inspect her  a day of exceeding occupation ensued  mervyn talked the whole way of cecily his plans and his prospects and phoebe had to draw her mind out of one world and immerse it into another straining ears and voice all the time to hear and be heard through the roar of the train  he left her at the cottage and then began the work of the day presiding over upholsterers hanging pictures arranging books settling cabinets of collections disposing of ornaments snatching meals at odd times in odder places and never daring to rest till long after dark when with fingers freshly purified from dust limbs stiff with running up and down stairs and arms tired with heavy weights she sat finally down before the drawingroom fire with her solitary cup of coffee and a book that she was far too weary to open  had she never been tired before that her heart should sink in this unaccountable way  why could she not be more glad that her sisters were coming home and dear miss fennimore  what made every one seem so dull and stupid and the comings and goings so oppressive as if everything would be hateful till christmas  why had she belied all her previous good character for method and punctuality of late and felt as if existence only began whenone person was in the room  oh can this be falling in love  there was a chiffonier with a lookingglass back just opposite to her and raising her eyes poor phoebe beheld a young lady with brow cheeks and neck perfectly glowing with crimson  you shant stand there long at any rate said she almost vindictively getting up and pushing the table with its deep cover between her and the answering witness  love  nonsense  yet i dont see why i should be ashamed  yes  he is my wise man he is the real humfrey charlecote  his is the very nature i always thought some one must still havethe exact judgment i longed to meet with  not stern like robins not sharp like mervyns nor highflying like dear miss charlecotes nor soft like bevils nor light like lucys nor clear and clever like miss fennimoresno but considerate and solid tender and truesuch as one can lean upon  i know why he has the steadfast eyes that i liked so much the first evening  and there is so much more in him than i can measure or understand  yes though i have known him but ten days i have seen much more of him than of most men in a year  and he has been so much tried and has had such a life that he may well be called a real hero in a quiet way  yes i well may like him  and i am sure he likes me said another whisper of the heart which veiled as was the lady in the mirror made phoebe put both hands over her face in a shamefaced ecstatic consciousness  nayi was the first lady he had seen the only person to speak to  no no i know it was not thati feel it was not why otherwise did he seem so sorry i was not poor  oh how nice it would be if i were  we could work for each other in his glorious new land of hope  i who love work was made for work  i dont care for this mere young lady life  and must my trumpery thousand a year stand in the way  as to birth i suppose he is as well or better born than iand oh so far superior in tone and breeding to what ours used to be he ought to know better than to think me a fine young lady and himself only an engineers assistant  but he wont  of course he will be honourable about itandand perhaps never dare to say another word till he has made his fortuneand when will that ever be  it will be right but and a very different but it was this time what am i thinking about  how can i be wishing such things when i have promised to devote myself to maria  if i could rough it gladly she could not and what a shameful thing it is of me to have run into all this long day dream and leave her out  no i know my lot  i am to live on here and take care of maria and grow to be an old maid  i shall hear about him when he comes to be a great man and know that the humfrey charlecote i dreamt about is still alive  there i wont have any more nonsense  and she opened her book but finding that humfrey randolfs remarks would come between her and the sense she decided that she was too tired to read and put herself to bed  but there the sense of wrong towards maria filled her with remorse that she had accepted her rights of seniority and let the maids place her in the prettiest room with the best bay window and most snug fireplace nor could she rest till she had pacified her selfreproach by deciding that all her own goods should move next day into the chamber that did not look at the holt firs but only at the wall of the back yard  yes said phoebe stoutly in her honest dealing with herself in her fresh untried morning senses  i do love humfrey charlecote randolf and i think he loves me  whether anything more may come of it will be ordered for me but whether it do so or not it is a blessing to have known one like him and now that i am warned and can try to get back selfcontrol i will begin to be the better for it  even if i am not quite so happy this is something more beautiful than i ever knew before i will be content  and when bertha and maria arrived brimful of importance at having come home with no escort but a man and maid and voluble with histories of sutton and wedding schemes they did not find an absent nor inattentive listener  yet the keen bertha made the remark something has come over you phoebe  you have more countenance than ever you had before  whereat phoebes colour rushed into her cheeks but she demanded the meaning of countenance and embarked bertha in a dissertation  when phoebe was gone robert found it less difficult to force lucilla to the extremity of a teteatete  young randolf was less in the house and when there more with owen than before and lucilla was necessarily sometimes to be caught alone in the drawingroom  lucy said robert the first time this occurred i have a question to ask you  wellshe turned round half defiant  a correspondent of mervyn on the spanish coast has written to ask him to find a chaplain for the place guaranteeing a handsome stipend  well said lucilla in a cold voice this time  i wished to ask whether you thought it would be acceptable to mr prendergast  i neither know nor care  i beg your pardon said robert after a pause but though i believe i learnt it sooner than i ought i was sincerely glad to hear  then unhear said lucilla pettishly  you at least ought to be glad of that  by no means returned robert gravely  i have far too great a regard for you not to be most deeply concerned at what i see is making you unhappy  may not i be unhappy if i like with my brother in this state  that is not all lucilla  then never mind  you are the only one who never pitied me and so i like you  dont spoil it now  you need not be afraid of my pitying you if you have brought on this misunderstanding by your old spirit  not a bit of it  i tell you he pitied me  i found it out in time so i set him free  thats all  and that was the offence  offence  what are you talking of  he didnt offendno but when i said i could not bring so many upon him and could not have owen teased about the thing he said he would bother me no more that i had owen and did not want him  and then he walked off  taking you at your word  just as if one might not say what one does not mean when one wants a little comforting said lucy pouting but after all it is a very good thinghe is saved a great plague for a very little time and if it were all pity so much the better  i say robin shall you be man enough to read the service over me just where we stood at poor ednas funeral  i dont think that concerns you much said robert  well the lady in madge wildfires song was gratified at the six brave gentlemen who kirkward should carry her  why should you deprive me of that satisfaction  really robin it is quite true  a little happiness might have patched me up but  the symptoms are recurring  have you seen f  yes  let me alone robin  it is the truest mercy to let me wither up with as little trouble as possible to those who dont want me  now that you know it i am glad i can talk to you and you will help me to think of what has never been enough before my eyes  robert made no answer but a hasty goodbye and was gone  lucilla gave a heavy sigh and then exclaimed halfaloud  oh the horrid little monster that i am  why cant i help it  i verily believe i shall flirt in my shroud and if i were canonized my first miracle would be like st philomenas to make my own relics presentable  wherewith she fell a laughing with a laughter that soon turned to tears and the exclamation why can i make nobody care for me but those i cant care for  i cant help disgusting all that is good and it will be well when i am dead and gone  theres only one that will shed tears good for anything and he is well quit of me  the poor little lonely thing wept again and after her many sleepless nights she fairly cried herself to sleep  she awoke with a start at some one being admitted into the room  my dear am i disturbing you  it was the wellknown voice and she sprang up  mr pendy mr pendy i was very naughty  i didnt mean it  oh will you bear with me again though i dont deserve it  she clung to him like a child wearied with its own naughtiness  i was too hasty he said i forgot how wrapped up you were in your brother and how little attention you could spare and then i thought that in him you had found all you wanted and that i was only in your way  how could you  didnt you know better than to think that people put their brothers before theirmr pendys  you seemed to wish to do so  ah but you should have known it was only for the sake of being coaxed said lucilla hanging her head on one side  you should have told me so  but how was i to know it  and she broke out into a very different kind of laughter  im sure i thought it was all magnanimity but it is of no use to die of ones own magnanimity you see  you are not going to die you are coming to this spanish place which will give you lungs of brass  spanish place  how do you know  i have not slept into tomorrow have i  that robin has not flown to wrapworth and back since three oclock  no i was only inquiring at mrs murrells  oh you silly silly person why couldnt you come here  i did not want to bother you  for shame for shame if you say that again i shall know you have not forgiven me  it is a moral against using words too strong for the occasion  so robert carried you the offer of the chaplaincy and you mean to have it  i could not help coming as he desired to see what you thought of it  i only know she said half crying yet laughing that you had better marry me out of hand before i get into any more mischief  the chaplaincy was promising  the place was on the lovely coast of andalusia  there was a small colony of english engaged in trade and the place was getting into favour with invalids  mervyns correspondent was anxious to secure the services of a good man and the society of a ladylike wife and offered to guarantee a handsome salary such as justified the curate in giving up his chance of a college living and though it was improbable that he would ever learn a word of spanish or even get so far as the pronunciation of the name of the place the advantages that the appointment offered were too great to be rejected when lucillas health needed a southern climate  oh yes yes let us go she cried  it will be a great deal better than anything at home can be  then you venture on telling owen now  oh yes  it was a mere delusion of mine that it would cost him anything  honor is all that he wants i am rather in their way than otherwise  he rests on her downpillowship and she sees hears knows nothing but him  is miss charlecote aware ofwhat has been going wrong  not she  i told her before that i should take my own time for the communication and i verily believe she has forgotten all about it  then little demure phoebe fell over head and ears in love with the backwoodsman on the spot and walked about in a dream such as ought to have been good fun to watch if i had had the spirit for it and if robert had not been sufficiently disengaged to keep his eyes open i dont know whether anything would have roused them short of breaking a bloodvessel or two  i shall never rest till you are in my keeping  i will go to fulmort at once and tell him that i accept  and i will go to owen and break the news to him  when are you coming again  tomorrow as soon as i have opened school  ah the sooner we are gone the better  much good you can be to poor wrapworth  just tell me please that i may know how badly i served you how often you have inquired at mrs murrells  whyi believeeach day except saturday and sunday but i never met him there till just now  lucillas eyes swam with tears she laid her head on his shoulder and in a broken voice of deep emotion she said indeed i did not deserve it  but i think i shall be good now for i cant tell why i should be so much loved  mr prendergast was vainly endeavouring to tell her why when humfrey randolfs ring was heard and she rushed out of the room  owens first hearty laugh since his return was at her tidings  that over he spoke with brotherly kindness  yes lucy he said i do think it is the best and happiest thing for you  he is the only man whom you could not torment to death or who would have any patience with your antics  i dont think i shall try said lucy  what are you shaking your head for owen  have i not had enough to tame me  i beg your pardon cilly  i was only thinking of the natural companionship of bears and monkeys  dont beat me  some day you shall come out and see us perform thats all said lucilla merrily  but indeed owen if i know myself at all unmerited affection and forbearance with no nonsense about it is the only way to keep me from flying out  at any rate i cant live without it  ah said owen gravely you have suffered too much through me for me to talk to you in this fashion  forgive me lucy i am not up to any other just yet  whatever lucilla might have said in the first relief of recovering mr prendergast she could not easily have made up her mind to leave her brother in his present condition and flattered herself that the at once could not possibly be speedy since mr prendergast must give notice of his intention of leaving wrapworth  but when he came the next morning it proved that things were in a far greater state of forwardness than she had thought possible  so convinced were both the curate and robert of the need of her avoiding the winter cold that the latter had suggested that one of his own curates who was in need of change and country air should immediately offer himself as a substitute at wrapworth either for a time or permanently and lucy was positively required to name a day as early as possible for the marriage and told on the authority of the physician that it might almost be called suicide to linger in the english frosts  the day which she chose was the 1st of december the same on which mervyn was to be married  there was a purpose in thus rendering it impracticable for any fulmort to be present and said owen i am glad it should be before i am about  i could never keep my countenance if i had to give her away to brother peter  keeping his countenance might have two meanings but he was too feeble for agitation and seemed only able to go through the time of preparation and parting by keeping himself as lethargic and indifferent as possible or by turning matters into a jest when necessarily brought before him playing at solitaire or trifling desultory chat was all that he could endure as occupation and the long hours were grievously heavy  his son though nearly four years old was no companion or pleasure to him  he was in his helpless and morbid state afraid of so young a child and little owen was equally afraid of him each dreaded contact with the other and more than all the being shut into a room together and the little boy half shy half assured filled by the old woman with notions of his own grandeur and yet constrained by the different atmosphere of woolstonelane was never at ease or playful enough before him to be pleasant to watch  and indeed his cockney pronunciation and ungainly vulgar tricks had been so summarily repressed by his aunt that his fear of both the ladies rendered him particularly unengaging and unchildlike nevertheless honora thought it her duty to take him home with her to the holt and gratified robert by engaging a nice little girl of fourteen whom lucilla called the crack orphan to be his attendant when they should leave town  this was to be about a fortnight after the wedding since st wulstans afforded greater opportunities for privacy and exemption from bustle than even hiltonbury and dr prendergast and his daughter could attend without being in the house  the prendergasts of southminster were very kind and friendly sending lucilla warm greetings and not appearing at all disconcerted at welcoming their former governess into the family  the elders professed no surprise but great gladness and sarah who was surprised was trebly rejoiced  owen accused his sister of selecting her solitary bridesmaid with a view to enhancing her own beauty by force of contrast but the choice was prompted by real security of the affectionate pleasure it would confer  handsome presents were sent both by the beaumonts and bostocks and lucilla even while half fretted half touched by mrs bostocks patronizing felicitations could not but be pleased at these evidences that her governessship had not been an utter failure  her demeanour in the fortnight before her marriage was unlike what her friends had ever seen and made them augur better for mr prendergasts venture  she was happy but subdued quiet and womanly gentle without being sad grave but not drooping and though she was cheerful and playful with an entire absence of those strange effervescences that had once betrayed acidity or fermentation  she had found the power of being affectionately grateful to honor and the sweetness of her tender ways towards her and owen would have made the parting all the sadder to them if it had not been evident that as she said it was happiness that thus enabled her to be good  the satisfied look of rest that had settled on her fair face made it new  all her animation and archness had not rendered it half so pleasant to look upon  the purchaser of castle blanch proved to be no other than mr calthorp lucilla at first was greatly discomfited and begged that nothing might be said about the picture but the next time mr prendergast arrived it was with a request from mr calthorp that miss sandbrook would accept the picture as a wedding gift  there was no refusing itindeed the curate had already accepted it and when lucilla heard that the calthorp had been two years married to what mr prendergast called a millionairess exceedingly hideous she still had vanity enough to reflect that the removal of her own resemblance might be an act of charity  and the sum that honor had set apart for the purchase was only too much wanted for the setting up housekeeping in spain whither the portrait was to accompany her mr prendergast declared like the penates of the pious aeneas  robert brought in his gift on the last day of november just before setting off for sutton  it was an unornamented but exquisitelybound bible and prayer book darkbrown with rededged leaves  goodbye lucilla he said you have been the brightest spot to me in this life  thank you for all you have done for me  and for all i never intended to do said lucilla smiling as she returned his pressure of the hand  he was gone not trusting her to speak nor himself to hear a word more  yes robin proceeded lucy half aloud you are the greater man i know very well but it is in human nature to prefer flesh and blood to mediaeval saints in castiron even if one knows there is a tender spot in them  there was a curious sense of humiliation in her full acquiescence in the fact that he was too high too grand for her and in her relief that the affection that would have lifted her beyond what she was prepared for had died away and left her to the more ordinary excellence and halfpaternal fondness of the man of her real choice with whom she could feel perfect ease and repose  possibly the admixture of qualities that in her had been called fast is the most contrary to all real aspiration  but there was no fault to be found with the heartfelt affection with which she loved and honoured her bridegroom lavishing on him the more marks of deference and submission just because she knew that her will would be law and that his love was strong enough to have borne with any amount of caprice or seeming neglect  the sacrifices she made without his knowledge for his convenience and comfort while he imagined hers to be solely consulted the concessions she made to his slightest wish the entire absence of all teasing would not have been granted to a younger man more prepossessing in the sight of others  it was in this spirit that she rejected all advice to consult health rather than custom in her wedding dress  exactly because mr prendergast would have willingly received her in the plainest garb she was bent on doing him honour by the most exquisite bridal array and never had she been so lovelyher colour such exquisite carnation her eyes so softened and full of such repose and reliance her grace so perfect in complete freedom from all endeavour at attracting admiration  the married pair came back from church to owens sittingroomnot bear and monkey not genie and fairy as he had expected to see but as they stood together looking so indescribably and happily one that owen smiled and said ah honor if you had only known twenty years ago that this was mrs peter prendergast how much trouble it would have saved  she did not deserve to be mrs peter prendergast said the bride  see how you deserve it now  that i never shall  brother and sister parted with light words but full hearts each trying to believe though neither crediting mr prendergasts assurance that the two owens should come and be at home for ever if they liked in santa maria de x  neither could bear to face the truth that henceforth their courses lay apart and that if the sisters life were spared it could only be at the sacrifice of expatriation for many years in lands where well or ill the brother had no call  nor would lucilla break down  it was due to her husband not to let him think she suffered too much in resigning home for him and true to her innate hatred of agitation she guarded herself from realizing anything and though perfectly kind and respectful to honora studiously averted all approaches to effusion of feeling  only at the last kiss in the hall she hung round her friend with a vehement embrace and whispered forgive  you have forgiven  forgive me lucilla  nay that i have forgiven you for all your pardon and patience is shown by my enduring to leave owen to you now  therewith surged up such a flood of passionate emotions that fleeing from them as it were the bride tore herself out of honors arms and sprang hastily into the carriage nervously and hastily moving about its contents while mr prendergast finished his farewells  after all there was a certain sense of rest snugness and freedom from turmoil when honor dried her eyes and went back to her convalescent the house seemed peaceful and they both felt themselves entering into the full enjoyment of being all in all to one another  there was one guest at the sutton wedding whose spirit was at st wulstans  in those set eyes and tightlyclosed lips might be traced abstraction in spite of himself  were there not thoughts and prayers for another bride elsewhere kneeling  was not the solitary man struggling with the last remnants of fancies at war with his life of selfdevotion and crushing down the few final regrets that would have looked back to the dreams of his youth  no marvel that his greatest effort was against being harsh and unsympathizing even while his whole career was an endeavour to work through charities of deed and word into charities of thought and judgment    chapter xxx       untouched by love the maidens breast     is like the snow on ronas crest     high seated in the middle sky     in bright and barren purity     but by the sunbeam gently kissed     scarce by the gazing eye tis missed     ere down the lonely valley stealing     fresh grass and growth its course revealing     it cheers the flock revives the flower     and decks some happy shepherds bowerscott  slow to choose but decided in her choice phoebe had always been and her love formed no exception to this rule  she was quite aware that her heart had been given away and never concealed it from herself though she made it a principle not to indulge in future castle buildings and kept a resolute guard over her attention  it was impossible to obviate a perpetual feeling of restlessness and of tedium in whatever she was about but she conquered oftener than she gave way and there was an indescribable sense of peace and sweetness in a new and precious possession and an undefined hope through all  miss fennimore who came the day after the girls return from sutton saw only the fuller development of her favourite pupil and in truth maria and bertha had so ineffably much to narrate that her attention would have been sufficiently engrossed to hinder her observation of the symptoms even had the good lady been as keen and experienced in love as in science  poor little phoebe equable as she was she was in a great perturbation when four days before christmas she knew that miss charlecote with owen sandbrook and humfrey randolf had arrived at the holt  what was so natural as for her to go at once to talk over the two weddings with her dear old friend  yes but did her dear old friend want her when these two young men had put an end to her solitude  was she only making miss charlecote an excuse  she would wait in hopes that one of the others would ask if she were going to the holt  if so it could not but be natural and properif not  this provoking throbbing of her heart showed that it was not only for honor charlecote that she wished to go  that ring at the bell  what an abominable goose she was to find a flush of expectation in her cheek  and after all it was only sir john  he had found that his son had heard nothing from the holt that morning and had come in to ask if she thought a call would be acceptable  i knew they were come home he said for i saw them at the station yesterday  i did not show myself for i did not know how poor young sandbrook might like it  but who have they got with them  mr randolf owen sandbrooks canadian friend  did i not hear he was some sort of relation  yes his mother was a charlecote  ha that accounts for it  seeing him with her i could almost have thought it was thirty years ago and that it was my dear old friend  phoebe could have embraced sir john  she could not conceal her glow of delight so completely that bertha did not laugh and say mr charlecote is what the germans would call phoebes bild  she always blushes and looks conscious if he is mentioned  sir john laughed but with some emotion and phoebe hastily turned her still more blushing face away  certainly if phoebe had had any prevision of her present state of mind she never would have bought that chiffonier  when sir john had sufficiently admired the details of the choice little drawingroom and had been shown by the eager sisters all over the house he asked if phoebe would walk up with him to the holt  he had hoped his eldest son who had ridden over with him would have come in and gone up with them but he supposed charlie had seized on him  poor sir john his attempt at matchmaking did not flourish  however he had secured phoebes most intense gratitude by his proposal and down she came a very pretty picture in her dark brown dress scarlet cloak and round brown felt hat with the long curly brown feather tipped with scarlet her favourite winter robin colouring  her cheeks were brilliant and her eyes not only brighter but with a slight drooping that gave them the shadiness they sometimes wanted  and it was all from a ridiculous trepidation which made it wellnigh impossible to bring out what she was longing to sayso you think mr randolf like mr charlecote  fortunately he was beforehand with her for both the likeness and the path through the pine woods reminded him strongly of his old friend and he returned to the subject  so you are a great admirer of dear old charlecote phoebe you cant remember him  no but robert does and i sometimes think i do  then it came  you think mr randolf like him  thanks to her hat she could blush more comfortably now  i did not see him near  it was only something in air and figure people inherit those things wonderfully  now my son charlie sits on horseback exactly like his grandfather whom he never saw and john  oh was he going to run away on family likenesses  phoebe would not hear the and john and observed mr charlecote was his godfather was he not  which selfevident fact brought him back again to yes and i only wish he had seen more of him  these are his plantations i declare that he used to make so much of  yes that is the reason miss charlecote is so fond of them  miss charlecote  when i think of him i have no patience with her  i do believe he kept single all his life for her sake and why she never would have him i never could guess  you ladies are very unreasonable sometimes phoebe  phoebe tried to express a rational amount of wonder at poor honors taste but grew incoherent in fear lest it should be irrational and was rather frightened at finding sir john looking at her with some amusement but he was only thinking of how willingly the poor little heiress of the mervyns had once been thrown at humfrey charlecotes head  but he went on to tell her of all that her hero had ever been to him and to the county and of the blank his death had left and never since supplied till she felt more and more what a wise man truly was  no one was in the drawingroom but honor came down much more cheerful and lively than she had been for years and calling owen materially betterthe doctors thought the injury to the head infinitely mitigated and the first step to recovery fairly takenthere were good accounts of the prendergasts and all things seemed to be looking well  presently sir john to phoebes great satisfaction spoke of her guest and his resemblance but honor answered with halfresentful surprise  some of the old servants had made the same remark but she could not understand it and was evidently hurt by its recurrence  phoebe sat on listening to the account of lucillas letters and the good spirits and health they manifested forcing herself not too obviously to watch door or window and when sir john was gone she only offered to depart lest miss charlecote should wish to be with owen  no my dear thank you mr randolf is with him and he can read a little now  we are getting above the solitaire board i assure you  i have fitted up the little room beyond the study for his bedroom and he sits in the study so there are no stairs and he is to go out every day in a chair or the carriage  does the little boy amuse him  no not exactly poor little fellow  they are terribly afraid of each other that is the worst of it  and then we left the boy too long with the old woman  i hear his lessons for a quarter of an hour a day and he is a clever child enough but his pronunciation and habits are an absolute distress and he is not happy anywhere but in the housekeepers room  i try to civilize him but as yet i cannot worry poor owen  you cant think how comfortable we are together phoebe when we are alone since his sister went we have got on so much better  he was shy before her but i must tell you my dear he asked me to read my psalms and lessons aloud as i used to do and we have had such pleasant evenings and he desired that the servants might still come in to prayers in the study  but then he always was different with me  and phoebe while assenting could not silence a misgiving that she thought very cruel  she would believe owen sincere if humfrey randolf did  honor however was very happy and presently begged her to come and see owen  she obeyed with alacrity and was conducted to the study no randolf was there only pen ink paper and algebra  but as she was greeting owen who looked much better and less oppressed honor made an exclamation and from the window they saw the young man leaning over the sundial partly studying its mysteries partly playing with little owen who hung on him as an old playmate  yes said owen he has taken pity on the boyhe is very good to himhas served an apprenticeship  mr randolf looked up saw phoebe gave a start of recognition and pleasure and sped towards the house  yes phoebe i do see some likeness said honor as though a good deal struck and touched  all the ridiculous and troublesome confusion was so good as to be driven away in the contentment of humfrey randolfs presence and the wondrous magnetic conviction that he was equally glad to be with her  she lost all restlessness and was quite ready to amuse owen by a lively discussion and comparison of the two weddings but she so well knew that she should like to stay too long that she cut her time rather over short and would not stay to luncheon  this was not like the evenings that began with hiawatha and ended at lakeville or on lake ontario but one pleasure was in store for phoebe  while she was finding her umbrella and putting on her clogs humfrey randolf ran downstairs to her and said i wanted to tell you something  my stepmother is going to be married  you are glad  very glad  it is to a merchant whom she met at buffalo well off and speaking most kindly of the little boys  that must be a great load off your mind  indeed it is though the children must still chiefly look to me  i should like to have little george at a good school  however now their immediate maintenance is off my hands i have more to spend in educating myself  i can get evening lessons now when my days work is over  oh do not overstrain your head said phoebe thinking of bertha  heads can bear a good deal when they are full of hope he said smiling  still after your outofdoors life of bodily exercise do you not find it hard to be always shut up in london  perhaps the novelty has not worn off  it is as if life had only begun since i came into the city  a new set of faculties called into play  facultiesyes and everything else  i must go now or my sisters will be waiting for me and i see your dinner coming in  goodbye  may i come to see you  o yes pray let me show you our cottage  when may i come  tomorrow i suppose  she felt rather than saw him watching her all the way from the gardengate to the wood  that little colloquy was the sunshiny point in her day  had the tidings been communicated in the full circle it would have been as nothing compared with their reservation for her private ear with the marked i wanted to tell you  then she came home looked at maria threading hollyberries and her heart fainted within her  there were moments when poor maria would rise before her as a hardship and an infliction and then she became terrified prayed against such feelings as a crime and devoted herself to her sister with even more than her wonted patient tenderness  the certainty that the visit would take place kept her from all flutterings and selfdebate and in due time mr randolf arrived anxiously did phoebe watch for his look at maria for berthas look at him and she was pleased with both  his manner to maria was full of gentleness and berthas quick eyes detected his intellect  he stood an excellent examination from her and miss fennimore upon the worn channel of niagara which had so often been used as a knockdown argument against miss charlecotes cosmogony and his bright terse powers of description gave them as they agreed a better idea of his woods than any travels which they had read  it was no less interesting to observe his impression of the english villagelife at hiltonbury  to him the aspect of the country had an air of exquisite miniature finish wanting indeed in breadth and freedom but he had suffered too much from vain struggling singlehanded with nature in her might not to value the bounds set upon her and a man who knew by personal experience what it was to seek his whole live stock in an interminable forest did not complain of the confinement of hedges and banks  nay the hedgerow elms and hillocks green were to him as classical as whitehall he treated marias tame robins with as much respect as if they had been howards or percies holly and mistletoe were handled by him with reverential curiosity and the church and home of his ancestors filled him with a sweet loyal enthusiasm more eager than in those to whom these things were familiar  miss charlecote herself came in for some of these feelings  he admired her greatly in her christmas aspect of lady bountiful in which she well fulfilled old visions of the mistress of an english home but still more did he dwell upon her gentleness and on that shadowy resemblance to his mother which made him long for some of that tenderness which she lavished upon owen  he looked for no more than her uniformly kind civility and hospitality but he was always wishing to know her better and any touch of warmth and affection in her manner towards him was so delightful that he could not help telling phoebe of it in their next brief teteatete  he was able to render a great service to miss charlecote  mr brookss understanding had not cleared with time and the accounts that had been tangled in summer were by the end of the year in confusion worse confounded  he was a faithful servant but his accounts had always been audited every month and in his old age his arithmetic would not carry him farther so that his mistresss long absence abroad had occasioned such a hopeless chaos that but for his long services his honesty might have been in question  honora put this idea away with angry horror  not only did she love and trust the old man but he was a legacy from humfrey and she would have torn the page from her receipts rather than rouse the least suspicion against him  yet she could not bear to leave any flaw in humfreys farm books and she toiled and perplexed herself in vain till owen finding out what distressed her and grieving at his own incapacity begged that randolf might help her when behold the confused accounts arranged themselves in comprehensible columns and poor old brooks was proved to have cheated himself so much more than his lady as to be entirely exonerated from all but puzzleheadedness  the young mans farmer life qualified him to be highly popular at the holt  he was curious about english husbandry talked to the labourers and tried their tools with no unpractised hand even the flail which honors hatred of steam still kept as the winters employment in the barn he appreciated the bullocks criticized the sheep and admired the pigs till the farming men agreed there had not been such an one about the place since the squire himself  honora might be excused for not having detected a likeness between the two humfreys  scarcely a feature was in the same mould the complexion was different and the heavilybuilt easygoing squire somewhat behind his own century had apparently had nothing in common with the brisk modern colonial engineer yet still there was something curiously recalling the expression of open honesty and the whole cast of countenance as well as the individuality of voice air and gestures and the perception grew upon her so much in the haunts of her cousin where she saw his attitudes and habits unconsciously repeated that she was almost ready to accept berthas explanation that it was owing to the influence of the christian name that both shared  but as it had likewise been borne by the wicked disinherited son who ran away the theory was somewhat halting  phoebes intercourse with humfrey the younger was much more fragmentary than in town and therefore perhaps the more delicious  she saw him on most of the days of his fortnights stay either in the mutual calls of the two houses in chance meetings in the village or in walks to or from the holyday services at the church and these afforded many a moment in which she was let into the deeper feelings that his first english christmas excited  it was not conventional christmas weather but warm and moist thus rendering the contrast still stronger with the sleighing of his prosperous days the snowshoe walk of his poorer ones  a frost hard enough for skating was the prime desire of maria and bertha who both wanted to see the art practised by one to whom it was familiar  the frost came at last and became reasonably hard in the first week of the new year one day when phoebe to her regret was forced to drive to elverslope to fulfil some commissions for mervyn and cecily who were expected at home on the 8th of january after a christmas at sutton  however she had a reward  i do think said miss fennimore to her as she entered the drawingroom that mr randolf is the most goodnatured man in the world  for full threequarters of an hour this afternoon did he hand maria up and down a slide on the pond at the holt  you went up to see him skate  yes he was to teach bertha  we found him helping the little sandbrook to slide but when we came he sent him in with the little maid and gave bertha a lesson which did not last long for she grew nervous  really her nerves will never be what they were  then maria begged for a slide and you know what any sort of monotonous bodily motion is to her there is no getting her to leave off and i never saw anything like the spirit and goodnature with which he complied  he is very kind to maria said phoebe  he seems to have that sort of pitying respect which you first put into my mind towards her  oh are you come home phoebe said maria running into the room  i did not hear you  i have been sliding on the ice all the afternoon with mr randolf  it is so nice and he says we will do it again tomorrow  ha phoebe said bertha meeting her on the stairs do you know what you missed  three children sliding on the ice quoted phoebe  seeing how a man that is called humfrey can bear with your two sisters making themselves ridiculous  really i should set the backwoods down as the best school of courtesy but that i believe some people have that school within themselves  hollo  for phoebe absolutely kissed bertha as she went upstairs  ha said bertha interrogatively then went into the drawingroom and looked very grave almost sad  phoebe could not but think it rather hard when on the last afternoon of humfrey randolfs visit there came a note from mervyn ordering her up to beauchamp to arrange some special contrivances of his for cecilys morningroomher mothers which gave it an additional pang  it was a severe threatening bitterly cold day not at all fit for sliding even had not both the young ladies and miss fennimore picked up a suspicion of cold but phoebe had no doubt that there would be a farewell visit and did not like to lose it  take the pony carriage and you will get home faster said bertha answering what was unspoken  no the groom sent in word that the ponies were gone to be roughshod and that one of them had a cold  never mind said phoebe cheerfully i shall be warmer walking  and she set off with a lingering will but a step brisk under her determination that her personal wishes should never make her neglect duty or kindness  she did not like to think that he would be disappointed but she had a great trust in his trust in herself and a confidence not to be fretted away that some farewell would come to pass and that she should know when to look for him again  scanty sleety flakes of snow were falling before her halfhours walk was over and she arrived at the house where anxious maids were putting their last touches of preparation for the mistress  it was strange not to feel more strongly the pang of a lost home and had not phoebe been so much preoccupied perhaps it would have affected her strongly with all her real joy at cecilys installation but there were new things before her that filled her mind too full for regrets for the rooms where she had grown up  she only did her duty scrupulously by cecilys writingtable piano and pictures and then satisfied the housekeeper by a brief inspection of the rooms more laudatory than particular  she rather pitied cecily after her comfortable parsonage for coming to all those state drawingrooms  if it had been the west wing now  by this time the snow was thicker and the park beginning to whiten  the housekeeper begged her to wait and order out the carriage but she disliked giving trouble and thought that an unexpected summons might be tardy of fulfilment so she insisted on confronting the elements confident in her cloak and indiarubber boots and secretly hoping that the visitor at the cottage might linger on into the twilight  as she came beyond the pillars of the portico such a whirl of snow met her that she almost questioned the prudence of her decision when a voice said it is only the drift round the corner of the house  you here  your sister gave me leave to come and see you home through the snowstorm  oh thank you  this is the first time you have been here she added feeling as if her first words had been too eagerly glad  yes i have only seen the house from a distance before  i did not know how large it was  which part did you inhabit  therethe west wingshut up now poor thing  and where was the window where you saw the horse and cart  yes you see i know that story which was your window  the nearest to the main body of the house  ah it is a dear old window i have seen many better things from it than that  what kind of things  sunsets and moonsets and the holt firs best of all  yes i know better now what you meant by owing all to miss charlecote he said smiling  i owe something to her too  oh is she going to help you on cried phoebe  no i do not need that  what i owe to her isknowing you  it had come then  the first moment of full assurance of what had gleamed before and yet the shock sweet as it was was almost pain and phoebes heart beat fast and her downcast look betrayed that the full force of his wordsand still more of his tonehad reached her  may i go on he said  may i dare to tell you what you are to me  i knew from the moment we met that you were what i had dreamt ofdifferent but better  i am sure i knew that you were escaped from phoebe softly but making her face burn as at what she had not meant to say  then you can bear with me  you do not forbid me to hope  oh i am a great deal too happy  there came a great wailing driving gust of storm at that moment as if it wanted to sweep them off their feet but it was a welcome blast for it was the occasion of a strong arm being flung round phoebe to restrain that fluttering cloak  storms shall only blow us nearer together dearest he said with recovered breath as with no unwilling hand she clung to his arm for help  if it be gods will said phoebe earnestly  and indeed he said fervently i have thought and debated much whether it were his will whether it could be right that i with my poverty and my burthens should thrust myself into your wealthy and sheltered life  at first when i thought you were a poor dependent i admitted the hope  i saw you spirited helpful sensible and i dared to think that you were of the stuff that would gladly be independent and would struggle on and up with me as i have known so many do in my own country  oh would i not  then i found how far apart we stand in one kind of social scale and perhaps that ought to have overthrown all hope but phoebe it will not do so  i will not ask you to share want and privation but i will and do ask you to be the point towards which i may work the best earthly hope set before me  i am glad said phoebe that you knew too well to think there was any real difference  indeed the superiority is all yours except in mere money  and mine i am sure need not stand in the way but there is one thing that does  what  your brothers  i do not know  it is my sister maria  i promised long ago that nothing should make me desert her and with a voice faltering a little but endeavouring to be firm a promise to fulfil a duty appointed by providence must not he repented of when the cost is felt  but why should you think of deserting her he said  surely i may help to bear your cares and there is something so good so gentle and lovable about her that she need be no grievance  i shall have to bring my little brothers about you too so we shall be even he added smiling  then she said looking in his face as beginning to take counsel with him you think it is right to assume a new tie that must have higher claims than the prior one that heaven sent me  nay dearest is not the new one instituted by heaven  if i promise that i will be as entirely marias brother as you are her sister and will reverence her affliction or more truly her innocence in the same way will you not trust her as well as yourself with me  trust oh indeed i do and am thankful  but i am thinking of you poor dear maria might be a drag where i should not  and i cannot leave her to any of the others  she could not be long without me  well faithless one we may have to wait the longer though i feel that you alone would be happiest fighting up the hill with me  oh thank you for knowing that so well  but as we both have these ties and as besides i should be a shabby adventurer to address you but on equal terms we must be content to wait tillas with gods blessing i trust to doi have made a home smooth enough for maria as well as for you  will that do phoebe  somehow it seems too much murmured phoebe and yet i knew it of you  and as you both have means of your own it may bring the time nearer he said  there you see i can calculate on your fortune though i still wish it were out of the way  if it were not for maria i should  and now with this hope and promise i feel as if even if it were seven years they would be like so many days said humfrey  you will not be of those my phoebe who suffer and are worn by a long engagement  one cannot tell without a trial said phoebe but indeed i do not see why security and rest or even hope deferred should hurt me  surely having a right to think about you cannot do so  and her look out of those honest clear gray eyes was one of the most perfect reliance and gladness  may i be worthy of those thoughts he fervently said  and you will write to meeven when i go back to the ottawa  i shall be so glad to tell you everything and have your letters  oh no with them i am not going to pineand her strong young nature laughed at the folly  and while god gives me strength we will not be afraid he answered phoebe i looked at the last chapter of proverbs last night and thought you were like that woman of strength and skill on whose lips is the law of kindness  and you are not afraid of the snow as if to complete the likeness  i did not quite know it was snowing  i like it for it suits your country  i like it because you are as clear firm and pure as my own clear crystal ice he said only not quite so cold  and now what remains must your brothers be consulted he added reluctantly  it will be right that i should tell them said phoebe  from robert i could not keep such a thing and mervyn has a right to know  i cannot tell how he may take it but i do not think that i owe him such implicit obedience as if he were my father  and by the time you really ask for me you know you are to be such a rising engineer that they are all to be almost as proud of you as i am  god helping me he gravely answered his eyes raised upwards and as it were carrying with them the glance that had sought them in almost playful confidence  and thus they looked forth upon this life  neither was so young as not to be aware of its trials  she knew the sorrows of suspense bereavement and family disunion and he before his twentyfourth year had made experience of adversity uncongeniality disappointment and severealmost hopelesseveryday labour  it was not in the spirit of those who had not braced on their armour but of those who had made proof of it that they looked bravely and cheerfully upon the battle feeling their strength doubled as faithful companionsinarms and willing in that strength and trust to bear patiently with the severest trial of allthe delay of their hopes  the cold but bracing wind the snow driving and whirling round them in gusts could not daunt nor quench their spiritsnay rather gave them additional vigour and enjoyment while even the tokens of the tempest that they bore away were of perfect dazzling whiteness  never was shelter less willingly attained than when the park wicket of the underwood was reached just as the early twilight was becoming darkness  it was like a foretaste for phoebe of seeing him go his own way in the storm while she waited safely housed but they parted with grave sweet smiles and a promise that he would snatch a moments farewell on the morrow  phoebe would rather not have been met by bertha at the front door in some solicitudeyou are come at last  are you wet are you cold  oh no thank you  dont stand in the draught said phoebe anxious to shake her off but it was not to be done  bertha preceded her upstairs talking all the way in something of her old mischievous whisper  am i in disgrace with you too phoebe  miss fennimore says i have committed an awful breach of propriety but really i could not leave you to the beating of the pitiless storm alone  i am afraid maltas sagacity and little paws would hardly have sufficed to dig you out of a snowdrift before life was extinct  are you greatly displeased with me phoebe and being by this time in the bedroom she faced about shut the door and looked full at her sister  nonodear bertha not displeased in the least only if you would go  now phoebe indeed that is not kind of you said bertha pleadingly but preparing to obey  no bertha it is not said phoebe recovering herself in a moment  i am sorry for it but oh dont you know the feeling of wanting to have ones treasure all to oneself for a little moment before showing it  no dont go and the two sisters flung their arms round one another  you shall hear now  no no said bertha kissing her my time for obtrusive childish curiosity is over  i only was so anxious and she looked up with tearful eyes and almost the air of an elder sister  phoebe might well requite the look with fullhearted tenderness and caresses as she said calmly yes bertha i am very happy  you ought to be said bertha seriously  yes said phoebe taking the ought in a different sense from what she meant he is all and more than i ever thought a man wise in true wisdom should be  and a man of progress full of the dignity of labour said bertha  i am glad he is not an old bit of county soil like john raymond  my dear phoebe sir john will tear his hair  for shame bertha  well i will not tease you with my nonsense but you know it is the only thing that keeps tears out of ones eyes  i see you want to be alone dear phoebe and she clung to her neck for a moment  an instant more bertha  you see everything i know but has miss fennimore guessed  no my dear i do not think any such syllogism has ever occurred to her as lovers look conscious phoebe looks conscious therefore phoebe is in love  it is defective in the major you see so it could not enter her brain  then bertha do not let any one guess it  i shall speak to mervyn tomorrow and write to robin  it is their due but no one else must know itno not for a long timeyears perhaps  you do not mean to wait for years  we must  then whats the use of having thirty thousand pounds  no bertha it would not be like him to be content with owing all to my fortune and beginning life in idleness  it would be just enough to live on with none of the duties of property and that would never do  i could not wish it for him and he has his brothers to provide for  well let him work for them and have your money to make capital really phoebe i would not lose such a chance of going out and seeing those glorious lakes  i have maria to consider  maria  and why are you to be saddled with maria  because i promised my motheri promised myselfi promised mervyn that she should be my care  i have told him of that promise and he accepts it most kindly  you cannot leave her to me  oh phoebe do you still think me as hateful as i used to be  dear dear bertha i have full trust in your affection for her but i undertook the charge and i cannot thrust it on to another who might  dont say that phoebe cried bertha impetuously i am the one to have her  i who certainly never can never shall marryi who am good for nothing but to look after her  say you do not think me unworthy of her phoebe  i say no such thing said phoebe affectionately but there is no use in discussing the matter  dear bertha leave me and compose yourself  truly during that evening bertha was the agitated one her speech much affected and her gestures restless while phoebe sat over her work her needle going swiftly and evenly and her eyes beaming with her quiet depth of thankful bliss  in the morning again it was bertha who betrayed an uneasy restlessness and irrepressible desire to banish miss fennimore and maria from the drawingroom till the governess in perplexity began to think of consulting phoebe whether a jack hastings affair could be coming over again  phoebe simply trusted to the promise and went about her mornings avocations with a heart at rest and when at last humfrey randolf did hurry in for a few moments before he must rush back to the holt her greeting was so full of reliance and composure that miss fennimore perceived nothing  bertha however rested not  as well as she could under a fearful access of stammering she insisted that mr randolf should come into the diningroom to look at aaaaa  ah well thought miss fennimore phoebe is gone too so she will keep guard  if miss fennimore could have looked through the door she would have seen the astonished maria pounced upon as if in sport pulled upstairs and desired by bertha to find her book of dried flowers to show mr randolf naughty bertha who really did not believe the dried flowers had ever been brought home from woolstonelane  it served the manoeuvrer right that maria after one look at the shelves began to cry out for phoebe to come and find them  but it signified the less since the lovers had not left the hall and had exchanged all the words that there was time for before bertha at the sound of the reopening door flew down to put her hand into humfreys and grasp it tightly looking in his face instead of speaking  thank you he said returning the pressure and was gone we improve as we go on  number three is the best of my brothersinlaw phoebe said bertha lightly  then leaving phoebe to pacify maria about the flowers she went into her own room and cried bitterly and overpoweringly    chapter xxxi       thekla  i should love thee           whateer thou hadst chosen thou wouldst still have acted           nobly and worthy of thee but repentance           shall neer disturb thy souls fair peace      max     then i must leave thee must part from thee      thekla                     being faithful     to thine own self thou art faithful too to mewallenstein  phoebe and maria went alone to the park to receive the bridal pair for poor bertha was so nervous and unhinged as not even to wish to leave the fireside  it was plain that she must not be deprived of an elder sisters care and that it would be unlikely that she would ever have nerve enough to undertake the charge of maria even if phoebe could think of shifting the responsibility or if a feeble intellect could be expected to yield the same deference to a younger sister as came naturally to an elder one  thus phoebes heart was somewhat heavy as she braced herself for her communication to mervyn doubtful as to the extent of his probable displeasure but for that very cause resolved on dealing openly from the first while satisfied that at her age his right was rather to deference than to surrender of judgment  maria roamed through the house exclaiming at the alterations and phoebe sat still in the concentrated resolute stillness that was her form of suspense  they came  the peals of the hiltonbury bells rung merrily in the cold air the snow sparkled bridally the icicles glittered in the sunset light the workpeople stood round the house to cheer the arrival and the sisters hurried out  it was no more the pale patient face  the cheeks were rounded the brown eyes smiled the haggard air that even as a bride cecily had worn was entirely gone and mervyn watched exultingly phoebes surprise at what he had made of the wan worn girl they had met at hyeres  the only disappointment was berthas absence and there was much regret that the newcomers had not heard of her cold so as to have seen her at the underwood on their way  they had spent the previous day in town in going over the distillery by cecilys particular wish and had afterwards assisted at a grand impromptu entertainment of all the workpeople at their own expense and roberts trouble  mervyn did certainly seem carried out of his own knowledge of himself and his wife had transgressed every precedent left by his mother who had never beheld whittingtonia in her life  phoebe found their eager talk so mazy and indistinct to her perception that she became resolved to speak and clear her mind at the first opportunity so she tarried behind when cecily went up under marias delighted guidance to take off her bonnet and accosted mervyn with the ominous words i want to speak to you  make haste then there is cecily left to maria  i wanted to tell you that i am engaged  the deuce you are  to mr randolf miss charlecotes canadian cousin  mervyn who had expected no less than john raymond whirled round in indignant surprise and looked incredulously at her but was confronted by her two open unabashed eyes as she stood firm on both her feet and continued i have been thrown a good deal with him so as to learn his goodness and superiority  i know you will think it a very bad match for he has nothing but his hands and head but we mean to wait till he can offer what are considered as equal terms  we thought it right you should know  upon my word thats a clever fellow  phoebe knew very well that this was ironical but would not so reply he has abilities she said and we are ready to wait till he has made proof of them  well what now he cried in despair  i did think you the sensible one of the lot  when you know him she said with her fearless smile you will own that i was sensible there  really the child looks so complacent that she would outface me that this mad notion was a fine thing  i declare it is worse than berthas business and you so much older  at least hastings was a man of family and this is a yankee adventurer picked out of the back of a ditch by that young dog sandbrook  only a yankee could have had the impudence  i declare you are laughing all the time  what have you to say for yourself  his father was major in the th dragoons and was one of the randolfs of  shire  his mother was a charlecote  his birth is as good as our own and you saw that he is a gentleman  his character and talents have gained his present situation and it is a profession that gives every opening for ability nor does he ask for me till his fortune is made  but hinders you from doing better  pray what would augusta say to you he added jocosely for even while lashing himself up his tone had been placable  he shall satisfy her  how long has this been going on  we only spoke of it yesterday  bertha found it out but i wish no one else to know it except robert  somehow she looks so cool and she is so entirely the last girl i expected to go crazy that i cant laugh at the thing as i ought  i say whats this about miss charlecote will she do anything for him  i believe not  and pray who vouches for his antecedents such as they are  mr currie and owen sandbrook both know the whole  is sandbrook at the holt  yes answered phoebe suppressing her strong distaste against bringing him into the affair  well i shall make inquiries andandit is a horrid unlucky business and the old girl should be scarified for putting you in his way  the end will be that youll marry on your own means and be pinched for life now look here you are no fool at the bottom you will give it up if i find that he is no go  if it be proved that i ought said phoebe  and if you find him what i have told you you will make no opposition  thank you mervyn  stay said he laughing and letting her kiss him i have made no promises mind  the confidence that phoebe had earned had stood her in good stead mervyn had great trust in her judgment and was too happy besides for severity on other peoples love  nor were her perfect openness and fearless though modest independence without effect  she was not one who invited tyranny but truly queen oer herself she ruled herself too well to leave the reins loose for others to seize  the result of the interview had surpassed her hopes and she had nothing to regret but her brothers implied purpose of consulting owen sandbrook friend of humfrey though he were she could not feel secure of his generosity and wished the engineer had been the nearer referee but she did not say so as much for shame at her own uncharitableness as for fear of rousing mervyns distrust and she was afraid that her injunctions to secrecy would be disregarded  fully aware that all would be in common between the husband and wife she was still taken by surprise when cecily coming early next day to the underwood to see bertha took her aside to say dearest i hope this is all right and for your happiness  you will soon know that it is said phoebe brightly  only my dear it must not be a long engagement  ah you think that nothing now but i could not bear to think that you were to go through a long attachment  was this forgiving cecily really fancying that her sorrows had been nothing worse than those incidental to a long attachment  ah thought phoebe if she could ever have felt the full reliance on which i can venture she need never have drooped  what is time to trust  mervyn kept his word and waiving ceremony took his wife at once to the holt and leaving her with miss charlecote made a visit to owen in the study wishing in the first place to satisfy himself of the young mans competence to reply to his questions  on this he had no doubt owen had made steady progress ever since he had been in england and especially during the quiet time that had succeeded his sisters marriage  his mental powers had fully regained their keenness and balance and though still incapable of sustained exertion of his faculties he could talk as well as ever and the first ten minutes convinced mervyn that he was conversing with a shrewd sensible observer who had seen a good deal of life and of the world  he then led to the question about young randolf endeavouring so to frame it as not to betray the occasion of it  the reply fully confirmed all that phoebe had averred  the single efforts of a mere youth not eighteen at the time of his fathers failure without capital and set down in a wild uncleared part of the bush had of course been inadequate to retrieve the ruined fortunes of the family but he had shown wonderful spirit patience and perseverance and the duteous temper in which he had borne the sacrifice of his prospects by his fathers foolish speculations and unsuitable marriage his affectionate treatment of the wife and children when left on his hands and his cheerful endurance of the severest and most hopeless drudgery for the bare support of life had all been such as to inspire the utmost confidence in his character  of his future prospects owen spoke with a sigh almost of envy  his talent and industry had already made him a valuable assistant to mr currie and an able engineer had an almost certain career of prosperity open to him  lastly mervyn asked what was the connection with miss charlecote and what possibilities it held out  owen winced for a moment then explained the second cousinship adding however that there was no entail that the disposal of miss charlecotes property was entirely in her own power and that she had manifested no intention of treating the young man with more than ordinary civility in fact that she had rather shrunk from acknowledging his likeness to the family  his fathers english relatives had in like manner owned him as a kinsman but had shown no alacrity in making friends with him  the only way to be noticed as the two gentlemen agreed when glad to close their conference in a laugh is to need no notice  uncommon hard on a fellow soliloquized owen when left alone  is it not enough to have ones throat cut but must one do it with ones own hands  it is a fine thing to be magnanimous when one thinks one is going off the stage but quite another thing when one is to remain there  im no twelfth century saint only a nineteenth century beggar with an unlucky child on my hands  am i to give away girl land and all to the fellow i raked out of his swamps  better have let him grill and saved my limbs  and pray what more am i to do  ive introduced him made no secret of his parentage puffed him off and brought him here and pretty good care he takes of himself  am i to pester poor honey if she does prefer the child she bred up to a stranger  no no ive done my part let him look out for himself  mervyn allowed to phoebe that randolf was no impostor but warned her against assuming his consent  she suspected that owen at least guessed the cause of these inquiries and it kept her aloof from the holt  when miss charlecote spoke of poor owens want of spirits discretion told her that she was not the person to enliven him and the consciousness of her secret made her less desirous of confidences with her kind old friend so that her good offices chiefly consisted in having little owen to the underwood to play with maria who delighted in his society and unconsciously did much for his improvement  honor herself perceived that phoebes visits only saddened her convalescent and that in his present state he was happiest with no one but her who was more than ever a mother to him  they were perfectly at ease together as she amused him with the familiar books which did not strain his powers like new ones the quiet household talk the little playful exchanges of tender wit and the fresh arrangement of all her museum on the natural system he having all the entertainment and she all the trouble till her conversion astonished bertha  the old religious habits of the holt likewise seemed to soothe and give him pleasure but whether by force of old association or from their hold on his heart was as yet unknown to honora and perhaps to himself  it was as if he were deferring all demonstration till he should be able again to examine the subject with concentrated attention  or it might be that while he shrank from exerting himself upon randolfs behalf he was not ready for repentance and therefore distrusted and hung back from the impulses that would otherwise have drawn him to renew all that he had once cast aside  he was never left alone without becoming deeply melancholy yet no companionship save honors seemed to suit him for many minutes together  his brain was fast recovering the injury but it was a trying convalescence and with returning health his perfect helplessness fretted him under all the difficulties of so tall and heavy a man being carried from bed to sofa from sofa to carriage  poor owen said phoebe to herself one day when she had not been able to avoid witnessing this pitiable spectacle of infirmity i cant think why i am always fancying he is doing humfrey and me some injustice and that he knows it  he who brought humfrey home and has praised him to mervyn  it is very uncharitable of me but why will he look at me as if he were asking my pardon  well we shall see the result of mervyns inspection  mervyn and his wife were going for two nights to the rooms at the office in the first lull of the bridal invitations which were infinitely more awful to cecily than to phoebe  after twentynine years of quiet clerical life cecily neither understood nor liked the gaieties even of the county had very little to say and unless her aunt were present made phoebe into a protector and retired behind her till phoebe sometimes feared that mervyn would be quite provoked and remember his old dread lest cecily should be too homely and bashful for her position poor dear cecily  she was as good and kind as possible but in the present close intercourse it sometimes would suggest to phoebe was she quite as wise as she was good  and miss fennimore with still clearer eyes inwardly decided that though religion should above all form the morals yet the morality of common sense and judgment should be cultivated with an equal growth  cecily returned from london radiant with sisterly congratulation in a flutter of delight with mr randolf and intimating a glorious project in the background devised between herself and mervyn then guarding against possible disappointment by declaring it might be all her own fancy  the meaning of these prognostics appeared the next morning  mervyn had been much impressed by humfrey randolfs keen businesslike appearance and sensible conversation as well as by mr curries opinion of him and always detesting the trouble of his own distillery it had occurred to him that to secure an active working partner and throw his sisters fortune into the business would be a most convenient generous and brotherly means of smoothing the course of true love and cecily had been so enchanted at the happiness he would thus confer that he came to the underwood quite elevated with his own kindness  phoebe heard his offer with warm thankfulness but could not answer for humfrey  he has too much sense not to take a good offer said mervyn otherwise it is all humbug his pretending to care for you  as to roberts folly have not i given up all that any rational being could stick at  i tell you it is the giving up those houses that makes me in want of capital so you are bound to make it up to me  mervyn and phoebe wrote by the same post  i will be satisfied with whatever you decide upon as right were phoebes words but she refrained from expressing any wish  what was the use of a wise man if he were not to be let alone to make up his mind  she would trust to him to divine what it would be to her to be thus one with her own family and to gain him without losing her sisters  the balance must not be weighted by a womans hand when ready enough to incline to her side and why should she add to his pain if he must refuse  how ardently she wished however can be imagined  she could not hide from herself pictures of herself and humfrey sometimes in london sometimes at the underwood working with robert and carrying out the projects which mervyn but half acted on and a quarter understood  the letter came and the first line was decisive  in spite of earnest wishes and great regrets humfrey could not reconcile the trade to his sense of right  he knew that as mervyn conducted it it was as unobjectionable as was possible and that the works were admirably regulated but it was in going over the distillery as a curiosity he had seen enough to perceive that it was a line in which enterprise and exertion could only find scope by extending the demoralizing sale of spirits and he trusted to phoebes agreeing with him that when he already had a profession fairly free from temptation it was his duty not to put himself into one that might prove more full of danger to him than to one who had been always used to it  he had not consulted robert feeling clear in his own mind and thinking that he had probably rather not interfere  kind humfrey  that bit of consideration filled phoebes heart with grateful relief  it gave her spirits to be comforted by the tender and cheering words with which the edge of the disappointment was softened and herself thanked for her abstinence from persuasion  oh better to wait seven years with such a humfrey as this in reserve than to let him warp aside one inch of his sense of duty  as highminded as dear robert without his ruggedness and harshness she thought as she read the manly warmhearted letter to mervyn which he had enclosed and which she could not help showing to bertha  it was lost on bertha  she thought it dull and poorspirited not to accept and manage the distillery just as he pleased  any one could manage mervyn she said not estimating the difference between a petted sister and a junior partner and it was a new light to her that the tradeinvolving so much chemistry and mechanic ingenuitywas not good enough for anybody unless they were peacocks too stupid to appreciate the dignity of labour  for the first time phoebe wished her secret known to miss charlecote for the sake of her appreciation of his triumph of principle  this is roberts doing was mervyns first exclamation when phoebe gave him the letter  if there be an intolerable plague in the world it is the having a fanatical fellow like that in the family  nice requital for all i have thrown away for the sake of his maggots  i declare ill resume every house ive let him have for his tomfooleries and have a gin bottle blown as big as an ox as a sign for each of them  phoebe had a certain lurking satisfaction in observing when his malediction had run itself down he never consulted robert  dont tell me that  as if robert had not run about with his mouth open reviling his fathers trade and pluming himself on keeping out of it  mervyn you know better  robert had said no word against you  it is the facts that speak for themselves  the facts  you little simpleton do you imagine that we distil the juices of little babies  phoebe laughed and he added kindly come little one i know this is no doing of yours  you have stuck by this wicked distiller of vile liquids through thick and thin  dont let the parson lead you nor randolf by the nose he is far too fine a fellow for that but come up to town with me and cecily as soon as lady carolines bear fight is over and make him hear reason  i should be very glad to go and see him but i cannot persuade him  why not  when a man has made up his mind it would be wrong to try to overpersuade him even if i believed that i could  you know the alternative  what  just breaking with him a little  she smiled  we shall see what crabbe and augusta and acton will say to your taking up with a dumpy leveller  we shall have another row  and youll be broken up again  that was by far the most alarming of his threats but she did not greatly believe that he would bring it to pass or that an engagement however imprudent conducted as hers had been could be made a plea for accusing miss fennimore or depriving her of her sisters  she tried to express her thankfulness for the kindness that had prompted the original proposal and her sympathy with his natural vexation at finding that a traffic which he had really ameliorated at considerable loss of profit was still considered objectionable but he silenced this at once as palaver and went off to fetch his wife to try her arguments  this was worse than phoebe had expected  cecily was too thorough a wife not to have adopted all her husbands interests and had totally forgotten all the objections current in her own family against the manufacture of spirits  she knew that great opportunities of gain had been yielded up and such improvements made as had converted the distillery into a model of its kind she was very proud of it wished every one to be happy and mervyn to be saved trouble and thought the scruples injurious and overstrained  phoebe would not contest them with her  what the daughter had learnt by degrees might not be forced on the wife and phoebe would only protest against trying to shake a fixed purpose instead of maintaining its grounds  so cecily continued affectionately hurt and unnecessarily compassionate showing that a woman can hardly marry a person of tone inferior to her own without some deterioration of judgment beneficial and elevating as her influence may be in the main  poor cecily she did the very thing that those acquainted with the ins and outs of the family had most deprecated  she dragged robert into the affair writing a letter very pretty in wifely and sisterly goodwill to entreat him to take mr randolf in hand and persuade him of the desirableness of the spirit manufacture in general and that of the fulmort house in particular  the letter she received in return was intended to be very kind but was severely grave in simply observing that what he had not thought fit to do himself he could not persuade another to do  those words somehow acted upon mervyn as bitter and ungrateful irony and working himself up by an account in his own colouring of roberts behaviour at the time of the foundation of st matthews he went thundering off to assure phoebe that he must take an active partner at all events and that if she and robert did not look out he should find a moneyed man who knew what he was about would clear off roberts waste and restore the place to what it had once been  what is your letter phoebe he asked seeing an envelope in roberts handwriting on her table  phoebe coloured a little  he has not said one word to humfrey she said  and what has he said to you  the traitor insulting me to my wife  phoebe thought for one second then resolved to take the risk of reading all aloud considering that whatever might be the effect it could not be worse than that of his surmises  cecily has written to me greatly to my surprise begging for my influence with randolf to induce him to become partner in the house  i understand by this that he has already refused and that you are aware of his determination therefore i have no scruple in writing to tell you that he is perfectly right  it is true that the trade as mervyn conducts it is free from the most flagrant evils that deterred me from taking a share in it and i am most thankful for the changes he has made  you show it dont you interjected mervyn  i had rather see it in his hands than those of any other person and there is nothing blameworthy in his continuance in it  but it is of questionable expedience and there are still hereditary practices carried on the harm of which he has not hitherto perceived but which would assuredly shock a newcomer such as randolf  you can guess what would be the difficulty of obtaining alteration and acquiescence would be even more fatal  i do not tell you this as complaining of mervyn who has done and is doing infinite good but to warn you against the least endeavour to influence randolf  depend upon it even the accelerating your marriage would not secure your happiness if you saw your husband and brother at continual variance in the details of the business and opposition might at any moment lead mervyn to undo all the good he has effected  right enough there and mervyn who had looked furious at several sentences laughed at last  i must get another partner then who can and will manage and when all the ginpalaces are more splendiferous than ever what will you and the parson say  that to do a little wrong in hopes of hindering another from doing worse never yet succeeded said phoebe bravely  she saw that the worst was over when he had come to that laugh and that the danger of a quarrel between the brothers was averted  she did not know from how much terror and selfreproach poor cecily was suffering nor her multitudinous resolutions against kindly interferences upon terra incognita  that fit of wrath subsided and mervyn neither looked out for his moneyed partner nor fulfilled his threat of bringing the united forces of the family displeasure upon his sister  still there was a cloud overshadowing the enjoyment though not lessening the outward harmony of those early bridal days  the long dark drives to the county gaieties shut up with mervyn and cecily were formidable by the mere existence of a topic never mentioned but always secretly dwelt on  and in spite of three letters a week phoebe was beginning to learn that trust does not fully make up to the heart for absence by the distance of london to estimate that of canada and by the weariness of one month the tedium of seven years  yet said bertha to cecily phoebe is so stupidly like herself now she is engaged that it is no fun at all  nobody would guess her to be in love  if they cared for each other one rush would not they have floated to bliss even on streams of gin  cecily would not dispute their mutual love but she was not one of those who could fully understand the double force of that love which is second to love of principle  obedience not judgment had been her safeguard and like most women she was carried along not by the abstract idea but by its upholder  intuition rather than what had actually passed before her showed phoebe more than once that cecily was sorely perplexed by the difference between the standard of sutton and that of beauchamp  strict scrupulous and deeply devout the clergymans daughter suffered at every deviation from the practices of the parsonage made her stand in the wrong places and while conscientiously and painfully fretting mervyn about petty details would be unknowingly carried over far greater stumblingblocks  in her ignorance she would be distressed at habits which were comparatively innocent and then fear to put forth her influence at the right moment there was hearty affection on either side and mervyn was exceedingly improved but more than once phoebe saw in poor cecilys harassed puzzled wistful face and heard in her faltering remonstrances what it was to have loved and married without perfect esteem and trust    chapter xxxii       get thee an ape and trudge the land     the leader of a juggling bandscott  master howen master howen you must not go up the best stairs  but i will go up the best stairs  i dont like the nasty dark back stairs  let me take off your boots then sir mrs stubbs said she could not have such dirty marks  i dont care for mrs stubbs  i wont take my boots off  get offill kick you if you touch them  i shall go where i like  im a gentleman i shall ave hall the olt for my very hown  master howen  oh my  for flibbertigibbets teeth were in the crack orphans neck and the foot that she had not seized kicking like a vicious colt when a large hand seized him by the collar and lifted him in midair and the crack orphan looking up as though the oftinvoked ugly man of her infancy had really come to bear off naughty children beheld for a moment propped against the doorpost the tall figure and bearded head hitherto only seen on the sofa  the next instant the child had been swung into the study and the apparition stumbling with one hand and foot to the couch said breathlessly to the frightened girl i am sorry for my little boys shameful behaviour  leave him here  owen stay  the child was indeed standing as if powerless to move or even to cry stunned by his flight in the air and dismayed at the terrific presence in which he was for the first time left alone  completely roused and excited the elder owen sat upright speaking not loud but in tones forcible from vehement feeling  owen you boast of being a gentleman  do you know what we are  we are beggars  i can neither work for myself nor for you  we live on charity that girl earns her breadwe do not  we are beggars  who told you otherwise  instead of an answer he only evoked a passion of frightened tears so piteous that he spoke more gently and stretched out his hand but his son shook his frock at him in terror and retreated out of reach backwards into a corner replying to his calls and assurances with violent sobs and broken entreaties to go back to granma  at last in despair owen lowered himself to the floor and made the whole length of his person available but the child in the extremity of terror at the giant crawling after him shrieked wildly and made a rush at the door but was caught and at once drawn within the grasp of the sweeping arm  all was still  he was gathered up to the broad breast the hairy cheek was gently pressed against his wet one  it was a great powerful encircling caress that held him  there was a strange thrill in this contact between the father and sona new sensation of intense loving pity in the one a great but soothing awe in the other as struggling and crying no more he clung ever closer and closer and drew the arm tighter round him  my poor little fellow  and never had there been such sweetness in those deep full tones  the boy responded with both arms round his neck and face laid on his shoulder  poor child it was the affection that his little heart had hungered for ever since he had left his grandmother and which he had inspired in no one  a few more seconds and he was sitting on the floor resting against his father listening without alarm to his questionnow owen what were you saying  ill never do it again panever  no never be disobedient nor fight with girls  but what were you saying about the holt  i shall live herei shall have it for my own  who told you so  granma  grandmamma knows nothing about it  shant i then  never  listen owen  this is miss charlecotes house as long as she livesi trust till long after you are a man  it will be mr randolfs afterwards and neither you nor i have anything to do with it  the two great black eyes looked up in inquiring disappointed intelligence  then he said in a satisfied tone  we aint beggarswe dont carry rabbitskins and lucifers  we do nothing so useful or profitable sighed poor owen striving to pull himself up by the table but desisting on finding that it was more likely to overbalance than to be a support  my poor boy you will have to work for me and he sadly stroked down the light hair  shall i said the little fellow  may i have some white mice  ill bring you all the halfpence pa  bring me a footstool first of all  thereat this rate i shall be able to hop about on one leg and be a more taking spectacle said owen as dragging himself up by the force of hand and arm he resettled himself on his couch as much pleased as amazed at his first personal act of locomotion after seven months and at the discovery of recovered strength in the sound limbs  although with the reserve of convalescence he kept his exploit secret his spirits visibly rose and whenever he was left alone or only with his little boy he repeated his experiments launching himself from one piece of furniture to another and in spite of the continued deadness of the left side feeling life vigour and hope returning on him  his morbid shyness of his child had given way to genuine affection and owen soon found that he liked to be left to the society of flibbertigibbet or as he called him for short giblets exacting in return the title of father instead of the terrible pa  little owen thought this a preparation for the itinerant whitemouse exhibition which he was permitted to believe was only delayed till the daily gymnastic exertions should have resulted in the use of crutches and till he could safely pronounce the names of the future mice hannibal and annabella and other traps for aspirates  nay his father was going to set up an exhibition of his own as it appeared for after a vast amount of meditation he begged for pen and paper ruler and compasses drew wrote and figured and finally took to cardboard and penknife begging the aid of miss charlecote greatly to the distress of the little boy who had thought the whole affair private and confidential and looked forward to a secret departure early in the morning with crutches mice and model  miss charlecote did her best with needle and gum but could not understand and between her fears of trying owens patience and letting him overstrain his brain was so much distressed that he gave it up but it preyed on him till one day phoebe came in and he could not help explaining it to her and claiming her assistance as he saw her ready comprehension  for two afternoons she came and worked under him and between card wire gum and watchspring such a beauteous little model locomotive engine and train were produced that owen archly assured her that she would be a fortune in herself to a rising engineer and honor was struck by the sudden crimson evoked by the compliment  little owen thought their fortune made and was rather disappointed at the delay when his father confirming his idea that their livelihood might depend on the model insisted that it should be carried out in brass and wood and caused his chair to be frequently wheeled down to the blacksmiths and carpenters whose comprehension so much more resembled their ladys than that of miss fulmort and who made such intolerable blunders that he bestowed on them more vituperation than in their opinion he had any call to and looked in a passion of despair at the numb nerveless fingers once his dexterous servants  still his spirits were immensely improved since resolution hope and independence had returned  his mental faculties had recovered their force and with the removal of the disease the healthfulness and elasticity of his twentyfive years were beginning to compensate for the lost powers of his limbs  as he accomplished more he grew more enterprising and less disinclined to show off his recovered powers  he first alarmed then delighted honor begged for crutches and made such good use of them that dr martin held out fair hopes of progress though advising a course of rubbing and seaair at brighton  perhaps honor had never been happier than during these weeks of improvement with her boy so completely her own and more than she had ever known him his dejection lessening his health returning his playfulness brilliant his filial fondness most engaging  she did not know the fixed resolution that actuated him and revived the entire man she did not know what was kept in reserve till confidence in his efficiency should dispose her to listen favourably  meantime the present was so delightful to her that she trembled and watched lest she should be relapsing into the old idolatry  the test would be whether she would put owen above or below a clear duty  the audit of farmaccounts before going to brighton was as unsatisfactory as the last  though not beyond her own powers of unravelling they made it clear that brooks was superannuated  it was piteous to see the old man seated in the study racking his brains to recollect the transaction with farmer hodnet about seedwheat and working oxen to explain for what the three extra labourers had been put on and to discover his own meaning in charging twice over for the repairs of joe littledales cottage angered and overset by his mistresss gentle crossexamination and enraged into absolute disrespect when that old object of dislike mr sandbrook looked over the books and muttered suggestions under his moustache  poor old man both exclaimed as he left the room and honor sighed deeply over this failure of the last of the supports left her by humfrey i must pension him off she said  i hope it will not hurt his feelings much and then she turned away to her oldfashioned bureau and applied herself to her entries in her farmingbooks while owen sat in his chair dreamily caressing his beard and revolving the proposition that had long been in his mind  at last the tall red book was shut the pen wiped the bureau locked and honor came back to her place by the table and resumed her needlework  still there was silence till she began this settles it i have been thinking about it ever since you have been so much better owen what should you think of managing the property for me  he only answered by a quick interrogative glance  you see she continued by the help of brooks who knew his masters ways i have pottered on to my own wonderment but brooks is past work my downhilltime is coming high farming has outrun us both and i know that we are not doing as humfrey would wish by his inheritance  now i believe that nothing could be of greater use to me the people or the place than that you should be in charge  we could put some deputy under your control and contrive for your getting about the fields  i would give you so much a year so that your boys education would be your own doing and we should be so comfortable  owen leant back much moved smiled and said thanks dear honor you are much too good to us  think about it and tell me what would be right  brooks has 100 pounds a year but you will be worth much more for you will develop all the resources you know  best honor sweetest honey said owen hastily the tears rising to his eyes i cannot bear to frustrate such kind plans nor seem more ungrateful than i have been already  i will not live on you for nothing longer than i can help but indeed this must not be  not  no  there are many reasons against it  in the first place i know nothing of farming  you would soon learn  and vex your dear old spirit with steamploughs and haymaking machines  she smiled as if from him she could endure even steam  next such an administration would be highly distasteful here  my overweening airs as a boy have not been forgotten and i have always been looked on as an interloper  depend on it poor old brooks fancies the muddle in his accounts was a suggestion of my malice  imagine the feelings of hiltonbury when i his supplanter begin to tighten the reins  if it be so it can be got over said honor a little aghast  if it ought to be attempted said owen but you have not heard my personal grounds for refusing your kindness  all your goodness and kind teaching cannot prevent the undesirableness of letting my child grow up here in a halfandhalf position engendering domineering airs and unreasonable expectations  you know how in spite of your care and warnings it worked on me though i had more advantages than that poor little man  dear honor it is not you but myself that i blame  you did your utmost to disabuse me and it is only the belief that my absurd folly is in human nature that makes me thus ungracious  but said honora murmuring as if in shame you know you and therefore your child must be my especial charge and always stand first with me  first in your affection dearest honey he said fondly i trust i have been in that place these twenty years ill never give that up but if i get as well as i hope to do i mean to be no charge on any one  you cannot return to your profession  my riding and surveying days are over but theres plenty of work in me still and i see my way to a connection that will find me in enough of writing calculating and drawing to keep myself and owen and i expect to make something of my invention too when i am settled in london  in london  yes the poor old woman in whittingtonstreet is breakingpining for her grandchild i believe and losing her lodgers from not being able to make them comfortable and without what she had for the child she cannot keep an effective servant  i think of going to help her out  that woman  well i do owe her a duty  i robbed her of her own child and it is cruel to deprive her of mine when she has had all the trouble of his babyhood  money would not do the thing even if i had it  i have brought it on myself and it is the only atonement in my power so i mean to occupy two or three of her rooms work there and let her have the satisfaction of doing for me  when you are in town i shall hop into woolstonelane  you will give me holidays here wont you  and whenever you want me let me be your son  to that you know i reserve my right and he bent towards her affectionately  it is very rightvery noble she was faltering forth  he turned quickly the tears ready to fall springing quite forth  honor you have not been able to say that since i was a child  do not spoil it  if this be right leave it so  only one thing owen are you sufficiently considering your sons good in taking him there out of the way of a good education  a working education is the good one for him said owen not the being sent at the cost of othersnot even covertly at yours sweet honeyto an expensive school  he is a working mans son and must so feel himself  i mean to face my own penalties in him and if i see him in a grade inferior to what was mine by birth i shall know that though i brought it on him it is more for his real good and happiness to be a man of the people than a poor halfacknowledged gentleman  so much for my americanisms honor  but the dissentthe cant  not so much cant as real piety obtrusively expressed  poor old thing i have no fear but that little giblets will go my way he worships me and i shall not leave his hs nor more important matters to her mercy he is nearly big enough for the day school mr parsons is setting on foot  it is a great consideration that the place is in the st matthews district  well owen i cannot but see that it may be your rightest course i hope you may find yourself equal to it said honor struggling with a fresh sense of desertion though with admiration and esteem returning such as were well worth the disappointment  if not said owen smiling to hide deeper feelings i reserve to you the pleasure of maintaining me nursing me or what not  if my carcase be good for nothing i hereby make it over to you  and now honor i have not been without thought for you  i can tell you of a better successor for brooks  well she said almost crossly  humfrey charlecote randolf said owen slowly giving full effect to the two christian names  honor started gasped and snatching at the first that occurred of her objections exclaimed but my dear he is as much an engineer as yourself  from necessity not choice  he farmed till last august  canadian farming  besides what nonsense to offer a young man with all the world before him to be bailiff of this little place  it would were he only to stand in brookss position but if he were the acknowledged heir as he ought to beyes i know i am saying a dreadful thingbut my good queen elizabeth your grace would be far wiser to accept jamie at once than to keep your subjects fretting over your partialities  he will be a worthy humfrey charlecote if you catch and pin him down young  he will be worthy any way but if you let him go levelling and roaming over the world for the best half of his life this same holt will lose its charms for him and his heirs for ever  butbut how can you tell that he would be caught and pinned  there is a very sufficient pin at the underwood  my dear owen impossible  mind no one has told me in so many words but mervyn fulmort gave me such an examination on randolf as men used to do when matrimony is in the wind and since that he inferred the engagement when he came to me in no end of a rage because my backwoodsman had conscientious scruples against partaking in their concoction of evil spirits  do you mean that mervyn wants to employ him  to take him into partnership on the consideration of a certain thirty thousand  you may judge whence that was to come  and he like robert declined to live by murdering bodies and souls  i am afraid mervyn has been persecuting them ever since  ever since when  this last conversation was some three weeks ago  i suspect the principal parties settled it on that snowy twelfthday  but which of them owen  which exclaimed owen laughing  the goggle or the squint  for shame owen  but i cannot believe that phoebe would not have told me  having a sister like lady bannerman may hinder confidences to friends  now owen are you sure  as sure as i was that it was a moonstruck man that slept in my room in woolstonelane  i knew that cynthias darts had been as effective as though he had been a son of niobe  i dont believe it yet cried honor an honourable mana sensible girl  such a wild thing  ah queen elizabeth  queen elizabeth shut up an honourable man and a sensible girl in a cedar parlour every evening for ten days and then talk of wild things  have you forgotten what it is to be under twentyfive  i hate queen elizabeth said honor somewhat tartly  he muttered something of an apology and resumed his book  she worked on in silence then looking up said rather as if rejoicing in a valid objection how am i to know that this man is first in the succession  i am not suspecting him of imposition  i believe that as you say his mother was a charlecote but how do i know that she had not halfadozen brothers  there is no obligation on me to leave the place to any one but this youth ought not to come before others  that is soon answered said owen  the runaway your grandfathers brother led a wild leatherstocking life till he was getting on in years then married luckily not a squaw and died at the end of the first year leaving one daughter who married major randolf and had this only son  the same relation to me as humfrey  impossible  and pray how do you prove this  i got currie to make notes for me which i can get at in my room said owen  you can set your lawyer to write to the places and satisfy yourself without letting him know anything about it  has he any expectations  i imagine not  i think he has never found out that our relationship is not on the charlecote side  then it is the moreimpertinent i really must say in him to pay his addresses to phoebe if he have done so  i cant agree with you  what was her father but an old distiller who made his fortune and married an heiress  you sophisticated old honey to expect him to be dazzled with her fortune and look at her from a respectful distance  i thought you believed that a mans a man for a that and would esteem the bold spirit of the man of progress  progress indeed said honor ironically  listen honor said owen you had better accuse me of this fortunehunting which offends you  i have only obeyed fate and so will you  from the moment i met him he seemed as one i had known of old  it was charlecotism of course and his signature filled me with presentiment  nay though the fire and the swamp have become mere hearsay to me now i still retain the recollection of the impression throughout my illness that he was to be all that i might have been  his straightforward good sense and manly innocence brought phoebe before me and currie tells me that i had fits of hatred to him as my supplanter necessary as his care was to me  honor just stopped herself from exclaiming never and changed it into my own dear generous boy  you forget that i thought it was all over with me  the first sensations i distinctly remember were as i lay on my bed at montreal one sunday evening and saw him sitting in the window his profile clearly cut against the light and retracing all those old silhouettes over the mantelshelf  then i remembered that it had been no sick delusion but truth and verity that he was the missing charlecote  and feeling far more like death than life i was glad that you should have some one to lean on of your own sort for honor it was his bible that he was readingone that he had saved out of the fire  i thought it was a lucid interval allowed me for the sake of giving you a better son and support than i had been and looked forward to your being happy with him as soon as i could get currie alone i told him how it stood and made him take notes of the evidence of his identity and promise to make you understand it if i were dead or childish  my best hope was to see him accepted as my expiation but when i got back and you wouldnt have him at any price and i found myself living and lifelike and had seen her again  her  phoebe  my poor boy you do not mean  i do mean that i was a greater fool than you even took me for said owen with rising colour  first and last that pure childs face and honest plain words had an effect on me which nothing else had  the other affair was a mere fever by comparison and half against my will  owen  yes it was  when i was with that poor thing her fervour carried me along and as to the marriage it was out of shortsighted dread of the uproar that would have followed if i had not done it  either she would have drowned herself or her mother would have prosecuted me for breach of promise or she would have proclaimed all to lucy or mr prendergast i hadnt courage for either though honor i had nearly told you the day i went to ireland when i felt myself done for  you were married then  halfanhour said owen with something of a smile and a deep sigh if i had spoken it would have saved a life but i could not bear to lose my place with you nor to see that sweet face turned from me  you must have known that it would come out in time owen  i never could understand your concealment  i hardly can said owen except that one shuffles off unpleasant subjects  i did fancy i could stave it off till oxford was over and i was free of the men there but that notion might have been a mere excuse to myself for putting off the evil day  i was too much in debt too for an open rupture with you and as to her i can truly say that my sole shadow of an excuse is that i was too young and selfish to understand what i was inflicting  he passed his hand over his face and groaned as he addedwell that is over now and at last i can bear to look at her child  then recurring in haste to the former subjectyou were asking about phoebe  yes when i saw the fresh face ennobled but as simple as ever the dog in the manger seemed to me a reasonable beast randolfs admiration was a bitter pill  if i were to be nailed here for ever i could not well spare the moonbeams from my prison  but thats over nowit was a diseased fancy  i have got my boy now and can move about and when i get into harness and am in the way of seeing people and maturing my invention i shall never think of it again  ah i am afraid that is all i can wish for you  dont wish it so pitifully then said owen smiling  after having had no hope of her for five years and being the poor object i am this is no such great blow and i am come to the mood of benevolence in which i really desire nothing so much as to see them happy  i will think about it said honor  and though she was bewildered and disappointed the interview had on the whole made her happier by restoring the power of admiring as much as she loved  yet it was hard to be required to sacrifice the interests of one whom she adored her darling who might need help so much to do justice to a comparative stranger and the more noble and worthy owen showed himself the less willing was she to decide on committing herself to his unconscious rival  still did the test of idolatry lie here  she perceived how lighthearted this conversation had rendered owen as though he had thrown off a weight that had long been oppressing him  he was overflowing with fun and drollery throughout the journey and though still needing a good deal of assistance at all changes of carriage showed positive boyish glee in every feat he could accomplish for himself and instead of shyly shrinking from the observation and casual help of fellowtravellers gave ready smiles and thanks  exhilarated instead of wearied by the journey he was full of enjoyment of the lodgings the window and the view a new spring of youthfulness seemed to have come back to him and his animation and enterprise carried honor along with him  assuredly she had never known more thorough present pleasure than in his mirthful affectionate talk and in the sight of his daily progress towards recovery and a still greater happiness was in store for her  on the second day he begged to accompany her to the weekday service at the neighbouring church previously sending in a request for the offering of the thanks of owen charteris sandbrook for preservation in great danger and recovery from severe illness  dearest she said were i to recount my causes of thanksgiving i should not soon have done  this is best of all  not fully best yet is it said owen looking up to her with eyes like those of his childhood  no but it soon will be  not yet said owen i must think first perhaps write or talk to robert fulmort  i feel as if i could now  you long for it  yes as i never even thought i did said owen with much emotion it was strange honor as soon as i came home to the old places how the old feelings that had been set aside so long came back again  i would have given the world to recover them in canada but could only envy randolf till they woke up again of themselves at the sight of the study and the big bible we used to read with you  yet you never spoke  no i could not till i had proved to myself that there was no timeserving in them if you must know the truth said owen colouring a little  besides having been told my wits would go how did i know but that they were a symptom of my second childhood  how could any one have been so cruel as to utter such a horrible presage  one overhears and understands more than people imagine when one has nothing to do but to lie on the broad of ones back and count the flies said owen  so when i was convinced that my machine was as good as ever but only would not stand application i put off the profession just to be sure what i should think of it when i could think  well was all honor could say gazing through glad tears  and now honor dear said he with a smile i dont know how it is ive tried experiments on my brains  i have gone through halfadozen tough calculations  i have read over a greek play and made out a problem or two in mechanics without being the worse for it but somehow i cant for the life of me hark back to the opinions that had such power over me at oxford  i cant even recollect the half of them it is as if that hemlock spruce had battered them out of my head  even like as a dream when one awaketh  something like it  why even unknownst to you sweet honey i got at one or two of the books i used to swear by and somehow i could not see the force of what they advanced  theres a futility about it all compared with the substance  before you did not believe with your heart so your understanding failed to be convinced  partly so said owen thoughtfully  the fact is that religion is so much proved to the individual by personal experience and actual sensation that those who reason from without are on different ground and the avocato del diavolo has often apparently the advantage because the other partys security is that witness in his own breast which cannot be brought to light  only apparently  really sometimes with the lookerson who have accepted the doctrines without feeling them  they having no experience feel the failure of evidence where the tangible ends  do you mean to say that this was the case with yourself my dear  i should have thought if ever child were good  so did i said owen smiling  i simulated the motions to myself and every one else and there was a grain of reality after all but neither you nor i ever knew how much was mere imitation and personal influence when i outgrew implicit faith in you i am afraid my higher faith went with itfirst through recklessness then through questioning  after believing more than enough the transition is easy to doubting what is worthy of credit at all  from superstition to rationalism  yes overdoing articles of faith and observances while the mind and conscience are young and tender brings a dangerous reaction when liberty and independent reflection begin  but owen i may have overdone observances yet i did not teach superstitions said honor  not consciously said owen  you meant to teach me dogmatically only what you absolutely believed yourself  but you did not know how boundless is a childs readiness to accept what comes as from a spiritual authority or you would have drawn the line more strongly between doctrine and opinion fact and allegory the true and the edifying  in effect i treated you as the romish church began by doing to the populace  exactly so  like the mediaeval populace i took legend for fact and like the modern populace doubted of the whole together instead of sifting  there is my confession honor dear  i know you are happier for hearing it in full but remember my errors are not chargeable upon you if i had ever been true towards myself or you and acted out what i thought i felt i should have had the personal experience that would have protected the truth when the pretty superstructure began to pass away  what you have undertaken now is an acting out  i hope it is  therefore it is the first time that i have ever trusted myself to be in earnest  and after all honor though it is a terrible past to look back on it is so very pleasant to be coming home and to realize mercy and pardon and hopes of doing better that i cant feel half the brokendown sorrow that perhaps ought to be mine  it wont stay with me when i have you before me  honor could not be uneasy  she was far too glad at heart for that  the repentance was proving itself true by its fruits and who could be anxious because the gladness of forgiveness overpowered the pain of contrition  her inordinate affection had made her blind and credulous where her favourite was concerned so as to lead to his seeming ruin yet when the idol throne was overturned she had learnt to find sufficiency in her maker and to do offices of love without excess  then after her time of loneliness the very darling of her heart had been restored when it was safe for her to have him once more but so changed that he himself guarded against any recurrence to the old exclusive worship    chapter xxxiii          but the pine woods waved        and the white streams raved        they told me in my need        that softness and feeling        were not soulhealing        and so it was decreed     that the marvellous flowers of womans duty     should grow on the grave of buried beautyfaber  easter was at hand and immediately after it mr currie was to return to canada to superintend the formation of the grand ottawa and superior line  he and his assistants were hard at work on the specifications when a heavy tap and tramp came up the stairs and owen sandbrook stood before them leaning on his crutch and was greeted with joyful congratulations on being on his legs again  randolf he said hastily miss charlecote is waiting in the carriage to speak to you  give me your pen  i shall be back in an instant  time will show  where are yousuch sleepers to be i see  down with you  yes never mind hurrying back said the engineer we can get this done without youand as the door closedand a good deal beside  i hear you have put it in train  i have every reason to hope so  does he guess  not a whit as far as i can tell  he has been working hard and improving himself in his leisure  he would have made a firstrate engineer  it is really hard to be robbed of two such assistants one after the other  meanwhile honor had spent those few moments in trepidation  she had brought herself to it at last  the lurking sense of injustice had persuaded her that it was crossing her conscience to withhold the recognition of her heir so soon as she had received full evidence of his claims and his worthiness  though she had the power she felt that she had not the right to dispose of her property otherwise and such being the case it was a duty to make him aware of his prospects and offer him such a course as should best enable him to take his future place in the county  still it was a severe struggle  even with her sense of insufficiency it was hard to resign any part of the power that she had so long exercised she felt that it was a risk to put her happiness into unknown hands and perhaps because she had had this young man wellnigh thrust on her and had heard him so much lauded she almost felt antagonistic to him as rival of owen and could have been glad if any cause for repudiating him would have arisen  even the favour that he had met with in phoebes eyes was no recommendation  she was still sore at phoebes want of confidence in her she took mervyns view of his presumption and moreover it was another prize borne off from owen  poor dear honor she never made a greater sacrifice to principle than when she sent her william off to normandy to summon her edgar atheling  she did not imagine that she had it in her to have hated any one so much  yet somehow when the bright open face appeared it had the kindred familiar air and the look of eagerness so visibly fell at the sight of her alone in the carriage that she could not defend herself from a certain amusement and interest while she graciously desired him to get in and drive with her round the park since she had something to tell him that could not be said in a hurry  then as he looked up in inquiry suspecting perhaps that she had heard of his engagement she rushed at once to the point  i believe you know she said that i have no nearer relation than yourself  not sandbrook he asked in surprise  he is on my mothers side  i speak of my own family  when the holt came to me it was as a trust for my lifetime to do my best for it and to find out to whom afterwards it should belong  i was told that the direct heir was probably in america  owen sandbrook has convinced me that you are that person  thank you began young randolf somewhat embarrassed but i hope that this will make little difference to me for many years  did he underrate the holt the wretch or was it civility  she spoke a little severely  it is not a considerable property but it gives a certain position and it should make a difference to you to know what your prospects are  the colour flushed into his cheeks as he said true  it may have a considerable effect in my favour  thank you for telling me and then paused as though considering whether to volunteer more but as yet her manner was not encouraging but had all the dryness of effort  i have another reason for speaking she continued  it is due to you to warn you that the estate wants looking after  i am unequal to the requirements of modern agriculture and my faithful old bailiff who was left to me by my dear cousin is past his work  neither the land nor the people are receiving full justice  surely sandbrook could find a trustworthy steward returned the young man  nay had you not better according to his suggestion come and live on the estate yourself and undertake the management with an allowance in proportion to your position as the heir  her heart beat high with the crisis and she saw his colour deepen from scarlet to crimson as he said my engagement with mr currie  mr currie knows the state of things  owen sandbrook has been in communication with him and he does not expect to take you back with him unless you prefer the variety and enterprise of your profession to becoming a country gentleman of moderate means  she almost hoped that he would as she named the rental and the proposed allowance adding the estate must eventually come to you but it is for you to consider whether it may not be better worth having if in the interim it be under your superintendence  he had had time to grow more familiar with the idea and spoke readily and frankly  indeed miss charlecote i need no inducement  it is the life i should prefer beyond all others and i can only hope to do my duty by you and whatever you may think fit to intrust to me  and almost against her will the straightforward honesty of his look brought back to her the countenance where she had always sought for help  then your past misfortunes have not given you a distaste to farming  they did not come from farming but speculation  i was brought up to farm work and am more at home in it than in anything else so that i hope i could be useful to you  she was silent  oh no she had not the satisfaction of being displeased  he was ready enough but not grasping and she found herself seeing more of the charlecote in him and liking him better than she was ready to grant  miss charlecote he said after a few moments thought in the relations you are establishing between us it is right that you should know the full extent of the benefits you are conferring  it was true then  well it was better than a new world lady and honora contrived to look pleasantly expectant  i know it was very presumptuous he said but i could not help making my feelings known to one who is very dear to youmiss fulmort  indeed she is said honor though maybe poor phoebe had of late been a shade less dear to her  and with your consent said be perhaps a little disconcerted by her want of warmth i hope this kindness of yours may abridge the term of waiting to which we looked forward  what were you waiting for  until such time as i could provide a home to which she could take her sister maria  so you see what you have done for us  maria  yes  she promised her mother on her deathbed that maria should be her charge and no one could wish her to lay it aside  and the family are aware of the attachment  the brothers are and have been kinder than i dared to expect  it was thought better to tell no one else until we could see our way but you have a right to know now and i have the more hope that you will find comfort in the arrangement since i know how warmly and gratefully she feels towards you  i may tell her he added with a good deal of affirmation in his question  what would you do if i told you not she asked thawing for the first time out of her set speeches  i should feel very guilty and uncomfortable in writing  then come home with me tomorrow and let us talk it over she said acting on a mandate of owens which she had strenuously refused to promise to obey  you may leave your work in owens hands  he wants to stay a few days in town to arrange his plans and i do believe to have the pleasure of independence but he will come back on saturday and we will spend easter together  miss charlecote said humfrey suddenly i have no right to ask but i cannot but fear that my having turned up is an injury to sandbrook  i can only tell you that he has been exceedingly anxious for the recognition of your rights  i understand now exclaimed humfrey turning towards her quickly he betrayed it when his mind was astray  i am thrusting him out of what would have been his  it cannot be helped began honor he never expected  i can say nothing against it said the young man with much emotion it is too generous to be talked of and these are not matters of choice but duty but is it not possible to make some compensation  i have done my best to lay up for those children said honor but his sister will need her full half and my city property has other claimants i own i should be glad to secure that after me he should not be entirely dependent upon health which i fear will never be sound again  i know you would be happier in arranging it yourself though he has every claim on my gratitude  could not the estate be charged with an annuity to him  thank you said honor warmly  such a provision will suit him best i see that london is his element indeed he is so much incapacitated for a country life that the estate would have been a burthen to him could he have rightly inherited it  he is bent on selfmaintenance and all i wish is that when i am gone he should have sonething to fall back upon  i do not think that i can thank you more heartily for any of your benefits than for making me a party to this he warmly said  but there is no thanking you i must try to do so by deeds  she was forced to allow that her atheling was winning upon her  two points i liked she said to robert who spent the evening with her while owen was dining with mr currieone that he accepted the holt as a charge not a giftthe other that he never professed to be marrying for my sake  yes he is as true as phoebe said robert  both have real power of truth from never deceiving themselves  they perfectly suit one another  high praise from you robin  yet how could you forgive his declaration from so unequal a position  i thought it part of his consistently honest dealing  had she been a mere child knowing nothing of the world and subject to parents it might have been otherwise but independent and formed as she is it was but just to avow his sentiments and give her the choice of waiting  in spite of the obloquy of a poor man paying court to wealth  i fancy he was too singleminded for that idea and that it was not wealth which he courted was proved by his rejection of mervyns offer do you know i think his refusal will do mervyn a great deal of good  he is very restless to find out the remaining objections to his management and randolf will have more influence with him than i ever could while he considers parsons as a peculiar species  if people would only believe the good of not compromising  they must often wait a good while to see the good  but oh the fruit is worth waiting for  robin she added after a pause you have been in correspondence with my boy  yes said robert and there indeed you may be satisfied  the seed you sowed in the morning is bearing its increase  i sowed  ah robert what i sowed was a false crop that had almost caused the good seed to be rooted up together with it  not altogether said robert  if you made any mistakes that led to a confusion of real and unreal in his mind still the real good you did to him is incalculable  so he tells me dear boy  but when i think what he was as a child and what he has been as a youth i cannot but charge it on myself  then think what he is and will be i trust as a man said robert even at the worst the higher purer standard that had been impressed on him saved him from lower depths and when he came to himself it was not as if he had neither known his fathers house nor the way to it  oh miss charlecote you must not come to me to assure you that your training of him was in vain  i who am always feeling the difference between trying to pull him and poor mervyn upwards  there may be more excuse for mervyn but owen knows where he is going and springs towards it while mervyn wonders at himself at every stage and always fancies the next some delusion of my straitlaced imagination  ah once i spurned and afterwards grieved over the saying that very religious little boys either die or belie their promise  there is some truth in it said robert  precocious piety is so beautiful that it is apt to be fostered so as to make it insensibly imitative and unreal or depend upon some individual personal influence and there is a certain reaction at one stage of growth against what has been overworked  then what could you do with such a child as my owen if it were all to come over again  his aspirations were often so beautiful that i could not but reverence them greatly and i cannot now believe that they were prompted by aught but innocence and baptismal grace  looking back said robert i believe they were genuine and came from his heart  no such a devotional turn should be treated with deep reverence and tenderness but the expression had better be almost repressed and the test of conduct enforced though without loading the conscience with details not of general application and sometimes impracticable under other circumstances  it is the practicalness of dear owens reformation that makes it so thoroughly satisfactory said honora though i must say that i dread the experiment  you will look after him for this week robert i fear he is overdoing himself in his delight at moving about and working again  i will see how he gets on  it will be a good essay for the future  i cannot think how he is ever to bear living with mrs murrell  she is a good deal broken and subdued and is more easily repressed than one imagines at her first onset  besides she is very proud and rather afraid of him and will not molest him much  indeed it is a good arrangement for him he ought to have care above that of the average landlady  will he get it  i trust so  she has the ways of a respectable servant and her religious principle is real though we do not much admire its manifestation  she will be honest and careful of his wants and look after his child and nurse him tenderly if he require it  as if any one but myself would do that  but it is right and he will be all the better and happier for accepting his duty to her while she lives if he can bear it  as he says it is his only expiation  well i should not wonder if you saw more of me here than hitherto  a born cockney like me gets inclined to the haunts of men as she grows old and if your sisters and charlecote raymond suffice for the parish i shall be glad to be out of sight of the improvements he will make  not without your consent  i shall have to consent in my conscience to what i hate in my heart  i am not the man to argue you away from here said robert eagerly if you would take up the young womens association it would be the only thing to make up for the loss of miss fennimore  then the st wulstans asylum wants a lady visitor  my fathers foundation whence his successor ousted me in a general sweep of troublesome ladies said honor  how sore i was and how things come round  well find work for you cried robert highly exhilarated  i should like to make out that we cant do without you  why robin you of all men taking to compliments  it is out of selfinterest  nothing makes so much difference to me as having this house inhabited  indeed she said highly gratified i thought you wanted nothing but st matthews  nay said robert as a bright colour came over his usually set and impassive countenance  you do not want me to say what you have always been to me and how better things have been fostered by your presence ever since the day you let me out of hiltonbury church  i have often since thought it was no vain imagination that you were a good spirit sent to my rescue by mr charlecote  poor robin said honor her lip quivering it was less what i gave than what you gathered up  i barely tolerated you  which served me right said robert and made me respect you  there are so few to blame me now that i need you all the more  i can hardly cede to owen the privilege of being your only son  you are my autumnsinging robin said honor too true to let him think that he could stand beside owen in her affections but with intense pleasure at such unwonted warmth from one so stern and reserved it was as if he was investing her with some of the tenderness that the loss of lucilla had left vacant and bestowing on her the confidences to which new relations might render phoebe less open  it was no slight preferment to be robert fulmorts motherly friend and far beyond her as he had soared she might still be the softening element in his life as once she had been the ennobling one  if she had formed robert or even given one impulse such as to lead to his becoming what he was the old maid had not lived in vain  she was not selfish enough to be grieved at owens ecstasy in emancipation and trusting to being near enough to watch over him without being in his way she could enjoy his overflowing spirits and detect almost a jocund sound in the thump of his crutch across the hall as he hurried in elated with hopes of the success of his invention eager about the canadian railway delighted with the society of his congeners and pouring out on her all sorts of information that she could not understand  the certainty that her decision was for his happiness ought surely to reconcile her to carrying home his rival in his stead  going down by an early train she resolved by roberts advice to visit beauchamp at once and give mervyn a distinct explanation of her intentions  he was tardy in taking them in then exclaimedphoebes teetotaller  well he is a sharp fellow  the luck that some men have  dear phoebe cried cecily i am so thankful that she is spared a long attachment  it was telling on her already  oh we should have put a stop to the affair if he had gone out to canada roundly asserted mervyn but of course he knew better  not at allthis was quite a surprise  mervyn recollected in time that it was best that miss charlecote should so imagine and reserved for his wifes private ear his conviction that the young fellow had had this hope in his eye when refusing the partnership  such smartness and foresight commanded his respect as a man of the world though maybe the women would not understand it  for phoebes interest he must encourage the lady in her excellent intentions  it is very handsome in you miss charlecotevery handsomeand i am perfectly unprejudiced in assuring you that you have done the very best thing for yourself  phoebe is a good girl and devoted to you already  indeed she is said cecily  she looks up to you so much  somehow honor did not want mrs fulmort to assure her of this  and as to the place continued mervyn you could not put it into better hands to get your people out of their old world ways  a young man like that used to farming and with steam and mechanics at his fingers ends will make us all look about us  perhaps murmured poor honor with quailing heart  john raymond and i were looking about the holt the other day said mervyn and agreeing how much more could be made of it  clear away some of those hedgerowsgrub up a bit of copse or twotry chemical manuresdrain that terrible old marsh beyond the plantationand have up a good enginehouse where you have those old ramshackle buildings at the home farm  why the place will bring in as much again and youve hit on the very man to carry it out  he shall try all the experiments before i adopt them  honora felt as if she must flee  if she were to hear any more she should be ready to banish young randolf to canada were he ten times her heir had she lived to hear humfreys new barn with the verge boards conceded to her taste called ramshackle  and she had given her word  as she left beauchamp and looked at her scraggy pinetrees cresting the hill she felt as though they were her own no longer and as if she had given them up to an enemy  she assured herself that nothing could be done without her freewill and considered of the limitations that must be imposed on this frightful reformer but her heart grew sick at the conviction that either she would have to yield or be regarded as a mere incubus and obstruction  with almost a passionate sense of defence of humfreys trees and humfreys barns she undid the gate of the fir plantationshis special favourites  the bright april sun shed clear gleams athwart the russet boles of the trees candied by their white gum the shadows were sharply defined and darkened by the dense silvered green canopy relieved by fresh light young shoots culminating in white powdery clusters or little soft crimson conelets all redolent of fresh resinous fragrance the wind whispered like the sound of ocean in the summit of the trees and a nightingale was singing gloriously in the distance  all recalled humfrey and the day thirty years back when she had given him such sore pain in those very woods grasping the shadow instead of the substance and taking the sunshine out of his life as well as from her own  never had she felt such a pang in thinking of that day or in the vain imagination of how it might have been  yet i believe i am doing right she thought  humfrey himself might say that old things must pass away and the past give place to the present  let me stand once more under the tree where i gave him that answer  shall i feel as if he would laugh at me for my shrinking or approve me for my resolution  the tree was a pinaster of lengthy foliage and ponderous cones standing in a little shootingpath leading from the main walk  she turned towards it and stood breathless for a moment  there stood the familiar figureyouthful wellknit firm with the open steadfast kindly face but with the look of crowned exultant love that she had only once beheld and that when his feet were already within the waters of the dark river  it was his very voice that exclaimed here she is  had her imagination indeed called up humfrey before her or was he come to upbraid her with her surrender of his charge to modern innovation  but the spell was broken for a woodland nymph in soft gray edged with green was instantly beside him and that calmlyglad face was no reflection of what honoras had ever been  dear dear miss charlecote cried phoebe springing to her we thought you would come home this way so we came to meet you and were watching both the paths  thank you my dear said honor  could that man who looked so like humfrey be thinking how those firs would cut up into sleepers  do you know said phoebe eagerly he says this wood is a little likeness of his favourite place in his old home  i am afraid he added as if apologizing i shall always feel most at home in the smell of pinetrees  mervyns predictions began to lose their force and honor smiled  but said phoebe turning to her i was longing to beg your pardon  i did not like to have any secret from you  ah you cunning children said honor finding surface work easiest you stole a march upon us all  i could not help it said phoebe  they both laughed and turning to him she said now could i  when you spoke to me i could only tell the truth  and i suppose he could not help it said honor  of course not if there was no reason for helping it he said  there could be no dwelling on the horrible things that he would perpetrate while he looked so like the rightful squire and while both were so fair a sight in their glad gratitude and she found herself saying you will bear our name  there might be a pang in setting aside that of his father but he looked at the glowing cheeks and glistening eyes beside him and said answer for me  it is what i should like best of all phoebe said fervently  if we can deserve to bear it he gravely added  and something in his tone made honora feel confident that even if he should set up an enginehouse it would be only if humfrey would have done so in his place  it will be belonging to you all the more said phoebe  it is one great pleasure that now i shall have a right to you  yes phoebe the old woman will depend on you her eastern moon brightening as days wild lights decline  but she will trouble you no longer  finish your walk with humfrey  it was the first time she had called him by that name  no they said with one voice we were waiting to walk home with you if we may  there was something in that walk in the tender respectful kindness with which she was treated in the intelligent interest that humfrey showed in the estate his clearheaded truthfulness on the need of change and his delicate deference in proposing alteration that set her heart at rest made her feel that the goodly heritage was in safe hands and that she had a staff in her hands for the first time since that sunday in harvest                                        before the next harvest hiltonbury bells rang out and the church was crowded with glad faces but there was none more deeply joyful than that of the lonely woman with silvery hair who quietly knelt beside the gray slab lettered h c 1840 convinced that the home and people of him who lay there would be in trusty hands when she should join him in his true inheritance  her idols set aside she could with clearer eyes look to that hope though in no weariness of earth no haste to depart but still in full strength ready to work for mans good and gods glory  beside her as usual was owen leaning on his crutch but eminent in face and figure as the handsomest man present and full of animation betraying neither pain or regret but throughout the wedding festivities showing himself the foremost in mirth and spurring hiltonbury on to rejoicings that made the villagers almost oblivious of the forest show  the saddest face in church was that of the head bridesmaid  even though phoebe was only going as far as the holt and humfrey was much loved berthas heart was sore with undefined regret for her own blotted past and with the feeling of present loss in the sister whose motherly kindness she had never sufficiently recognized  bertha knew not how much gentler and more lovable she herself was growing in that very struggle with her own sadness and in her endeavours to be sufficient protectress for maria  the two sisters were to remain at the underwood with miss fennimore and in her kindness and in daily intercourse with phoebe and cecily could hardly fail to be happy  maria was radiantly glad in all the delight of her bridesmaids adornments and of the school feasting and above all in patronizing her pretty little niece elizabeth acton the baby bridesmaid  it was as if allegiance to poor julianas dislikes had hitherto kept sir bevil aloof from phoebe and deterred him from manifesting his goodwill but the marriage brought him at last to beauchamp kind grave military and melancholy as ever and so much wrapped up in his little girl and his fancied memory of her mother that cecilys dislike of long attachments was confirmed by his aspect and only her sanguine benevolence was bold enough to augur his finding a comforter in her cousin susan  poor man  lady bannerman had been tormenting him all the morning with appeals to his own wedding as precedents for cecilys benefit  her instructions to cecily were so overwhelming as to reduce that meek little lady to something approaching to annihilation and the simple advice given by bertha and backed by phoebe herself never to mind appeared the summit of audacity  long since having ceased to trouble herself as to the danger of growing too stout lady bannerman in her brocades and laces was such a mountain of a woman that she was forced to sail up the aisle of hiltonbury church alone in her glory without space for a cavalier beside her  the bridegrooms friend was his little seven years old brother whom he had sent for to place at a good school and who fraternized with little owen a brisk little fellow his hs and his manners alike doing credit to the paternal training and preparing in due time to become a bluegowned and yellowlegged christs hospital scholara nomination having been already promised through the fulmort city influence  robert assisted charlecote raymond in the rite which joined together the young pair  they were goodly to look upon in their grave glad modesty and selfpossession and their youthful strength and fairnesswhich to honors mind gave the idea of the beauty of simple strength and completeness such as befits a wellbuilt vessel at her launch in all her quiet force whether to glide over smooth waters or to battle with the tempest  peaceful as those two faces were there was in them spirit and resolution sufficient for either storm or calm for it was steadfastness based upon the only strong foundation  for the last time was signed and with no unsteady hand the clear wellmade letters of the maiden phoebe fulmort and as above it the bride read the words humfrey charlecote randolf charlecote she looked up to her husband with a sweet halfsmile of content and exultation as though his name were doubly endeared as recalling her wise man the revered guardian of her imagination in her orphaned girlhood  there are years when the buds of spring are nipped by frost or blight and when summer blossoms are rent by hail and storm till autumn sets in without one relenting pause  then even at the commencement of decline comes an interval a renewal of all that former seasons had proffered of fair and sweet the very tokens of decay are lovelythe skies are deep calm blue the sunsets soft gold and the exquisite serenity and tranquil enjoyment are beyond even the bright fitful hopes of spring  there is a tinge of melancholy for this is a farewell though a lingering farewell and for that very cause the enduring flowers the brilliant eaves the persevering singing birds are even more prized than those which in earlier months come less as present boons than foretastes of the future  such an indian summer may be honor charlecotes present life  it is not old age for she has still the strength and health of her best days but it is the later stage of middle life with experience added to energy her girlhood suffered from a great though highminded mistake her womanhood was careworn and sorrowstricken  as first the beloved of her youth so again the darling of her afterage was a disappointment but she was patient and patience has met with a reward even in this life desolateness taught her to rely no longer on things of earth but to satisfy her soul with that love which is individual as well as infinite and that lesson learnt the human affection that once failed her is come back upon her in full measure  she is no longer forlorn the children whom she bred up and those whom she led by her influence alike vie with one another in their love and gratitude  the old house in woolstonelane is her home for the greater part of the winter and spring and her chief work lies in her fathers former parish directed by mr parsons and robert and enjoying especially the sunday evenings that owen constantly spends with her in the cedar parlour in such converse whether grave or gay as men rarely seek save with a mother or one who has been as a mother  but she is still the lady of the holt  there she still spends autumn and christmas resuming her old habits without feeling them a burthen bemoaning a little but approving all the while humfreys moderate and successful alterations and loving and delighting above all in phoebes sweet wisdom in her happy household rule  it is well worth all the past to return to the holt with the holiday feeling of her girlhood     footnote   225  terrify to tease or worry                      picture detail from book cover
