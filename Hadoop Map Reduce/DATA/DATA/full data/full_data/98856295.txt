98856295	nona vincent  by henry james     chapter i    i wondered whether you wouldnt read it to me said mrs alsager as they lingered a little near the fire before he took leave  she looked down at the fire sideways drawing her dress away from it and making her proposal with a shy sincerity that added to her charm her charm was always great for allan wayworth and the whole air of her house which was simply a sort of distillation of herself so soothing so beguiling that he always made several false starts before departure  he had spent some such good hours there had forgotten in her warm golden drawingroom so much of the loneliness and so many of the worries of his life that it had come to be the immediate answer to his longings the cure for his aches the harbour of refuge from his storms  his tribulations were not unprecedented and some of his advantages if of a usual kind were marked in degree inasmuch as he was very clever for one so young and very independent for one so poor  he was eightandtwenty but he had lived a good deal and was full of ambitions and curiosities and disappointments  the opportunity to talk of some of these in grosvenor place corrected perceptibly the immense inconvenience of london  this inconvenience took for him principally the line of insensibility to allan wayworths literary form  he had a literary form or he thought he had and her intelligent recognition of the circumstance was the sweetest consolation mrs alsager could have administered  she was even more literary and more artistic than he inasmuch as he could often work off his overflow this was his occupation his profession while the generous woman abounding in happy thoughts but unedited and unpublished stood there in the rising tide like the nymph of a fountain in the plash of the marble basin  the year before in a big newspapery house he had found himself next her at dinner and they had converted the intensely material hour into a feast of reason  there was no motive for her asking him to come to see her but that she liked him which it was the more agreeable to him to perceive as he perceived at the same time that she was exquisite  she was enviably free to act upon her likings and it made wayworth feel less unsuccessful to infer that for the moment he happened to be one of them  he kept the revelation to himself and indeed there was nothing to turn his head in the kindness of a kind woman  mrs alsager occupied so completely the ground of possession that she would have been condemned to inaction had it not been for the principle of giving  her husband who was twenty years her senior a massive personality in the city and a heavy one at home wherever he stood or even sat he was monumental owned half a big newspaper and the whole of a great many other things  he admired his wife though she bore no children and liked her to have other tastes than his as that seemed to give a greater acreage to their life  his own appetites went so far he could scarcely see the boundary and his theory was to trust her to push the limits of hers so that between them the pair should astound by their consumption  his ideas were prodigiously vulgar but some of them had the good fortune to be carried out by a person of perfect delicacy  her delicacy made her play strange tricks with them but he never found this out  she attenuated him without his knowing it for what he mainly thought was that he had aggrandised her  without her he really would have been bigger still and society breathing more freely was practically under an obligation to her which to do it justice it acknowledged by an attitude of mystified respect  she felt a tremulous need to throw her liberty and her leisure into the things of the soulthe most beautiful things she knew  she found them when she gave time to seeking in a hundred places and particularly in a dim and sacred regionthe region of active pity over her entrance into which she dropped curtains so thick that it would have been an impertinence to lift them  but she cultivated other beneficent passions and if she cherished the dream of something fine the moments at which it most seemed to her to come true were when she saw beauty plucked flowerlike in the garden of art  she loved the perfect workshe had the artistic chord  this chord could vibrate only to the touch of another so that appreciation in her spirit had the added intensity of regret  she could understand the joy of creation and she thought it scarcely enough to be told that she herself created happiness  she would have liked at any rate to choose her way but it was just here that her liberty failed her  she had not the voiceshe had only the vision the only envy she was capable of was directed to those who as she said could do something  as everything in her however turned to gentleness she was admirably hospitable to such people as a class  she believed allan wayworth could do something and she liked to hear him talk of the ways in which he meant to show it  he talked of them almost to no one elseshe spoiled him for other listeners  with her fair bloom and her quiet grace she was indeed an ideal public and if she had ever confided to him that she would have liked to scribble she had in fact not mentioned it to a creature he would have been in a perfect position for asking her why a woman whose face had so much expression should not have felt that she achieved  how in the world could she express better  there was less than that in shakespeare and beethoven  she had never been more generous than when in compliance with her invitation which i have recorded he brought his play to read to her  he had spoken of it to her before and one dark november afternoon when her red fireside was more than ever an escape from the place and the season he had broken out as he came inive done it ive done it  she made him tell her all about itshe took an interest really minute and asked questions delightfully apt  she had spoken from the first as if he were on the point of being acted making him jump with her participation all sorts of dreary intervals  she liked the theatre as she liked all the arts of expression and he had known her to go all the way to paris for a particular performance  once he had gone with herthe time she took that stupid mrs mostyn  she had been struck when he sketched it with the subject of his drama and had spoken words that helped him to believe in it  as soon as he had rung down his curtain on the last act he rushed off to see her but after that he kept the thing for repeated last touches  finally on christmas day by arrangement she sat there and listened to it  it was in three acts and in prose but rather of the romantic order though dealing with contemporary english life and he fondly believed that it showed the hand if not of the master at least of the prize pupil  allan wayworth had returned to england at twoandtwenty after a miscellaneous continental education his father the correspondent for years in several foreign countries successively of a conspicuous london journal had died just after this leaving his mother and her two other children portionless girls to subsist on a very small income in a very dull german town  the young mans beginnings in london were difficult and he had aggravated them by his dislike of journalism  his fathers connection with it would have helped him but he was insanely most of his friends judged the great exception was always mrs alsager intraitable on the question of form  formin his sensewas not demanded by english newspapers and he couldnt give it to them in their sense  the demand for it was not great anywhere and wayworth spent costly weeks in polishing little compositions for magazines that didnt pay for style  the only person who paid for it was really mrs alsager  she had an infallible instinct for the perfect  she paid in her own way and if allan wayworth had been a wageearning person it would have made him feel that if he didnt receive his legal dues his palm was at least occasionally conscious of a gratuity  he had his limitations his perversities but the finest parts of him were the most alive and he was restless and sincere  it is however the impression he produced on mrs alsager that most concerns us  she thought him not only remarkably goodlooking but altogether original there were some usual bad things he would never dotoo many prohibitive puddles for him in the short cut to success  for himself he had never been so happy as since he had seen his way as he fondly believed to some sort of mastery of the scenic idea which struck him as a very different matter now that he looked at it from within  he had had his early days of contempt for it when it seemed to him a jewel dim at the best hidden in a dunghill a taper burning low in an air thick with vulgarity  it was hedged about with sordid approaches it was not worth sacrifice and suffering  the man of letters in dealing with it would have to put off all literature which was like asking the bearer of a noble name to forego his immemorial heritage  aspects change however with the point of view  wayworth had waked up one morning in a different bed altogether  it is needless here to trace this accident to its source it would have been much more interesting to a spectator of the young mans life to follow some of the consequences  he had been made as he felt the subject of a special revelation and he wore his hat like a man in love  an angel had taken him by the hand and guided him to the shabby door which opens it appeared into an interior both splendid and austere  the scenic idea was magnificent when once you had embraced itthe dramatic form had a purity which made some others look ingloriously rough  it had the high dignity of the exact sciences it was mathematical and architectural  it was full of the refreshment of calculation and construction the incorruptibility of line and law  it was bare but it was erect it was poor but it was noble it reminded him of some sovereign famed for justice who should have lived in a palace despoiled  there was a fearful amount of concession in it but what you kept had a rare intensity  you were perpetually throwing over the cargo to save the ship but what a motion you gave her when you made her ride the wavesa motion as rhythmic as the dance of a goddess  wayworth took long london walks and thought of these thingslondon poured into his ears the mighty hum of its suggestion  his imagination glowed and melted down material his intentions multiplied and made the air a golden haze  he saw not only the thing he should do but the next and the next and the next the future opened before him and he seemed to walk on marble slabs  the more he tried the dramatic form the more he loved it the more he looked at it the more he perceived in it  what he perceived in it indeed he now perceived everywhere if he stopped in the london dusk before some flaring shopwindow the place immediately constituted itself behind footlights became a framed stage for his figures  he hammered at these figures in his lonely lodging he shaped them and he shaped their tabernacle he was like a goldsmith chiselling a casket bent over with the passion for perfection  when he was neither roaming the streets with his vision nor worrying his problem at his table he was exchanging ideas on the general question with mrs alsager to whom he promised details that would amuse her in later and still happier hours  her eyes were full of tears when he read her the last words of the finished work and she murmured divinely   and nowto get it done to get it done  yes indeedto get it done wayworth stared at the fire slowly rolling up his typecopy  but thats a totally different part of the business and altogether secondary  but of course you want to be acted  of course i dobut its a sudden descent  i want to intensely but im sorry i want to  its there indeed that the difficulties begin said mrs alsager a little off her guard  how can you say that  its there that they end  ah wait to see where they end  i mean theyll now be of a totally different order wayworth explained  it seems to me there can be nothing in the world more difficult than to write a play that will stand an allround test and that in comparison with them the complications that spring up at this point are of an altogether smaller kind  yes theyre not inspiring said mrs alsager theyre discouraging because theyre vulgar  the other problem the working out of the thing itself is pure art  how well you understand everything  the young man had got up nervously and was leaning against the chimneypiece with his back to the fire and his arms folded  the roll of his copy in his fist was squeezed into the hollow of one of them  he looked down at mrs alsager smiling gratefully and she answered him with a smile from eyes still charmed and suffused  yes the vulgarity will begin now he presently added  youll suffer dreadfully  i shall suffer in a good cause  yes giving that to the world  you must leave it with me i must read it over and over mrs alsager pleaded rising to come nearer and draw the copy in its cover of greenishgrey paper which had a generic identity now to him out of his grasp  who in the world will do itwho in the world can she went on close to him turning over the leaves  before he could answer she had stopped at one of the pages she turned the book round to him pointing out a speech  thats the most beautiful placethose lines are a perfection  he glanced at the spot she indicated and she begged him to read them againhe had read them admirably before  he knew them by heart and closing the book while she held the other end of it he murmured them over to herthey had indeed a cadence that pleased himwatching with a facetious complacency which he hoped was pardonable the applause in her face  ah who can utter such lines as that mrs alsager broke out whom can you find to do her  well find people to do them all  but not people who are worthy  theyll be worthy enough if theyre willing enough  ill work with themill grind it into them  he spoke as if he had produced twenty plays  oh it will be interesting she echoed  but i shall have to find my theatre first  i shall have to get a manager to believe in me  yestheyre so stupid  but fancy the patience i shall want and how i shall have to watch and wait said allan wayworth  do you see me hawking it about london  indeed i dontit would be sickening  its what i shall have to do  i shall be old before its produced  i shall be old very soon if it isnt mrs alsager cried  i know one or two of them she mused  do you mean you would speak to them  the thing is to get them to read it  i could do that  thats the utmost i ask  but its even for that i shall have to wait  she looked at him with kind sisterly eyes  you shant wait  ah you dear lady wayworth murmured  that is you may but i wont  will you leave me your copy she went on turning the pages again  certainly i have another  standing near him she read to herself a passage here and there then in her sweet voice she read some of them out  oh if you were only an actress the young man exclaimed  thats the last thing i am  theres no comedy in me  she had never appeared to wayworth so much his good genius  is there any tragedy he asked with the levity of complete confidence  she turned away from him at this with a strange and charming laugh and a perhaps that will be for you to determine  but before he could disclaim such a responsibility she had faced him again and was talking about nona vincent as if she had been the most interesting of their friends and her situation at that moment an irresistible appeal to their sympathy  nona vincent was the heroine of the play and mrs alsager had taken a tremendous fancy to her  i cant tell you how i like that woman she exclaimed in a pensive rapture of credulity which could only be balm to the artistic spirit  im awfully glad she lives a bit  what i feel about her is that shes a good deal like you wayworth observed  mrs alsager stared an instant and turned faintly red  this was evidently a view that failed to strike her she didnt however treat it as a joke  im not impressed with the resemblance  i dont see myself doing what she does  it isnt so much what she does the young man argued drawing out his moustache  but what she does is the whole point  she simply tells her lovei should never do that  if you repudiate such a proceeding with such energy why do you like her for it  it isnt what i like her for  what else then  thats intensely characteristic  mrs alsager reflected looking down at the fire she had the air of having halfadozen reasons to choose from  but the one she produced was unexpectedly simple it might even have been prompted by despair at not finding others  i like her because you made her she exclaimed with a laugh moving again away from her companion  wayworth laughed still louder  you made her a little yourself ive thought of her as looking like you  she ought to look much better said mrs alsager  no certainly i shouldnt do what she does  not even in the same circumstances  i should never find myself in such circumstances  theyre exactly your play and have nothing in common with such a life as mine however mrs alsager went on her behaviour was natural for her and not only natural but it seems to me thoroughly beautiful and noble  i cant sufficiently admire the talent and tact with which you make one accept it and i tell you frankly that its evident to me there must be a brilliant future before a young man who at the start has been capable of such a stroke as that  thank heaven i can admire nona vincent as intensely as i feel that i dont resemble her  dont exaggerate that said allan wayworth  my admiration  your dissimilarity  she has your face your air your voice your motion she has many elements of your being  then shell damn your play mrs alsager replied  they joked a little over this though it was not in the tone of pleasantry that wayworths hostess soon remarked  youve got your remedy however have her done by the right woman  oh have her donehave her done the young man gently wailed  i see what you mean my poor friend  what a pity when its such a magnificent partsuch a chance for a clever serious girl  nona vincent is practically your playit will be open to her to carry it far or to drop it at the first corner  its a charming prospect said allan wayworth with sudden scepticism  they looked at each other with eyes that for a lurid moment saw the worst of the worst but before they parted they had exchanged vows and confidences that were dedicated wholly to the ideal  it is not to be supposed however that the knowledge that mrs alsager would help him made wayworth less eager to help himself he did what he could and felt that she on her side was doing no less but at the end of a year he was obliged to recognise that their united effort had mainly produced the fine flower of discouragement at the end of a year the lustre had to his own eyes quite faded from his unappreciated masterpiece and he found himself writing for a biographical dictionary little lives of celebrities he had never heard of  to be printed anywhere and anyhow was a form of glory for a man so unable to be acted and to be paid even at encyclopaedic rates had the consequence of making one resigned and verbose  he couldnt smuggle style into a dictionary but he could at least reflect that he had done his best to learn from the drama that it is a gross impertinence almost anywhere  he had knocked at the door of every theatre in london and at a ruinous expense had multiplied typecopies of nona vincent to replace the neat transcripts that had descended into the managerial abyss  his play was not even declinedno such flattering intimation was given him that it had been read  what the managers would do for mrs alsager concerned him little today the thing that was relevant was that they would do nothing for him  that charming woman felt humbled to the earth so little response had she had from the powers on which she counted  the two never talked about the play now but he tried to show her a still finer friendship that she might not think he felt she had failed him  he still walked about london with his dreams but as months succeeded months and he left the year behind him they were dreams not so much of success as of revenge  success seemed a colourless name for the reward of his patience something fiercely florid something sanguinolent was more to the point  his best consolation however was still in the scenic idea it was not till now that he discovered how incurably he was in love with it  by the time a vain second year had chafed itself away he cherished his fruitless faculty the more for the obloquy it seemed to suffer  he lived in his best hours in a world of subjects and situations he wrote another play and made it as different from its predecessor as such a very good thing could be  it might be a very good thing but when he had committed it to the theatrical limbo indiscriminating fate took no account of the difference  he was at last able to leave england for three or four months he went to germany to pay a visit long deferred to his mother and sisters  shortly before the time he had fixed for his return he received from mrs alsager a telegram consisting of the words  loder wishes see youputting nona instant rehearsal  he spent the few hours before his departure in kissing his mother and sisters who knew enough about mrs alsager to judge it lucky this respectable married lady was not therea relief however accompanied with speculative glances at london and the morrow  loder as our young man was aware meant the new renaissance but though he reached home in the evening it was not to this convenient modern theatre that wayworth first proceeded  he spent a late hour with mrs alsager an hour that throbbed with calculation  she told him that mr loder was charming he had simply taken up the play in its turn he had hopes of it moreover that on the part of a professional pessimist might almost be qualified as ecstatic  it had been cast with a margin for objections and violet grey was to do the heroine  she had been capable while he was away of a good piece of work at that foggy old playhouse the legitimate the piece was a clumsy rechauffe but she at least had been fresh  wayworth remembered violet greyhadnt he for two years on a fond policy of looking out kept dipping into the london theatres to pick up prospective interpreters  he had not picked up many as yet and this young lady at all events had never wriggled in his net  she was pretty and she was odd but he had never prefigured her as nona vincent nor indeed found himself attracted by what he already felt sufficiently launched in the profession to speak of as her artistic personality  mrs alsager was differentshe declared that she had been struck not a little by some of her tones  the girl was interesting in the thing at the legitimate and mr loder who had his eye on her described her as ambitious and intelligent  she wanted awfully to get onand some of those ladies were so lazy  wayworth was scepticalhe had seen miss violet grey who was terribly itinerant in a dozen theatres but only in one aspect  nona vincent had a dozen aspects but only one theatre yet with what a feverish curiosity the young man promised himself to watch the actress on the morrow  talking the matter over with mrs alsager now seemed the very stuff that rehearsal was made of  the near prospect of being acted laid a finger even on the lip of inquiry he wanted to go on tiptoe till the first night to make no condition but that they should speak his lines and he felt that he wouldnt so much as raise an eyebrow at the scenepainter if he should give him an old oak chamber  he became conscious the next day that his danger would be other than this and yet he couldnt have expressed to himself what it would be  danger was there doubtlessdanger was everywhere in the world of art and still more in the world of commerce but what he really seemed to catch for the hour was the beating of the wings of victory  nothing could undermine that since it was victory simply to be acted  it would be victory even to be acted badly a reflection that didnt prevent him however from banishing in his politic optimism the word bad from his vocabulary  it had no application in the compromise of practice it didnt apply even to his play which he was conscious he had already outlived and as to which he foresaw that in the coming weeks frequent alarm would alternate in his spirit with frequent esteem  when he went down to the dusky daylit theatre it arched over him like the temple of fame mr loder who was as charming as mrs alsager had announced struck him as the genius of hospitality  the manager began to explain why for so long he had given no sign but that was the last thing that interested wayworth now and he could never remember afterwards what reasons mr loder had enumerated  he liked in the whole business of discussion and preparation even the things he had thought he should probably dislike and he revelled in those he had thought he should like  he watched miss violet grey that evening with eyes that sought to penetrate her possibilities  she certainly had a few they were qualities of voice and face qualities perhaps even of intelligence he sat there at any rate with a fostering coaxing attention repeating over to himself as convincingly as he could that she was not commona circumstance all the more creditable as the part she was playing seemed to him desperately so  he perceived that this was why it pleased the audience he divined that it was the part they enjoyed rather than the actress  he had a private panic wondering how if they liked that form they could possibly like his  his form had now become quite an ultimate idea to him  by the time the evening was over some of miss violet greys features several of the turns of her head a certain vibration of her voice had taken their place in the same category  she was interesting she was distinguished at any rate he had accepted her  it came to the same thing  but he left the theatre that night without speaking to her moved a little even to his own mystification by an odd procrastinating impulse  on the morrow he was to read his three acts to the company and then he should have a good deal to say what he felt for the moment was a vague indisposition to commit himself moreover he found a slight confusion of annoyance in the fact that though he had been trying all the evening to look at nona vincent in violet greys person what subsisted in his vision was simply violet grey in nonas  he didnt wish to see the actress so directly or even so simply as that and it had been very fatiguing the effort to focus nona both through the performer and through the legitimate before he went to bed that night he posted three words to mrs alsagershes not a bit like it but i dare say i can make her do  he was pleased with the way the actress listened the next day at the reading he was pleased indeed with many things at the reading and most of all with the reading itself  the whole affair loomed large to him and he magnified it and mapped it out  he enjoyed his occupation of the big dim hollow theatre full of the echoes of effect and of a queer smell of gas and successit all seemed such a passive canvas for his picture  for the first time in his life he was in command of resources he was acquainted with the phrase but had never thought he should know the feeling  he was surprised at what loder appeared ready to do though he reminded himself that he must never show it  he foresaw that there would be two distinct concomitants to the artistic effort of producing a play one consisting of a great deal of anguish and the other of a great deal of amusement  he looked back upon the reading afterwards as the best hour in the business because it was then that the piece had most struck him as represented  what came later was the doing of others but this with its imperfections and failures was all his own  the drama lived at any rate for that hour with an intensity that it was promptly to lose in the poverty and patchiness of rehearsal he could see its life reflected in a way that was sweet to him in the stillness of the little semicircle of attentive and inscrutable of waterproofed and muddybooted actors  miss violet grey was the auditor he had most to say to and he tried on the spot across the shabby stage to let her have the soul of her part  her attitude was graceful but though she appeared to listen with all her faculties her face remained perfectly blank a fact however not discouraging to wayworth who liked her better for not being premature  her companions gave discernible signs of recognising the passages of comedy yet wayworth forgave her even then for being inexpressive  she evidently wished before everything else to be simply sure of what it was all about  he was more surprised even than at the revelation of the scale on which mr loder was ready to proceed by the discovery that some of the actors didnt like their parts and his heart sank as he asked himself what he could possibly do with them if they were going to be so stupid  this was the first of his disappointments somehow he had expected every individual to become instantly and gratefully conscious of a rare opportunity and from the moment such a calculation failed he was at sea or mindful at any rate that more disappointments would come  it was impossible to make out what the manager liked or disliked no judgment no comment escaped him his acceptance of the play and his views about the way it should be mounted had apparently converted him into a veiled and shrouded figure  wayworth was able to grasp the idea that they would all move now in a higher and sharper air than that of compliment and confidence  when he talked with violet grey after the reading he gathered that she was really rather crude  what better proof of it could there be than her failure to break out instantly with an expression of delight about her great chance  this reserve however had evidently nothing to do with high pretensions she had no wish to make him feel that a person of her eminence was superior to easy raptures  he guessed after a little that she was puzzled and even somewhat frightenedto a certain extent she had not understood nothing could appeal to him more than the opportunity to clear up her difficulties in the course of the examination of which he quickly discovered that so far as she had understood she had understood wrong  if she was crude it was only a reason the more for talking to her he kept saying to her ask meask me  ask me everything you can think of  she asked him she was perpetually asking him and at the first rehearsals which were without form and void to a degree that made them strike him much more as the death of an experiment than as the dawn of a success they threshed things out immensely in a corner of the stage with the effect of his coming to feel that at any rate she was in earnest  he felt more and more that his heroine was the keystone of his arch for which indeed the actress was very ready to take her  but when he reminded this young lady of the way the whole thing practically depended on her she was alarmed and even slightly scandalised  she spoke more than once as if that could scarcely be the right way to construct a playmake it stand or fall by one poor nervous girl  she was almost morbidly conscientious and in theory he liked her for this though he lost patience three or four times with the things she couldnt do and the things she could  at such times the tears came to her eyes but they were produced by her own stupidity she hastened to assure him not by the way he spoke which was awfully kind under the circumstances  her sincerity made her beautiful and he wished to heaven and made a point of telling her so that she could sprinkle a little of it over nona  once however she was so touched and troubled that the sight of it brought the tears for an instant to his own eyes and it so happened that turning at this moment he found himself face to face with mr loder the manager stared glanced at the actress who turned in the other direction and then smiling at wayworth exclaimed with the humour of a man who heard the gallery laugh every night  i sayi say  whats the matter wayworth asked  im glad to see miss grey is taking such pains with you  oh yesshell turn me out said the young man gaily  he was quite aware that it was apparent he was not superficial about nona and abundantly determined into the bargain that the rehearsal of the piece should not sacrifice a shade of thoroughness to any extrinsic consideration  mrs alsager whom late in the afternoon he used often to go and ask for a cup of tea thanking her in advance for the rest she gave him and telling her how he found that rehearsal as they were doing itit was a caution took it out of onemrs alsager more and more his good genius and as he repeatedly assured her his ministering angel confirmed him in this superior policy and urged him on to every form of artistic devotion  she had naturally never been more interested than now in his work she wanted to hear everything about everything  she treated him as heroically fatigued plied him with luxurious restoratives made him stretch himself on cushions and roseleaves  they gossipped more than ever by her fire about the artistic life he confided to her for instance all his hopes and fears all his experiments and anxieties on the subject of the representative of nona  she was immensely interested in this young lady and showed it by taking a box again and again she had seen her halfadozen times already to study her capacity through the veil of her present part  like allan wayworth she found her encouraging only by fits for she had fine flashes of badness she was intelligent but she cried aloud for training and the training was so absent that the intelligence had only a fraction of its effect  she was like a knife without an edgegood steel that had never been sharpened she hacked away at her hard dramatic loaf she couldnt cut it smooth    chapter ii    certainly my leading lady wont make nona much like you wayworth one day gloomily remarked to mrs alsager  there were days when the prospect seemed to him awful  so much the better  theres no necessity for that  i wish youd train her a littleyou could so easily the young man went on in response to which mrs alsager requested him not to make such cruel fun of her  but she was curious about the girl wanted to hear of her character her private situation how she lived and where seemed indeed desirous to befriend her  wayworth might not have known much about the private situation of miss violet grey but as it happened he was able by the time his play had been three weeks in rehearsal to supply information on such points  she was a charming exemplary person educated cultivated with highly modern tastes an excellent musician  she had lost her parents and was very much alone in the world her only two relations being a sister who was married to a civil servant in a highly responsible post in india and a dear little oldfashioned aunt really a greataunt with whom she lived at notting hill who wrote childrens books and who it appeared had once written a christmas pantomime  it was quite an artistic homenot on the scale of mrs alsagers to compare the smallest things with the greatest but intensely refined and honourable  wayworth went so far as to hint that it would be rather nice and human on mrs alsagers part to go therethey would take it so kindly if she should call on them  she had acted so often on his hints that he had formed a pleasant habit of expecting it  it made him feel so wisely responsible about giving them  but this one appeared to fall to the ground so that he let the subject drop mrs alsager however went yet once more to the legitimate as he found by her saying to him abruptly on the morrow  oh shell be very goodshell be very good  when they said she in these days they always meant violet grey though they pretended for the most part that they meant nona vincent  oh yes wayworth assented she wants so to  mrs alsager was silent a moment then she asked a little inconsequently as if she had come back from a reverie  does she want to very much  tremendouslyand it appears she has been fascinated by the part from the first  why then didnt she say so  oh because shes so funny  she is funny said mrs alsager musingly and presently she added shes in love with you  wayworth stared blushed very red then laughed out  what is there funny in that he demanded but before his interlocutress could satisfy him on this point he inquired further how she knew anything about it  after a little graceful evasion she explained that the night before at the legitimate mrs beaumont the wife of the actormanager had paid her a visit in her box which had happened in the course of their brief gossip to lead to her remarking that she had never been behind  mrs beaumont offered on the spot to take her round and the fancy had seized her to accept the invitation  she had been amused for the moment and in this way it befell that her conductress at her request had introduced her to miss violet grey who was waiting in the wing for one of her scenes mrs beaumont had been called away for three minutes and during this scrap of time face to face with the actress she had discovered the poor girls secret  wayworth qualified it as a senseless thing but wished to know what had led to the discovery  she characterised this inquiry as superficial for a painter of the ways of women and he doubtless didnt improve it by remarking profanely that a cat might look at a king and that such things were convenient to know  even on this ground however he was threatened by mrs alsager who contended that it might not be a joking matter to the poor girl  to this wayworth who now professed to hate talking about the passions he might have inspired could only reply that he meant it couldnt make a difference to mrs alsager  how in the world do you know what makes a difference to me this lady asked with incongruous coldness with a haughtiness indeed remarkable in so gentle a spirit  he saw violet grey that night at the theatre and it was she who spoke first of her having lately met a friend of his  shes in love with you the actress said after he had made a show of ignorance doesnt that tell you anything  he blushed redder still than mrs alsager had made him blush but replied quickly enough and very adequately that hundreds of women were naturally dying for him  oh i dont care for youre not in love with her the girl continued  did she tell you that too wayworth asked but she had at that moment to go on  standing where he could see her he thought that on this occasion she threw into her scene which was the best she had in the play a brighter art than ever before a talent that could play with its problem  she was perpetually doing things out of rehearsal she did two or three tonight in the other mans piece that he as often wished to heaven nona vincent might have the benefit of  she appeared to be able to do them for every one but himthat is for every one but nona  he was conscious in these days of an odd new feeling which mixed this was a part of its oddity with a very natural and comparatively old one and which in its most definite form was a dull ache of regret that this young ladys unlucky star should have placed her on the stage  he wished in his worst uneasiness that without going further she would give it up and yet it soothed that uneasiness to remind himself that he saw grounds to hope she would go far enough to make a marked success of nona  there were strange and painful moments when as the interpretress of nona he almost hated her after which however he always assured himself that he exaggerated inasmuch as what made this aversion seem great when he was nervous was simply its contrast with the growing sense that there were groundstotally differenton which she pleased him she pleased him as a charming creatureby her sincerities and her perversities by the varieties and surprises of her character and by certain happy facts of her person  in private her eyes were sad to him and her voice was rare  he detested the idea that she should have a disappointment or an humiliation and he wanted to rescue her altogether to save and transplant her  one way to save her was to see to it to the best of his ability that the production of his play should be a triumph and the other wayit was really too queer to expresswas almost to wish that it shouldnt be  then for the future there would be safety and peace and not the peace of death the peace of a different life  it is to be added that our young man clung to the former of these ways in proportion as the latter perversely tempted him  he was nervous at the best increasingly and intolerably nervous but the immediate remedy was to rehearse harder and harder and above all to work it out with violet grey  some of her comrades reproached him with working it out only with her as if she were the whole affair to which he replied that they could afford to be neglected they were all so tremendously good  she was the only person concerned whom he didnt flatter  the author and the actress stuck so to the business in hand that she had very little time to speak to him again of mrs alsager of whom indeed her imagination appeared adequately to have disposed wayworth once remarked to her that nona vincent was supposed to be a good deal like his charming friend but she gave a blank supposed by whom in consequence of which he never returned to the subject  he confided his nervousness as freely as usual to mrs alsager who easily understood that he had a peculiar complication of anxieties his suspense varied in degree from hour to hour but any relief there might have been in this was made up for by its being of several different kinds  one afternoon as the first performance drew near mrs alsager said to him in giving him his cup of tea and on his having mentioned that he had not closed his eyes the night before  you must indeed be in a dreadful state  anxiety for another is still worse than anxiety for ones self  for another wayworth repeated looking at her over the rim of his cup  my poor friend youre nervous about nona vincent but youre infinitely more nervous about violet grey  she is nona vincent  no she isntnot a bit said mrs alsager abruptly  do you really think so wayworth cried spilling his tea in his alarm  what i think doesnt signifyi mean what i think about that  what i meant to say was that great as is your suspense about your play your suspense about your actress is greater still  i can only repeat that my actress is my play  mrs alsager looked thoughtfully into the teapot  your actress is your  my what the young man asked with a little tremor in his voice as his hostess paused  your very dear friend  youre in love with herat present  and with a sharp click mrs alsager dropped the lid on the fragrant receptacle  not yetnot yet laughed her visitor  you will be if she pulls you through  you declare that she wont pull me through  mrs alsager was silent a moment after which she softly murmured ill pray for her  youre the most generous of women wayworth cried then coloured as if the words had not been happy  they would have done indeed little honour to a man of tact  the next morning he received five hurried lines from mrs alsager she had suddenly been called to torquay to see a relation who was seriously ill she should be detained there several days but she had an earnest hope of being able to return in time for his first night in any event he had her unrestricted good wishes  he missed her extremely for these last days were a great strain and there was little comfort to be derived from violet grey  she was even more nervous than himself and so pale and altered that he was afraid she would be too ill to act  it was settled between them that they made each other worse and that he had now much better leave her alone they had pulled nona so to pieces that nothing seemed left of her she must at least have time to grow together again  he left violet grey alone to the best of his ability but she carried out imperfectly her own side of the bargain  she came to him with new questionsshe waited for him with old doubts and half an hour before the last dressrehearsal on the eve of production she proposed to him a totally fresh rendering of his heroine  this incident gave him such a sense of insecurity that he turned his back on her without a word bolted out of the theatre dashed along the strand and walked as far as the bank  then he jumped into a hansom and came westward and when he reached the theatre again the business was nearly over  it appeared almost to his disappointment not bad enough to give him the consolation of the old playhouse adage that the worst dressrehearsals make the best first nights  the morrow which was a wednesday was the dreadful day the theatre had been closed on the monday and the tuesday  every one on the wednesday did his best to let every one else alone and every one signally failed in the attempt  the day till seven oclock was understood to be consecrated to rest but every one except violet grey turned up at the theatre  wayworth looked at mr loder and mr loder looked in another direction which was as near as they came to conversation  wayworth was in a fidget unable to eat or sleep or sit still at times almost in terror  he kept quiet by keeping as usual in motion he tried to walk away from his nervousness  he walked in the afternoon toward notting hill but he succeeded in not breaking the vow he had taken not to meddle with his actress  she was like an acrobat poised on a slippery ballif he should touch her she would topple over  he passed her door three times and he thought of her three hundred  this was the hour at which he most regretted that mrs alsager had not come backfor he had called at her house only to learn that she was still at torquay  this was probably queer and it was probably queerer still that she hadnt written to him but even of these things he wasnt sure for in losing as he had now completely lost his judgment of his play he seemed to himself to have lost his judgment of everything  when he went home however he found a telegram from the lady of grosvenor placeshall be able to comereach town by seven  at halfpast eight oclock through a little aperture in the curtain of the renaissance he saw her in her box with a cluster of friendscompletely beautiful and beneficent  the house was magnificenttoo good for his play he felt too good for any play  everything now seemed too goodthe scenery the furniture the dresses the very programmes  he seized upon the idea that this was probably what was the matter with the representative of nonashe was only too good  he had completely arranged with this young lady the plan of their relations during the evening and though they had altered everything else that they had arranged they had promised each other not to alter this  it was wonderful the number of things they had promised each other  he would start her he would see her offthen he would quit the theatre and stay away till just before the end  she besought him to stay awayit would make her infinitely easier  he saw that she was exquisitely dressedshe had made one or two changes for the better since the night before and that seemed something definite to turn over and over in his mind as he rumbled foggily home in the four wheeler in which a few steps from the stagedoor he had taken refuge as soon as he knew that the curtain was up  he lived a couple of miles off and he had chosen a fourwheeler to drag out the time  when he got home his fire was out his room was cold and he lay down on his sofa in his overcoat  he had sent his landlady to the dress circle on purpose she would overflow with words and mistakes  the house seemed a black void just as the streets had doneevery one was formidably at his play  he was quieter at last than he had been for a fortnight and he felt too weak even to wonder how the thing was going  he believed afterwards that he had slept an hour but even if he had he felt it to be still too early to return to the theatre  he sat down by his lamp and tried to readto read a little compendious life of a great english statesman out of a series  it struck him as brilliantly clever and he asked himself whether that perhaps were not rather the sort of thing he ought to have taken up not the statesmanship but the art of brief biography  suddenly he became aware that he must hurry if he was to reach the theatre at allit was a quarter to eleven oclock  he scrambled out and this time found a hansomhe had lately spent enough money in cabs to add to his hope that the profits of his new profession would be great his anxiety his suspense flamed up again and as he rattled eastwardhe went fast nowhe was almost sick with alternations  as he passed into the theatre the first mansome underlingwho met him cried to him breathlessly  youre wanted siryoure wanted  he thought his tone very ominoushe devoured the mans eyes with his own for a betrayal did he mean that he was wanted for execution  some one else pressed him almost pushed him forward he was already on the stage  then he became conscious of a sound more or less continuous but seemingly faint and far which he took at first for the voice of the actors heard through their canvas walls the beautiful builtin room of the last act  but the actors were in the wing they surrounded him the curtain was down and they were coming off from before it  they had been called and he was calledthey all greeted him with go ongo on  he was terrifiedhe couldnt go onhe didnt believe in the applause which seemed to him only audible enough to sound half hearted  has it gonehas it gone he gasped to the people round him and he heard them say ratherrather perfunctorily mendaciously too as it struck him and even with mocking laughter the laughter of defeat and despair  suddenly though all this must have taken but a moment loder burst upon him from somewhere with a for gods sake dont keep them or theyll stop  but i cant go on for that wayworth cried in anguish the sound seemed to him already to have ceased  loder had hold of him and was shoving him he resisted and looked round frantically for violet grey who perhaps would tell him the truth  there was by this time a crowd in the wing all with strange grimacing painted faces but violet was not among them and her very absence frightened him  he uttered her name with an accent that he afterwards regrettedit gave them as he thought both away and while loder hustled him before the curtain he heard some one say she took her call and disappeared  she had had a call thenthis was what was most present to the young man as he stood for an instant in the glare of the footlights looking blindly at the great vaguely peopled horseshoe and greeted with plaudits which now seemed to him at once louder than he deserved and feebler than he desired  they sank to rest quickly but he felt it to be long before he could back away before he could in his turn seize the manager by the arm and cry huskilyhas it really gonereally  mr loder looked at him hard and replied after an instant  the plays all right  wayworth hung upon his lips  then whats all wrong  we must do something to miss grey  whats the matter with her  she isnt in it  do you mean she has failed  yes damn itshe has failed  wayworth stared  then how can the play be all right  oh well save itwell save it  wheres miss greywhere is she the young man asked  loder caught his arm as he was turning away again to look for his heroine  never mind her nowshe knows it  wayworth was approached at the same moment by a gentleman he knew as one of mrs alsagers friendshe had perceived him in that ladys box  mrs alsager was waiting there for the successful author she desired very earnestly that he would come round and speak to her wayworth assured himself first that violet had left the theatreone of the actresses could tell him that she had seen her throw on a cloak without changing her dress and had learnt afterwards that she had the next moment flung herself after flinging her aunt into a cab  he had wished to invite half a dozen persons of whom miss grey and her elderly relative were two to come home to supper with him but she had refused to make any engagement beforehand it would be so dreadful to have to keep it if she shouldnt have made a hit and this attitude had blighted the pleasant plan which fell to the ground  he had called her morbid but she was immovable  mrs alsagers messenger let him know that he was expected to supper in grosvenor place and half an hour afterwards he was seated there among complimentary people and flowers and popping corks eating the first orderly meal he had partaken of for a week  mrs alsager had carried him off in her broughamthe other people who were coming got into things of their own  he stopped her short as soon as she began to tell him how tremendously every one had been struck by the piece he nailed her down to the question of violet grey  had she spoilt the play had she jeopardised or compromised ithad she been utterly bad had she been good in any degree  certainly the performance would have seemed better if she had been better mrs alsager confessed  and the play would have seemed better if the performance had been better wayworth said gloomily from the corner of the brougham  she does what she can and she has talent and she looked lovely but she doesnt see nona vincent  she doesnt see the typeshe doesnt see the individualshe doesnt see the woman you meant shes out of itshe gives you a different person  oh the woman i meant the young man exclaimed looking at the london lamps as he rolled by them  i wish to god she had known you he added as the carriage stopped  after they had passed into the house he said to his companion  you see she wont pull me through  forgive herbe kind to her mrs alsager pleaded  i shall only thank her  the play may go to the dogs  if it doesif it does mrs alsager began with her pure eyes on him  well what if it does  she couldnt tell him for the rest of her guests came in together she only had time to say  it shant go to the dogs  he came away before the others restless with the desire to go to notting hill even that night late as it was haunted with the sense that violet grey had measured her fall  when he got into the street however he allowed second thoughts to counsel another course the effect of knocking her up at two oclock in the morning would hardly be to soothe her  he looked at six newspapers the next day and found in them never a good word for her  they were well enough about the piece but they were unanimous as to the disappointment caused by the young actress whose former efforts had excited such hopes and on whom on this occasion such pressing responsibilities rested  they asked in chorus what was the matter with her and they declared in chorus that the play which was not without promise was handicapped they all used the same word by the odd want of correspondence between the heroine and her interpreter  wayworth drove early to notting hill but he didnt take the newspapers with him violet grey could be trusted to have sent out for them by the peep of dawn and to have fed her anguish full  she declined to see himshe only sent down word by her aunt that she was extremely unwell and should be unable to act that night unless she were suffered to spend the day unmolested and in bed  wayworth sat for an hour with the old lady who understood everything and to whom he could speak frankly  she gave him a touching picture of her nieces condition which was all the more vivid for the simple words in which it was expressed  she feels she isnt right you knowshe feels she isnt right  tell her it doesnt matterit doesnt matter a straw said wayworth  and shes so proudyou know how proud she is the old lady went on  tell her im more than satisfied that i accept her gratefully as she is  she says she injures your play that she ruins it said his interlocutress  shell improve immenselyshell grow into the part the young man continued  shed improve if she knew howbut she says she doesnt  she has given all she has got and she doesnt know whats wanted  whats wanted is simply that she should go straight on and trust me  how can she trust you when she feels shes losing you  losing me wayworth cried  youll never forgive her if your play is taken off  it will run six months said the author of the piece  the old lady laid her hand on his arm  what will you do for her if it does  he looked at violet greys aunt a moment  do you say your niece is very proud  too proud for her dreadful profession  then she wouldnt wish you to ask me that wayworth answered getting up  when he reached home he was very tired and for a person to whom it was open to consider that he had scored a success he spent a remarkably dismal day  all his restlessness had gone and fatigue and depression possessed him  he sank into his old chair by the fire and sat there for hours with his eyes closed  his landlady came in to bring his luncheon and mend the fire but he feigned to be asleep so as not to be spoken to  it is to be supposed that sleep at last overtook him for about the hour that dusk began to gather he had an extraordinary impression a visit that it would seem could have belonged to no waking consciousness  nona vincent in face and form the living heroine of his play rose before him in his little silent room sat down with him at his dingy fireside  she was not violet grey she was not mrs alsager she was not any woman he had seen upon earth nor was it any masquerade of friendship or of penitence yet she was more familiar to him than the women he had known best and she was ineffably beautiful and consoling  she filled the poor room with her presence the effect of which was as soothing as some odour of incense  she was as quiet as an affectionate sister and there was no surprise in her being there  nothing more real had ever befallen him and nothing somehow more reassuring  he felt her hand rest upon his own and all his senses seemed to open to her message  she struck him in the strangest way both as his creation and as his inspirer and she gave him the happiest consciousness of success  if she was so charming in the red firelight in her vague clearcoloured garments it was because he had made her so and yet if the weight seemed lifted from his spirit it was because she drew it away  when she bent her deep eyes upon him they seemed to speak of safety and freedom and to make a green garden of the future  from time to time she smiled and said  i livei livei live  how long she stayed he couldnt have told but when his landlady blundered in with the lamp nona vincent was no longer there  he rubbed his eyes but no dream had ever been so intense and as he slowly got out of his chair it was with a deep still joythe joy of the artistin the thought of how right he had been how exactly like herself he had made her  she had come to show him that  at the end of five minutes however he felt sufficiently mystified to call his landlady backhe wanted to ask her a question  when the good woman reappeared the question hung fire an instant then it shaped itself as the inquiry  has any lady been here  no sirno lady at all  the woman seemed slightly scandalised  not miss vincent  miss vincent sir  the young lady of my play dont you know  oh sir you mean miss violet grey  no i dont at all  i think i mean mrs alsager  there has been no mrs alsager sir  nor anybody at all like her  the woman looked at him as if she wondered what had suddenly taken him  then she asked in an injured tone  why shouldnt i have told you if youd ad callers sir  i thought you might have thought i was asleep  indeed you were sir when i came in with the lampand well youd earned it mr wayworth  the landlady came back an hour later to bring him a telegram it was just as he had begun to dress to dine at his club and go down to the theatre  see me tonight in front and dont come near me till its over  it was in these words that violet communicated her wishes for the evening  he obeyed them to the letter he watched her from the depths of a box  he was in no position to say how she might have struck him the night before but what he saw during these charmed hours filled him with admiration and gratitude  she was in it this time she had pulled herself together she had taken possession she was felicitous at every turn  fresh from his revelation of nona he was in a position to judge and as he judged he exulted  he was thrilled and carried away and he was moreover intensely curious to know what had happened to her by what unfathomable art she had managed in a few hours to effect such a change of base  it was as if she had had a revelation of nona so convincing a clearness had been breathed upon the picture  he kept himself quiet in the entractes he would speak to her only at the end but before the play was half over the manager burst into his box  its prodigious what shes up to cried mr loder almost more bewildered than gratified  she has gone in for a new readinga blessed somersault in the air  is it quite different wayworth asked sharing his mystification  different  hyperion to a satyr  its devilish good my boy  its devilish good said wayworth and its in a different key altogether from the key of her rehearsal  ill run you six months the manager declared and he rushed round again to the actress leaving wayworth with a sense that she had already pulled him through  she had with the audience an immense personal success  when he went behind at the end he had to wait for her she only showed herself when she was ready to leave the theatre  her aunt had been in her dressingroom with her and the two ladies appeared together  the girl passed him quickly motioning him to say nothing till they should have got out of the place  he saw that she was immensely excited lifted altogether above her common artistic level the old lady said to him  you must come home to supper with us  it has been all arranged  they had a brougham with a little third seat and he got into it with them  it was a long time before the actress would speak  she leaned back in her corner giving no sign but still heaving a little like a subsiding sea and with all her triumph in the eyes that shone through the darkness  the old lady was hushed to awe or at least to discretion and wayworth was happy enough to wait  he had really to wait till they had alighted at notting hill where the elder of his companions went to see that supper had been attended to  i was betteri was better said violet grey throwing off her cloak in the little drawingroom  you were perfection  youll be like that every night wont you  she smiled at him  every night  there can scarcely be a miracle every day  what do you mean by a miracle  ive had a revelation  wayward stared  at what hour  the right hourthis afternoon  just in time to save meand to save you  at five oclock  do you mean you had a visit  she came to meshe stayed two hours  two hours  nona vincent  mrs alsager  violet grey smiled more deeply  its the same thing  and how did mrs alsager save you  by letting me look at her  by letting me hear her speak  by letting me know her  and what did she say to you  kind thingsencouraging intelligent things  ah the dear woman wayworth cried  you ought to like hershe likes you  she was just what i wanted the actress added  do you mean she talked to you about nona  she said you thought she was like her  she isshes exquisite  shes exquisite wayworth repeated  do you mean she tried to coach you  oh noshe only said she would be so glad if it would help me to see her  and i felt it did help me  i dont know what took place she only sat there and she held my hand and smiled at me and she had tact and grace and she had goodness and beauty and she soothed my nerves and lighted up my imagination  somehow she seemed to give it all to me  i took iti took it  i kept her before me i drank her in  for the first time in the whole study of the part i had my modeli could make my copy  all my courage came back to me and other things came that i hadnt felt before  she was differentshe was delightful as ive said she was a revelation  she kissed me when she went awayand you may guess if i kissed her  we were awfully affectionate but its you she likes said violet grey  wayworth had never been more interested in his life and he had rarely been more mystified  did she wear vague clearcoloured garments he asked after a moment  violet grey stared laughed then bade him go in to supper  you know how she dresses  he was very well pleased at supper but he was silent and a little solemn  he said he would go to see mrs alsager the next day  he did so but he was told at her door that she had returned to torquay she remained there all winter all spring and the next time he saw her his play had run two hundred nights and he had married violet grey  his plays sometimes succeed but his wife is not in them now nor in any others  at these representations mrs alsager continues frequently to be present
