complete story in itself but forms the second volume in a line issued under the general title of dave porter series  in the first volume of this series called dave porter at oak hall i introduced a typical american boy and gave something of his haps and mishaps at an american boarding school of today at this school dave made a number of warm friends and also a few enemies and was the means of bringing one weak and misguided youth to a realization of his better self dave was poor and had to fight his way to the front and this was not accomplished until he had shown those around him what a truly straightforward and manly fellow he was  the one great cloud over daves life was the question of his parentage he had been raised by those who knew practically nothing of his past and when he thought that he saw a chance to learn something about himself he embraced that opportunity eagerly even though it necessitated a long trip to the south seas and a search among strange islands and still stranger natives dave makes the trip in a vessel belonging to the father of one of his school chums and is accompanied by several of his friends not a few perils are encountered and what the boys do under such circumstances i leave for the pages that follow to tell  in penning this tale i have had a twofold object in view first to give my young readers a view of a long ocean trip and let them learn something of the numerous islands which dot the south seas and in the second place to aid in teaching that old truththat what is worth having is worth working for  again i thank the many thousands of boys and girls and older persons too who have shown their appreciation of my efforts to amuse and instruct them i can only add as i have done before that i sincerely trust that this volume fulfills their every reasonable expectation                                     edward stratemeyer      april 10 1906     contents     chapter                                        page    i

come about seven thousand miles to see you      274     dave porter in the south seas     chapter i  the boys of oak hall   hello dave where are you bound  for the river phil i am going out for a row want to come along  that suits me answered phil lawrence throwing down the astronomy he had been studying but i cant stay out late he added reaching for his cap got two examples in algebra to do have you finished up  yes answered dave porter they are not so hard  and your latin  thats done too  phil lawrence eyed the boy before him admiringly dave i dont see how you manage it youre always on deck for fun and yet you scarcely miss a lesson let me into the secret wont you  thats right dave pull the cover off clean and clear came from a youth who had just entered the school dormitory if i can get lessons without studying  oh roger you know better than that burst out dave porter with a smile of course i have to studyjust the same as anybody but when i study i study and when i play i play ive found out that it doesnt pay to mix the two upit is best to buckle your mind down to the thing on hand and to nothing else  thats the talk came from a boy resting on one of the beds it puts me in mind of a story i once heard about a fellow who fell from the roof of a house to the ground  there goes shadow again cried roger morr shadow will you ever get done telling chestnuts  this isnt a chestnut and i havent told it over twice in my life the man fell to the ground past an open window as he was going down he grabbed another man at the window by the hair the hairit was a wigcame off say yells the man at the window leave me alone if you want to fall tend to business and fall and a smile passed around among the assembled schoolboys  perhaps roger would like to come along continued dave i was going out for a row and phil said he would go too he explained  that suits me answered roger morr it will give us an appetite for supper  what about you shadow and dave turned to the youth on the bed  maurice hamilton shook his head slightly not today i am going to take a nap if i can get it remember i was up half the night  so he was affirmed phil lawrence but he hasnt said what it was about  not much growled the boy called shadow he was very tall and very thin hence the nickname turning over he pretended to go to sleep  there is something wrong about shadow said dave as he and his two companions left the school building and hurried for the river at the back of the grounds he has not been himself at all today  i think he has had something to do with that bully gus plum said phil i saw them together two days ago and both were talking earnestly i dont know exactly what it was about but i know shadow has been very much disturbed ever since  well the best he can do is to leave plum alone returned dave decidedly i can tell you fellows that chap is not to be trusted you know that as well as i do  of course we know it said roger morr didnt i warn you against gus plum before you ever came to oak hall and now that chip macklin has turned over a new leaf and refused to be plums toady any longer the bully is worse than ever only yesterday buster beggs caught him back of the gym abusing one of the little fellows buster is generally too lazy to rouse up but he said it made him mad and he told plum to stop or it would be the worse for him and plum went off grumbling  its a great pity plum cant reform like macklin i declare chip is getting to be quite a decent sort now  its not in plum to reform exclaimed phil lawrence if i were doctor clay id get rid of him why such a chap can keep a whole school in hot water  somebody said that plums father had lost a good bit of his money observed roger morr if that is so it must be a bitter pill for gus to swallow  well i wouldnt taunt him with it if its true replied dave quickly  oh i shant say a wordalthough he deserves to have it rubbed in for the way he treated you dave  yes that was a jolly shame commented phil it makes me angry every time i think of it  i am willing to let bygones be bygones said dave with a little smile as it was it only showed me who my true friends were and are i can afford to get along without the others  and especially after we waxed plum and his crowd at baseball and then won our great victory over the rockville boys said roger oh but wasnt that a dandy victory and didnt we have a dandy celebration afterwards  and do you remember the big cannon cracker we set off in the courtyard daves eyes began to twinkle i heard afterwards that pop swingly the janitor was scared almost to death he thought somebody was trying to blow up the building  yes and job haskers said if he could catch the fellow who phil broke off short here comes gus plum now he whispered  the others looked up and saw coming toward them across the school grounds a tall broadshouldered individual loudly dressed and with a shock of uncombed hair and a cap set over on one ear  hello plum said dave pleasantly while his two companions nodded to the newcomer  hello yourself came shortly from gus plum hold up a minute he went on planting himself in front of the three  whats wanted questioned phil in a little surprise  i want to know if shadow hamilton has been saying anything about me to you growled the bully of oak hall  i havent heard anything answered phil while dave and roger shook their heads  humph he had better not muttered plum with a scowl if he does the bully did not finish  i hope there is no more trouble in the air was daves comment  there will be trouble if hamilton opens his trap i wont allow anybody in this school to talk about me and all of you had better understand it and the bully glared at the others defiantly  i am sure i dont know what you are talking about said dave i havent said anything about you  and you havent heard anything inquired gus plum with a look of keen anxiety showing on his coarse face  ive heard some roundabout story about your father losing money said roger before dave could answer if it is true i am sorry for you gus  bah i dont want your sympathy did hamilton tell you that story  no  i suppose you are spreading it right and left eh making me out to be a pauper like your friend porter eh continued gus plum working himself up into a magnificent condition of illhumor  i am not spreading it right and left answered roger quietly  and i am not a pauper plum exclaimed dave with flashing eyes i thought we had settled that difference of opinion long ago if you are going to open it up again  oh dont mind what he says dave broke in phil catching his chum by the arm you know nobody in the school pays attention to him  i wont let any of you run me down roared gus plum now just you remember that if any of you say a word about me or my father ill make it so hot for you that youll wish you had never been born my father has lost a little money but it aint a fleabite to what he is worth and i want everybody in this school to know it  and i want you to know that you cannot continue to insult me blazed out dave i am not as rich as most of the boys here but  he is just as good as any of us plum remember that finished phil it is an outrage for you to refer to dave as a pauper  well didnt he come from the poorhouse and aint he a nobody sneered the bully  he is a better fellow than you will ever be plum said roger warmly he and phil were both holding dave back dont listen to him dave  yes but fellows daves face was white and he trembled all over  i know it cuts you whispered roger but plum is aa brute dont waste your breath on him  ho so i am a brute am i blustered the big bully clenching his fists  yes you are answered roger boldly any fellow with a spark of goodness and honor in him would not speak to dave as you have done it simply shows up your own lowmindedness plum  dont you preach shouted the bully say another word and illill  we are not afraid of you said phil firmly weve told you that before we intend to leave you alone and the best thing you can do is to leave us alone  bah i know you and you cant fool me you say one thing to my face and another behind my back but dont you dare to say too much and you can tell shadow hamilton not to say too much either if you dowell there will be war thats alland all of you will get what you dont want and with this threat gus plum hurried around a corner of the school building and out of sight  what a cad murmured phil  he is worked up no disputing that was rogers comment he acts as if he was afraid something was being told that he wished to keep a secret  the hot blood had rushed to daves face and he was still trembling  i wish i had knocked him down he said in a low tone  what good would it have done returned roger it would only get you into trouble with the doctor and that is just what plum would like when it comes to a standing in the class he knows he hasnt as much to lose as you have he is almost at the bottom already while you are close to the top  but roger he saidoh i cant bear to think about it i suppose he blabs it to everybody too and they will think  dont give it another thought dave said phil soothingly and he turned his chum toward the river again dismiss plum and all his meanness from your mind  i wish i could answered dave and his voice had a great deal of seriousness in it     chapter ii  a glimpse of the past   as the three boys hurried to the river dave porter felt that all his anticipated sport for that afternoon had been spoiled he had been brought face to face once more with the one dark spot in his history and his heart was filled with a bitterness which his two loyal chums could scarcely comprehend  dave was indeed a poorhouse boy and of unknown parentage when but a few years of age he had been found one evening in the summer wandering close to the railroad tracks just outside of the village of crumville how he was found by some farm hands and taken to a house and fed and cared for otherwise has already been related in the first volume of this series entitled dave porter at oak hall  at first every effort to learn his identity was made but this failing he was turned over to the poorhouse authorities he said his name was dave or davy and sometimes added porter and then dundun and from this he was called dave portera name which suited him very well  dave remained at the poorhouse until he was about nine years old when he was taken out of that institution by a brokendown college professor named caspar potts who had turned farmer he remained with the old professor for several years and a warm friendship sprang up between the pair caspar potts gave dave a fair education and in return the boy did all he could for the old man who was not in the best of health and rather eccentric at times  unfortunately for professor potts there was in the neighborhood a hardhearted moneylender named aaron poole who had a mortgage on the old educators farm the moneylender had a son named nat who was a flippant youth and this boy had trouble with dave then the moneylender would have sold out the old professor had not aid come opportunely from a most unexpected quarter  in this volume it is unnecessary to go into the details of how dave became acquainted with mr oliver wadsworth a rich manufacturer of the neighborhood and how the boy saved jessie wadsworth from being burned to death when the gasoline tank of an automobile exploded and enveloped the young miss in flames for this service the wadsworths were all more than grateful and when dave told his story oliver wadsworth made the discovery that caspar potts was one of the professors under whom he had studied in his college days  i must meet him and talk this over said the rich manufacturer and the upshot of the matter was that the professor and dave were invited to dine at the wadsworth mansion  this dinner proved a turning point in the life of the poorhouse youth mr wadsworth had lost a son by death and dave reminded him strongly of his boy it was arranged that caspar potts should come to live at the wadsworth mansion and that dave should be sent to some firstclass boarding school the manufacturer agreeing to pay all bills because of the boys bravery in behalf of jessie  oak hall was the school selected a fine institution located not far from the village of oakdale the school was surrounded by oaks which partly shaded a beautiful campus and the grounds which were on a slight hill sloped down in the rear to the leming river  daves heart beat high when he started off for oak hall and he had a curious experience before he reached that institution the house of a senator morr was robbed and the boy met the robber on the train and after a good deal of trouble managed to recover a valise containing a large share of the stolen goods this threw dave into the company of roger morr the senators son and the two became warm friends roger was on his way to oak hall and it was through him that dave became acquainted with phil lawrencereckoned by many the leader of the academy maurice hamilton generally called shadow sam day joseph beggswho always went by the name of buster because he was so fatand a number of others in crumville dave had had one boy friend ben basswood and ben also came to oak hall and so did nat poole as flippant and loudmouthed as ever  but dave soon found out that nat poole was not half so hard to get along with as was gus plum the big bully of the hall there was a difference of opinion almost from the start and plum did all he could to annoy dave and his friends plum wanted to be a leader in baseball and in athletics generally and when he found himself outclassed he was savagely bitter  ill get square he told his toady chip macklin more than once but his plans to injure dave and his chums fell through and in the end macklin became disgusted with the bully and left him most of the boys wanted nothing to do with the boy who had been the bullys toady but dave put in a good word for him and in the end macklin was voted a pretty fair fellow after all  with the toady gone gus plum and nat poole became very thick and poole lost no opportunity of telling how dave had been raised at the poorhouse gus plum took the matter up and for a while poor dave was made miserable by those who turned their backs on him but doctor clay who presided over the academy sided with dave and so did all of the better class of students and soon the affair blew over at least for the time being but now the bully was agitating it again as we have just seen  during the winter term at oak hall one thing of importance had occurred of which some particulars must be given for it has much to do with our present tale some of the boys including dave had skated up the river to what was locally called the old castlea deserted stone dwelling standing in a wilderness of trees they had arrived at this structure just in time to view a quarrel between two menone a sleeklooking fellow and the other an elderly man dressed in the garb of a sailor the sleeklooking individual was the man who had robbed senator morrs house and just as he knocked the old sailor senseless to the ground the boys rushed in and made him a prisoner  when the old sailor came to his senses he stared at dave as if the boy were a ghost he said his name was billy dill and that he had sailed the south seas and many other portions of the briny deep he insisted that he knew dave well and wanted to know why the youth had shaved off his mustache the boys imagined that the tar was out of his head and he was removed to a hospital later on as dave was so interested in the man mr wadsworth had him taken to a private sanitarium here he lingered for awhile between life and death but at last grew better physically although his mind was sadly unbalanced and he could recall the past only in a hazy way  yet he insisted upon it over and over again that he had met dave before or if not the youth then somebody who looked exactly like him although older pressed to tell his story he said he had met this man on cavasa island in the south seas he also mentioned a crazy nurse and a lost child but could give no details going off immediately into a wild flight about the roaring of the sea in his ears and the dancing of the lighthouse beacon in his eyes  he must know something of my past dave said when he came away from visiting the old tar oh if only his mind were perfectly clear  we must wait answered oliver wadsworth who was along i think his mind will clear after awhile it is certainly clearer now than it was some months ago  the man he knows may be my father or some close relative  that may be true dave but dont raise any false hopes i should not like to see you disappointed for the world  dave knew that phil lawrences father was a shipping merchant of considerable standing owning an interest in a great number of vessels he went to phil and learned that the boy was going to take a trip to the south seas that very summer and was going to stop at cavasa island  i am going on business for my father explained phil it is something special of which he wishes the supercargo to know nothing and then he told dave all he knew of cavasa island and its two towns and their inhabitants after that dave sent a letter to both of the towns asking if there were any persons there by the name of porter or if any englishspeaking person had lost a child years ago but so far no answer had been received  of course phil wanted to know why dave was so anxious to learn about his proposed trip and in the end the poorhouse boy told his story to which his chum listened with interest  phil what would you say if i wanted to go with you on that trip to cavasa island dave had said after his story was finished  do you really mean it dave had been the return question and phils face had shown his astonishment  i doif matters turn out as i think they may  that is if that old sailor gets around so that he can tell a pretty straight story  yes  well id like your company firstrate but phil drew a deep breathid hate to see you go on a wildgoose chase think of traveling thousands of miles and then being disappointed at the end of the trip that old sailor may simply be crazy  i dont think so why should he mention a lost childa boy  well that is the only thing that makes it look as if there was something in the story but couldnt i do the looking for you  no id prefer to do that myself besides you must remember that sailor did not come directly from cavasa island to this country so whoever was on the islandi mean the person i may be interested inmay have gone elsewherein which case i should want to follow him  i see well dave do what you think is best and may good luck go with you phil had said and there the conversation on the subject had come to a close  it was not until a week later that dave had called on billy dill againto find the old tar sitting on a porch of the sanitarium smoking his pipe contentedly  on deck again my hearty had been the greeting give us your flipper and a warm handshake had followed  but the visit had been productive of little good billy dill could remember nothing clearly excepting that he knew a man who looked very much like dave and that that man had been his friend while he was stranded on cavasa island and looking for a chance to ship he said he could recall a bark named the mary sacord and a crazy nurse called polly but that was all  i had a picter o that man oncethe feller that looks like you he said but i dunno whats become o it and then he had scratched his head and gone off into a rambling mumble that meant nothing at all and dave had gone back to oak hall more mystified than ever     chapter iii  three chums on the river   down at the boathouse the three boys procured a roundbottomed rowboat and were soon on the river roger took one pair of oars and motioned to phil to let dave take the other  let him do the most of the rowingit will help him to forget his troubles he whispered and phil understood  it was a beautiful afternoon in the early summer with just the faintest breeze stirring the trees which lined the river bank on either side the boys pulled a good stroke and roger purposely kept dave at it until both were thoroughly warmed up  youre improving in your stroke remarked dave as they came to a bend in the watercourse and rested on their oars for a minute perhaps you are training for the boat races  well i shouldnt mind going into a race returned the senators son it would be lots of sport even if i didnt win  i am going into some of the field contests this summer said phil that is if they come off before i go away  when do you expect to start  i dont know yet it depends upon when one of my fathers vessels gets back to san francisco and ships her cargo  ive heard a rumor that the hall is to be shut up early this summer said dave the doctor is thinking of building an addition before the fall term begins and he wants to give the masons and carpenters as much of a show as possible  do you remember that day we were on the river and gus plum ran into us with that gasoline launch observed phil my what a mess we were in  ive had trouble with him ever since i clapped eyes on him answered dave  oh lets talk about something else cried roger no matter where we start from we always end up with gus plum and by the way do you notice how thick he is with nat poole since macklin has refused to toady to him  they are almost of a stripe roger answered dave i know nat poole thoroughly the only difference is that poole is more of a dandy when it comes to dress  poole says he is going in for athletics this summer said phil i overheard him telling luke watson so  is luke going into training  i dont think so he loves his banjo and guitar too much  well id love them too if i could play as he does returned dave  luke told me he had noticed something strange about shadow put in roger he asked me if i knew what made shadow so worried he said he hadnt heard a funny story out of him for a week and thats unusual for shadow is generally telling about a dozen a day  it is possible that he may be fixing for a regular spell of sickness was daves comment thats the way some things come on you know  the boys resumed their rowing and roger put on a burst of speed that made dave work with a will in order to keep up with him then of a sudden there came a sharp click and the senators son tumbled over backwards splashing the water in every direction  whoop look out yelled phil i dont want any showerbath did you catch a crab roger  nno i didnt spluttered the senators son when he had regained a sitting position theres the trouble and he pointed to a broken oarlock  thats too bad declared dave boys we shall have to have that fixed before we take the boat back to the boathouseor else well have to tell mr dale the man he mentioned was the first assistant instructor at the hall  let us row down to ike rasmers boathouse and see if he will sell us an oarlock suggested roger he ought to have plenty on hand  all right said phil and as both of you must be tired now ill take my turn and he motioned to dave to change seats with him while roger drew in his remaining oar  the man whom roger had mentioned was a boatman who rented out craft of various kinds his boathouse was about half a mile away but phil covered the distance with ease they found rasmer out on his little dock painting a tiny sloop a dark green  how do you do boys he called out pleasantly out for an airing  no we came down to see if you needed any painters answered dave  well i dunno what do you think of this job of mine aint it pretty slick and ike rasmer surveyed his work with evident satisfaction  its all right ike answered roger when you give up boating take to housepainting by all means  housepainting snorted the man not fer me i aint goin to fall off no slippery ladder an break my neck id rather paint signs whats that youve got a broken oarlock  yes and i want to know if youll sell me one to match  sure i will answered ike rasmer with a twinkle in his eye he threw down his paint brush and walked into his boathouse here you be my boy and he held up the parts of a broken oarlock  wellii didnt want a broken one stammered the senators son  didnt ye say you wanted one to match ho ho i reckon i cotched you that trip didnt i and the man continued to laugh and dave and phil joined in  ike must have swallowed a whetstone this morning observed dave  a whetstone queried the old boatman why  youre so awfully sharp  ho ho thats one on me sure enough the man slapped dave on the shoulder you hall boys are the cute ones aint ye well if you want a good oarlock you shall have it and he brought forth a number that roger might make his selection the senators son did so and paid for it out of his pocketmoney  we ought to pay for part of that said dave always ready to do what was fair  oh dont bother dave its only a trifle answered his chum  say some of you boys are out pretty late nights observed ike rasmer as he resumed his painting and while roger was adjusting the new oarlock to the gunwale of the hall boat  out late queried phil  yes mighty late  i havent been out for a month  nor i added dave and roger  i see that young hamilton not long agothe fellow that tells stories whenever he can get the chance and i saw gus plum too  together asked dave with sudden interest  oh no but they were out the same night  late  i should say soafter twelve oclock  what were they doing ike asked phil  rowing along the river each had a small boati guess one from the school it was bright moonlight and i saw them quite plainly when they passed robbins point where i was fishing  and each was alone  yes hamilton was right ahead of plum and both rowing along at good speed too i thought it was mighty strange and made up my mind id ask you boys about it but say i dont want you to get them into trouble added the old boatman suddenly they are both customers of mine sometimes  i shant say anything answered roger but this puzzles me he continued turning to his friends  each boy was alone in a boat queried dave  yes  and plum was following hamilton  he seemed to be anyway his boat was behind the other  was anybody else around asked phil  i didnt see a soul and the river was almost as bright as day  did you see them a second time asked dave  no for i was getting ready to go home when they came along i dont know where they went or when they got back  ike rasmer could tell no more than this and as it was getting late the three boys lost no time in shoving off once more and pulling for the hall boathouse  this stumps me declared the senators son what do you make of it do you think shadow and plum are up to something between them  no i dont answered dave decidedly shadow is not the fellow to train with gus plum he doesnt like the bully any more than we do  no wonder shadow feels sleepy if he spends his nights on the river said phil but i cant make out what he is up to i must confess if it was some fun he would surely take somebody with him  the boys pulled with all their strength yet when they arrived at the hall boathouse they found that they were exactly twelve minutes behind the supper hour  no time to wash up said roger well be lucky if we can slip into the dining room without being observed  with all speed they tied up their craft and ran for the school building they were just entering the side door when they were brought face to face with job haskers the second assistant teacher and a man who was very dictatorial in his manner  stop cried job haskers catching dave by the shoulder what do you mean by coming in at this hour  we were out on the river and broke an oarlock mr haskers replied dave  humph an old excuse  it is the truth sir and daves face flushed  i broke the oarlock said roger we got back as soon as we couldas soon as we got a new lock at ike rasmers boathouse  we cannot allow pupils to come in half an hour late went on job haskers loftily directly after supper report to me in classroom 7 and he passed on  we are in for it now grumbled phil its a shame it wasnt our fault that the oarlock broke  wonder what he will make us do came from the senators son  something not very pleasant answered dave he had encountered the second assistant many times before and knew the harsh instructor well  they were soon in their seats at the table some of the other students looked at them inquiringly but nothing was said not far from dave sat gus plum and nat poole and both favored the poor boy with a scowl to which dave paid no attention  the meal finished dave phil and the senators son brushed up a bit and then hurried to classroom 7 located in an angle of the building they were soon joined by job haskers  the three of you may remain here and each write the word oarlock two hundred times said the second assistant as soon as all of you have finished ring the bell and i will come and inspect the work it must be neatly done or i shall make you do it over again and then he left them to themselves going out and closing the door tightly after him     chapter iv  a plot to square up   phew but this is a real picnic came softly from phil hes as kind as they make em isnt he  its a jolly shame grumbled the senators son to make us stay in this stuffy classroom on such a fine evening as this  i am glad i finished with my lessons was daves comment but i am sorry for you two but as there is no help for it we might as well get to work the sooner begun the sooner done you know and he began to write away vigorously on one of the pads the teacher had pointed out to them  i wish old haskers had to write it himself growled roger as he too went at the task oh but isnt he the mean one i dont see why the doctor keeps him  hes smart thats why answered phil i wish we could get square for this im sure doctor clay would have excused us had he known the facts ive a good mind to go to him about it  dont you do it phil cried dave its not worth it get to workand well think about squaring up afterwards  in a minute more all three of the boys were writing as rapidly as their fingers could travel over the paper roger was the best penman of the three and finished several minutes before the others he began to walk up and down the room whistling softly to himself  yes i go in for squaring up with old haskers he said rather loudly hes about as mean and then he stopped short as the door swung open and the second assistant appeared  huh he snorted were you alluding to me master morr he demanded  roger stammered and his face turned red  herhere are the words he stammered  two hundred eh well you may write a hundred more and after this be careful of what you say and then job haskers turned to dave and phil that is all right you two can go  can i stay with roger asked dave  no i shall remain here myself was the cold answer and then dave and phil had to leave  ill wager roger feels like hugging him was phils comment he will want to get square now sure  the two boys went out on the campus for awhile and then up to their dormitory where they found a small crowd assembled some talking and a few studying the door to the adjoining dormitory was open and there luke watson was playing on a banjo while another student was singing a negro song in a subdued voice  i say dave will you explain something to me said a voice from a corner the question came from chip macklin gus plums former toady the small boy was working over a sheet of algebra sums  certainly said dave readily and sat down by the others side now what is it oh i see i got twisted on that myself once this is the proper equation and you can reduce it this way and he was soon deep in the problem with chip looking on admiringly when the problem had been worked out and explained in detail the small boy was very grateful  and dave he went on in a low tone ii want to tell you something be on your guard against plum and nat poole  why  because they are plotting mischief i heard them talking in the gym i dont know what it is about but they are surely up to something  ill remember chip and much obliged answered dave and then he turned to the other boys leaving the small youth to finish his examples  hello where have you been came from stout and lazy buster beggs he was sprawled out on the end of a couch i noticed you didnt get to supper till late and went right off directly you had finished  had a special session with haskers answered dave he wants me to improve my handwriting  there was a smile at this for all the boys knew what it meant  oh that fellow is a big peach he is came from sam day who sat in one of the windows yesterday he made me stay in just because i asked tolliver for a lead pencil  he was mad because polly vane caught him in an error in grammar added another youth didnt you polly he added addressing a rather girlishlooking boy who sat near chip macklin  i did was the soft answer it was rather a complicated sentence but perfectly clear to me explained the boy  i dont wonder for polly fairly lives on grammar and language put in phil i dont believe anybody could trip him up and this compliment made bertram vane blush like a girl he was in reality one of the best scholars in the academy  which puts me in mind of a story came from one of the cots an  hello are you awake shadow cried sam day i thought you were snoozing  so i was but i am slept out and feel better now as i was saying an old farmer and a college professor went out rowing together says the college professor can you do sums in algebra no answers the farmer then you have missed a great opportunity says the professor just then the boat struck a rock and went over save me yells the professor cant you swim asked the farmer no then you have lost the chance of your life says the farmer and strikes out and leaves the professor to take care of himself  two hundredth time came in a solemn voice from the doorway to the next room  whawhat do you mean i never told any story two hundred times cried shadow hamilton and that puts me in mind  shadow if you tell another as bad as that ill heave you out of the window came from sam day that has moss on it three inches th  oh i know you lazy youre jealous thats all you couldnt tell a story if you stood on your head  can you shadow and then a general laugh went up in the midst of which the door opened and job haskers entered on catching sight of the unpopular teacher sam day lost no time in sliding from the windowsill to a chair  boys we cannot permit so much noise up here cried job haskers and that constant strumming on a banjo must be stopped master day were you sitting in the window  ieri think i was stammered sam  you are aware that is against the rules if you fell out the hall management would be held responsible after school tomorrow you can write the words windowsill two hundred times hamilton get up and straighten out that cot properly i am ashamed of you and then the hated teacher passed on to the next dormitory  i told you to get out of the window said macklin as soon as they were alone i was caught that way myself once and so was gus plum  lazy is going to learn how to write a little better too said dave with a grin  at that moment roger came in looking thoroughly disgusted  made me write half of it over again he explained oh its simply unbearable say i am going to do something to get square as sure as eggs is eggs  eggs are eggs corrected polly vane sweetly  oh thanks polly what about a tailors goose  eh  if one tailors goose is a goose what are half a dozen  tailors geese i supposebut no youd not say that let me see and the girlish youth dove into his books thats a serious question truly he murmured  well i am willing to get square too put in sam day  so am i grunted shadow hamilton there was no need to call me down as he did simply because the cot was mussed up a bit the question is whats to be done  the boys paused and looked at each other then a sudden twinkle came into daves clear eyes  if we could do it it would be great he murmured  do what dave asked several at once  i dont care to say unless i am certain we are all going to stand together  we are came in a chorus from all but polly vane who was still deep in his books  what about you polly called out roger  me whyerif a tailors goose is a real goose not a flatiron goose  oh drop the goose business we are talking about getting square with haskers will you stand with the crowd  you see we dont want to make gooses of ourselves said phil with a wink at polly vane  ill stand by you said polly but please dont ask me to do something ridiculous as when we dumped that feather bed down from the thirdstory landing and caught those visitors instead of pop swingly  i was only thinking of farmer cadmores ram said dave innocently he is now tied up in a field below here i dont think he likes to be out over night hed rather be under sheltersay in mr haskers room  whoop cried roger just the thing we will store him away in old haskers closet  this plan met with instant approval and the boys drew straws as to which of them should endeavor to execute the rather difficult undertaking three were to go and the choice fell upon dave phil and sam day the others promised to remain on guard and issue a warning at the first intimation of danger  i think the coast will be fairly clear said sam day i heard haskers tell doctor clay he was going out tonight and would not be back until eleven or after that ought to give us plenty of time in which to do the trick  the three boys could not leave the dormitory until the monitor jim murphy had made the rounds and seen to it that all was right for the night and the lights put out then they stole out into the hallway and down a back stairs soon they were out of the building and making for farmer cadmores place  as they left the hall they did not see that they were being watched yet such was a fact nat poole had been out on a special errand and had seen them depart at once that student hurried to tell his friend gus plum  going out eh said the big bully  yes and i heard them say something about making it warm when they got back returned nat poole  humph nat we must put a spoke in their wheel  im willing what shall we do  ill think something upbefore they get back replied the bully of oak hall they havent any right to be out and i guess weve got em just where we want em     chapter v  what the plot led to   it was a clear night with no moon but with countless stars bespangling the heavens all was quiet around oak hall and the three boys found it an easy matter to steal across the campus gain the shade of a row of oaks and get out on the side road leading to the cadmore farm  we dont want to get nabbed at this was phils comment if farmer cadmore caught us he would make it mighty warm hes as irritable as old farmer brown and youll remember what a time we had with him and his calf  does he keep a dog asked dave i havent any use for that sort of an animal if he is savage  no he hasnt any dog answered phil i was asking about it last week but phil was mistaken jabez cadmore did have a dogone he had purchased a few days before he was a goodsized mastiff and far from gentle  walking rapidly it did not take the three boys long to reach the first of farmer cadmores fields this was of corn and passing through it and over a potato patch they came to an orchard wherein they knew the ram was tied to one of the trees  now be careful whispered dave as he leaped the railfence of the orchard somebody may be stirring around the farmhousepointing to the structure some distance away  oh they must be in bed by this time said phil farmers usually retire early cadmore is a closefisted chap and he wont want to burn up his oil or his candles  with hearts which beat rather rapidly the boys stole along from one tree to another then they saw a form rise out of the orchard grass and all gave a jump but it was only the ram and the animal was more frightened than themselves  look out that he doesnt butt you warned dave some of em are pretty rambunctious  they approached the ram with caution and untied him then phil started to lead him out of the orchard with dave and sam following at first he would not go but then began to run so that phil kept up with difficulty  stop cried the boy not so fast dont you hear but the ram paid no attention and now turned to the very end of the orchard here the ground was rough and in a twinkling all three of the boys went down in a hollow and rolled over and over while the ram finding himself free plunged on and was hidden from view in the darkness  he got away gasped phil scrambling up we musthark  he stopped short and all of the boys listened from a distance came the deep baying of the mastiff the sounds drew closer rapidly  a dogand he is after us cried dave fellows we have got to get out of this  if we can replied sam day which is the way out i am all turned around  so were the others and they stared into the darkness under the apple trees in perplexity the dog was coming closer and to get away by running appeared to be out of the question  jump into a tree cried dave and showed the way the others followed clutching at some lowhanging branches and pulling themselves up as rapidly as possible dave and sam were soon safe but the mastiff making a bound caught phil by the sole of his shoe  hi roared phil let go and he kicked out with the other foot this made the mastiff make another snap but his aim was poor and he dropped back to the ground while phil hauled himself up beside his companions  phew but that was a narrow escape and no mistake was the comment of the big youth after he could catch his breath i thought sure he had me by the foot  we are in a pickle groaned sam i suppose that dog will camp right at the foot of this tree till farmer cadmore comes  yes he is camping now announced dave peering down into the gloom the moment the mastiff saw him the canine set up a loud barking  for a full minute after that none of the boys spoke each being busy with his thoughts  we are treed that is certain said phil soberly and i must say i dont see any way to escape  yes and dont forget about the ram added sam old jabez cadmore will want to know about him too  ive got an idea said dave presently perhaps it wont work but it wont do any harm to try it  give it to us by all means  the trees are pretty thick in this orchard let us try to work our way from one tree to another until we can reach the fence then perhaps we can drop outside and get out of the way of that animal  this was considered a good plan and they proceeded to put it into execution at once it was no easy matter to climb from tree to tree and each got a small rent in his clothing and sam came near falling to the ground the mastiff watched them curiously barking but little much to their satisfaction  at last they came to the final row of apple trees a long limb hung over a barbedwire fence and the boys paused wondering if it would be safe to drop to the ground  if that mastiff should come through the fence it would go hard with us was phils comment id rather stay up here and take what comes  i am going to risk it answered dave i see a stick down there and ill grab that as soon as i land and down he dropped and caught up the stick with alacrity the dog pounced forward struck the sharp barbs of the fence and retreated howling dismally with pain then he made another advance with like results  hurrah he cant get through ejaculated dave come on fellows its perfectly safe and down his chums dropped and all hurried away from the vicinity of the orchard  we had better be getting back said sam after the orchard and potato patch had been left behind that farmer may be coming after us before we know it he must have heard the dog but in this he was mistaken the distance from the house was too great and the farmer and his family slept too soundly to be disturbed  its too bad we must go back without the ram observed dave the other fellows will think we got scared and threw up the job  well it cant be helped began phil when he caught sight of something moving along the road ahead of them look is that the ram  it is exclaimed dave wait if you are not careful hell run away again stay here and ill catch him i was brought up on a farm and i know all about sheep  the others came to a halt and dave advanced with caution until he was within a few feet of the ram then he held out his hand and made a peculiar sound the ram grew curious and remained quiet while the youth picked up the end of the rope which was around the animals neck  ive got him he said in a low even tone now keep to the rear and ill manage him and on they went once in a while the ram showed a disposition to butt and to stop short but dave coaxed him and the trouble was not great  when they came in sight of the school building they realized that the most difficult part of the task lay before them it was decided that dave should keep the ram behind the gymnasium building until sam and phil ascertained that the coast was clear  left to himself dave tied the ram to a post and crawled into the gymnasium by one of the windows he procured several broad straps and also a small blanket just as he came out with the things sam and phil came hurrying back each with a look of deep concern on his face  the jig is up groaned sam plum and poole are on to our racket and they wont let us in  plum and poole exclaimed dave are they at that back door  yes and when we came up they jeered us said phil oh but wasnt i mad they said if we tried to force our way in theyd ring up the doctor or mr dale  does our crowd know about this  i dont think they do  plum and poole intend to keep us out all night eh  it looks that way they said we could ask haskers to let us in when he came  i am not going to haskers said dave firmly sam you look after this ram for a few minutes ill make them let us in and not give us away either phil you come along  but i dont see how you are going to do it expostulated the big boy  never mind just come on thats all plum isnt going to have a walkover tonight  somewhat mystified phil accompanied dave across the campus and to the rear door of the hall here the barrier was open only a few inches with plum peering out and poole behind him the face of the bully wore a look of triumph  how do you like staying out he whispered hoarsely fine night for a ramble eh you can tell old haskers what a fine walk you have had hell be sure to reward you handsomely  see here plum i am not going to waste words with you tonight said dave in a low but intense tone you let us in and at once or youll regret it  will i  you will and what is more dont you dare to say a word to anybody about what is happening now  oh dear but you can talk big maybe you want me to get down on my knees as you pass in added the bully mockingly  if you dont let us in do you know what i shall do continued dave in a whisper i shall go to doctor clay and tell him that you are in the habit of going out after midnight to row on the river  if dave had expected this statement to have an effect upon the bully his anticipations were more than realized gus plum uttered a cry of dismay and fell back on nat pooles shoulder his face lost its color and he shook from head to foot  yoyou he began whawhat do you know about mymy rowing on the river  i know a good deal  yoyouve beenfollowingme for once the bully could scarcely speak  i shant say any more said dave giving his chum a pinch in the arm to keep quiet only are you going to let us in or not  nnoi mean yes stammered gus plum he could scarcely collect himself he seemed so upset you can come in poole well have to let them in this time  and you will keep still about this demanded dave  yes yes i wont say a word porter not a word andand ill see you tomorrow after school ithat isi want to talk to you until then mums the word on both sides and then to the astonishment of both dave and phil gus plum hurried away dragging nat poole with him     chapter vi  the fun of a night   my gracious plum acts as if he was scared to death observed phil after the bully and his companion had departed leaving the others a clear field  he certainly was worked up returned dave i wonder what hell have to say tomorrow  there was no answering that question and the two boys hurried to where they had left sam without attempting to reach a conclusion they found their chum watching out anxiously  well came from his lips as soon as he saw them  its all right answered dave and told as much as he deemed necessary come we must hurry or job haskers will get back before we can fix things  this ram is going to be something to handle observed phil no meek as a lamb about him  ill show you how to do the trick answered the boy from the country and with a dexterous turn of the horns threw the ram over on one side now sit on him until i tie his legs with the straps  in a few minutes dave had the animal secured and the blanket was placed over the rams head that he might not make too much noise then they hoisted their burden up between them and started toward the hall  it was no easy matter to get the ram upstairs and into job haskers room on the upper landing they were met by roger and buster beggs who declared the coast clear once in the room of the assistant teacher they cleared out the bottom of the closet and then releasing the animal from his bonds thrust him inside and shut and locked the door leaving the key in the lock  now skip cried dave in a low voice he may cut up highjinks in another minute  here is an apple he can havethat will keep him quiet for awhile said roger and put it in the closet locking the door as before the ram was hungry and began to munch the fruit with satisfaction  a few minutes more found the boys safe in their dormitory where they waited impatiently for the second assistant teacher to get back to oak hall at last they heard him unlock the front door and come up the broad stairs then they heard his room door open and shut  now for the main act in the drama whispered roger come on but dont dare to make any noise  all of the boys including little macklin and polly vane were soon outside of dormitories nos 11 and 12the two rooms the crowd occupied they went forth on tiptoe scarcely daring to breathe  arriving at job haskers door they listened and heard the teacher preparing to go to bed one shoe after another dropped to the floor and then came a creaking of the bed which told that he had lain down  that ram isnt going to do anything began sam in disgust when there came a bang on the closet door that caused everybody to jump  whawhats that cried job haskers sitting up in bed he fancied somebody had knocked on the door to the hall  another bang resounded on the closet door the ram had finished the apple and wanted his freedom the teacher leaped to the middle of the bedroom floor  who is in there he demanded walking toward the closet who is there i say  getting no answer he paused in perplexity then a grin overspread his crafty face and he slipped on some of his clothing  so ive caught you eh he observed going to play some trick on me were you i am half of a mind to make you stay there all night no matter who you are i suppose you thought i wouldnt get back quite so early in the morning ill  another bang on the door cut his speculations short he struck a match and lit the light and then unlocking the closet door threw it wide open  what happened next came with such suddenness that job haskers was taken completely by surprise as soon as the door was opened the ram leaped out he caught one glimpse of the teacher and lowering his head he made a plunge and caught job haskers fairly and squarely in the stomach doubling up the man like a jackknife haskers went down in a heap and turning the ram gave him a second prod in the side  hi stop murder help came in terror stop it you beast hi call him off somebody oh my and then job haskers tried to arise and place a table between himself and the ram but the animal was now thoroughly aroused and went at the table with vigor upsetting it on the teacher and hurling both over into a corner  by this time the noise had aroused nearly the entire school and pupils and teachers came hurrying from all directions  what is the trouble here demanded andrew dale as he came up to where dave was standing  sounds like a bombardment in mr haskers room sir was the answer  mr haskers is trying some new gymnastic exercises came from a student in the rear of the crowd  maybe he has got a fit suggested another he didnt look well at supper time  the racket in the room continued and now doctor clay arrayed in a dressinggown and slippers came upon the scene followed by pop swingly the janitor  has mr haskers caught a burglar asked the janitor  thats it shouted phil with a wink at his friends look out swingly that you dont get shot  shot gasped the janitor who was far from being a brave man i dont want to get shot not me and he edged behind some of the boys  doctor clay hurried to the door of the room only to find it locked from the inside  mr haskers what is the trouble he demanded  another bang and a thump was the only reply accompanied by several yells then of a sudden came a crash of glass and an exclamation of wonder  something has gone through the window as sure as you are born whispered dave to roger  oh dave you dont suppose it was haskers if he fell to the ground hed be killed  open the door or i shall break in thundered doctor clay and then the door was thrown open and job haskers stood there a look of misery on his face and trembling from head to foot  what is the trouble asked the doctor  the ramhe butted meknocked me downnearly killed me spluttered the assistant teacher  the ramwhat ram  hes gone nowhit the window and jumped out  mr haskers have you lost your senses  no sir there was a ram in this roomin the closet i heard him and opened the doorioh i can feel the blow yet he was aa terror  do you mean a real live ram questioned andrew dale with a slight smile on his facethat smile which made all the boys his friends  i should say he was alive oh its no laughing matter growled job haskers he nearly killed me  an did he go through the winder asked pop swingly as he stepped to the broken sash  he didwent out like a rocket look at the wreck of the table i am thankful i wasnt killed  how did the ram get here asked doctor clay  how should i know he was in the closet when i came in some of those villainous boys  gently mr haskers the boys are not villains  well they put the ram there i am sure of it  the doctor turned to the janitor  swingly go below and see if you can see anything of the ram he may be lying on the ground with a broken leg or something like that if so well have to kill him to put him out of his misery  the janitor armed himself with a stout cane and went downstairs and after him trooped andrew dale and fully a score of boys but not a sign of the ram was to be seen only some sharp footprints where he had landed  must have struck fair an square an run off observed the janitor rams is powerful tough critters i knowed one as fell over a stone cliff an never minded it at all  let us take a look around said the first assistant boys get to bed youll take cold in this night air and then the students trooped back into the hall  upstairs they found that job haskers and doctor clay had gotten into a wrangle the assistant wanted an examination of the boys at once regardless of the hour of the night but doctor clay demurred  well investigate in the morning said he and as the window is broken out mr haskers you may take the room next to mine which is just now vacant  somebody ought to be punished  well investigate do not fear  its getting worse and worse by and by there wont be any managing these rascals at all grumbled the assistant teacher some of them ought to have their necks wrung  there that is enough returned the doctor sternly i think we can manage them even at such a time as this now boys he continued go to bed and do not let me hear any more disturbances and he waved the students to their various dormitories  say but isnt old haskers mad exclaimed roger when he and his chums were in their dormitory hed give a good bit to find out who played the joke on him  i hope that ram got away all right came from dave i didnt want to see the animal injured  i think pop swingly is right animals like that are tough was buster beggs comment more than likely he is on his way back to farmer cadmores farm  well find out later on put in sam day  there is another thing to consider continued dave it wouldnt be right to let doctor clay stand for the expense of that broken window i think ill send him the price of the glass out of my pocket money  not a bit of it exclaimed phil let us pass around the hat we are all in this as deep as you and so it was decided that all of the students of dormitories nos 11 and 12 should contribute to the fund for mending the broken sash then as andrew dale came around on a tour of inspection all hopped into bed and were soon sound asleep     chapter vii  gus plums mysterious offer   when doctor clay came to his desk on the following morning he found an envelope lying there on which was inscribed the following  to pay for the broken window if it costs more please let the school know and well settle the bill three dollars was inclosed  this caused the worthy doctor to smile quietly to himself it took him back to his college days when he had aided in several such scrapes  boys will be boys he murmured they are not villains only real fleshandblood youngsters  you are going to punish those boys demanded job haskers coming up  if we can locate them  humph id catch them if it took all day  you may do as you think best mr haskers only remember you have young gentlemen to deal with i presume they thought it only a harmless prank  ill prank them if i catch them growled the assistant to himself as he walked away  word had been passed around among the boys and when the roll was called all were ready to face the music  who knows anything about the proceedings of last night began job haskers gazing around fiercely  there was a pause and then a rather dull boy named carson arose  great cæsar is he going to blab on us murmured phil  what have you got to say carson asked the teacher  iii knknow whwhat happened stuttered carson  very well tell me what you know  a rarararam got into your rorororoom and he knoknoknoknocked you ddddown went on the boy who was the worst stutterer at oak hall  ahem i know that who put the ram in my room  i dddd  you did thundered the teacher how dare you do such a thing  i dddd  carson i ameramazed what made you do it  i ddddidnt say i ddddid it spluttered poor carson i said i ddddidnt know  oh job haskers face fell and he looked as sour as he could sit down now then whoever knows who put that ram in my room last night stand up  not a boy arose  will anybody answer stormed the teacher  there was utter silence broken only by the ticking of the clock on the wall dave looked at gus plum and nat poole but neither budged  i shall call the roll and each boy must answer for himself went on job haskers ansberry  i can tell you nothing mr haskers was the reply and the pupil dropped back into his seat  humph aspinwell  i can tell you nothing mr haskers  babcock  i can tell you nothing mr haskers  this iseroutrageous beggs  sorry but i can tell you nothing mr haskers drawled the fat youth  after that one name after another was called and every pupil said practically the same thing even plum and poole stating that they could tell nothing when the rollcall was finished the teacher was fairly purple with suppressed rage  i shall inquire into this at some future time he snapped out you are dismissed to your classes and he turned away to hide his chagrin  do you think we are safe whispered phil to dave as they hurried to their room  i think so was the country boys reply and dave was rightthe truth concerning the nights escapade did not come out until long after when it was too late to do anything in the matter  dave was anxious to make a record for himself in his studies and with the end of the term so close at hand he did his best over his books and in the classroom he was close to the top of his class and he was already certain of winning a special prize given for mathematics roger was just behind him in the general average and phil was but five points below with a special prize for language to his credit the best scholar of all was polly vane who so far had a percentage of ninetyseven out of a possible hundred  dave had not forgotten what gus plum had said and just before the session for the day was ended received a note from the bully asking him to come down to a point on the lake known as the three rocks and located at the extreme limit of the academy grounds plum asked him particularly to come alone  arent you afraid plum will play some trick on you asked phil who saw the note delivered and read it  ill be on my guard answered dave i am not afraid of him if it should come to an encounter between us  having put away his books dave sauntered down to the spot mentioned which was behind a thick fringe of bushes plum was not yet there but soon came up at a quick walk  i couldnt get away from poole explained the bully are you alone and he gazed around anxiously  yes i am alone answered dave coolly  there was a silence and each boy looked at the other daves eyes were clear but the bullys had something of the haunted in them  you said something about me last night began plum lamely something about my being on the river  i did  did you see me on the river  i am not going to answer that question just yet plum  huh maybe you are only joking  very well you can think as you please if you want to talk to me very well if not ill go back to the school and dave started to walk away  hold on the bully caught the country boy by the arm if you saw me on the river what else did you see  you were following shadow hamilton in a boat  i wasnti didnt have anything to do with hamilton ii didnt know he was out till afterwards went on the bully fiercely dont you say such a thingdont you dare his face was very white you are not going to get me into trouble  is that all you have to say plum  nno i want to talk this over porter ithat islet us come to termsthats the best way it wont do you any good to try to get me into trouble ii havent done anything wrong i was out on the river byby accident thats allgot it into my head to have a lark that night just as you went out for a lark last night  well what do you want to see me about then questioned dave he could readily see that the bully had something on his mind which troubled him greatly  i think we might as well come to termsyou keep still and ill keep still  i havent said anything plum  yes but you might later on you know ithat is let us make a sure thing of this stammered the bully  what are you driving at plum talk out straight  i will the bully looked around to make certain that nobody was within hearing distance youre a poor boy porter arent you  i admit it  just so and being poor some pocket money comes in mighty handy at times doesnt it  i have some spending money  but not as much as youd like aint that so  oh i could spend moreif i had it answered dave trying to find out what the other was driving at  well supposing i promised to give you some money to spend porter how would that strike you  dave was astonished the suggestion was so entirely unexpected but he tried not to show his feelings  would you give me money gus he asked calmly  yes i wouldif youd only promise to keep quiet  how much  wellierid do the right thing did phil lawrence see me on the river  no  any of the other boys  not that i know of  then you were alone gus plum drew a sigh of relief now let us come to terms by all means ill do the square thing and youll have all the pocket money you want  but how much are you willing to give me queried dave his curiosity aroused to its highest pitch  ill give youthe bully paused to add impressiveness to his wordsill give you fifty dollars  fifty dollars ejaculated dave he was bewildered by the answer he had expected plum to name a dollar or two at the most  aint that enough  do you think it is enough asked the country boy he scarcely knew what to say he was trying to study the bullys face  wellerif youll give me your solemn word not to whisper a wordnot a word rememberill make it aa hundred dollars  youll give me a hundred dollars when  before the end of the week i havent the money now but if you want it i can give you ten dollars on accountjust to bind the bargain and the bully drew two fivedollar bills from his vest pocket but remember mums the wordno matter what comes  he thrust the bills at dave who merely looked at them then the country boy drew himself up  i dont want a cent of your money gus plum he said in a low but firm voice you cant bribe me no matter what you offer  the bully dropped back and his face fell he put his money back into his pocket then he glared savagely at dave  then you wont come to terms he fairly hissed between his teeth  no  you had better if you dare to tell on mebreathe a word of what you saw that nightillill make it so hot for you that youll wish you had never been born i am not going to let a country jay like you ruin me not much you think twice before you make a move i can hurt you in a way you least expect and if i have to leave this school youll have to go too and shaking his fist at dave gus plum strode off leaving dave more mystified than ever before     chapter viii  shadow hamiltons confession   i simply cant understand it phil gus plum was frightened very much or he would never have offered me a hundred dollars to keep quiet  dave and his chum were strolling along the edge of the campus an hour after the conversation recorded in the last chapter the boy from the poorhouse had told phil all that had occurred  it is certainly the most mysterious thing i ever heard of outside of this mystery about billy dill answered phil plum has been up to something wrong but just what remains to be found out  and what about shadow hamilton  i cant say anything about shadow i never thought he would do anything that wasnt right  nor i what would you advise  keep quiet and await developments something is bound to come to the surface sooner or later  hello you fellows where are you bound came in a cry and looking up they saw a wellknown form approaching  ben cried dave rushing up to the newcomer and shaking hands warmly when did you come in and how are all the folks at crumville did you happen to see professor potts and the wadsworths  one question at a time please answered ben basswood as he shook hands with phil yes i saw them all and everybody wants to be remembered to you jessie sends her very sweetest regards  oh come now no fooling interrupted dave blushing furiously tell us the plain truth  well she sent her best regard anyway and all the others did the same the professor is getting along finely youd hardly know him now he looks so hale and hearty it did him a world of good to go to live with the wadsworths  you must have had a pretty nice vacation observed phil  yes although it was rather short but say have you fellows heard about plums father went on ben basswood earnestly  weve heard that he lost some money  yes and he has tied himself up in some sort of underhanded getrichquick concern and i understand some folks are going to sue him for all he is worth that will be rather rough on gusif his father loses all his money  true enough said dave but tell us all the news he continued and then ben related the particulars of affairs at crumville and of a legal fight between his father and mr aaron poole in which mr basswood had won  that will make nat more sour on you than ever observed phil  maybe but i cant help it if he leaves me alone ill leave him alone  the following day passed quietly at oak hall gus plum and nat poole kept by themselves shadow hamilton appeared to brighten a little but dave observed that the youth was by no means himself he did not care to play baseball or do a turn at the gym and kept for the most part by himself  saturday passed and on sunday a large number of the students marched off to three of the town churches dave roger and phil attended the same church and ben went with them and all listened to a strong sermon on christian brotherhood which was destined to do each of them good  it makes a fellow feel as if hes got to help somebody else said roger  well it is our duty to help others answered dave the fellow who isnt willing to do that is selfish  youve certainly helped macklin dave said ben i never saw such a change in a fellow ill wager he is more than happy to be out of gus plums influence  id help plum too if hed let me said dave and then gave a long sigh  two days later there was a sensation at the school doctor clay came into the main classroom in the middle of the forenoon looking much worried  young gentlemen i wish to talk to you for a few minutes he said as some of you may know i am the proud possessor of a stamp collection which i value at not less than three thousand dollars the stamps are arranged in three books and i have spent eight years in collecting them these books of stamps are missing and i wish to know if anybody here knows anything about them if they were taken away in a spirit of fun let me say that such a joke is a poor one and i trust the books will be speedily returned and without damage to a single stamp  all of the boys listened with interest for many of them had inspected the collection and they knew that stampgathering was one of the kind doctors hobbies  doctor i am sorry to hear of this said one boy named bert dalgart a youth who had a small collection of his own i looked at the collection about ten days ago as you know i havent seen it since  nor have i seen it said roger who also collected stamps  is there any boy here who knows anything at all about my collection demanded the doctor sharply if so let him stand up  there was a pause but nobody arose the master of oak hall drew a long breath  if this is a joke i want the collection returned by tomorrow morning he went on if this is not done and i learn who is guilty i shall expel that student from this school  he then passed on to the next classroom and so on through the whole academy but nothing was learned concerning the missing stamp collection and the end of the inquiry left the worthy doctor much perplexed and worried  that is too bad was daves comment after school was dismissed that was a nice collection id hate to have it mussed up if it was mine  the fellow who played that joke went too far said the senators son he ought to put the collection back at once  the matter was talked over by all the students for several days in the meantime doctor clay went on a vigorous hunt for the stamp collection but without success  do you think it possible that somebody stole that collection questioned dave of phil one afternoon as he and his chum strolled in the direction of farmer cadmores place to see if they could learn anything about the ram  oh its possible but who would be so mean  maybe some outsider got the stamps  i dont think so an outside thief would have taken some silverware or something like that no i think those stamps were taken by somebody in the school  then maybe the chap is afraid to return themfor fear of being found out  so the talk ran on until the edge of the cadmore farm was gained looking into a field they saw the ram grazing peacefully on the fresh green grass  hes as right as a button cried phil i guess he wasnt hurt at all and after jumping from the window he came straight home and in this surmise the youth was correct  as the boys walked back to the school they separated phil going to the gymnasium to practice on the bars and dave to stroll along the river the boy from crumville wanted to be by himself to think over the past and try to reason out what the sailor had told him many a time had dave tried to reason this out but always failed yet he could not bear to think of giving up  some time or another ive got to find out who i am and where i came from he murmured i am not going to remain a nobody all my life  he came to a halt in a particularly picturesque spot and was about to sit down when he heard a noise close at hand looking through the bushes he saw shadow hamilton on his knees and with his clasped hands raised to heaven the boy was praying and remained on his knees for several minutes when he arose he turned around and discovered dave who had just started to leave the spot  dave porter came in a low cry and hamiltons face grew red  hello shadow taking a walk along the river if you are ill go along  ii was walking stammered the other boy his eyes searched daves face youwere you watching me he asked lamely  not exactly  but you saw meer  i saw you shadow i couldnt help it it was nothing for you to be ashamed of though  iioh i cant tell you and hamiltons face took on a look of keen misery  shadow you are in some deep trouble i know it came bluntly from dave dont you want to tell me about it ill do what i can for you weve been chums ever since i came here and i hate to see you so downcast  it wouldnt do any goodyou couldnt help me  are you sure of that sometimes an outsider looks at a thing in a different light than that person himself of course i dont want to pry into your secrets if you dont want me to  shadow hamilton bit his lip and hesitated  if i tell you something will you promise to keep it to yourself  if it is best yes  i dont know if it is best or not but i dont want you to say anything  well what is it  you know all about the doctor losing that collection of stamps  certainly  and you know about the loss of some of the class stickpins about three weeks ago  yes i know mr dale lost just a dozen of them  the stickpins are worth two dollars each  yes  and that stamp collection was worth over three thousand dollars  i know that too  well i stole the stickpins and i stole the stamp collection too     chapter ix  about athletic contests   you stole those things you gasped dave he could scarcely utter the words he shrank back a step or two and his face was filled with horror  yes i did it came from shadow hamilton  butbutoh shadow you must be fooling surely you didnt really go to work andand try his best dave could not finish  i stole the things or rather i think i had better say i took them although it amounts to the same thing but i dont think i am quite as bad as you suppose  but if you took them why didnt you return them you have had plenty of time  i would return them only i dont know where the things are  you dont know what do you mean  ill have to tell you my whole story dave will you listen until i have finished  certainly  well to start on i am a great dreamer and what is more i occasionally walk in my sleep  yes you told me that before  one morning i got up and i found my clothes all covered with dirt and cobwebs and my shoes very muddy i couldnt explain this and i thought some of the fellows had been putting up a job on me but i didnt want to play the calf so i said nothing  some days after that i found my clothing in the same condition and i likewise found that my hands were blistered as if from some hard work i couldnt understand it but suddenly it flashed on me that i must have been sleepwalking i was ashamed of myself so i told nobody  well but this robbery began dave  i am coming to that when doctor clay spoke about his stamp collection i remembered that i had dreamed of that collection one night it seemed to me that i must run away with the collection and put it in a safe place then i remembered that i had dreamed of the stickpins at another time and had dreamed of going to the boathouse to put them in my locker there that made me curious and i went down to the locker and there i foundwhat do you think one of the stickpins stuck in the wood  a new one  exactly that made me hunt around thoroughly and after a while i discovered this under my rowing sweater  as shadow finished he drew from his pocket a doubledup sheet of paper dave unfolded it and saw it was a large sheet of rare american postage stamps  did you find any more than this  the other youth shook his head  did you hunt all around the boathouse  yes i hunted high and low in the building and out i have spent all my spare time hunting that is why i have had such poor lessons lately  dont you remember going out to row during the night shadow  at this question shadow hamilton started  what do you know about that he demanded  not muchonly i know you were out  do you know where i went to  i do not  well neither do i i dreamed about rowing but i cant for the life of me remember where i went i must have gone a good way for i blistered my hands with the oars  and yet you cant remember  oh i know it sounds like a fairy tale and i know nobody will believe it yet it is true dave ill give you my word on it  i believe you shadow your being out is what has made you so tired lately now you have told me a secret i am going to tell you one ike rasmer saw you out on the river at night passing robbins point and there is something stranger to tell  what is that  are you dead certain you were asleep on the river  i must have been i remember nothing more than my dream  do you know that you were followed  by rasmer  no by gus plum  plum gasped shadow hamilton and his face turned pale areare you certain of this  that is what ike rasmer told me and then dave related all that the old boatman had said  that makes the mystery deeper muttered shadow it puts me in mind of a story i oncebut i cant tell stories now he gave a sigh oh dave i am so wretched over this i dont know what to do  i know what id do  what  go and tell doctor clay everything  ii cant do it he thought so much of that stamp collectionhell surely send me homeand make my father pay for the collection too  i dont think hell send you home about pay thats another question in one sense you didnt really steal the stamps a fellow isnt responsible for what he does in his sleep id certainly go to him if you wish ill go with you  the two talked the matter over for half an hour and on daves continual urging shadow hamilton at last consented to go to doctor clay and make a clean breast of the matter  they found the master of oak hall in his private office writing a letter he greeted them pleasantly and told them to sit down until he had finished then he turned around to them inquiringly  it was no easy matter for shadow hamilton to break the ice and dave had to help him do it but once the plunge was taken the youth given to sleepwalking told him his story in all of its details and turned over to the doctor the stickpin and the sheet of stamps he had found  during the recital doctor clays eyes scarcely once left the face of the boy who was making the confession as he proceeded shadow hamilton grew paler and paler and his voice grew husky until he could scarcely speak  i know i am to blame sir he said at last but iioh doctor clay please forgive me he burst out  my boy there is nothing to forgive was the kindly answer that took even dave by surprise it would seem that you have been as much of a victim as i have been i cannot blame you for doing these things in your sleep i take it for granted that you have told me the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth  i have sir i have  then there is nothing to do but to investigate this as far as we can of course i realize that it would cut you to have everybody in the school know of your sleepwalking habit  yes sir but i shouldnt care if only you could get back the stamps and the pins  is rasmer sure he saw plum following hamilton on the river asked the doctor turning to dave  that is what he told morr lawrence and myself the day we stopped at his boathouse for a new oarlock  then i must see him and have a talk with him said the master of oak hall and after a few words more the boys were dismissed  on the following morning doctor clay drove down to ike rasmers place the boatman was pleasant enough but he remembered that gus plum was one of his customers and when questioned closely said he could not testify absolutely to the fact that it had been plum who had followed hamilton on the river  you see my eyesight aint of the best doctor said rasmer lamely i saw hamilton full in the face but the other feller had his face turned away from me i aint gittin nobody into trouble less i am sure of what i am dointhats nateral aint it  very answered doctor clay coldly and returned to the academy in deep thought he realized that ike rasmer was now on his guard and would tell no more than was absolutely required of him  the next movement of the worthy doctor was to call gus plum into his office the bully was anxious but had evidently nerved himself for the ordeal  no sir i have not been out on the river at night this season said he blandly in reply to the doctors question i have not dared to go out so late for i take cold too easily and he coughed slightly  this was all doctor clay could get from plum and he dismissed the bully without mentioning hamilton or the missing pins and stamps then the doctor called in andrew dale and the two consulted together for the best part of an hour but what the outcome of that discussion was the boys were not told a day later however shadow hamilton was told to change his sleeping quarters to a small room next to that occupied by andrew dale  hello shadow is going to get hightoned and have a sleepingroom all to himself cried roger and would have asked some questions only dave cut him short  there is a good reason roger whispered the country boy but dont ask me to explain now if you question shadow youll only hurt his feelings this tip spread and none of the boys after that said a word before hamilton about the change but later all came to dave and asked what it meant  i wish i could tell you but i cant fellows some day perhaps youll know until then youll have to forget it and that is all dave would say  the boys were too busy to give the mystery much attention a series of athletic contests had been arranged and all of the students who were to take part had gone into training in the gymnasium and on the cindertrack which was laid out in the field beyond the lastnamed building the contests were to come off on the following saturday and to make matters more interesting doctor clay had put up several prizes of books and silver medals to be presented to the winners  dave had entered for a hurdle race and roger phil and ben were in various other contests dave felt that he would stand a good chance at the hurdles for on caspar potts farm he had frequently practiced at leaping over the rail fences while on the run he did not know surely who would be pitted against him until ben basswood brought him the news  gus plum fanning and saultz are in the hurdle race said ben plum says he feels certain he will win  plum repeated the country boy i knew the others were in it but i didnt think gus would take part  he went in right after he heard that you had entered he says he is going to beat you out of your boots he wanted to bet with me but i told him i didnt bet  is nat poole in the race  no he is in the quartermile dash against me and six others he thinks he will win too  i dont think he will ben you can outrun him  anyway i am going to try answered ben basswood     chapter x  how a race was won   it was a bright clear day in early summer when the athletic contests of oak hall came off all the academy boys assembled for the affair and with them were a number of folks from the town and also some students from the rockville military academy a rival institution of learning as my old readers already know  the contests began with pole vaulting and putting the shot and much to the surprise of all chip macklin won out over half a dozen boys slightly larger than himself luke watson also won one of the contests and the banjo player and macklin were roundly applauded by their friends  dave porter coached macklin said one small boy to another i saw him doing it i can tell you chip is picking up  yes was the answer and he doesnt seem to be afraid of that bully of a plum any more either  after the shotputting and vaulting came the quartermile dash for which ben had entered  go in and win ben cried dave to his old chum i know you can do it if youll only try  nat poole will win that race came roughly from gus plum who stood near  hi catch the ball gus sang out nat poole from across the field and threw a ball in bens direction plum leaped for the sphere bumped up against ben and both went down with the bully on top  plum you did that on purpose cried roger who was close by shame on you  shut up i didnt do it on purpose howled the bully arising say that again and ill knock you down  you certainly did do it on purpose said phil stepping up quickly you ought to be reported for it  aw dry up muttered plum and walked away  when ben arose he could scarcely get his breath he was not hurt but the wind had been knocked completely out of him  ii dont know if i can rurun or not he gasped he camecame down on me like a ton of bricks  wait ill speak to mr dale about this said dave and ran off as a result of the interview the contest was delayed ten minutesanother taking its placemuch to the disgust of gus plum and nat poole both of whom had reckoned on putting ben out of the contest  at the start of the quartermile dash nat poole and two others forged ahead but ben was on his mettle and setting his teeth soon began to close up the gap  go it ben yelled dave you can win i know it  sail right past em came from the senators son hump yourself old man  make em take the dust added phil  ben hardly heard the words for he was now running with all his strength he passed first one boy and then another and then came abreast of nat poole so they moved on to within a dozen paces of the finish then ben made a leap ahead and so did one of the other contestants and ben came in the winner with the other boy second and nat poole third a roar went right across the field  ben basswood wins  jake tatmon is second  nat poole came in only third and he boasted he was going to win sure  as soon as the race was over nat poole sneaked out of sight behind some friends he was bitterly disappointed and could scarcely keep from running away altogether  you didnt fix him at all he whispered to gus plum when he got the chance he was in prime condition  i did the best i couldyou saw him go down with me on top of him retorted the bully now dont you forget what you promised he added sharply  oh ill keep my word dont fear growled nat poole i hate dave porter too much to let him win  there were some standing and running jumps in which roger and phil won second and third places and then came the hurdle race in which dave was to participate in the meantime nat poole had shed his track outfit and donned his regular clothes and a rather heavy pair of walking shoes  please let me pass said he to the crowd in which dave was standing and without warning brought one of his heavy shoes down smartly on daves light canvas footcovering  ouch cried the country boy and gave poole a quick shove what do you mean by stepping on my foot in that fashion nat poole  oh excuse me said the crumville aristocrat coolly didnt know it was your foot porter or i shouldnt have stepped on it for anything  youve just about lamed me gasped dave the pain was still intense  dave i believe this is a putup job said ben quickly plum agreed to lame me so that poole could win and now poole is trying the same trick on you for plums benefit  no such thing roared nat poole but his face grew fiery red it was a pure accident i dont have to lame porter plum will win anyhow  it certainly looks suspicious said shadow hamilton he hadnt any business to force his way through our crowd  oh dont you put in your oar you old sleepwalker growled nat poole and then hurried off and out of sight behind the gymnasium at the parting shot shadow became pale but nobody seemed to notice the remark  can you go ahead asked phil of dave  i think so was the answer but that was a mean thing to do he came near crushing my little toe  fortunately several of the hurdles had not been properly placed and it took some little time to arrange them properly during that interval roger dressed the injured foot for his chum which made it feel much better  are you all ready was the question put to the contestants as they lined up then came a pause followed by the crack of a revolver and they were off  the encounter with nat poole had nerved dave as he had seldom been nerved before ben had won and he made up his mind to do the same regardless of the fact that gus plum and one of the other boys in the race were bigger than himself he took the first and second hurdles with ease and then found himself in a bunch with plum on one side and a lad named cashod on the other  whoop her up cashod he yelled out come on and show the others what we can do  right you are porter was the answering cry  not much puffed out gus plum im the winner here  rats answered dave youll come in fifth plum youre winded already and then with a mighty effort he leaped to the front with cashod on his heels poole didnt do your dirty work well enough he flung back over his shoulder as he took his fourth hurdle  the taunts angered gus plum and this made him lose ground until almost before he knew it the third pupil in the race dashed past him then he found himself neckandneck with the fifth contestant  here they come  dave porter is ahead with cashod second  collins has taken third place  plum and higgins are tied for fourth place  not much higgins is ahead  and there goes sanderson ahead of plum too phew wonder if that is what plum calls winning he had better study his dictionary  illustration dave cleared the last hurdle and came in a winnerpage 87  with a mighty leap dave cleared the last hurdle and came in a winner then the others finished in the order named excepting that gus plum was so disgusted that he refused to take the last hurdle for which some of the boys hissed him considering it unsportsmanlike which it was  my shoe got loose said the bully lamely if it hadnt been for that i should have won but nobody believed him  dave the way you went ahead was simply great cried phil it was as fine a hurdle race as i ever saw  yes and he helped me too said cashod i was thinking plum would go ahead until porter laughed at him it was all right and cashod bobbed his head to show how satisfied he was  if nat poole had been disgusted gus plum was more so and he lost no time in disappearing from public gaze the two cronies met back of the gymnasium  you hurt porter about as much as i hurt basswood plum grumbled if you cant do better than that next time you had better give up trying  oh the pot neednt call the kettle black retorted poole you made just as much of a mess of it as i did well be the laughing stock of the porter crowd now  if they laugh at me ill punch somebodys nose as it is ive got an account to settle with porter and i am going to settle it pretty quick too  what do you mean  he jeered me while we were in the race he has got to take it back or there is going to be trouble muttered the bully clenching his fists  in his usual bragging way gus plum let several students know that he had it in for dave and this reached the country boys ears the next day directly after school  i am not afraid of him said dave coolly if he wants to find me he knows where to look for me  shortly after this dave and some of his chums took a walk down to the boathouse dock there they ran into plum poole and several of their admirers  here is porter now said one boy in a low voice now is your chance gus  yes let us see you do what you said came from another  plum had not expected an encounter so soon but there seemed to be no way of backing out so he advanced quickly upon dave and clenched his fists  you can fight or apologize he said loudly  apologize to you queried dave coolly  yes to me and at once blustered the bully  i am not apologizing to you plum  then youll fight  if you hit me i shall defend myself  hit you if i sail into you youll think a cyclone struck you if you know where you are wise youll apologize  on the contrary plum i want to let you and all here know what i think of you you are a bully a braggartand a coward  daves eyes were flashing dangerously and as he gazed steadily at plum the latter backed away a step  youyou dare to talk to me like that  why not nobody ought to be afraid to tell the truth  oh dont stand gassing burst out nat poole give it to him gusgive it to him good and hard  i will cried the bully and making a quick leap he delivered a blow straight for daves face  had the blow landed as intended the country boy would undoubtedly have sustained a black eye but dave ducked slightly and the bullys fist shot past his ear then dave drew off and hit plum a stinging blow on the chin  a fight a fight was the rallying cry from all sides and in a twinkling a crowd assembled to see the impromptu contest     chapter xi  a fight and its result   dave if you fight and doctor clay hears of it youll get into trouble whispered roger you know what his rules are  i am not going to fight but ill defend myself was the calm answer  maybe youre afraid to fight sneered nat poole who stood close by  before the country youth could answer gus plum sprang forward and aimed another blow at daves face dave ducked but was not quite quick enough and the fist of his enemy landed on his ear  this aroused the boy from crumville as never before the look on the bullys face was such as to nerve him to do his best and casting prudence to the winds he sailed in with a vigor that astonished all who beheld it one fist landed on plums nose and the other on the bullys chin and down he went in a heap against the boathouse  have you had enough demanded dave his eyes fairly flashing  no roared the bully and scrambling up he rushed at dave and the pair clenched around and around the little dock they wrestled first one getting a slight advantage and then the other  break away cried some of the students break away  ill break if hell break panted dave plum said nothing for he was doing his best to get the country boys head in chancery as it is termed that is under his arm where he might pummel it to his satisfaction  but dave was on his guard and was not to be easily caught he knew a trick or two and watching his opportunity led plum to believe that he was getting the better of the contest then with remarkable swiftness he made a halfturn ducked and came up and sent the bully flying clean and clear over his shoulder when this happened both were close to the edge of the dock and with a cry and a splash gus plum went over into the river  gracious did you see that fling  threw him right over his head into the river  the fellow who tackles dave porter has his hands full every time  so the comments ran on in the meantime dave stood quietly on the edge of the dock watching for the bully and trying to regain his breath  plum had disappeared close to the edge of the dock and all the bystanders expected him to reappear almost immediately but to their surprise he did not show himself  where is he why doesnt he come up  he must be playing a trick on porter maybe he is under the dock  no he cant get under the dock it is all boarded up  he must have struck his head on something or got a cramp being so heated up  dave continued to wait and as his enemy did not come to light a cold chill ran over him what if plum was really hurt or in trouble under water he knew that the bully was not the best of swimmers  there he is came in a shout from one of the boys and he pointed out into the stream to where gus plums body was floating along face downward  dave gave one look and his heart seemed to leap into his throat by the side of the dock was a rowboat with the oars across the seats he made a bound for it  come he said motioning to roger and the senators son followed him into the craft they shoved off with vigor and dave took up the oars then another boat put off containing poole and two other students  a few strokes sufficed to bring the first rowboat up alongside of the form of the bully plum had turned partly over and was on the point of sinking again when roger reached out and caught him by the foot then dave swung the rowboat around and after a little trouble the two got the soaked one aboard  gus plum was partly unconscious and a bruise on his left temple showed where his head had struck some portion of the dock in falling as they placed him across the seats of the rowboat he gasped spluttered and attempted to sit up  better keep still said dave kindly we dont want the boat to go over  where am i oh i know now you knocked me over  dont talk plum wait till we get back to shore warned roger  a few strokes took the boat back to the dock and dave and roger assisted the dripping youth to land gus plum was so weak he had to sit down on a bench to recover  you played me a mean trick he spluttered at last a mean trick  thats what he did put in nat poole who had also returned to the dock i guess he was afraid to fight fair  i suppose you wanted to drown me went on the bully of oak hall  i didnt want to drown you plumi didnt even want to push you overboard i didnt think we were so close to the docks edge  humph its easy enough to talk gus plum gazed ruefully at his somewhat loud summer suit look at my clothes they are just about ruined  nonsense came from roger they need drying cleaning and pressing thats all you can get the job done down in oakdale for a dollar and a half  and who is going to pay the bill  well if you are too poor to do it ill do so answered roger  this reply made the bully grow very red and he shook his fist at the senators son  none of your insinuations he roared i am not poor and i want you to know it my father may have lost some money but he can still buy and sell your father and as for such a poorhouse nobody as your intimate friend there porter  for shame plum cried several  oh go ahead and toady to him if you want to i shant stop you but id rather pick my company  and so would i added nat poole i once heard of a poorhouse boy who was the son of a thief id not want to train with a fellow of that sort  dave listened to the words and they seemed to burn into his very heart he came forward with a face as white as death itself  nat poole do you mean to insinuate that i am the son of a thief he demanded  oh a fellow dont know what to think replied the crumville aristocrat with a sneer  then take that for your opinion  it was a telling blow delivered with a passion that dave could not control it took nat poole squarely in the mouth and the aristocrat went down with a thud flat on his back his lip was cut and two of his teeth were loosened while the countrys boys fist showed a skinned knuckle  whoop did you see that  my what a sledgehammer blow  poole is knocked out clean  such were some of the comments in the midst of which nat poole sat up dazed and bewildered then he gasped and ejected some blood from his mouth  youyou he began  stay where you are nat poole said dave in a voice that was as cold as ice dont you dare to budge  whawhat  dont you dare to budge until you have begged my pardon  me beg your pardon id like to see myself  well that is just what you are going to do if you dont do you know what ill do ill throw you into the river and keep you there until you do as i say  here you let him alone blustered plum starting to rise  keep out of this plum or as sure as im standing here ill throw you in again too said dave  dave whispered roger he could see that his friend was almost beside himself with passion  no roger dont try to interfere this is my battle they have been talking behind my back long enough poole has got to apologize or take the consequences and so has plum ill make them do it if i have to fight them both and the eyes of the country boy blazed with a fire that the senators son had never before seen in them i dont deny that i came from the poorhouse and i dont deny that i know nothing of my past went on dave speaking to the crowd but i am trying to do the fair thing every boy here knows it andand  we are with you dave came from the rear of the crowd and luke watson pushed his way to the front followed by phil shadow and buster beggs  dave porter is one of the best fellows in this school cried phil  and plum and poole are a couple of codfish added buster  iiam a codfish am i roared plum  you are gus plum you say things behind folks backs and try to bully the little boys and in reality you are no better than anybody else if as good you make me sick  illill hammer you good for that  all right send me word when you are ready retorted buster  in the meantime dave was still standing over nat poole suddenly he caught the aristocratic youth by the ear and gave that member a twist  ouch let go yelled nat poole let go dont wring my ear off  will you apologize demanded dave and gave the ear a jerk that brought tears to pooles eyes  iioh youll have my ear off next oh you waitoh oh if i ever getouch  say you are sorry you said what you did to me went on dave or into the river you go and despite pooles efforts he dragged the aristocrat toward the edge of the dock  no no oh i say porter oh my ear i dont want to go into the river iii take it backi guess i made a mistake oh let me go  you apologize then  yes  then get out and after this behave yourself said dave and gave nat poole a fling that sent him up against the boathouse with a bang in another instant he was by gus plums side now its your turn you overgrown bully he continued  whawhat do you mean stammered plum who had looked on the scene just enacted with a sinking heart  i mean you must apologize just as poole has done  and if i wont  ill thrash you till you dono matter what the consequences are and dave hauled off his jacket and threw off his cap  would you hit a fellow when he iserhalf drowned whined the bully  youre not half drownedyoure only scared plum now then will you apologize or not and dave doubled up his fists  ii dont have to iioh  the words on plums lips came to a sudden end for at that instant the country boy caught him by the throat and banged his head up against the boathouse side  now apologize and be quick about it said dave determinedly  oh my head you have cracked my skull illill have the law on you  very well im willing but you must apologize first and plums head came into contact with the boathouse side again and he saw stars  oh let upstop porter dont kill me iitake it back ii apologize ii didnt mean anything let up please do shrieked gus plum and then dave let go his hold and stepped back  now gus plum listen to me said the country boy let this end it between us if you dont let me tell you right now that you will get the worst of it after this keep your distance and dont open your mouth about me i shant say anything to doctor clay about this but if you say anything ill tell him all and i know from what he has already said that he will stand by me  maybe he doesnt know  he knows everything about my past and he has asked me to stay here regardless of what some mean fellows like you might say about it but i am not going to take anything from you and poole in the future remember that added dave and then he picked up his cap and jacket put them on and followed by phil roger and a number of his other friends walked slowly away     chapter xii  shadow as a somnambulist   the manner in which dave had brought gus plum and nat poole to terms was the talk of oak hall for some time and many of the pupils looked upon the country boy as a veritable leader and conqueror  i wish i had been there said chip macklin to roger it must have been great to see plum and poole eat humble pie what do you think theyll do about it  they wont do anything just at present answered the senators son they are too scared and in this surmise roger was correct  but though the majority of the students sided with dave there was a small class made up of those who were wealthy who passed him by and snubbed him not wishing to associate with anybody who had come from a poorhouse they said nothing but their manners were enough to hurt dave greatly and more than once the country boy felt like packing his trunk and bidding goodby to oak hall forever but then he would think of his many friends and of what kindhearted doctor clay had said and grit his teeth and declare to himself that he would fight the battle to the end no matter what the cost  if the story of the encounter came to the ears of the master of the school or the teachers nothing was said about it and in the multitude of other events coming up the incident was forgotten by the majority but dave did not forget and neither did plum and poole  oh how i detest that chap grumbled poole to plum one night when they were alone gus we must get square  thats right returned the bully but not now wait till he is off his guard then we can fix him and do it for keeps too  on the following saturday evening chip macklin called dave to one side the young student was evidently excited over something  what is it chip asked dave hurry up i cant wait long for i want to join the fellows in the gym  i want to tell you something about gus plum was the answer i think ive discovered something but i am not sure  well out with it  this afternoon i got permission to ride over to rockville on my bicycle to get some shirts at the furnishing store there well when i came out of the store i saw gus plum coming out of the postoffice on the opposite side of the street he had some letters in his hand and he turned into the little public park near by sat down on a bench and began to read them  well what is remarkable about that outside of the fact that he is supposed to get all his letters in the hall mail remarked dave  thats just it i made up my mind something was wrong or else hed have his mail come here i saw him tear three of the envelopes to pieces and scatter the bits in the grass when he went away i walked over to the spot and picked up such bits of paper as i could find of course you may say i was a sneak for doing it but just look at what i found  i have no desire chip to pry into plums private affairs  yes but this is not his private affairto my way of thinking it concerns the whole school returned chip macklin eagerly  dave glanced at the bits of paper and at once became interested one piece contained the words stamp dealer another rare sta w york and another stamps bought and sold by isaac dem nett street sa  these must have come from dealers in stamps said dave slowly  that is what i thought  did you ever know gus plum to be interested in stamps  no  were the letters addressed to him  i dont know strange as it may seem i couldnt find any of the writtenon portions of the envelopes  did plum see you  not until laterwhen i was on my way back to the hall  what did he say  nothing he acted as if he wanted to avoid me  after this the pair talked the matter over for several minutes but could reach no satisfactory conclusion regarding the bits of paper  do as you think best chip said dave at last if you want to go to doctor clay i fancy he will be glad to hear what you have to say  well if plum has those lost stamps dont you think he should be made to return them  by all means but youve got to prove he has them first and the doctor wont dare to say anything to plum until he is sure of what he is doing otherwise plums father could raise a big row and he might even sue the doctor for defamation of character or something like that  a little later found chip macklin in the doctors office the small boy was rather scared but told a fairly straight story and turned over the bits of paper to the master of the hall doctor clay was all attention  i will look into this he said in the meantime macklin i wish you would keep it to yourself  i have already told dave porter about it i wanted his advice  then request porter to remain quiet also and chip said that he would do as asked and later on did so  the end of the school term was now close at hand and dave turned to his studies with renewed vigor resolved to come out as near to the head of the class as possible he received several letters from professor potts mr wadsworth and a delicately scented note from jessie and answered them all without delay the letter from jessie he prized highly and read it half a dozen times before he stowed it carefully away among his few valued possessions  on wednesday evening dave partook rather freely of some hash that was served up on the sly sam day salted his portion and as a consequence the country boy went to bed feeling remarkably thirsty he drank one glass of water and an hour later got up to drink another only to find the water pitcher empty  its no use ive got to have a drink he told himself and if i catch the fellow who salted my hash  he slipped into part of his clothing and taking the water pitcher made his way through the hallway to the nearest of the bathrooms here he obtained the coldest drink possible and then filling the pitcher started to return to dormitory no 12  as he neared the dormitory he saw somebody pass along the other end of the hallway it was a boy fully dressed and with a cap set back on his head  shadow hamilton he murmured as the boy passed close to a dimly burning hall light now what is he up to  he put down his pitcher and stole forward until he was directly behind shadow then of a sudden he beheld the boy swing around and put out his hands feeling for the rail of a rear stairs shadow hamilton was fast asleep  he is doing some more of his sleepwalking thought dave now what had i best do  there was no time to think long for the sleepwalker was already descending the back stairs slowly and noiselessly dave hurried into the dormitory set down the pitcher and aroused roger who was nearest to him  come quick he whispered slip on your clothes and dont make any noise  oh im too sleepy for fun murmured roger  this isnt fun its important come i say  thus aroused the senators son rolled from his couch and hurried into his clothing in a few minutes both boys had their shoes and caps on and along the hallway they sped and down the back stairs the door below was unlocked but closed soon they were out in the rear yard of the hall and there they beheld shadow hamilton walking slowly in the direction of the boathouse  who is it whispered roger  it is shadow he is walking in his sleep i want to find out where he is going and what hell do  humph this certainly is interesting answered the senators son  whatever you do roger dont arouse him or there may be an accident cautioned dave let him go his own way  but he may hurt himself anyway  no he wont a sleepwalker can walk a slack wire if he tries it and never tumble havent you heard of them walking on the ridge pole of a house i have  ive read about such things and i know they say you mustnt arouse them he is going into the boathouse  the chums ran forward and reached the doorway of the boathouse just as shadow hamilton was coming out the somnambulist had a pair of oars and he stepped to the edge of the dock and untied one of the boats and leaped in  i must find them they heard the youth mutter to himself i must find them and bring them back  did you hear that asked roger what is he talking about  that remains to be found out come let us follow him returned dave  they procured two pairs of oars and were soon in another boat and pulling behind shadow hamilton the boy who was asleep seemed to possess supernatural strength and they had no easy time of it keeping up with him his course was up the leming river past robbins point and then into a side stream that was rather narrow but almost straight for a distance of two miles  do you know where this stream leads to questioned roger  i do not  almost to the old castle that we visited last winter on our skates the day we caught that robber and saved billy dill the river makes half a dozen twists and turns before the castle is reached but this is a direct route and much shorter  can it be possible that shadow is going to the old castle queried the country boy  im sure i dont know well learn pretty soon  as my old readers know the place referred to was a dilapidated structure of brick and stone which had been erected about the time of the revolutionary war it set back in a wilderness of trees and was given over largely to the owls and to tramps it belonged to an unsettled estate that had gone into litigation and there was no telling if it would ever be rebuilt and occupied in a regular way  it was dark under the trees but by pulling close to the boat ahead dave and roger managed to keep shadow hamilton in sight as soon as the somnambulist came near to the castle he ran his boat up the bank leaped ashore and stalked toward the building  he has disappeared cried roger softly  i see him answered dave come and he led the way into the old structure and to the very rooms where the encounter with the robber and with billy dill had occurred  scarcely daring to breathe they watched shadow move around in an uncertain way touching this object and that and opening and shutting several closet doors and even poking into the chimneyplace  gone gone gone they heard him mutter what shall i do what shall i do and he gave a groan  five minutes passed and the sleepwalker left the castle and hurried to his boat his course was now down the stream toward the hall and dave and roger followed as before at the dock the boats were tied up the oars put away and shadow hamilton went back to the room from which he had come peering in dave and roger saw him undress and go to bed just as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred     chapter xiii  a photograph of importance   i should not believe it had i not seen it with my own eyes  it was in this fashion that roger expressed himself on the following day when discussing the affair of the night previous with dave shadow was around as usual he looked sleepy but otherwise acted as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened  it certainly is remarkable was daves comment the question is what made him go to the castle i think i know but i cannot speak about it but ill tell you what i should like to do roger go up to the castle while it is daylight and take a thorough look around  roger was willing to do this and the upshot of the talk was that dave and the senators son paid the old brickandstone structure a visit on the following saturday halfholiday taking phil and ben with them they went up in a boat by the short route arriving there about halfpast three oclock  there was not a soul about the deserted mansion and the few birds flew away at their approach it was a clear sunny day and they lost no time in throwing every door and window wide open so that they might have the full benefit of the light and fresh air  here is the room in which he moved around the most remarked roger gazing around earnestly but i cant say that i see anything unusual do you  they were all searching around and after a few minutes had passed ben uttered a low cry and held up a small object almost covered with dust and dirt  a class pin cried dave we must see if we can find any more of them  it was not long before phil came upon two pins sticking on a board of a closet then roger ran into the next room and after a short hunt uncovered a flat pasteboard box with several more of the class pins each a bit tarnished by the dampness but otherwise uninjured  he must have come for the pins said ben that solves the mystery of how they disappeared from mr dales possession  here is a postage stamp ejaculated phil and held it up its an old german issue he added and here are half a dozen others all evidently torn from a sheet boys shadow must have taken the doctors collection  dave said nothing to this for he had discovered a cupboard in a corner tightly closed and with the wooden button of the door missing he now opened the door of the cupboard with a knife  hello whats in there asked roger who was behind him  seems to be some clothing answered dave and hauled forth some loose garments and also an old satchel the garments formed part of a sailors garb and the satchel was marked on the bottom with the name william dill  its billy dills missing outfit cried dave eagerly oh roger how glad i am that i have found this its the best yet  all the boys were interested for they knew daves story and the tale of the strange sailor as dave ran to the light with the satchel they crowded around him  i think i am fully justified in opening this grip said the country boy he was so agitated he could scarcely speak  why certainly cried phil open it by all means it may throw light on some things which billy dill has been unable to explain  the satchel was not locked and came open with ease inside was a bag containing some loose silver and a roll of fortysix dollars in bankbills there was also a locket containing the picture of a motherly old lady probably the sailors parent under the locket were a small bible and a work on ocean navigation and at the bottom a thick brown envelope containing a photograph  let us see whose picture that is said phil and dave opened the envelope and drew the photograph forth as he held it up there was a general cry in which he was forced to join  thats the man who looks like you dave cried roger  what a striking resemblance exclaimed phil  and he has the mustache just as the sailor said added ben dave that man looks enough like you to be your older brother or your father  dave said nothing for he was too much overcome to speak as he gazed at the picture he began to tremble from head to foot taking away the mustache the face was exactly like his own only older and more careworn he did not wonder that billy dill had become confused because of the resemblance he turned the picture over there was not a scrap of printing or writing on it anywhere  what was the meaning of this mystery what was this man to him was he the man who had once lost a child through a crazy nurse in his perplexed state of mind the questions were maddening ones to the boy  what do you think of it dave asked phil after a pause and the eyes of all the others were turned on the poorhouse boy  what do i think of it he repeated slowly i think this i am going to find this man if he is alive even if i have to go around the world to do it he must know something of my pastmost likely he is a relative of mine i am going to be a poorhouse nobody no longer i am going to establish my identityand i am going to do that before i do anything else  dave spoke deliberately weighing every word it was almost as if he was registering a vow the others saw a look of determination settle on his face and knew that he would do as he said  the boy from the country had suddenly lost interest in clearing up the mystery surrounding shadow hamilton and allowed the others to finish the search for class pins and postage stamps one more pin was found and three rare stamps from brazil and then the search was abandoned and they returned to oak hall dave carrying the sailors possessions  that evening there was an interesting interview in doctor clays office in which dave and his friends took an active part the worthy master of oak hall listened to all the boys had to tell with keen attention and smiled quietly when told how dave and roger had first followed shadow in his somnambulistic feat he took possession of the class pins and the stamps and said the latter were undoubtedly from his collection  we now have nearly all of the class pins he said but fully ninetenths of the postage stamps are still missing and they represent a value of at least twentyfive hundred dollars i am tolerably sure that maurice hamilton took them in his sleep but the question is did he destroy the others or did somebody else come along and take them  i believe chip macklin came to see you sir said dave significantly  he did porter and i am going to follow that clew upif it is a clew answered doctor clay gravely  after the others had departed dave showed the things he had found belonging to billy dill the master of the hall was as much astonished as anybody over the resemblance between his pupil and the photograph and examined the picture with care  i do not wonder that you wish to investigate this said he i should wish to do so were i in your position  i have simply got to do it doctor cried dave i shall not be able to settle my mind on a thing until its done would you go home and see mr wadsworth and professor potts first or go direct to that sailor  why not send a long letter to your friends telling them what you have told me you can add that i agree that the photograph resembles you closely and that you wish to talk the matter over once again with this william dill  as impatient as he was dave concluded to follow this advice and a letter of ten pages was sent to mr wadsworth and to caspar potts the next morning in the meantime it may be added here doctor clay had a closer watch than ever set on shadow hamiltons movements and he also began a quiet investigation of gus plums doings  the letter that dave sent to crumville created a sensation in the wadsworth household and was read and reread several times by the members of the manufacturers family and by professor potts  there is undoubtedly something in this said the professor it certainly is entitled to a strict investigation if you will permit me i will run up to oak hall to see dave and then take him to see this billy dill  i will go with you answered the rich manufacturer the outing will do us both good and i am greatly interested in daves welfare i only trust that there is a happy future in store for him  and i say the same sir for no boy deserves it more answered professor potts  a telegram was sent to dave and on the following day oliver wadsworth and caspar potts journeyed to oakdale dave met them at the depot with the hall carriage  there he is exclaimed old caspar potts rushing up and shaking hands my boy my boy i am glad to see you again and he fairly quivered with emotion  and i am glad to see you cried dave in return he shook hands with both men mr wadsworth it was kind of you to answer my letter so quickly he added  i knew you would be anxious dave my how well and strong you look the air up here must do you good  it is a very healthful spot answered the youth and i like it better than i can tell  a fine schoola fine school murmured professor potts you could not go to a better  on the way to the hall dave told his story in detail and exhibited the photograph which he had brought with him scarcely daring to leave it out of his sight  it is just as you have said remarked oliver wadsworth a most remarkable resemblance truly  that man must be some relative to dave added caspar potts there could not be such a resemblance otherwise it is undoubtedly the same strain of blood he may be a father uncle cousin elder brotherthere is no telling what but he is a relative i will stake my reputation on it  the visitors were cordially greeted at oak hall by doctor clay and made to feel perfectly at home they were given rooms for the night and in the morning the doctor and his visitors and dave had breakfast together  it had been decided that a visit should be paid to billy dill that very afternoon and by nine oclock mr wadsworth professor potts and dave were on the way to the town where was located the sanitarium to which the sailor had been taken dave had the tars satchel and clothing with him and the precious photograph was stowed away in his pocket just then he would not have parted with that picture for all the money in the world     chapter xiv  a gleam of light   i would advise that you keep that satchel and the picture out of sight at first said professor potts as he rang the bell of the sanitarium talk to the old sailor and try to draw him out then show him his belongings when you think the time ripe  mr wadsworth and dave thought this good advice and when they were ushered into the old sailors presence the boy kept the satchel behind him  well douse my toplights but im glad to see ye all cried billy dill as he shook hands its kind o you to pay a visit to such an old wreck as i am  oh youre no wreck mr dill answered oliver wadsworth well soon have you as right and tight as any craft afloat he added falling into the tars manner of speaking  bless the day when i can float once more sir do you know ive been thinkin that a whiff o salt air would do me a sight o good might fix my steerin apparatus and the tar tapped his forehead  then you must have a trip to the ocean by all means said caspar potts he turned to the rich manufacturer it might be easily arranged  dill i want to talk to you about the time you were out in the south seas said dave who could bear the suspense no longer now please follow me closely will you  will if i can my hearty the sailors forehead began to wrinkle you know my memory box has got its cargo badly shifted  dont you remember when you were down thereat cavasa island and elsewherehow hard times were and how somebody helped you  seems to me i do  dont you remember traveling around with your bundle and your satchel you had some money in bankbills and some loose silver and a work on navigation and a bible  yes yes i remember the bibleit was the one my aunt gave megod bless her she aunt lizzietook care o me when my mother died an she told me to read it every dayan i did most o the time  well you had the bible and your satchel and your bundle of clothes went on dave impressively and at that time you fell in with a man who afterwards gave you his photograph  so i didthe man who looks like you but i  wait a minute dont you remember his telling you a story about a crazy nurse and a lost child  i certainly do but  dave drew the photograph from his pocket and thrust it forward directly before the tars eyes  there is the man he cried now what is his name tell me his name at once  illustration tell me his name at oncepage 121  dunston porter fairly shouted the sailor dunston porter thats it i knew i would remember it sometime dunston porter of course it was funny how i forgot it better write it down afore it slips my cable again  dunston porter murmured dave and the others likewise repeated the name  ha this is remarkable ejaculated caspar potts dave do you remember what you called yourself when you were first found and taken to the poorhouse  i do sir i called myself davy and porter and dundun  exactly and dundun meant dunston you were trying to repeat the name dunston porter  that would seem to be the fact came from oliver wadsworth and if so he paused significantly  you think my real name is dunston porter  either that or else that is the name of some relative of yours  daves heart beat fast he felt that he was getting at least a faint glimpse of his past he turned again to billy dill  then this dunston porter was your friend he observed  he was and he helped me when i was stranded was the answer i cant give ye all the particulars cos some o em is more like a dream than anything to me when i try to think my head begins to swim and the sailor wrinkled his forehead as before and twitched his eyes  tell me one thing said the rich manufacturer do you think this dunston porter is still at cavasa island or in that locality  i suppose soi dont know  when did you come away from there asked professor potts  it must be nigh on to a year ago i came straight to frisco went up the coast on a lumber boat to puget sound and then took passage to new york next i drifted up here to look up some friends and you know what happened after that  was dunston porter alone out there questioned oliver wadsworth  whyeri cant say as to that he didnt say much about himself that i can remember once he told me about that child butbut its hazyi cant think oh it drives me crazy when i try to think the roar of the sea gets in my ears and the light from the lighthouse fires my brain and the old tar began to pace the floor in a rolling gait  he is growing excited whispered caspar potts it is too bad were he in his right mind he might be able to tell us a great deal  supposing we go out and have lunch together suggested oliver wadsworth and then we can go for a ride on the lake  he spoke to the sanitarium manager and the upshot of the matter was that the whole party went out to a hotel for dinner previous to going dave gave billy dill the satchel and money and the bundle which seemed to tickle the tar immensely  douse my toplight but i feel like old times again he cried when they had had a good dinner and were seated on the forward deck of one of the lake boats used to take out pleasure parties oh but i love the water  i suppose this doesnt look anything like around cavasa island remarked dave trying to draw the sailor out  not much my boy cavasa island has a volcano in the middle of it and once in a while that volcano gets busy and folks run for their lives an they have earthquakes too once i was out with dunston porter and along came an earthquake and the other fellow mr lemington almost had his leg broken  who was mr lemington asked caspar potts quickly  why he was dunston porters partner in the treasurehunting scheme oh i didnt tell you about that did i funny how it slipped my mind eh they went to the volcano for the treasure i guess that was when the baby disappearedand that other mani dont remember much of him he was wild it was misty misty but they didnt get any treasure i know that and then mr lemington got disgusted and sailed for australia  did you ever see the baby asked dave  did i whyi think so i dont remember  this was all they could get out of the sailor try their best and upon oliver wadsworths advice they did not bother him any further before returning to the sanitarium the rich manufacturer called dave to one side  dave do you want to go to cavasa island he asked with a quiet smile  i do was the prompt answer i was going to speak to you about it you know i told you that phil lawrence is goingon one of his fathers ships this summer id like very much to go with phil  then you shall go if we can make the necessary arrangements now what i want to know is do you not think it would be an excellent thing to take this billy dill along the trip might cure him entirely and he might aid you greatly in clearing up this mystery  why mr wadsworth you must have been reading my thoughts exclaimed the country boy i was going to suggest that very thing  then we will speak to dill about it before we leave him do you know when your friend lawrence is to join his fathers ship  no sir but i can soon find out and here is mr lawrences address if you want it added dave and wrote it on a card  when the idea of sailing on the pacific once more was broached to billy dill his eyes lit up with pleasure  id like nothing better he cried ive been athinkin i might ship again i cant stay an be spongin on you folks any longer it wouldnt be proper i want to pay up now dave has found my money for me  keep your money dill returned oliver wadsworth you may need it later and then he explained what dave wished to do and how the tar might accompany the youth on his long trip  ill goan glad o the chance said billy dill readily just draw up your articles an ill sign em any time ye want and so the matter was settled  dave returned to oak hall late that night in a very thoughtful mood so much had been done and said that he wanted time in which to think it over it was not until the next day that he got a chance to talk matters over with phil and roger both of whom listened attentively to his tale  it seems to me you are learning something dave said roger i hope the whole matter is cleared up before long then plum and poole will have to stop casting slurs on you  and now phil i want to go out to the south seas with you continued dave and what is more i am going to ask your father to find a place on the vessel for billy dill  i fancy hell do that if i ask him answered phil ill write and tell the whole story and i know he will be as much interested as i am  i wish i was going on that trip with you said roger such an outing would suit me to a t  i guess there will be room enough for another passenger answered phil why dont you ask your folks about it  i will burst out the senators son they are going to europe you know i was to go along but ill see if i cant go with you two instead  after that there was a good deal of letterwriting and the boys waited anxiously for replies in the meanwhile the final examinations for the term began dave did his best to keep his mind on his lessons and succeeded so well that he came out second from the top studious polly vane heading the list roger came next to dave with ben basswood fourth phil sixth and sam day seventh gus plum was almost at the end of the list and nat poole was but little better in a lower class luke watson stood second buster beggs fourth and chip macklin fifth shadow hamilton although generally a good student dropped to tenth place in his class  i am more than gratified at this showing said doctor clay when the examinations were over the general average is higher than usual you have done well and i shall award the prizes with much pleasure  after that there was an entertainment lasting the best part of the afternoon and in the evening the students celebrated by a bonfire on the campus and a general merrymaking they sang the school song over and over again and gave the hall cry           baseball           football           oak hall           has the call     biff boom bang whoop  tonights the night whispered phil as he entered the school with his chums just wait and see     chapter xv  winding up the school term   i must say i dont feel much like fun tonight observed dave as he hurried up the stairs to dormitory no 12 i am anxious to get started on that trip to the pacific  oh that will hold for one day longer said ben i wish i was going too roger have you got word yet  no but i expect a letter tomorrow if it doesnt come ill have to wait till i get home  dave was in advance and was the first to throw open the dormitory door as he did so a powerful smell of onions greeted him  great cæsar he ejaculated smells like an onion factory up here somebody must have been eating a dozen or two open the window phil while i make a light  hello whats this spluttered ben and fell headlong over something a decayed cabbage who put that on the floor  look out everybody shouted roger i just stepped on something soft phew some decayed sweet potatoes  by this time dave made a light and all of the boys who had come up gazed around the dormitory then a cry of amazement and anger arose  this is a roughhouse and no mistake  somebody has been heaving decayed vegetables all over the room  yes and ancient eggs too this is an outrage  here is a rotten cabbage in my trunk called out roger he held the object at arms length id like to soak the fellow who did it he added savagely  with caution all made an investigation they found their clothing and other belongings disarranged and decayed vegetables stale eggs and sour milk were everywhere in evidence it was a mess bad enough to make them weep  we ought to report this was phils comment i dont mind real fun but this is going too far  this stuff must have come from the cellar put in buster beggs i heard the head cook telling pop swingly that the place must be cleaned out or he would report it to the doctor swingly said he didnt know the bad stuff was there  well swingly didnt put the stuff here put in dave its the work of some of the other fellows  i know where the janitor is cried ben shall i go down and question him maybe he can give us a pointer  yes go ahead said dave  and ill go along added the senators son and a moment later the two boys were off  while the pair were gone the others surveyed the damage done the most of the decayed vegetables were swept into a corner and then the boys did what they could toward straightening out their things  heres a stale egg in my hatbox groaned sam id like to throw it at some fellows head  dave had found his trunk open and was searching the box with care suddenly he gave a loud cry  its gone its gone  whats gone queried phil  the photograph i had it among my books and papers and the whole bunch is missing  you mean the photo of the man who looks like you asked sam quickly  yes dave gave a groan that came straight from his heart oh boys i must get that back i cant afford to lose it i must get it back it is worth more to me than anything in the world he was so agitated that he could scarcely control himself  let us hunt for the picture came from buster beggs who knew about the photograph and all started a search which lasted until ben and roger returned  weve discovered the chaps who are responsible said ben in triumph  they are gus plum and nat poole asserted the senators son pop swingly was throwing this stuff away in a hole back of the campus when plum and poole came up he heard them talking about playing a trick but he didnt think theyd lower themselves by touching the mess i suppose they thought that they were doing something quite smart  daves photo is gone said phil we have been hunting for it everywhere  you dont say dave that is too bad  we ought to make plum and poole clean up this mess came from buster let us try to capture them  the suggestion met with instant approval and the boys started to locate the bully and his crony plum and poole were still below but shadow hamilton announced that they were preparing to come up by a side stairs  we must get them sure cried dave i want that picture back if nothing else  soon one boy who was acting as a spy announced the coming of plum and poole the pair were allowed to reach the door of their dormitory when they were pounced on from behind and made prisoners they tried to escape but the crowd was too many for them and towels pulled down over their mouths kept them from raising an outcry  whats the meaning of this spluttered nat poole when he found himself and his crony in dormitory no 12 and with the door closed and locked  it means in the first place that i want my things back said dave and especially a photograph that was between my books  humph that photo is burned up growled gus plum  gus plum gasped dave he could say no more  plum do you mean to say you burned that picture up demanded roger if you did you ought to be tarred and feathered for it  he wouldnt dare to do it came boldly from phil if he did i know what dave will dohave him sent to jail for it  bah you cant send me to jail for a little fun blustered the bully  that is no fun plum put in ben that photo was of great importance if you burned it up you will surely suffer  is it really burned or not muttered dave hoarsely answer me youyou cur and he caught the bully by the throat  lelet godont strangle me nnoits all right i was only fooling  then where is it  in thethe closeton the top shelf  dave dropped his hold and ran to the closet pointed out true enough on the top shelf in a back corner were the books with the precious photograph between them dave lost no time in placing the picture in an inside pocket  youre a fine fellow not to take a bit of fun without getting mad grumbled gus plum he did not dare to say too much in such a crowd  so you call this fun remarked phil sarcastically fun to play the scavenger and bring this stuff up here well i must say i dont like your preference for a calling  look here you neednt call us scavengers howled nat poole i am a gentleman i am  well you brought this up here you and plum  it was only area joke everybody has got to put up with jokes tonight  well you are going to put up with a little hard work came from roger  work  yes you and plum are going to clean up the muss and put this room in applepie order  huh i see myself doing it stormed the aristocratic youth  you will do it observed ben isnt that so fellows  there was a chorus of approvals  so take off your coats and get to work said dave who felt easier now that he had the picture back i guess you both need a little exercise  ill be hanged if i do a stroke roared gus plum  hardly had he spoken when ben caught up a pitcher of icewater and held it over the bullys head  take your choice plum he cried and allowed a little of the icewater to trickle down the bullys backbone there was a roar of fright and a shiver  oh dont do that do you want to freeze me to death  now poole maybe you want some added ben advancing poole tried to retreat stumbled and sat down heavily on a decayed cabbage which squashed beneath him he set up a roar  now see what youve done ben basswood my best gray suit too ill fix you for this  both of you must get to work declared dave well give you two minutes in which to get started if you dont start  well roll you in the decayed vegetables and kick you out finished buster beggs with the term so nearly ended he was growing reckless ill play timekeeper and he drew out his watch  plum and poole begged and protested but all to no purpose and badly scared took off their coats and cuffs rolled up their sleeves and began to clean up the muss they had made while this was under way the other boys of the dormitory came up and viewed the scene with amazement and satisfaction  at last the dirty job was at an end at least so far as plum and poole could go they had worked hard and were bathed in perspiration and their hands were in anything but a clean condition both were boiling mad but neither dared to say a word for fear the others would make them do more  now you have learned your trade said phil finally you can graduate as fullfledged scavengers when you go out dont fail to place that bag of nasty stuff in a corner of your own room the smell will give you both pleasant dreams  phil lawrence began the bully  just wait till i came from nat poole  silence cried dave not a word or youll be sorry take up the bag now march  the door was flung open and with the bag of messy stuff between them plum and poole marched forth into the corridor and to the stairs leading to the back yard the boys of dormitory no 12 watched them out of sight then returned to their room  ill wager they are the maddest boys in the hall said dave when the door had been locked once more  will they come back do you think questioned roger  i dont think so but we can be on our guard  they remained on guard for half an hour but plum and poole did not reappear they had had enough of their socalled fun and they sneaked out of sight at the first opportunity  but without this there was fun galore that night in the various dormitories two crowds of boys held feasts to which even the monitors were invited and dormitories nos 3 and 4 got into a pillow fight in the midst of which job haskers appeared the teacher was knocked over by a pillow and then some other pillows were piled on top of him after that he was hustled out of the room and completely bewildered he rolled down the broad stairs bumping on every step then pop swingly came up followed by horsehair the carriage driver to quell the disturbance and each received a pitcher of icewater over his head which made both beat a hasty retreat but by one oclock the school quieted down and all of the pupils went to sleep as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred     chapter xvi  preparing for a long trip   illustration goodby to oak hallpage 137  whoop hurrah off we go goodby to oak hall  the carryall belonging to the school was moving away from the campus it was loaded with students and behind it came two wagons full of trunks and dresssuit cases back on the campus a crowd was assembled to bid the departing ones goodby  write to me often  dont forget tom atlantic city middle of august  be sure and ask him to join the team  yes we are going to casco bay come up if you can  tell jacksay get off my toes will you tell jack to come up to lake titus back of malone well give him a dandy  toot toot toot now then horsehair start em up and be lively or ill miss that connection for albany  ill start em up all right if you young gents will give me a show responded the driver say buster dont use the whip give me the reins master porter  dont you want me to drive horsehair  no i wantsay you in the back give me my hat will you shouted the driver turning around i aint agoing a step till i git that hat  all right horsehair darling replied sam day i thought id keep it to remember you by but if you want  which puts me in mind of a story said shadow hamilton he had caught the humor of the occasion a lady once  no stories allowed broke in phil  i cant tell a story unless i speak it aloud answered shadow tartly  phew what a pun came from roger somebody please dump him off for that  hold tight all of you called out the anxious driver and with a lurch the carryall made a turn and started out of the academy grounds and along the broad highway leading to oakdale all of the boys shouted themselves hoarse and horns and rattles added to the din such a thing as holding the students in was out of the question and doctor clay and his assistants did not attempt it the doctor and andrew dale smiled broadly and waved their hands and only job haskers looked bored the other teachers were busy in the building and did not show themselves  this was the first load to leave and another was ready to depart directly after dinner nearly all of the boys were in high spirits and sang and cut up all the way to the town much to the terror of jackson lemond known only to the lads as horsehair because he carried the signs of his calling continually  if there was one boy in the crowd particularly sober at times it was shadow hamilton doctor clay had communicated with his parents and mr hamilton and the master of the school had had a long conference regarding the pins and stamps that had been taken shadows father had agreed to pay for the missing articles if they could not be recovered inside of the next few months in the meantime a private detective was to be called in to watch the movements of gus plum  at oakdale the party split into three parts one to go up the railroad line another to go down and the third to take the connection for albany phil roger ben and dave took the same train and managed to get seats together  i wish i had heard from my folks remarked roger but i think it is all right he added hopefully  dont be too sure roger said dave i dont want you to be disappointed  i shall write to you as soon as i get home and can talk to my father said phil to dave well be able to arrange everything without much trouble i am sure  near the end of their journey dave and ben found themselves alone roger and phil having said goodby at places further up the road as they neared crumville the heart of the country boy beat quicker how many things had happened since he had left that town to go to oak hall  i see the old white church steeple cried ben as they came out of a patch of timber looks natural doesnt it  i feel as if i had been away a year instead of a few months answered dave he was peering anxiously out of the window here we come to the station and yes there is mr wadsworths automobile and mr wadsworth himself and jessie  soon the train came to a halt and they piled out dresssuit cases in hand and walked over to the automobile  how do you do cried jessie wadsworth a beautiful miss of thirteen with soft eyes and golden curls i told papa you would be on this train  how do you do returned dave dropping his suit case to lift his cap and shake hands i hope you are well  oh i am replied the miss shaking back her curls how do you do ben and then there was more handshaking  both of the boys were invited to enter the automobile and did so and in a few minutes ben found himself at his own door then the machine was turned toward the wadsworth mansion  i like to go riding with papa explained jessie i never go out with our man though not sinceyou know and she turned a pair of grateful eyes upon dave that made the boy color up  the machine appears to be perfectly safe since we have had it repaired put in mr wadsworth but our man is better with the horses  at the mansion mrs wadsworth an aristocratic but motherly lady came out to greet dave followed by caspar potts whose face was wreathed in smiles all told it was a homecoming that would have warmed the heart of any lad and it made dave forget completely that he was a poorhouse nobody  you must tell me all about everything said jessie after a somewhat elaborate supper had been served i dont want to miss a single thing  seems to me you are cutting out a big job for dave laughed her father  well i guess i can tell all shell wish to hear answered the youth and seated at one end of a couch with jessie at the other he told much of his life at oak hall with its studies its pranks and its athletic sports dave could see the humorous side of a thing as well as anybody and some stories he told made mr and mrs wadsworth laugh as well as jessie on his trials he touched but lightly for he could not dream of giving his little lady friend pain  on the following day nat poole came home and dave met the aristocratic youth in one of the stores of crumville poole gave him a glassy stare and did not speak a few minutes later dave met ben  just ran into poole said the latter and what do you think he made out that he didnt see me  he was in parsons store but he wouldnt speak to me either answered dave he must feel awfully sore but i shant mind  nor i dave i never did like that fellow and i dont like his father either by the way have you heard anything more about the farm that belongs to professor potts  yes and i am glad and so is he that we didnt let nats father get hold of it the new trolley company is going to put a line past it and mr wadsworth says it will be quite valuable in time  two days passed and then dave got long letters from phil and roger senator morr had been to see mr lawrence and had arranged to have his son go on the long trip to the south seas roger was almost wild with joy and said he was going to prepare for the trip immediately  the letter from phil told dave that the start for san francisco was to be made on the following monday morning all the boys were to meet at the grand central depot in new york city and take the limited express which left for chicago at noon  i will go with you as far as new york announced mr wadsworth i wish to see that your journey is safely begun  the last days of the week were busy ones for dave a steamer trunk was procured for him and into this was packed his outfit including a seminautical suit that fitted him to perfection and gave him quite a sailor look  i suppose youll be a regular sailor by the time you come back said jessie  i dont know about that answered dave i am not going for that purpose and his tone grew serious  oh i know that dave i hope you find what you are going for butbut  but what jessie  oh ii dont want you to leave us dave if you find a father or an uncle or brother or somebody like that i suppose you wont stay with us any more and the young miss pouted engagingly  ill certainly not care to leave you jessie he answered gently but you cannot blame me for wanting to find out who i am i am sure  oh no dave  i dont want to remain a nobody and have folks shun me on that account  who would do such a thing she asked her eyes opening widely  oh a good many folks  it is very mean of them came from the little miss firmly but never mind dave ill not shun you she went on catching his hand and squeezing it as hard as she could were going to be just like a brother and sister always arent we  if you say so  dont you say so dave  yes jessie  then that is settled and we wont talk about it any more shun you i just want to see them do it i wont speak to anybody that does such a thing and jessie looked as tragic as a miss of thirteen can look  among the things provided by thoughtful mr wadsworth for dave was a money belt and in this was placed a fair amount of bankbills and also a letter of credit  mr wadsworth you are more than kind cried the country boy and something like tears stood in his honest eyes how can i ever repay you  in one way only dave by making a real man of yourself  i shall do my best sir  then that is all i ask  billy dill had been communicated with and caspar potts went after the tar and brought him to crumville where oliver wadsworth procured the sailor a new outfit billy dills health was now restored completely and the only thing he suffered from was a slight loss of memory and even that defect seemed to be gradually wearing away  ill be the happiest tar afloat when i have the rolling ocean under me once more said he to dave cables an capstans but i do love the salt breeze  well youll soon get enough of it answered the boy we have a long trip before us     chapter xvii  the trip to the far west   my stars what a very busy place  this was daves exclamation as he and oliver wadsworth hurried along one of the streets of new york city on the way to buy some small thing which had been forgotten they had arrived in the metropolis an hour ahead of time and the country boy had stared at the many sights in wonder  it is one of the busiest cities in the world answered the manufacturer with a smile a fortune can be made or lost here in no time  i believe you and the people why there is a regular crowd no matter where you turn  dont you think youd like the city dave  i dont knowperhaps i should after i got used to it  roger and phil had not yet come in and they had left billy dill at the depot to watch out for them on returning to the station dave and mr wadsworth met the three at the doors  here we are again cried roger shaking hands and not very much time to spare either  is the train in asked the manufacturer  will be in a few minutes so the gateman said answered phil  they saw to it that their trunks were properly cared for and a short while after the cars came in and they climbed aboard seats had been engaged beforehand so there was no trouble on that score  now remember to write whenever you get the chance said oliver wadsworth to dave and if you run short of funds dont hesitate to let me know  ill remember and thank you very much replied dave and then the long train moved off slowly at first and then at a good rate of speed daves long journey to solve the mystery of his identity had begun  say what mountain is this were goin under anyway came presently from the sailor i noticed it when i came to new york  this isnt a mountain laughed roger it is new york city itself we are under the streets  great whales wonder they dont knock down the wall o somebuddys cellar  it was not long before they came out into the open and then both dave and the sailor looked out of the windows with interest phil and roger were more used to traveling and spent the time in pointing out objects of interest and in answering questions  the fine coach was a revelation to billy dill who in the past had traveled exclusively in the ordinary day cars  these here seats are better nor them in a barber shop he observed an thet little smokingroom is the handiest i ever see but boys we made one big mistake he added suddenly  whats that asked phil  unless we tie up to an eatin house on the way well be starved nobody brung any grub along  dont worry about that said roger with a wink at the others i think i can scrape up some crackers and cheese somewhere  well thats betteralthough i allow as how we could have brought some ham sandwiches as well as not  they had all had dinner so nobody was hungry until about six oclock when a waiter from the diningcar came through in his white apron  first call to supper  wots thet queried billy dill  come and see answered dave and led the way to the diningcar when the old sailor saw the tables and saw some folks eating as if at home he stared in amazement  well keelhaul me if this dont beat the dutch he ejaculated dropping into a chair pointed out to him reglar hotel dininroom on wheels aint it never heard o such a thing in my life never say roger better keep that crackers an cheese out o sight or theyll laugh at ye he added with a chuckle  you never saw anything like this then asked dave  never i allers traveled in one o them plain everyday kind o trains an took my grub along in a pasteboard box  though amazed billy dill was not slow about eating what was set before him and he declared the repast the finest he had ever tasted after the meal he went into the smoking compartment for a smoke and then came back to the boys  feelin a bit sleepy he announced i suppose there aint no objections to my going to sleep  not at all said phil do you want your berth made up right away  humph thats a good one laughed the tar they may have an eatin room but they aint got no bedrooms an i know it ill do my best in the seat though i allow a reglar long sofy would be better  just you wait until i call the porter said roger and touched the pushbutton this gentleman will have his berth made up he went on as the porter appeared  yes sah  make it up with real sheets messmate put in billy dill thinking it was a joke an you might add a real feather piller while ye are at it  yes sah answered the porter with a grin please step to another seat sah  come said dave and arose and took billy dill to the opposite side of the sleepingcoach  the old tar dropped into a vacant seat and watched the porter as he began to make up the berths from a smile his face changed to a look of wonder and when he saw the clean sheets blankets and pillows brought forth he could scarcely control himself  cables capstans an codfish he murmured thet beats the dininroom dont it say maybe they hev got a ballroom on board an a church an aafarm an a few more things  not quite answered roger with a laugh but there is a library if you want any books to read  beats all why this here train is equipped like a regular ship aint she  almost said dave here are two berths you can take one and ill take the other  good enough dave which will ye have  the boy said he preferred the lower berth and billy dill swung himself up in true sailor fashion to that above  makes me think o a ship he declared i know ill sleep like a rock and half an hour later he was in the land of dreams and then the boys also retired  morning found them well on their way to chicago and just before noon they rolled into the great city by the lakes here they had two hours to wait and spent the time in getting dinner and taking a short ride around to see the sights  this is as far west as i have been said roger the rest of the journey will be new to me  i once took a journey to los angeles said phil but i went and returned by the southern route so this is new to me also  i have never traveled anywherethat is since i can remember put in dave but i am sure i am going to like itthat is if i dont get seasick when i am on the ocean  oh i suppose well all get our dose of that responded the senators son  maybe not said billy dill some gits it an some dont  nightfall found them well on the second portion of their journey to san francisco there was an observation car on the train and the whole party spent hours seated on campchairs viewing scenery as it rushed past them now and then for a change they would read and billy dill would smoke and the boys often talked over what was before them  my father said i might tell you the object of my trip said phil to his chums but he does not want anybody else to know of it unless it becomes necessary for me to say something to the captain the supercargo of the ship is a man named jasper van blott he has worked for my father for some years and my father always thought him honest but lately things have happened which have caused my father to suspect this supercargo he sometimes disposes of certain portions of a cargo and his returns are not what they should be  then you are to act as a sort of spy said roger  i am to watch everything he does without letting him know exactly what i am doing and when he makes a deal of any kind i am to do my best to ascertain if his returns are correct if i find he is honest my father is going to retain him and increase his salary if he is dishonest my father will discharge him and possibly prosecute him  have you ever met this van blott asked dave  once when he called on my father two years ago he is a smooth talker but i did not fancy his general style he is supposed to be a firstclass business man and that is why my father has retained him i do not believe captain marshall likes him much by the way he writes to father  have you ever met captain marshall  oh yes twice youll like him i know he is so bluff and hearty my father has known him for many years and he thinks the captain one of the best skippers afloat he has sailed the pacific for ten years and never suffered a serious accident  in that case well be pretty safe in sailing under him observed roger it will certainly be a long tripfour thousand miles or more  do you know anybody else on the ship asked dave  i do not and i dont know much about the ship herself excepting that she is named the stormy petrel father bought her about a year ago she is said to be a very swift bark and yet she has great carrying capacity  will you please explain to me just what a bark is said roger i must confess i am rather dumb on nautical matters  a bark is a vessel with three masts the front mast or foremast as sailors call it and the main or middle mast are rigged as a ship that is with regular yardarms and sails the back mast called the mizzen mast is rigged schooner fashion that is with a swinging boom  thats plain enough hurrah for the stormy petrel dave well be fullfledged sailors before we know it  we must get billy dill to teach us a thing or two before we go aboard said the country boy then we wont appear so green  this all thought good advice and for the remainder of the journey they frequently talked nautical matters over with the old tar billy dill had his book on navigation with him and also a general work on seamanship and he explained to them how a ship and especially a bark was constructed and taught them the names of the ropes and sails and many other things  youll soon get the swing on it he declared it aint so much to learn fer a feller as is bright an willin to learn its only the blockheads as cant master it but i allow as how none o you expect to work afore the mast do ye  not exactly answered phil but there is no harm in learning to do a sailors work in case we are ever called on to take hold somebody might get sick you know  thets true ladan i can tell ye one thing a ship in a storm on the pacific an shorthanded aint no plaything to deal with concluded the old tar     chapter xviii  sailing of the stormy petrel   as soon as the party arrived at san francisco phil set out to learn if the stormy petrel was in port this was easy for the firm of which mr lawrence was the head had a regular shipping office near the docks  yes she is in and almost loaded said the clerk at the office as soon as he learned phils identity ill take you down to her if you wish  very well answered the youth and soon he and his chums and billy dill were on board of the bark a gang of stevedores were on hand bringing aboard boxes crates and barrels and in the midst of the crowd were captain frank marshall and van blott the supercargo both directing operations  well well ejaculated the captain on catching sight of phil got here at last eh glad to see you so these are the young gentlemen to go along well i reckon youll find the trip long enough glad to know you porter and the same to you morr yes we are mighty busy just now got a little of the cargo in the wrong waytell you about it laterthe last words to phil i shall be glad of your company go down into the cabin and make yourselves at home and ill be with you presently  thank you answered phil but is that mr van blott over yonder  it is want to see him trot along if you do and the captain turned to his work once more  by his general manner captain marshall showed that he did not wish to come into contact with the supercargo just then and phil walked over to that personage alone the supercargo was a tall thin individual with a sallow face and a thin yellowish mustache  this is mr van blott i believe said phil  yes was the short and crusty answer and the supercargo gave the boy a sharp look  i am phil lawrence i guess you do not remember me  oh cried the supercargo and his manner changed instantly how do you do i didnt think youd be here quite so soon i hope your father is well  yes sir then you got his letter mr van blott  yes this morning i havent read it very carefully yet he said something about you helping me if i needed help well i wont bother you much i have done the work alone in the past and i can do it now  i am willing to do all i can to assist you said phil politely  i dont doubt it but i wont trouble youso you and your friends can just lie back and enjoy yourselves returned jasper van blott smoothly no use in working when you are on a vacation  oh i shant call it work i want to learn a little about the business some day you know i am to go into my fathers office  at this a slight frown crossed the supercargos face but he quickly smiled it off as you please he said but excuse me now im very busy we are trying to get ready to sail tomorrow by noon and there is still a great deal to do  in some way phil felt himself dismissed and he rejoined dave and roger who were standing by the companionway all went below to find the cabin of the stormy petrel deserted  this is a fine cabin remarked dave gazing around its as cozy as can be  where is billy dill asked phil  he said hed go forward and await orders  did he say anything about the vessel  said she looked to be a firstclass sailer and in prime condition answered the senators son he was delighted with her  what do you think of the captain  i think i shall like him returned dave roger thinks the same  i dont like that supercargo went on phil lowering his voice i am afraid i shall have trouble with him before the trip is over he doesnt want me to know a thing about what he is doing  a little later captain marshall came in and showed them the staterooms they were to occupyone fairsized one for dave and roger and a smaller one adjoining for phil then he introduced the boys to his first mate paul shepley and to several others when he got phil by himself he asked the youth if the supercargo had said anything about the loading of the bark  not a word answered phil why do you ask that question  we had some trouble just before you came on board mr van blott wanted some things done one way and i wanted them another he thinks he can run things but i am going to let him understand that i am master here i tell you this because i want you to understand how matters are going  from what you say i dont think you like mr van blott said phil if so let me say i dont think i shall like him myself  oh i can get along with him if he will mind his own business and do what is right answered the captain of the stormy petrel but he must not attempt to dictate to me even if he is the supercargo  well i trust we have no trouble answered phil with a sigh but the trouble he felt was already in the air  late that afternoon their baggage came on board and the boys set to work to establish themselves on the ship which was to be their home for so many weeks to come in the meantime billy dill reported to the captain and was assigned to his place in the forecastle as an extra hand at full pay the old tar was pleased mightily and the smell of oakum and bilge water appeared to act on him like a tonic he was one to make friends readily and soon established himself as a favorite among the foremast hands  in the morning the boys took a final run ashore purchasing a few things they thought they needed and mailing some long letters home coming back to the bark they caught sight of the supercargo coming with another man from a drinking place on a corner  humph that shows he drinks muttered phil  i think most seafaring men do answered roger  captain marshall does not  they had to pass the supercargo who stood on the corner with his back to them talking to the other man just as they went by they heard van blott remark  dont worry this trip is going to pay me big bangor and when i come back you shall have all that is coming to you this was all the three boys heard but it set phil to thinking  id like to know how this trip is going to pay him big said the shipowners son father says he gets his regular salary and a small commission  perhaps he has some private deal he wishes to put through suggested dave  no by his agreement he has no right to do any outside work his time belongs exclusively to the stormy petrel and her cargo  they returned to the bark and quarter of an hour later the supercargo followed with a flushed face that showed he had been imbibing more liquor than was good for him  are you ready to sail demanded captain marshall striding up  all ready was the surly response and the supercargo walked down to his stateroom and disappeared  orders were given to cast off and in a very few minutes the bark was on her way from san francisco bay toward the golden gate it was a perfect day and by nightfall the harbor was left behind and land became a mere speck in the distance  the first night on the bark passed pleasantly enough for the three chums at first the quarters on the vessel appeared small to them but they soon grew accustomed to the change all slept soundly and they were out on deck very shortly after sunrise  well how do you like life on mother careys chicken asked phil when they were gazing at the rolling ocean  mother careys chicken repeated dave with a puzzled look  oh i know what he means cried roger with a laugh a stormy petrel is a bird that the sailors call a mother careys chicken  what a name i think i like stormy petrel better observed dave but i say isnt this just grand a fellow can open his lungs and drink in ozone by the barrel  and hardly a cloud in the sky added roger if this is any criterion well have the finest kind of a trip  well boys i see you are up on time came from a little behind them and now captain marshall strode up fine sea this and a fine breeze too  how long will this nice weather last asked roger  humph the captain humped his shoulders no man alive can tell that a few days at least maybe a week or more but sooner or later well pay up for it the finer the weather the bigger the storm to follow  i shouldnt mind an ordinary storm observed dave but i dont want to be wrecked  no danger of that lad the stormy petrel can outride any storm likely to blow in these parts she is one of the best vessels i ever sailed ina man couldnt ask for a better  how much of a crew have you captain marshall asked phil  i have sixteen men all told besides the tar you brought along the brow of the shipmaster wrinkled slightly they are all pretty fair men too excepting four and those four mr van blott brought in  whats the trouble with the four  they drink and they dont mind as they should captain marshall turned to phil after breakfast id like to talk to you on business in the cabin he added  this was a hint that dave and roger were not desired and accordingly after the meal they left phil and the captain alone  ive been studying your fathers instructions to me said captain marshall to phil as i view it you are to be a sort of assistant to mr van blott  if he will allow it  and if he wont the captain gazed at phil sharply  then perhaps ill do something on my own account  are you going to keep your eye on him  yes but you need not tell him so  dont worryi shant open my mouth philip i am glad to hear of this for i tell you privately van blott needs watching he is a sly dog and i am satisfied in my own mind that he has something up his sleeve  do you know a man named bangor in san francisco he was with mr van blott just before we sailed  ah i thought so yes i know him and his reputation among shippers is none of the best he used to be a supercargo for the donaldsonmunroe company but they discharged him for some crooked work what were he and van blott doing  phil told of what he had overheard  that confirms my idea exactly cried the captain of the stormy petrel there is something in the wind you must watch out by all means and ill do the same this man must not be allowed to do anything wrong if we can possibly prevent it     chapter xix  days on the ocean   the weather remained fine for a full week and with favoring winds the stormy petrel bowled along merrily on her course the ocean rolled lazily in the warm sunshine a few birds circled about the ship and once they passed a steamer coming from the hawaiian islands and a schooner from manila and that was all  shall we stop at honolulu asked roger of the captain  no i thought of doing so at first but now i shall make no stops until we get to christmas island and from there we will go direct to cavasa and then to sobago what we do after that will depend largely on what is done about a cargo  so far none of the boys had experienced any seasickness and they congratulated themselves on their escape but billy dill put a little damper on their ardor  this aint no weather to judge by was his comment wait till we get some crosswinds and the ships starts to roll maybe then ye wont be so settled in the stomach  the few days on the ocean had done the old tar a world of good his eyes were brighter and he was physically in the best of health once more his mind too was clearer and one day he announced to dave that he had something to tell  i aint quite sure as i have the exact straight on t he began a little on t is still like a dream but i know enough to make a putty straight story and then he told his tale  a good portion of it was not unlike the story of many sailors when very young he had had a strong desire to go to sea and at his first opportunity had shipped as a cabin boy from cabin boy he had become a foremast hand and had been in such service more years than he could count he had visited nearly every portion of the globe and had been wrecked twice once off the coast of africa and once while trying to round cape horn  three years before had found him at sydney australia looking for a chance to ship while down among the wharves he had discovered a tramp vessel the mary sacord bound for cavasa and other islands in the south seas and had signed articles for a years cruise the captain proved to be a brute and there was fighting on the vessel from the time she left sydney until cavasa was reached there at the main seaport billy dill went ashore and refused to go aboard again  the captain of the mary sacord was very angry over the refusal of the seaman to continue on the trip and threatened dill with imprisonment and even had the old tar arrested but at this juncture two men came forward and aided the sailor in his trouble and as a consequence billy dill was set free and the vessel went on her way without him  one of the men who had helped billy dill was dunston porter and the other was samuel lemington they were both americans and fairly welltodo at first they did not tell the old sailor much about their business but they asked him if he wished to work for them and he said he was willing and they offered him thirty dollars a month and all his expenses  the two americans so the tar discovered later were after a treasure of precious stones said upon good authority to have been hidden years before in the mountains by a former cannibal king of cavasa and some other south sea islands the three journeyed into the interior of the island and spent months in looking for the treasure but without success then came an earthquake and the volcano in the center of the island began to grow active and all three had to flee to the coast in order to escape destruction  it was on this treasure hunt that billy dill heard through dunston porter about the lost child that had been carried off by a nurse who was not mentally sound although usually goodhearted dunston porter had not said very much about the matter for it seemed to hurt him a great dealso much in fact that the old sailor did not think it best to ask for the particulars but he knew one thing that try his best dunston porter could not learn what had become of the woman and the little one and he was half inclined to believe that both were dead  well did he say that the child was his son asked dave with deep interest  no it was some relative of his i think i dont believe dunston porter was married  when you came back to the coast what did this mr porter do  he and mr lemington stayed in the town trying to make up their minds as to what theyd do next i got a chance to ship and as they didnt seem to want me any more i sailed away and then i did as ive told you before  this was practically all the information billy dill could give concerning dunston porter and the missing child although he told much more concerning the treasure hunt and of several fights with the natives of the interior he said the natives were a bad lot and he wanted no more to do with them than was absolutely necessary  how old should you judge this dunston porter to be asked dave  forty to fortyfive years old my lad  did he ever tell you where he came from  not exactly but he was an american and he knew a good bit about san francisco chicago and new york and i remember he once told about hunting in the maine woods and in the adirondacks  he didnt say a word about coming back to the united states  not that i can remember  with this information dave had to be content the story had been a strain on billy dill and afterward he complained of a headache and of feeling dizzy but a good nights rest restored him completely  the sailor was at all times delighted to instruct the boys in the art of seamanship and under his tutelage they learned rapidly so that any of them could go aloft and make or take in sail whenever required he also taught them how to make knots of various kinds and many other things useful on board a ship in the meantime captain marshall allowed them to read his works on navigation and gave them a few lessons in steering and in the use of the compass sextant and other nautical instruments  well be fullfledged sailors before this voyage is over remarked roger to his chums i declare i almost feel as if i could handle a small ship already  maybe you could on the leming river rejoined phil but when it came to a big storm on the pacific i rather believe youd find it a different story  so far phil had had but little to do with the supercargo but now he asked the man if he could look over the books jasper van blott agreed but the scowl on his face showed plainly that the move was not to his liking phil went over the accounts at his leisure but could find nothing wrong in them there were a few entries that looked odd but the supercargo was ready with explanations concerning them  well have you found anything wrong questioned dave after phil had spent three days over the books  nothing much dave was the answer from the shipowners son  the supercargo isnt very friendly i notice  oh he hates it that i am going on this trip answered phil  there seemed to be but one man on the ship with whom the supercargo was thoroughly friendly and that was paul shepley the first mate the pair were together a large part of the time and their conversation was frequently an animated one  i cant get it out of my head that those two are working together over something said dave why they are as thick as bees in a sugar barrel  ive noticed that too came from roger perhaps they are hatching up some mischief  on the following day the weather became more unsettled and occasionally the clouds showed themselves above the horizon captain marshall gave orders to his mate that a strict watch should be kept for a blow  i guess we are in for it now cried dave that afternoon it is much rougher than it has yet been  i know i am in for it answered roger his face was white and wore a troubled look  whats the matter seasick  ii fancy so my head spins like a top and my stomach is starting to do the same  better go below lad said captain marshall coming up it wont do you any good to remain on deck  roger shuffled off to the companionway and dave went after him the senators son was growing worse every minute and it was not long before phil announced that he also felt sick both went to their staterooms and dave did what he could to relieve their distress  if the old tub would only stop for a minutejust one minute groaned roger  thats what i say responded phil oh dear id give a hundred dollars to be on shore again  i think id make it a thousand groaned the senators son why dave dont you feel it at all  well i feel a little strange answered the country boy but he did not add that it was because he had to stand by and assist his friends he made them as comfortable as possible and then rushed to the deck to get some fresh air and to get the matter off his mind  a storm was certainly brewing and dave wondered how soon it would strike the stormy petrel and how long it would last the black clouds were piling up in the sky and the wind came in unsteady puffs below the clear blue water had turned to a dark green  the first mate was in charge of the deck and so far he had given no orders to shorten sail ever and anon a sail would crack in the wind and the bark would give a plunge in the sea dave walked forward to where billy dill stood by the rail watching the sky anxiously  this looks stormy doesnt it questioned the youth  stormy great dogfish i should allow as how it did lad were in for a blow an a big one too  then isnt it about time to take in sail  i should say it was  then why doesnt the mate do so  at this question the old tar shrugged his shoulders  reckon he wants to take the benefit o all the breeze he can he answered but it aint the best thing to donot to my way o reasonin if he aint keerful we may lose a topmast or more  i suppose you dont dare to say anything to him  no hes in charge an thets all there is to it  the storm continued to approach and now several of the sailors looked anxiously at the first mate he was evidently in a savage mood and paid no attention to them  unless he does sumthin soon well lose a stick sure said billy dill to dave in a low tone i never saw sech a contrary mate in my life  perhaps i had better speak to captain marshall suggested the country youth  i wish ye wouldit would be safer but dont let shepley know itor hell be as mad as a hornet at ye added the old tar  leaving the bow dave hurried to the stern and toward the companionway here he almost ran headlong into the first mate  hi look where you are going ejaculated the man roughly have you no manners  excuse me returned dave dont you think we are having a pretty big blow sir he added  oh this wont amount to much grumbled paul shepley nothing to get scared about  dave said nothing to this he hurried below and a moment later stood in front of captain marshalls stateroom door the master of the stormy petrel was taking a nap but at the boys knock roused up instantly     chapter xx  caught in a storm   who is there  captain marshall can i speak to you a moment  oh so it is you porter what do you want  there seems to be a big storm coming up and i thought i had better tell you about it  whyerisnt mr shepley on deck  yes sirbut i thought i had better tell you anyway went on dave  mr shepley knows what to do answered the captain rather shortly he did not fancy having his muchneeded nap disturbed  i suppose that is true sirbut some of the sailors are getting very anxious i dont care to mention their names but they think some sail ought to be taken in  the master of the stormy petrel arose and stretched himself then he put on the shoes he had dropped on lying down and came out into the cabin he gave one look at the barometer and his sleepiness vanished  i should say there was a storm coming he exclaimed and ran for the companionway he was soon on deck and cast an anxious eye around  mr shepley why havent you shortened sail he demanded in a low but sharp voice  i didnt think it necessary just yet was the cool response  i dont agree with you returned the master of the bark shortly and then without delay gave orders to take in fully half the sails while the crew were ordered to remain in readiness to stow away still more of the canvas at a moments notice the sailors for the most part worked with a will although there were several laggards for laziness among certain classes of men is not confined to the land alone  captain marshall was angry and he did not hesitate to let the first mate know it  there is no sense in taking too many risks he remarked after his orders had been obeyed that storm is coming as sure as fate  i wanted to make as much headway as possible before it struck us grumbled shepley we havent suffered any  no but we might have lost a topmast or a topsail after this you will please be a little more careful  there was no time to argue the matter for a little later the storm began in earnest all of the sails were taken in but the fore sheet and this was reefed down allowing just enough canvas to fly to keep the bark before the wind the breeze was turning to half a gale and from a distance came the rumble of thunder then the sky grew still blacker and a flash of lightning illuminated the angry waters  dave had followed captain marshall on deck but now he went below once more to learn how phil and roger were faring he found them both out in the cabin having come from their staterooms in alarm  is it very bad outside questioned the senators son  not yet but i am afraid it is going to be was daves reply  phew that certainly means business burst out roger as another flash of lightning was followed by a heavy peal of thunder i hope the ship weathers it all right  captain marshall is on deck and he knows what he is doing answered dave i am glad i called him up he added  oh so you called him up did you came in a voice from the cabin doorway and turning dave beheld paul shepley there the mate had come below to get his raincoat  yes i did answered the country boy boldly now that the truth was out he did not mean to mince matters  thought you knew more about running a ship than i did eh  i thought it was time to take in sailand so did the captain  humph this blow isnt going to kill anybody and we want to take all the advantage of the wind that we can we are expected to make a quick trip but we cant do it if we are going to haul down sail all the time  i am sure captain marshall will do what is right said phil  really sneered the mate i didnt ask you to put in your oar  i know you didntbut my father owns the vessel and i shall stand by captain marshall and by my friend dave porter  oh so its something of a plot against me eh snorted the mate more angry than ever well dont let it go too far and he turned into his own room banging the door after him a minute later he came out wearing his raincoat and hurried out on deck once more  hes a real nice man i dont think was rogers comment my how he would lord it over us if he dared  he is certainly sore said phil i must say in a way he and the supercargo are a team when i get a chance i am going to write to father and let him know exactly the sort of fellows they are  the boys felt little like discussing the subject further just then for the storm had now burst over the vessel in all of its mad fury the wind was whistling through the rigging making the masts and yards creak and groan and the rain came down in sheets sweeping the decks by the bucketful it was with difficulty that the stormy petrel could be kept before the wind the waves were running like so many big hills with the bark first on a crest and then down in a valley between the sky was almost black lit up occasionally by flashes of lightning that were blinding  well go to the bottom sure groaned roger for at least the tenth time id rather be at oak hall any day than in such a storm as this he was still seasick but the storm made him forget the ailment for the time being and what was true of the senators son in this regard was likewise true of phil  i think ill take another look on deck said dave as the bark gave a pitch that sent them all against a partition  take care that you dont fall overboard returned phil  ill be on my guard never fear  putting on his raincoat the country boy made his way cautiously up the companionway the moment he stuck his head into the open he realized that it was blowing great guns and more the rain dashed violently into his face drenching him completely  this is no place for you lad bellowed captain marshall trying to make himself heard above the wind better go below again  ill be careful pleaded dave i love to watch a stormi always did when i was on the farm i never thought of hiding no matter how hard it thundered or lightened  the master of the bark gazed for a second at him in admiration  well i was the same he said but be careful and dont go close to the rail  illustration another flash lit up the scenepage 179  dave remained in the vicinity of the cabin when another flash lit up the scene he saw billy dill near the bow stowing away some rope in the most unconcerned fashion possible the old tar was in his element and said afterward that the storm had done him more good than gallons of medicine would have accomplished saterated me with salt brine an thets wot i needed were his words  how do you like it now asked captain marshall coming up a little later while there was something of a lull  i dont mind it answered dave smiling its a little excitement and that is what i like  i am thankful that you called me when you did  i did what i thought was best sir but i reckon it has put me into a hole with your first mate  why did you tell him anything  no but he overheard me telling the other boys that i had called you he didnt say much but he showed that he was angry  humph well dont you mind porter it was the right thing to do shepley is a good sailor but once in a while he takes risks that i dont like if he troubles you about this let me know do you hear  yes sir but i am willing to fight my own battles  i dont doubt it for you are gritty i can see that nevertheless you let me know  how long do you suppose this storm will last  there is no telling perhaps twentyfour hours and maybe two or three days we are paying up for that nice weather we had concluded the captain  finding he could do nothing on deck and that he was getting wet through dave went below and to his stateroom he found roger and phil lying down as before and as miserable as ever a little later supper was announced but dave had to eat alone for neither the captain nor the mate came to join in the repast it was a meal under difficulties and dave did not remain at the table long he asked roger and phil if they wanted anything but both declined  why the very idea of anything to eat makes me sicker than ever declared the senators son  the storm did not abate during the evening and the three boys spent rather a dismal time of it in the cabin and the staterooms as night came on none of them felt like going to bed although advised to do so by captain marshall  we have seen the worst of the blow said the master of the stormy petrel coming down about ten oclock  it was not until morning that dave fell into a troubled doze from which he did not awaken until roger shook him  hello i went to sleep after all cried the country boy what time is it  about seven oclock dave there is something unusual going on on deck continued the senators son  what is it  i dont know but i am going up to see and so is phil  the three were soon ready and crawled up the companionway and out on the raindrenched and slippery deck  we must man the pumps they heard captain marshall cry and scader report as soon as you can  aye aye sir came from scader who was the ships carpenter but i am afraid sir its a bad leak to get at he added  have we sprung a leak cried phil  we have answered the captain his face wore a serious look and the boys saw that he was much troubled  the sailors were at the pumps and worked away with a will roger and phil still felt too weak to take part but dave leaped to billy dills side and worked as hard as any of the foremast hands leaving the ship in charge of the first mate captain marshall went below to learn what the ships carpenter might have to say about the condition of affairs  we are bringing up a good deal of water are we not asked dave of billy dill  you have it right lad more water nor i care to see answered the old tar  that means the leak is a bad one eh  yes some of the ships seams must be wide open  will it sink us  i cant tell anything more about that than you dave we must hope for the best replied billy dill     chapter xxi  cavasa island at last   phil and roger heard the conversation between dave and the old sailor and it worried them so much that they hurried below to learn what might be going on  we must shift that part of the cargo first came from the ships carpenter then i think i can do something but i am not sure  captain marshall at once ordered the cargo shifted as desired this did not please the supercargo but the master of the vessel paid no attention to van blotts objections  it is a question of keeping the ship afloat mr van blott said he coldly if necessary ill have the whole cargo heaved overboard  but sir commenced the supercargo  i cant talk about it now my duty is to save the ship do you want to go to the bottom of the ocean and captain marshall spoke in such a decided way that jasper van blott sneaked off and said no more for the time being  a portion of the crew came below and not without difficulty a number of heavy boxes and casks were shifted then the ships carpenter and an assistant went to work to tighten up the seams through which the water of the ocean was spurting furiously it was a difficult and dangerous task and it lasted the best part of three hours but at last the workers got the better of the elements and then the water went down steadily in the ships well as the men at the pumps continued their labors  will the ship pull through asked phil of the captain  yes my lad i think we are safe nowunless the blow makes us open some more seams  after the repairs below had been made and the alarm had passed captain marshall called the first mate to his side  i thought you said those seams were all right when we were at the dock at san francisco he began  they looked all right mumbled paul shepley  you couldnt have examined them very closely  i did  humph after this i had better look to things myself was the captains comment and he moved away  a little later the supercargo and the first mate met in the waist the storm was now dying down rapidly and it looked as if the sun would soon break through the clouds  well i see you had another runin with the old man remarked van blott  so did you  you mean about the cargo  of course  well i didnt want him to nose around too much and the supercargo grinned  afraid he might run across some of that private stuff  hush somebody might hear you shepley what was your row about  he laid the opening of the seams on my shoulderssaid i didnt inspect things properly at san francisco  he seems to be getting harder than ever on us  thats it and i am done after this trip growled the first mate  so am iif i can make my little pile  thats what i mean van blott we must do it too  i expect to but it isnt going to be so easy as we thought the owner of the ship has sent his son to watch me and he and those other lads are rather clever  pooh you are not afraid of those boys are you  it isnt that im afraid theyll discover something and take the news to the old man  here the talk had to come to an end and the two men separated promising to meet in the evening that they had some scheme they wished to work there could not be the slightest doubt  by nightfall the storm was at an end and the sun set in a perfect blaze of glory of the gale only a stiff breeze remained and captain marshall lost no time in setting his sails as before all the loose seams had been mended and the stormy petrel now took in no more water than was usual with her and is usual with ordinary seagoing craft  i am glad that is over remarked phil the next day after a fair nights sleep  so am i and i never want to experience another such storm came from roger  how do you both feel asked dave  my seasickness is gone thank goodness answered phil  ditto here said the senators son dave you are a lucky dog to keep so well he added a bit enviously  perhaps it will be my turn next time roger  after that the stormy petrel continued on her course for many days with but little out of the ordinary happening once or twice the boys had some sharp words with the first mate and phil had a tiff with the supercargo but nothing like an open quarrel ensued yet the flames were smoldering ready to break out at the first opportunity  those two men hate us worse than poison said dave one day i can see it plainly  that supercargo has it in for me replied phil i wish i could let my father know just how he is acting hed soon lose his situation  they were now near the equator and the weather was very warm and would have been unendurably hot had it not been for the constant breeze that was blowing nobody cared to do much in such an atmosphere and the three boys were content to sit around or loll in hammocks suspended in shady portions of the deck the broiling sun started the tar from the seams and the odor therefrom was almost overpowering  i wish we had an icemaking machine on board said roger as he fanned himself they had taken ice along but the supply was running low and he could not get quite as much as he desired  never mind well have a run ashore soon said dave that will be something of a change  he had in mind the stop at christmas island a small body of land belonging to england and lying in the pacific close to the equator the island was sighted the next day and they made a landing and roamed around for three hours while some fresh water and other things were taken on board then by nightfall the bow of the stormy petrel was once more headed for the southwestward  now we are in southern seas cried dave one day after the equator had been left behind i suppose well begin to sight some of the numerous islands before long  i shant mind sighting the islands but i dont want to run on some hidden reef returned roger the charts show a great number of reefs in this portion of the ocean  once more the days slipped by it was fearfully hot and the boys did not move excepting when it was absolutely necessary occasionally they would sit at the bow and billy dill would tell them stories of the sea and of sights in foreign lands he now said that he felt as of old  i was born for the sea he observed it was a mistake for me to travel all the way across land to oakdale an i reckon i got punished fer it  i am sorry you suffered but i am glad i had the chance to meet you answered dave it may mean a great deal to me you know  thets true dave but take my advice an dont depend upon it too much id hate awfully to see ye disappinted  yesbut i wish we were at cavasa island said the country boy wistfully  the nearer the ship drew to the island mentioned the more anxious did he become although he did his best to conceal his feelings but phil and roger understood  i sincerely hope dave isnt disappointed said the senators son when he and phil chanced to be alone think of coming such a distance as this on a wildgoose chase  well it was the only thing to do answered the son of the bark owner you and i would have done the same  i dont doubt it but look at it from every point of view it is an odd situation i only hope this dunston porter is still at cavasa island or in that vicinity  at last came the day when captain marshall called the boys to him and said they might sight cavasa island inside of the next twentyfour hours  youll know the island at a glance said he approaching it from this side it looks exactly like a long loaf of bread with a hump in the middle the hump is the old volcano the town at which we are to stop is located at the western extremity of the island there is where the real shipping is done there is a town at the eastern end but the harbor is poor and most of the inhabitants are natives  and what of the people where we are to stop asked dave  about onehalf are natives and the others a mixture of americans and europeans the harbor there is a very good one indeed and that is why it is so popular  as they neared cavasa island both the supercargo and the first mate appeared to grow more than ordinarily anxious and talked together by the halfhour dave noticed this and so did the others  they have something in mind said the country boy to phil youll surely have to be on guard when the cargo for tolao is taken ashore  the next day the boys kept on the lookout having borrowed captain marshalls best glass about noon roger uttered a loud cry  i see something it must be the island  let me look exclaimed dave and took the glass yes it is cavasa island he went on for it looks exactly as the captain said  inside of an hour they could see cavasa island quite plainly and by nightfall they were ready to enter the harbor but this was not to be accomplished in the dark and so they had to remain outside until daybreak impatient as dave was to get ashore  what an odd collection of ships said phil as the stormy petrel made her way into the harbor they must have come from all parts of the world and this remark was largely true  it had been arranged that dave and billy dill should go ashore at the first opportunity and roger was to go with them  i am sorry i cant go said phil to dave but you understand how it is and he jerked his thumb in the direction of the supercargo who was writing in one of his books  yes i understand phil answered dave i hope you dont have any trouble  the shipping of tolao was very much huddled together and the boys had to depend upon billy dill to pilot them to the main thoroughfare of the town the old sailor declared that the place had changed but little since his last visit and said he would take them directly to the hotel at which dunston porter had been in the habit of stopping  all right said dave you cant get there any too quick for me and they walked on with the heart of the country boy beating as it had seldom beat before to him his whole future seemed to rest upon what he might learn in the next few hours     chapter xxii  about some missing men   the hotel proved to be a onestory building of spanish architecture with numerous small windows and a rather low door it was presided over by a roundfaced englishman who stared at billy dill curiously when the old tar presented himself  do you remember me mr chadsey asked the sailor  i do was the answer you were here some years ago but i cannot recall your name  billy dill  oh yes yes you were with mr porter and mr lemington returned the hotelkeeper  thats it i am looking for mr porter now  sorry but he isnt here  isnt here cried dave and his heart sank isnt he in town at all  no he left the island a couple of months ago  and where did he go to  i dont know he said something about going to sobago island and something about going to australia but where he really did go to i have not learned  this young man is very much interested in meeting mr porter explained billy dill his name is porter too and i reckon they are related have you any idea where we can find out where dunston porter went  might find out at the shipping offices  why of course exclaimed dave let us go to the different offices at once  billy dill was willing and without loss of time led the way to the street upon which the majority of the shipping of cavasa island was booked the offices were mostly small and rather dirty and around them hung sailors and other men of various nationalities and some of them far from prepossessing in their general appearance  they visited two offices without success and then came to a place located on a corner with doors on both streets  hello cried roger there is mr van blott just ahead of us is this the shipping firm with which mr lawrence does business  i dont think it is answered billy dill  then what is he doing here  must have a little business of his own said dave but i dont care come along just then he was thinking only of his personal affairs  they entered the office which reeked of tobacco smoke and the smell of rum in the rear was another office and they were just in time to see the supercargo go into this shutting a partition door behind him  looking around dave saw a clerk at a corner desk looking over some papers with an elderly german  i will be at liberty in a few minutes said the clerk in broken english please to take seats and he pointed to a couple of low benches set against the wall and the partition  billy dill sat down on the bench along the wall and dave and roger upon that next to the partition which was not over seven feet in height save for the rattling of the papers at the corner desk the office was very quiet and the boys readily heard the talk going on behind the partition  so you really have some goots on board came in a somewhat german voice i vos afraid you vould not bring any  didnt i say id bring them baumann returned jasper van blott ive got them and the only question is how am i to get them here and when are you going to pay me  i pay so soon as de goots is here said the german shipping agent i not pay a dollar before  but you will send your men down to the dock  oh yes i do dot vot dime you vonts dem hey  tomorrow morning at eight oclock sharp tell them to watch me and when i wave my handkerchief they can come forward and get the goods  how many poxes vos dere  sixteen all told you want to be careful and caution your men i dont want captain marshall to learn what i am  the boys heard no more for at this juncture the clerk came forward having finished his work at the corner desk  what can i do for you he asked blandly  i am looking for a man who is supposed to have left cavasa island by steamer or sailboat about two months ago said dave his name is dunston porter can you tell me if he shipped from here  the clerk looked over a book he drew from a desk  i see nothing of the name he said after a pause  you would have the name if he had taken passage from here questioned roger  the clerk nodded then when he found that he could do nothing more for them he dropped into an easy chair lit a blacklooking cigar and took up a newspaper  there is one more shipping office said billy dill as he led the way to the street well go there  dave did you hear that talk in the back room questioned the senators son as they were hurrying down the street  i did  what do you think of it  i think the supercargo is up to some game and we must tell phil and captain marshall  thats just my idea too dave let me see the name of the firm was baumann  feltmuller wasnt it  yes  they were soon at the last of the shipping offices here the clerk could scarcely talk english and they had to call in the services of a gentleman who chanced to be present and who could speak the native tongue a booking list was consulted and it was announced that dunston porter had taken passage for nanpi on sobago island just six weeks before  six weeks cried dave i hope he is there still now how can i communicate with him roger  you can send him a letter answered roger but you must remember that the stormy petrel is going to nanpi as soon as her cargo for this town is unloaded  from the shipping clerk they learned that dunston porter had gone to sobago alonethat is without his partner mr lemington a further searching into the shipping lists revealed the fact that the partner had sailed for australia seven weeks past  i reckon they dissolved partnership observed billy dill an one went his way an tudder the other way an i likewise guess they didnt git thet treasure  there was now nothing to do but to return to the bark and this they did without delay the boys found that captain marshall had gone ashore on business and so called phil aside and related to him what had been heard in the office of baumann  feltmuller  you are rightthere is something in the wind said the shipowners son i wish the captain was here so i could consult with him  hell be back soon wont he questioned roger  he said he might not be back until late this evening  phil was interested in what dave had to tell about dunston porter and said he would urge the captain of the stormy petrel to set sail for nanpi at the earliest possible moment  it was not until ten oclock that jasper van blott came back to the bark he immediately walked up to the first mate and the pair engaged in conversation for some time then the supercargo went to bed and roger and dave did the same phil sat up reading and awaiting the captains return  it was almost seven oclock when the country boy sprang up and awakened the senators son both hurried into their clothes and then into the cabin where they met phil whose face was full of worry  whats the matter asked both  captain marshall hasnt come back yet  hasnt come back ejaculated dave do you mean to say he stayed away all night  exactly and i dont know what to make of it  did he say he might remain away came from roger  no  where did he go  i dont know and neither does mr shepley  what will you do about began dave and cut himself short as jasper van blott came into the cabin  mr van blott do you know anything about the captain questioned phil  i do not was the short reply  it is queer that he should stay away all night  oh captains like to have good times occasionally continued the supercargo with a sickly grin  if you mean by that that captain marshall went off to have a good time as you put it i do not think so returned phil coldly he is not that sort  perhaps you know him better than i do flared up the supercargo  i know that he is a man who sticks to his duty mr van blott something has gone wrong or he would be back  as you please the supercargo paused well it doesnt matter much he continued i know what to do and i am going ahead without waiting for him  you mean about unloading  yes  would it not be better to wait until captain marshall returns  no it would only be a waste of time  no more was said just then and a few minutes later breakfast was announced as soon as it was over phil called his chums aside  i wish youd do me a favor he whispered go ashore and try to hunt up the captain he must be around somewhere i will try to hold the supercargo back as much as i can  dave and the senators son were willing and in less than ten minutes were on the dock and moving for the streets beyond  where are those boys going asked jasper van blott coming up to phil  they are going to look for captain marshall  humph muttered the supercargo and said no more  i think we had better wait until the captain returns went on phil  i am not going to wait snapped van blott i am going to get that cargo ashore as quickly as it can be done  and fifteen minutes later the hatches were opened and the work of getting out the boxes barrels and casks began     chapter xxiii  in which the supercargo is cornered   from one street corner dave and roger hurried to another looking in every direction for some sign of captain marshall this hunt they kept up for the best part of half an hour but without success  he is certainly nowhere in this vicinity said the senators son i wonder where he can be keeping himself  they walked on more slowly and at the entrance to a lane came to another halt then chancing to look into the lane dave uttered a short cry  there he is  coming along the lane was captain marshall his step was an uncertain one and he pitched from side to side as the two boys ran forward the master of the stormy petrel gave a lurch and landed on some old boxes with a crash  oh dave can this be possible murmured roger i did not think the captain would do it  let us help him to the ship answered dave he was as much shocked as his companion and he could not help but think of what the supercargo had said  oh is it you boys mumbled the captain as he espied them i want toto get back to the ship  well help you said dave  ive had an awful nightmy mind is in a perfect whirl went on the master of the stormy petrel  well soon have you safe on the bark put in roger  the two assisted the captain to his feet his eyes had a peculiar stare in them suddenly he clapped his hand to his pocket  funny he muttered very funny ive got my watch and ive got my money too  did you think they were gone queried dave  well i shouldnt bebe surprised i thought they did it to rob me what time is it oh but i am weak in the legs boys  it is about eight oclock  in the morning  yes  then i must get back to the stormy petrel by all means ihow did you come to find me  we were out looking for you answered roger we were alarmed and so was phil because you didnt come back last night  ii meant to come back oh how my head spins i wish i had a drink of water that coffee they dosed me with was vile  coffee they dosed you with queried dave were you drugged  i must have been lad i met some men and they wanted me to drink with them i refused then they offered me some coffee and native cakes and to be sociable i took the stuff directly afterward i began to grow sleepy and then i didnt know a thing until i woke up at the end of that lane awhile ago  did you know the men asked roger  i did not but they pretended to know me its queer they didnt rob me i wonder why they drugged me  i dont know answered dave unless  unless what  i shouldnt like to say captain marshall but ill tell you one thing you are wanted on board of the stormy petrel at once  who wants me  phil lawrence we have learned something about mr van blott which we think you ought to know but you must get your head cleared up first of all  they walked the captain back to the bark and by accident more than design managed to get the skipper on board without the supercargo seeing the party then they called phil into the cabin and in the meantime got the captain some fresh water and some other things they fancied might do him good they were glad to note that his dizziness was fast leaving him  this looks suspicious to me said captain marshall after he had heard what the boys had to relate but i cannot accuse van blott of having me drugged as i have no proof of it i do not know who those men were and more than likely they will keep themselves out of sight  that is true returned phil but you can help me regarding this stuff to be taken away by baumann  feltmuller cant you  certainly phil i want to know all about that stuff before it leaves this ship have you the records of the goods  no sir mr van blott has locked the books in the safe  then if i were you as your fathers representative i should demand to see the records i will back you up  if you will back me up ill go to him at once he is already getting the goods out of the hold  ill put a stop to that answered the captain  he was still feeble in the legs but managed to climb to the deck and walked to where the supercargo and the first mate were directing the unloading of a portion of the cargo  hello so you are back exclaimed the supercargo and his face paled a little  i am returned the captain coldly mr shepley did you give orders to unload he went on turning to the mate  iierdid stammered the mate you said yesterday we were to start first thing this morning  i didbut i expected to be here when we began mr van blott philip lawrence wishes to see you in your office  i havent time to bother with him now growled the supercargo go ahead with those cases he shouted to some stevedores who were nearby and pulling out his handkerchief he gave it a flourish toward the dock  drop those cases roared captain marshall his face growing red drop them i say and the natives who were carrying the cases stopped short  captain marshall began jasper van blott iwhat do you mean by thiserby this  i told you that philip lawrence wanted to see you in your office you had better see him before we move any more of this cargo  yes but  i wont argue the matter mr van blott i was drugged last night do you understand drugged but my mind is clear now and i want everything on this bark to run smoothly you had better go to your office and ill go with you  the supercargo glared at the captain and the latter glared in return then van blott shrugged his shoulders  as you please he said but it is a strange proceeding and he walked to that part of the ship where was located his little office as he passed the first mate he gave the man a wink and turned his eyes toward the cases on the deck paul shepley nodded slightly  in the office they found phil awaiting them roger followed the pair but dave had seen the wink that was passed and remained on deck and a moment later seated himself on one of the very cases the stevedores had been in the act of removing from the ship  aint you going with them asked the first mate coming up with a dark frown on his face  no i think ill stay here until they come back answered dave lightly  then please get off of that box  i am not hurting the box mr shepley  get off i say  the boy from the country did so  i believe captain marshall wanted nothing moved until he came back said dave gazing boldly into the mates angry face perhaps i had better call him if you are going to work again  who said i was going to move anything growled paul shepley his manner showing that that was just what he had had in mind to do dont you get too fresh around me or there will be trouble  well if there is trouble ill do my best to stand up against it  aw you make me tired grumbled the first mate and strode away in deep disgust leaving dave master of the field  in the meantime a stormy meeting was being held in the supercargos office at first van blott flatly refused to allow phil to look at his books but at last brought forth several which the shipowners son knew were of little importance  i want the books that relate to the goods to be landed here said phil i want to know all about each piece before it is put ashore  humph you are getting very particular young man observed the supercargo  i do not deny it  did your father send you on this trip to spy on me  you may put it that way if you wish mr van blott i am here simply to learn this business and to see that everything is o k  if everything is all right what have you to fear from an inspection like this came suggestively from captain marshall  i am not going to work here and be watched like a criminal stormed jasper van blott if old man lawrence cant trust me it is time we parted company  i agree with you returned the captain  do you came with a sneer very well ill close up my accounts and quit  youll not do it just yet put in phil he was pale but determined  i wont  no before you quit you must make an accounting to me of goods and money and satisfy me and also captain marshall that everything is o k in every particular  bah boy who gave you authority to talk to me in this fashion  my father  i dont believe it why you are a mere boyyou dont know what you are saying ill close up this business to suit myself and leave my keys with captain marshall and that will end it  mr van blott you must remember that philip lawrence is the shipowners son said the captain sternly  i dont care if he is he has no legal authority and i dont propose to let him drive me  just wait a minute until i come back said phil starting for the door  where are you going asked roger  to my stateroom ill be back in a few minutes  what is he going to do questioned the supercargo uneasily  i dont know answered captain marshall shortly but if i were you mr van blott i should listen to him in a certain sense he represents his father on this vessel  he doesnt represent him with me muttered the supercargo his anger had made him lose a good portion of his common sense  there was a minute of silence during which jasper van blott strode up and down the narrow office then a step was heard outside and phil reappeared carrying a large envelope in his hand  my father said i was not to use this unless it was necessary he said drawing a paper from the envelope  at the appearance of a legallooking document the supercargo started back  whats that he demanded hoarsely  this is a document authorizing captain marshall to take charge of your affairs mr van blott he is to investigate everything under my supervision and is to hold you strictly accountable for everything you have done since starting on this voyage     chapter xxiv  the cargo mystery explained   there was a deathlike silence for several seconds after phil made his announcement even captain marshall was astonished for he had not anticipated such a turn of affairs  let me see that paper demanded jasper van blott wildly i will not believe a word of what you have said until i read that paper  then read it answered the shipowners son and passed it over  with compressed lips the supercargo perused the document then he gritted his teeth  so this is the game you have been playing on me eh he snarled well it doesnt work  doesnt work came from roger who was as much interested as any one  no it doesnt work that paper isnt worth the ink its written with it was drawn up in the united states and we are not in the united states now  perhaps not but we are sailing under the united states flag mr van blott said captain marshall quickly besides that i think the authorities here will respect a legal document drawn up in uncle sams country  its not worth a pinch of snuff roared the supercargo and would have torn the paper to bits had not phil and roger leaped forward and prevented him  none of that cried phil let that alone or ill have captain marshall place you under arrest  arrest me under arrest id like to see you do it fumed the supercargo  ill do it unless you do what is right said the master of the stormy petrel quickly mr van blott your actions do you no credit trying to destroy that document proves to me beyond a doubt that you have something to conceal i shall begin an investigation at once and the boys shall aid me  i dont care roared jasper van blott but i am done with the ship and the whole crowd  please hand over the keys to your safe boxes  with bad grace the supercargo did so  now you will please sit down and let us go through the accounts continued the captain  the supercargo squirmed and argued and did his best to get away but it was all to no purpose and in the end he had to remain in the office until the captain phil and roger had examined all the shipping accounts some of the entries were mixed up and they could not obtain any satisfactory explanation regarding them  now we will go on deck and examine that stuff that was to go ashore said captain marshall  especially the goods for baumann  feltmuller put in the senators son  ha what do you know about that firm gasped jasper van blott  not much  youyou have been spying on meyou must have followed me on shore gasped the supercargo but you are mistaken you will find nothing wrong he added suddenly and then appeared to calm down  they went on deck where they found dave still on guard the first mate was sulking near the rail as soon as the captain appeared dave walked up to him  i am glad you are here he whispered mr shepley wanted to send the goods ashore but i told him that if he did so i would call you  is that so thank you dave i am glad you went on watch replied the master of the stormy petrel  the inspection of the goods began and in the midst of the work jasper van blott gave an exclamation  did anybody bring that brown book up he queried  nobody knew anything about a brown book and all looked puzzled  that has this transaction in it in full went on the supercargo i remember now i put the book in my stateroom i will go below and get it that will prove everything is as straight as a string then i am going to sue somebody for heavy damages he added  he walked to the companionway and disappeared captain marshall continued to inspect the goods to go ashore and the boys aided him that something was wrong they did not doubt and they waited impatiently for the supercargo to reappear with his brown book  the first mate has gone below too announced roger presently maybe the pair are talking it over between them they are certainly handinglove with each other according to what dave says  go below and tell mr van blott i want him to come up at once returned captain marshall  the senators son disappeared down the companionway and was gone for several minutes he came up with a worried look on his face  i cant find mr van blott anywhere he cried  what roared the master of the stormy petrel he must be down there  unless he has sneaked ashore came quickly from dave  could he do that questioned phil  he might  i will go below and look around went on captain marshall you boys scatter on the deck and watch for him he must not be allowed to get away  the boys did as requested and the captain went below to be gone quarter of an hour and more when he came up his face was much downcast  he has certainly gotten away he declared his valise and some of his clothing are gone and his money box is wide open and empty  where is the mate asked phil  there he is exclaimed dave pointing to the bow  the captain ran forward  mr shepley have you seen mr van blott  when inquired the mate slowly  within the last ten or twenty minutes  why yes  where is he  i think he walked ashore i didnt notice particularly  humph did he have his valise  i dont know but what he did i wasnt paying any particular attention are we to unload or not went on the first mate  we are to do nothing until mr van blott is found answered the captain shortly  all right in that case youll wait a long time murmured the mate to himself  after that a regular hunt was instituted and the boys went ashore along with billy dill they even visited the offices of baumann  feltmuller but not a trace of the missing supercargo could be found anywhere  when the boys got back to the bark they found that captain marshall had begun on an examination of the goods taken from the hold he found a number of cases mismarkedthose which were to have been sent to baumann  feltmuller  this stuff seems to have been meant for some firm in australiafeatherstone  harmsworth said the captain how it came on my ship is a mystery to me  wait shouted dave i know something about that just before we left san francisco i heard some dock officials speaking about some costly cases of goods which had disappeared from a neighboring dock the goods were for the firm of featherstone  harmsworth i remember the name well the stuff was to go to sydney they said they had tried their best but could get no trace of the stolen cases  that explains it exclaimed phil van blott took the cases and had them stowed away in the hold of this ship he was going to sell the stuff to baumann  feltmuller in part or in whole  i believe you have struck the truth returned captain marshall and now fearing exposure he has fled  what can you do with the goods questioned roger  i dont know yet either return them to their owners or sell them and forward the money ill have to think the matter over  what a rascal van blott has proved himself to be was phils comment  yes and i reckon that man in san francisco bangor was in with him said dave and he was correct in his surmise it may be added here though that bangor never suffered for this crime for he was caught shortly after the sailing of the stormy petrel and tried for something equally unlawful and sentenced to prison for several years  the stolen goods were placed in another part of the ship and then the work of unloading a part of the regular cargo began paul shepley had to superintend this work and did so in a thoughtful mood  i wish i knew the truth about the mate said phil to dave i am going to watch him pretty closely after this  he certainly had something in common with the supercargo replied the country boy  from baumann  feltmuller captain marshall could learn but little the merchants said that the supercargo had offered to sell them some goods which he declared had not been accepted by other parties because of delay in shipment they had agreed to take the same and pay on delivery and when convinced that all was fair and above board  they are a tricky firm said the captain to the boys but as i have no proof against them ill have to let them go  in spite of the excitement over the exposure of the supercargo dave was anxious to sail from cavasa island and be on the way to sobago it was with great satisfaction that he heard captain marshall say they would set sail on the following monday morning  and how long will it take us to reach nanpi he asked of the master of the stormy petrel  that will depend upon the wind lad if we have luck we ought to get there in four or five days but sometimes the wind is mighty contrary around these parts  while at cavasa the boys spent one whole day ashore and went out riding in the direction of the volcano in company with billy dill the old tar showed them where he and dunston porter and mr lemington had camped out and where they had hunted for the treasure  id like to feel an earthquake once just for fun remarked roger it must be a queer sensation  it is answered billy dill an one ye aint apt to forgit in a hurry  if it was bad i think id be scared out of my wits said phil what do you think about it dave  i dont want any in mine  oh whats a little earthquake cried the senators son it would be an experience worth talking about thats all  well maybe youll have your wish gratified before we leave this region of the globe said dave i understand that earthquakes are common for thousands of miles around sometimes the quakes make new islands while other islands sink out of sight  excuse me from being on an island when it sinks out of sight cried phil id rather be on solid ground any time and in this statement the others agreed with him     chapter xxv  swept onward by a tidal wave   off at last and i am glad of it  i suppose you are anxious to get to nanpi dave  i am roger can you blame me  not at all in fact if i were in your place i think id be even more anxious meeting this dunston porter means so much to you went on the senators son  the two chums were on the forward deck of the stormy petrel and the bark was just leaving the harbor of tolao it was a clear day with a bright sun high overhead and the boys felt in excellent spirits  nothing had been seen or heard of jasper van blott and with the sailing of the bark he was practically forgotten by dave and roger but phil and the captain remembered him and were sorry that they had not been able to bring the wicked supercargo to justice  although he was in nominal authority captain marshall turned over the cargo books to phil and the shipowners son did very well when it came to straightening out the tangle left by van blott phil wished to make a clean report to his father and worked with a will until he knew where he was at as he declared  i rather think it will open my fathers eyes said phil he has suspected van blott for some time but he didnt think of anything like this  on the second day out the wind died down utterly and this state of affairs continued for several days the sails flapped idly against the masts and scarcely any progress was made  we are not going to make such a quick passage after all remarked roger my but this is slow work i must declare  and havent you noticed the heat added phil it seems to me to be unusually hot  it is said dave who had been consulting a thermometer this is our warmest day by four degrees if it gets much warmer well certainly melt  that afternoon the sea appeared to be strangely agitated and toward night the sailors noticed a large number of dead fish rising to the surface dave discovered a large shark and this proved to be dead also  there has been some disturbance under the oceans surface said captain marshall more than likely an earthquake  an earthquake and we never knew it ejaculated roger and his tone showed his disappointment  in the morning the sea was more agitated than ever one minute it would appear to flatten out the next two waves would come together with a clash that sent the spray flying upward for many feet more dead fish were in evidence on every hand  i have never witnessed anything like this commented captain marshall i trust it gets no worse  when the breeze sprang up it came from the wrong direction and the stormy petrel had to tack as best she could the breeze kept growing stiffer and stiffer until it was little short of a gale then a thick mist settled down on the ocean shutting out the view upon all sides  i must say i dont like this observed the senators son supposing we should run into something  there isnt much to run into replied dave i just asked the captain and he told me we were a good many miles from land of any sort  we might run into some other ship  there seem to be very few ships in this locality  morning found the stormy petrel still surrounded by the mist and there was now little or no wind the barometer had gone down and the captain ordered some sail taken in in anticipation of a storm  at noon the mist appeared to lift a little and once more the wind sprang up this continued for several hours when of a sudden a strange humming filled the air  what can that be cried dave who was on the forward deck  its wind cried billy dill a reglar tornado too  captain marshall was on deck no longer disposed to trust his first mate he at once ordered all of the sails taken in and stowed away securely this was just accomplished when the hurricanefor it was nothing lessstruck the stormy petrel almost sending the bark on her beam ends  better go below shrieked the captain to the three boys its not safe for you on deck  ill be careful answered phil but the master of the bark shook his head and then the three lads started for the companionway holding on to first one thing and then another as they moved along  phil had just reached the bottom of the steps roger was halfway down and dave still at the top when a wild cry from the bow reached their ears  hold tight all of ye came in the voice of billy dill hold on or yell be swept overboard sure  everybody on board the stormy petrel realized that this could be no idle warning and all held on like grim death to anything that was handy the next moment there was a strange hissing and pounding of the ocean and in a twinkling the stormy petrel was caught on what seemed to be the top of a giant wave and carried along as if in the grip of a demon of the deep  the upward and forward movement came with such a force that nearly everybody was taken clean and clear off his feet and had not each one clung fast as directed by billy dill somebody must surely have been flung overboard the bark turned around and around on the top of the wave and then lurched forward and went on and on the spray flying so thickly that scarcely a thing of what was beyond could be seen  my gracious gasped roger who had been flung down on top of phil what is this  dont ask me returned dave who was sitting on the upper step with his arms entwined around the companionway rail i guess its an earthquake and a hurricane rolled into one  has anybody gone overboard asked phil as he tried to stand up  i dont know billy dill gave the warning  the door to the cabin was open and the three lads fairly tumbled into the compartment the bark was rocking to such an extent that to stand upright was out of the question everything that was loose was on the floor shifting from one side to the other  the boys waited with bated breath and a few minutes later heard a crash on the deck which told that a topmast or one of the yards had come down then came a yell of alarm from one of the sailors  we are going to sink we are going to sink  did you hear that ejaculated roger he said the stormy petrel was going to sink  what shall we do put in phil i dont want to drown  phil had scarcely spoken when a side door to one of the staterooms burst open and a man came forth wild with terror his face scratched and bleeding much to their amazement they saw it was jasper van blott  is the ship really going down cried the former supercargo in a trembling voice  where did you come from cried dave  ierive been in hiding but tell me are we going down  i dont know  ieri must go on deck and see it nearly killed me the bark bounced around so went on van blott  he started for the companionway but had not yet reached the top when a big wave hit the stormy petrel broadside sweeping the deck from end to end and sending some of the water into the cabin the former supercargo was washed off the steps and came down flat on his back screaming with terror  illustration the former supercargo was washed off the steps and came down flat on his backpage 225  the boys were nearly as much alarmed and as soon as it was possible to do so all three crawled up to where they could get a view of the deck and the sea beyond  the outlook was truly startling the ocean was whipped up into a milkwhite foam and was dashing and churning in all directions one tremendous wave was rolling straight to the southward and on this the bark was riding like a monkey on a runaway race horse the wind was whistling through the rigging and the sky was filled with dark clouds and a strange whitish dust  what is this called dave to the captain as the latter passed  its a tidal wave yelled back captain marshall there has been another earthquake and most likely some of the volcanoes in this vicinity have become active  are we going down as that sailor said  not yet i will warn you if there is any danger of our sinking  you cant put out any small boats can you asked phil  no a small boat would not live a minute in such a sea as is now running  has anybody been washed overboard asked roger  i believe notbut i am not sure it came on so sudden we had no time to prepare for it said captain marshall  mr van blott is below said dave  van blott you must be dreaming  no he had been in hiding and the alarm scared him  humph well well take care of him laterif we get out of this with a whole skin  the boys could do nothing on deck and so went below again to find that the former supercargo had disappeared  it doesnt matter observed phil we know he is on board and he cant get away until we land and i guess we can root him out before that time  the stormy petrel was still being carried forward but now the motion was a bit more steady than before it was true that she had encountered a tidal wave due to a submarine earthquake and also true that a volcano on the island of cholomu had become active the fine volcanic dust floated for miles over the ocean covering the bark from stem to stern as with flour  half an hour later came another alarm somebody roared out breakers ahead and in a moment more the stormy petrel was in the midst of a choppy sea and staggered from side to side as if ready to go over then came a scraping at the bottom  we have struck a reef cried the first mate we are done for now but even as he spoke the bark went on over the reef and into what seemed to be a large harbor far in the distance could be seen a palmfringed shore with the waves dashing high up on the sands  it took captain marshall but an instant to consider the situation and he immediately gave orders to cast an anchor the stormy petrel continued to rush onward but quarter of a mile from the shore the forward progress was checked then another anchor was dropped and it was seen that this had secured a good hold in the meantime the waters of the tidal wave began to recede and by sunset the ocean was almost as calm as ever  thank fortune that peril is a thing of the past said dave fervently and the other boys and captain marshall echoed his sentiments     chapter xxvi  exploring a tropical island   the night to follow was an anxious one for all on board the stormy petrel the sea was still too rough to think of venturing ashore and so it was impossible to learn to what harbor they had floated and what was the prospect of continuing their voyage to sobago island  we must be at least two hundred miles out of our reckoning said captain marshall in reply to a question from phil this may be tapley island but i am not sure  is tapley island inhabited  i am not sure about that either there was once a colony there but i think it died out the natives on the other islands around here are very fierce  then i hope we havent landed on one of the other islands remarked dave  if we came over a reef how are we to get out of this harbor questioned roger  that remains to be learned roger answered the master of the stormy petrel gravely  during the night the sea went down a great deal and in the morning the harbor could be plainly distinguished a boat was lowered and captain marshall went ashore taking dave and phil with him  it was an easy matter to beach the rowboat on the sands and the boys leaped ashore quickly and ran up to the nearest of the palm trees a look around showed all how the gigantic tidal wave had torn and twisted everything growing near the waters edge in some spots the sand lay a foot thick on beds of grass and moss and small brushwood  we can be thankful that our ship was not cast up high and dry on the shore remarked captain marshall as he gazed around that wave must have done the shipping for hundreds of miles around great damage  the party walked up and down the beach for almost a mile but without seeing the first sign of inhabitants of any sort the shore was full of dead fish and overturned turtles and the sailors took some back to the ship with them for eating purposes  it was nearly midday when they returned to the ship and the boys were so hungry that a mess of fried fish was particularly appetizing to them at noon the captain made some observations and got out his charts and finally announced that they must be at a small island one hundred and sixty miles to the southward of sobago  the island is not of great importance said he it is shaped a good deal like the letter b and this harbor is formed by the double curve on one side the interior of each of the two portions is mostly marsh landa good place for tropical fevers the reef outside of the harbor is well defined on the chart and extends in a semicircle for many miles  isnt there any opening at all queried dave  for small vessels yes  but not for a bark the size of ours  that remains to be found out i shall go this afternoon and make some soundings  if there isnt any opening in the reef what are we to do asked phil blankly why the stormy petrel will have to remain here forever  which puts me in mind of a story as shadow hamilton would say came from dave i once heard of a fellow who built a rowboat in the garret of his house after the boat was done it was so large he couldnt get it out of the door or window and he had to take the boat apart again  if the boys at oak hall could see us now cried roger but about our ship we didnt build it herethe tidal wave sent it in over yonder reef now the question arises how are we to get over the reef again  if there is no opening in the reef maybe we can blow one out with dynamite suggested phil  after dinner captain marshall went out in the largest of the rowboats taking with him his pick of the sailors they took a lead line along and remained away until dark taking as many soundings as they possibly could it was dangerous work and those on the bark were glad when the rowboat returned  well did you find a channel asked the first mate  no was the short answer there are several openings but none that i discovered wide enough for the stormy petrel  of course you didnt cover the whole reef  by no means i will go out again tomorrowor you may do so  the news the captain brought was very disheartening and it was a gloomy party that assembled in the cabin of the bark that evening  we shall be perfectly safe in this harbor so long as the weather remains fair said captain marshall but a heavy blow might cause us to drag our anchors and either run ashore or on the reef we must get away in the near future if it can possibly be accomplished  you cant get away and to sobago any too quick for me replied dave  that evening jasper van blott came out of hiding and attempted to take his place at the cabin table but captain marshall would have none of this and sent the former supercargo forward where the sailors made room for him in the forecastle this angered van blott intensely and he gritted his teeth with rage  wait until i get the chance he said to himself ill get square for this insult  he cant run away for the present the captain explained to the boys when we get to a regular stopping place ill put him in irons  on the following morning it was so fair all the boys begged to be allowed to go ashore and do a little exploring the captain was willing but told them to be careful billy dill was to go with them and they took along a pistol a shotgun and some provisions  if you get into trouble fire two shots in quick succession said captain marshall if i want you to return ill fire two shots  the boys got into the boat and billy dill took one pair of oars and dave the others they were soon at the beach and landed in true nautical style then the rowboat was drawn up out of the water and into the shade of some palms that the sun might not crack open the seams  we must be extremely careful observed phil remember we do not know what is on this island  sure there might be lions suggested roger with a wink and a glance at billy dill  you boys know better nor thet rejoined the old tar none o these south sea islands have much in the way o wild beasts but you may strike a big snake  excuse me but i dont want to be introduced to his snakeship cried the senators son  after a little look around they determined to start up the shore and did so with their provisions on their backs and dave carrying the shotgun and phil the pistol roger and the old tar armed themselves with big sticks  a halfmile was covered when they came to a hollow in which were basking a number of turtles all of great size phil gave a shout and on the instant the turtles all headed for the ocean with clumsy but swift strides billy dill made after them and managed to catch the last one and turn him over  illustration billy dill managed to catch the last one and turn him over page 233  he will make fine turtle soup said the tar  so he will cried dave i suppose i might have shot at them  not worth while lad one is enough  they soon came to a portion of the shore where the undergrowth was exceedingly close and they had to journey a short distance inland the palms were thick and they saw numerous cocoanuts and great varieties of beautiful ferns and gigantic creeping vines billy dill also pointed out three varieties of breadfruit trees  well a fellow wouldnt starve here in spite of the scarcity of meat observed dave  and meat isnt especially good in hot weather added roger  natives down here eat very little meat said the old tar they use lots of yams and such stuff besides bananas and plantains everything grows of itself and they have a lazy mans life of it  excepting when they fight each other observed phil  an hour later they came out on the shore again they were now away from the harbor and could look straight out on the ocean  look look cried roger pointing seaward am i mistaken or do i see a long canoe filled with men  it certainly is a canoe declared dave after a look  and it is filled with natives added phil what do you make of this he added turning to billy dill are they coming here  i dont think they are phil they seem to be headed away from this island  the canoe was certainly a large one and they counted at least twelve natives at the paddles or sweeps other natives were in the bow and stern of the craft in quarter of an hour the canoe was but a speck in the distance and then it was lost to sight altogether  well have to tell the captain about this declared dave if there are natives around he will want to know it  perhaps they can tell us of a way out of the harbor suggested roger  like as not if there is a way out spoke up billy dill they generally know the coasts putty wellbein out so much in their canoes  the little party continued on its exploring tour but soon came to a portion of the marsh land the captain had mentioned not wishing to get stuck they began to retrace their steps until they were in the midst of the thickets again then a strange rushing sound through the trees broke upon their ears  wait whispered billy dill i know what that is dont make any noise  is there any danger queried roger  the old tar shook his head then he pointed upward and the boys saw a large flock of beautiful tropical birds settling down on all sides of them  what a sight murmured dave how pretty they are  they get birds for ladies hats from places like this whispered billy dill  i know it what a shame to shoot them down too  it is a shame lad and ladies ought to stop wearin sech finery said the old tar soberly  they watched the beautiful birds for some time then the creatures discovered the strangers and off they went in a mad flight and were lost to sight  an hour later found the party passing down the shore once more here they walked on the sand until they came to something of a cove surrounded by stately palms  might as well rest a bit began roger when dave uttered a cry  see the remains of a campfire  yes and the remains of a feast too added phil those natives must have been here     chapter xxvii  a map and a plot   the boys and billy dill viewed the surroundings with interest some bones lay on the ground and they kicked them over  these cant be human bones can they whispered the senators son to dave  no roger they are nothing but the bones of some small animal  i was afraid the natives might be cannibals  to one side of the camp lay a fantastically carved stick evidently cut by somebody during his leisure dave picked this up and saw that it contained a heart an anchor a cross several links of a chain and some stars at the big end of the stick was an american flag  hello look here exclaimed the country boy this is strange to say the least i dont believe any native would cut a stick in this fashion  neither do i declared phil that must have been carved by an american and with his jackknife perhaps some sailors were camping out here  to me this campfire or whats left o it looks to be about a week old said billy dill the question is where did the crowd go to from here  maybe there were some americans with those natives in that canoe suggested roger  in that case the natives must be friendly returned phil  they walked around the locality and down the shore half a mile further but could find nothing more of interest then they sat down to enjoy the lunch they had brought washing the meal down at a spring close by where the campfire had been  it is wonderful that fresh water should be so close to the salt observed the senators son youd think it would all get salt  nature knew man wanted fresh water and so it was placed there replied billy dill trust a kind providence to take care on us every time  after the meal the party set off for the opposite shore of the island over a small hill which divided one end from the other here the jungle was so thick they had to literally force their way through and each of the boys got his clothing torn more or less once the old tar became so completely fastened that the lads had to go to his assistance and cut him loose with their pocketknives  im jest about anchored remarked billy dill this is worse nor the sargasso sea aint it  by the middle of the afternoon they gained the opposite shore of the island here the ground was very rough but at one spot they found the remains of a villagetwo houses of logs and half a dozen thatched huts the houses and huts were bare and nothing of interest was to be found around the remains of half a dozen campfires  this shows that somebody lived here once upon a time observed phil but it couldnt have been much of a population  cant tell as to thet came from the old sailor these natives live pretty thick sometimes ten or a dozen in one hutand a good many live right out under the trees  dave and roger had passed into one of the deserted log houses and the country youth struck a match that they might see around a little better somewhat to their astonishment they saw pinned up on a wall a sheet of waterstained brown wrapping paper upon which was drawn something of a map with a heavy cross where two lines met  heres a discovery cried dave wonder what this map was for  the others came in and a minute later a torch was lit and all examined the map with care then roger uttered a cry  dave look there and the senators son pointed to one corner of the map in faint letters was the written name            dunston a porter  the very man i am looking for ejaculated dave and his heart gave a bound oh boys what can it mean  it means that mr porter has been here answered roger  he must have been hunting for that treasure said phil this may be one of his maps  thats a fact said billy dill he was always drawing jest such things when i was with him he said he was bound to find that treasure some day  this map looks to be quite old went on dave in disappointed tones i wish it was fresh and he was here  he must have come here after sailing to sobago island said the senators son and that cant be so very long ago  after that they made a closer hunt than before in and around the camp but found nothing outside of two buttons a bit of lead pencil and the broken handle of a spade  that spade proves there was some digging done said phil undoubtedly he came here looking for that treasure  did you ever get any of the particulars of that treasure asked dave of the old sailor  not much exceptin that it was a treasure of pearls and precious stones once hidden by some native king mr porter didnt want to tell much about it and i didnt feel as i had the right to ask him  it was now growing late and all felt that it was time to return to the ship before leaving the hut dave pinned a slip of paper over the map writing upon it as follows      to dunston a porter       i am very anxious to meet you i am on board the bark stormy      petrel in the harbor of this island and bound for sobago      island please see me by all means                                           david porter  to this the youth added the date and also his home address in case he should fail to meet dunston porter and the man should wish to write to him  that certainly ought to interest himespecially if he is interested in a lost boy was rogers comment  dave was in a sober mood when he returned to the ship and did not feel much like talking he allowed the others to relate the days experience to which captain marshall listened closely  it is certainly a pity we didnt get a chance to talk to those natives said the master of the stormy petrel they might have shown me some way out of this harbor  then you havent found any passage through the reef  not yet the first mate was out with four of the crew but they could find nothing wide enough answered captain marshall  the master of the bark thought he spoke the truth but he was mistaken unknown to the captain the first mate had found a passage rather twisting in shape but perfectly safe it was near the northern end of the reefa locality captain marshall had not visited one of the sailors who had been out with the mate also knew of the passage but paul shepley had pledged him to secrecy for the time being  while the boys and billy dill were in the cabin of the stormy petrel relating their experiences an interesting conversation was going on in another part of the ship between the first mate and jasper van blott  i have made an important discovery said shepley in a low tone so that no others might hear i have found a safe passageway out of this harbor  did you tell the old man demanded the former supercargo quickly  no i told him that there wasnt any opening wide enough for the bark  good now if we can only arrange this other matter shepley well make a fine thing of this went on jasper van blott  i dont know about this other thing as you call it grumbled the first mate ill be running a tremendous risk  oh it will be perfectly safe  dont you know that mutiny on the high seas is punishable by death  i doif you get caught but you wont get caught besides that please to remember that i am not going to suffer for this cargo affair alone if i have to stand trial youll have to do the same  then you really mean to drag me into it eh said the first mate sourly  unless you consent to my plan why man its dead easy continued the former supercargo earnestly i know that at least four of the sailors will stand in with us from the start and we can easily win over the others by the promise of a big reward all we have got to do is to get captain marshall billy dill and those three boys ashore and then sail away for some distant port on the way we can change the name of the bark and ill fix up the clearance papers and there you are you and i can become equal owners and we can go into the regular australiannew zealand trade and make a barrel of money in a few years  but supposing some of the men raise a row  we wont give them a chance until we are out on the ocean we can tell themafter the captains crowd is gonethat you have orders to try to clear the reef when we are on the ocean i dont think it will be so hard to manage things we can arm ourselves and lock up all the other weapons and tell the men they shall have big money if they ask no questions and stick to their duty added jasper van blott  well how do you propose to get that crowd ashore they may not happen to go of their own free will  i think i can manage that sooner or later the main thing is we must watch our chances and strike as soon as the right moment arrives now then what do you say shepley  the first mate hesitated and an argument lasting a full hour ensued during which the former supercargos plot was discussed from every possible point of view at last the first mate agreed to do as jasper van blott wanted and then the two separated to await the time for making their first move     chapter xxviii  marooned   on the following morning captain marshall went out once more to look for a passageway through the reef dave accompanied him and so did billy dill in the meantime roger and phil rowed ashore to see if they could find any more traces of the natives  the captain and dave had been out about an hour when they noticed a small boat coming toward them containing two sailors and the first mate  captain marshall you are wanted on shore at once cried paul shepley when within hearing distance those two boys just sent word to the ship by a native they said to bring young porter and dill along  they must have discovered something cried dave quickly oh let us go by all means  i will answered the master of the stormy petrel did they say where they were  near the interior of the island i believe answered the mate  no more was said and winding up his lead line the captain had the rowboat turned around and headed for the island in the meantime the first mate returned to the bark once on the deck of the ship he was quickly joined by the former supercargo  what did he say asked jasper van blott anxiously  said hed go  then we must lose no time in getting up the anchors luckily the breeze is just right  wait until they are ashore and have disappeared answered the first mate nervously he was really a coward at heart and now fairly under the thumb of van blott  it took but a few minutes for the captain dave and billy dill to gain the stretch of sand then those on the stormy petrel saw them draw the small craft up to a safe place and disappear in among the trees  now then act as quickly as you can said jasper van blott  an order was issued for the sailors to come on deck and all did so and the second mate a young man named bob sanders also appeared then paul shepley issued orders to hoist the anchors and raise some of the sails  what does this mean mr shepley asked the second mate in surprise  the captain has found a passageway and wants me to take the ship out and around to the other side of the island replied the first mate he wants us to be lively too  bob sanders was mystified but as he was not on particularly good terms with the first mate he asked no more questions soon the sails were up and paul shepley himself steered the bark toward the passageway he had discovered  you are sure of what you are doing asked jasper van blott coming to the wheel we dont want to strike and go to the bottom  i wish i was as sure of the future as i am of the passageway answered the first mate somewhat grimly  oh dont worry about the future answered the former supercargo lightly in a few days well have everything in applepie order  there was a good breeze and the bark cleared the reef with but little difficulty then paul shepley had all the sails set and soon the stormy petrel was leaving the island far behind  in the meantime captain marshall dave and the old tar were looking everywhere for phil and roger they dove straight into the jungle and called out as loudly as they could but no answer came back  it is queer that we cant locate them was daves comment if they wanted us i should think they would be watching out wouldnt you  perhaps they are in trouble answered the captain gravely  he fired his pistol as a signal and at last came an answering shot from the lower end of the island at once they hurried in that direction only to find themselves cut off by a stretch of impassable marsh land  reckon as how well have to go around observed billy dill if we try to go through thet well git stuck fer sartin  going around was not so easy and it took them nearly half an hour to cover a mile then the captain discharged his pistol once more and a minute later came an answering shot but a short distance away  i see themat the top of the hill cried dave and looking ahead the others discovered phil and roger at the top of the slight rise of ground waving their handkerchiefs to attract attention soon the two parties were together  whats the news cried captain marshall looking around to see if anybody else was present  no news answered phil he gazed at them curiously whats up you look rather excited  didnt you send for us gasped dave  send for you what do you mean queried roger  the first mate said you sent a native to the bark asking us to come to you said captain marshall  we sent nobodywe have seen no natives today  there was a pause during which each looked blankly at the others  i cant understand this said dave slowly mr shepley certainly delivered that message  it is a trick of some sort burst out captain marshall the very best thing we can do is to get back to the vessel without delay  the others thought so too and in a moment more all were on their way to the shore hurrying through the undergrowth as rapidly as the bushes and vines would permit phil and roger had managed to shoot two small animals that looked like hares but that was all  at last they came out on the sands and a shout of dismay went up  the ship is gone  the stormy petrel has sailed away and left us  the boys and the old sailor turned to captain marshall whose face had turned white now it grew dark and stern  how could they get out of the harbor questioned dave  shepley must have found a passageway answered the captain  but where has the ship gone to queried phil i cant see her anywhere  instead of replying the captain of the stormy petrel clenched his hands and compressed his lips he was doing some deep thinking  i must say this looks to me as if somebody had run off with the ship declared the senators son  and that is just what they have done cried the captain oh the rascals the scoundrels if i ever catch them he could not finish so great was his rage  run off with the ship burst out dave how could they do that do you think there was a regular mutiny  there may have beenanyway the bark is goneand we are left to shift for ourselves  i think i see through it said phil the first mate and van blott have hatched this up between them i know they were as thick as peasin fact i suspect shepley helped the supercargo to hide away on board they must have bought over the crew and mr sanders  i dont think they could buy over bob sanders declared the captain i know him too well he is very quiet but id trust him with almost anything but i cant say as much for all the crew shepley got some of the men to ship and he most likely knew whom he was getting  what are you going to do about it asked roger  i dont exactly know what to do yet lad we are marooned that is all there is to it and it doesnt look as if they had left us anything to live on either added the captain casting his eyes along the shore  do you mean to say they have deserted us cried dave  doesnt it look like it  and stolen the bark  yes  dave drew a long breath here was another setback of which he had not dreamed if the stormy petrel had really sailed away not to return what were they to do and when would they get a chance to leave the lonely island  this is positively the worst yet groaned roger the fellows who would do such a thing ought to bebe hanged and they havent left us a thing  let us separate and see if we can sight the bark said the captain and this was done one party going to the upper end of the island and the other to the lower but not a trace of the missing vessel was to be seen  it was a decidedly sober party that gathered on the sands two hours later to discuss the situation and decide upon what was to be done here they were marooned on a deserted island with no food and but little shelter and with only two pistols and a shotgun between them it was certainly not a situation to be envied  i used to think when i was a small boy that id like to play robinson crusoe remarked roger but ive changed my mind and id much rather be back on the ship  humph if you are going to talk that way what will you say if we have to stay here weeks or months or maybe years asked phil  gracious burst out dave you dont think well have to stay here years do you  well have to stay until we can git away was the sage remark of billy dill captain are we in the track o any ships  captain marshall shook his head slowly  i dont think we are that storm blew us far out of our course i doubt if a ship comes this way once in three months  there what did i tell you cried phil but dont think i want to stay he added quickly i am just as anxious to get away as any one and anxious to regain my fathers ship too why to lose her would mean a serious loss to my father  they talked the matter over until nightfall but without reaching any satisfactory conclusion not one of the party could bring himself to think that he would really have to stay on the island for any great length of time  if we do have to stay well have to rassle around fer somethin to eat remarked billy dill the mean sharks they might at least have left us a barrel o salt horse an some canned goodsan a little tobacco he added dolefully his pipe was empty and so was his pouch and this added the last drop to his misery  as night came on they gathered some driftwood and lit a campfire not because they were cold but because it looked more cheerful and because it also helped to keep away some obnoxious insects that had appeared over the fire they cooked the game roger and phil had shot and made a supper of this and some crackers the boys had been carrying in their pockets then they sat down to talk the matter over once more as the night advanced the bright stars bespangled the heavens and all became perfectly calm and quiet tired out by what had passed one after another sought a comfortable restingplace and soon all were sound asleep     chapter xxix  the coming of the natives   when dave awoke it was with a start the wind was blowing half a gale and the rain was falling  what a change since last night he murmured to himself as he sat up hello are you up already  i am answered billy dill thought as how id better keep the fire agoin if its goin to storm this aint so nice is it  i should say not indeed my now the wind is rising  the others soon roused up and all gathered under the shelter of some dense tropical trees and vines soon the rain was pouring down in torrents shutting out the landscape on all sides  well in one way its a good thing the stormy petrel got out of the harbor remarked captain marshall this wind might make her shift and either throw her up on the island or on to the reef  they could do nothing with the fire and so allowed it to die out and crawled still further into the jungle in an endeavor to keep dry but the rain followed them until each one of the party was about soaked  this is another one of the comforts of a robinson crusoe life remarked phil soaking wet and nothing to eat oh dont i wish i was on the bark again and had hold of those mutineers  the rain and wind kept up for the best part of that day there was but little thunder and lightning and at nightfall the storm died away although the wind still kept up at a lively rate during the afternoon they managed to find a turtle in a hollow and after turning the creature over killed it and cooked it in its own shell the meal was not particularly appetizing but all were exceedingly hungry and partook of it without a murmur  tomorrow we must gather some yams and some plantains and also do some fishing said the captain we might go hunting too but i would rather save our ammunition for emergencies  to keep from taking cold in their wet clothing all slept close to the campfire that night and early in the morning they hung most of their garments out in the bright sunshine to dry fishing proved good and the boys and billy dill caught over a score of goodsized fish and also discovered a bed of oysters which as roger declared were not half bad even if they werent particularly good in the meantime the captain who knew not a little about tropical life tramped around and found some breadfruit and some luscious berries which he declared were perfectly good to eat  this solves the question of food at least for the present said dave not a very extensive list of things to eat but much better than nothing at all  what would the boys of oak hall say if they could see us asked roger  well certainly have a tale to tellif we ever get back to tell it returned phil  having nothing in particular to do they took their time about preparing the next meal and when it was done it proved to be a regular spread some of the fish made particularly good eating and the berries topped the repast off in good style  i do not believe that the stormy petrel will come back to this harbor said captain marshall and that being so i think we had best take ourselves to the other side of the island to those log huts and shacks you mentioned that is most likely the spot where the natives land and where ships may stop we can put up a flag of distress and after that there will be nothing to do but to wait and make the best of it  shall you leave the rowboats here asked dave  we can leave one boat here and row around the island in the other we can carry the craft to some point beyond the reef  this advice was followed and beyond the reef line the ocean was found to be comparatively quiet despite the storm of the day before all entered the rowboat and the captain and billy dill took the oars and the voyage to the other side of the island was begun  by the end of the day they had reached the log houses and they cleaned out the larger of the two and gave to it as much of a homelike appearance as possible then they set to work to gather all the driftwood possible for they had nothing with which to cut firewood the boys fell to fishing once more and phil began to manufacture a snare with which he hoped to trap some small animals that had been discovered at a distance  another whole day passed by slowly and they began to feel a little more settled when in the middle of the afternoon billy dill who was out in the rowboat trying to catch some big fish set up a loud shout  what is it demanded captain marshall who was busily at work breaking up some of the driftwood  i see a big canoe comin loaded with niggers announced the old sailor  this news brought all to the shore immediately and they watched the approach of the canoe with much interest it was all of twentyfive feet in length and manned by twelve darkcolored men six on each side the natives in the craft numbered all told nineteen and some of them had guns while others had bows and arrows and long spears each man had also a long and sharp knife stuck in his girdle  do you think they will be friendly asked dave in a low tone  i hope so answered the captain they have nothing to gain by being otherwise  when the natives discovered the whites they stopped rowing and set up an animated jabbering among themselves they looked around thinking a ship must be close by and finding none were much astonished  hello called out captain marshall waving a welcome glad to see you  to this the natives did not answer but the canoe was sent closer and finally beached and the majority of the black men leaped ashore each carrying his weapons with him  how do you do went on the captain extending his hand and smiling glad to see you can anybody speak english  at the question one of the natives a short thickset fellow with a peculiarly flat nose came to the front and shook hands  soko speak inglees he said and grinned soko once on inglees ship  i am glad to know you soko replied the captain i am captain marshall of the ship stormy petrel what island is this  dis yamkolo island answered soko still grinning how you come dis way where he ship  some rascals have stolen my ship she is a finelooking bark she was here a few days ago have you seen her  no see ship nono ship so many days and the native held up four fingers all stumpy and not overly clean steal ship on you big thief yes  you are right where do you come from  come from waponu dat on sobago island  yes i have heard of the place the captain turned to the others it is a native village some ten miles from the town for which the stormy petrel was bound he explained  then perhaps they can take us to sobago said dave eagerly  perhaps they can answered the captain but it must be a long trip in such a canoe as that  tell me said dave to the native do you come here often  sometime not many time answered soko still grinning he was evidently of a sunny disposition  did you ever come here with a man named dunston porter  at this question the native shrugged his shoulders and looked perplexed  i mean this man went on the youth and taking the native by the hand led him into the hut and up to the map on the wall instantly the face of soko brightened  yes soko know he said dat man come so many time here he held up three fingers look in ground dig not can find much no go back to sobago so and he made a dejected face at which roger and phil had to laugh  he means mr porter didnt locate the treasure said the senators son  is that man in sobago now went on dave paying no attention to his chums remark  yes him at big town nanpi  good i then i would like to get to nanpi just as soon as i can cried dave enthusiastically will you take me there i can pay you well he added for he still had his money belt and cash with him  yes can take to nanpi answered the native  after that he explained that he and his companions had come to the island to hunt for some rare birds and for turtles they were quite willing to return to sobago island immediately if paid for so doing a bargain was struck and it was decided that the voyage should be begun in the morning in the meantime all hands were to catch some fish and cook them and also gather in a supply of other eatables the natives had a number of hollow reeds with them and these were filled with fresh water just previous to setting out it was calculated that weather permitting the distance would be covered in three days  these fellows know how to handle their big canoes very well explained captain marshall they go out hundreds of miles and sometimes weather the worst of storms occasionally of course they get swept away but not often they sail altogether by the sun and stars and can strike almost as straight a course as if they were using a compass  dave questioned soko further about dunston porter but could learn little outside of the fact that the man was a treasure hunter and had paid very well for what was done for him soko added however that he thought the man expected to remain at sobago for some time  the boys could sleep but little that night so anxious were they concerning the trip before them they were up at dawn but early as it was found the natives ahead of them a hasty breakfast was had by all the things to be taken along were packed in the bow and stern of the canoe and shortly after sunrise the craft was pushed from the shore whites and natives scrambled in and the start from the lonely island was made     chapter xxx  the retaking of the stormy petrel   for the whole of that day the natives kept at the sweeps of the long canoe one set of rowers relieving the other the whites were willing to assist but soko said the natives could get along best alone they having their own peculiar manner of handling the craft  the weather remained fair with only a bit of a breeze blowing and the bosom of the ocean was as calm as they could wish they were soon out of sight of the island and then all they could behold was the sky above and the sparkling waters on every side  it must be terrible to be lost on the ocean remarked phil as he gazed around i dont wonder that men go mad after they have been out days and days  and think of having nothing to eat or to drink said dave ugh it gives a fellow the shivers to think of it  at noon the whole party partook of a lunch and toward nightfall had supper then the whites went to sleep and so did half of the natives the remaining blacks keeping at the sweeps guiding themselves by the stars now that the sun had gone down  when the boys awoke they were dismayed to see that a mist covered the sea  hello i didnt expect this cried the senators son why a fellow cant see a hundred feet in any direction  what are the natives going to do now asked dave of captain marshall who had been awake for some time  soko says they must rest and wait answered the captain he cannot go ahead for he knows not in what direction to steer  ive got a pocket compass cried phil bringing it forth how odd that i didnt think of it before  the captain took the compass and showed it to the native who could speak english he had seen such things before and after a short talk with the master of the stormy petrel set the others to using the sweeps as before  it was about ten oclock of the forenoon that one of the natives who was watching in the bow uttered a short cry at once those at the sweeps stopped pulling  what is it asked captain marshall quickly  big ship over dare announced soko a moment later  all of the whites looked in the direction pointed out and through the mist saw a large vessel drifting along the sails flapping idly against the masts the wheel was lashed fast and nobody was in sight on the deck  the stormy petrel ejaculated captain marshall  are you sure asked dave and phil in a breath  sure its the bark cried billy dill say but this is great luck aint it and his face brightened up now we can teach them dirty mutineers a lesson  dat you ship asked soko  it is answered captain marshall see here soko he went on can i depend upon your helping me i will pay you and your men for whatever you do  the native shugged his ebony shoulders and then consulted with his fellowtribesmen all decided that they would aid the captain providing he would give them each a piece of silver so big pointing out the size of a trade dollar captain marshall agreed on the spot and preparations were made for boarding the bark  it is queer that nobody is in sight remarked phil as the canoe drew closer  somebody is coming on deck now cried dave in a low tone and paul shepley appeared followed by jasper van blott and close behind him one of the sailors  hello whats this sang out the first mate on catching sight of the canoe  captain marshall and the others muttered the former supercargo hi keep away from here he roared  surrender you villains called out the captain what do you mean by running off with my ship in this fashion  you keep off warned paul shepley without answering the question keep off i tell you  well fire on you if you dont keep off called the former supercargo and he brought forth a big pistol  be careful capn or somebody will git shot whispered billy dill those fellers look like they was desprit  dont you dare to shoot called out captain marshall the first man who fires shall swing from the yardarm  the loud talking had brought several sailors to the deck and they were followed by the second mate who stared at the canoe and its occupants as if he could not believe his eyes  hello captain marshall sang out bob sanders i am mighty glad you have come  then you are not in this mutiny sanders  not by a jugful they tried to buy me up but i wouldnt consent podders diski and mcnabb are not in it either  i am glad to hear it sanders take control of the ship until i get aboard  he will do nothing of the kind yelled jasper van blott and was about to turn on the second mate when the latter hit him a blow in the ear sending him headlong to the deck  mcnabb podders called the second mate grab mr shepley  the sailors called upon understood and before the first mate could turn one tar had him from behind so that he could not raise his arms then the other seized a pistol and turning faced the crew with the weapon  the turn of affairs had been so sudden that shepley and van blott were taken completely by surprise as were likewise the sailors who had sided with the rascals and for the moment none of them knew exactly what to do in the meantime the canoe bumped alongside of the stormy petrel and catching hold of a trailing rope thrown overboard by the sailor named diski captain marshall hauled himself to the deck followed by billy dill and the boys  do you surrender demanded the captain striding up to the first mate revolver in hand  yeyes burst out shepley itsits all a mistake captain marshallall a mistake  i reckon it was answered the captain grimly what about you van blott and he turned on the former supercargo who was struggling to his feet  i suppose ive got to give in muttered jasper van blott  and what about you men demanded captain marshall turning his stern eyes on the portion of the crew that had mutinied  were with you capn said one humbly mr shepley led us into this without us knowin what we was adoin aint that so mates  thats so said the others humbly  are you willing to obey me after this  yes yes came in an eager chorus  after this a long talk took place and jasper van blott and paul shepley were placed in irons and conducted to a closet in the bow of the ship used for the storage of oil and lanterns the place was given a rough cleaning and then the pair were locked inside captain marshall putting the key in his pocket both of the prisoners wanted to protest but the master of the stormy petrel would not listen  you can do your talking later when i have time to listen said he just now i have other matters to attend to  from bob sanders and the three loyal sailors captain marshall got a fairly accurate account of the mutiny he was told that jasper van blott had done his best to get all hands to join in the plot the former supercargo was the prime mover in the affair and the first mate was a coward and had been little more than his tool the sailors who had gone in had done so rather unwillingly and after thinking the matter over captain marshall decided to read them a stern lecture and then forgive them  it was now no longer necessary for the natives to take the whites to sobago island and after a brief consultation soko and his men were paid off and given some presents and then the mists rising the canoe was headed back for yamkolo island it was the last that dave and his friends saw of these black men who had proven so friendly  with the first mate in irons bob sanders was advanced to fill his place this left the position of second mate vacant and after a consultation with the boys the master of the stormy petrel offered billy dill the position and he accepted gladly  i always kind o wanted to be a mate said the old tar im tickled to death and his face showed it  with the lifting of the mist a stiff breeze came up and preparations were made for continuing the voyage to nanpi it was found that the last storm had slightly disabled the rudder which accounted for the fact that the bark had not made greater headway on her trip but additional parts were on board and by nightfall the damage was made good and then the stormy petrel answered her helm as well as ever  and now for sobago island cried dave to his chums i hope i have no more trouble in finding mr dunston porter     chapter xxxi  lifting the curtain   the second mate told the truth when he said paul shepley was a coward and under the thumb of the former supercargo that very evening shepley begged to see captain marshall alone and when given the opportunity actually fell on his knees before the master of the stormy petrel  i am willing to do anything captain he groaned only dontdont swing me from thethe yardarm he had it firmly fixed in his mind that he was to be executed  you deserve to be hanged answered the captain i dont see why i should spare you  it was all van blotts faulthe fixed the whole thing from beginning to end he got the stolen cases on board and made me promise to help in getting rid of them and he got up the plan to run away with the ship  after that paul shepley told his story in detail and the captain became convinced that the first mate was more of a sneak than a villain  i will let you off upon two conditions said captain marshall at last the first is that you serve as a common sailor for the rest of this trip will you do it  yes but its pretty hard on me whined shepley  the second condition is that you promise to appear against van blott whenever called upon to do so  yes ill do that  then go forward and take billy dills place in the forecastle  where is dill to go  i have made him second mate and sanders first mate  oh murmured paul shepley and said no more it cut him deeply to take up quarters in the forecastle where the men treated him any way but kindly yet he was glad to get off so cheaply  the next day was an anxious one for dave who was on the constant lookout for land toward nightfall a speck was seen in the distance and in the morning when he came on deck the country youth saw before him sobago in all of its tropical beauty with its cozy harbor its long stretch of white sand and its waving palms in the harbor were ships of several nationalities and also numerous native canoes and the scene was an animated one  the boys had no difficulty in getting ashore but once on the streets of nanpi they scarcely knew how to turn they walked along slowly until they came to a shipping office in the window of which was a sign            english spoken here  i am going in here to ask a few questions said dave and entered followed by phil and roger they found in the office a very stout and very bald old gentleman wearing big spectacles  you speak english i believe said dave politely  i speak english and a dozen other languages too said the baldheaded gentleman peering at them curiously whyerhows this he added to dave is this some joke why did you shave so clean  shave repeated dave his heart gave a sudden bound why do you ask that question  why ierthis is most extraordinary ejaculated the man still staring at the country youth i dont understand it  dont understand what  you look so much like a man i knowa mr dunston porter maybe he is some relative of yours  the very man i am looking for cried dave can you tell me where i can find him his heart was almost in his throat as he asked the question supposing mr dunston porter had left sobago island for parts unknown  find him i think so he was here yesterday and said he was going out to the ruins of the old temple on the pokali road he expected to be gone all day on the trip hell be back to town by night  then youll have to wait dave came from phil  oh i cant wait burst out dave how far is that old temple from here  about three miles  can i hire somebody to take me there i want to see mr porter as soon as possible  certainly you can get a boy for a few pennies answered the baldheaded man there is a boy now who wants a job and he beckoned to an urchin who sat on an empty box eating a banana  when the lad came up the man explained in the native tongue and soon the party set off dave first thanking the baldheaded man for his kindness  to phil and roger the walk on the tropical road was long hot and dusty but dave was so busy with his thoughts that he did not notice he was walking at all how much the next hour or two might reveal  presently they came in sight of a ruined pile which the native boy pointed out as the old temple dave forged ahead and hurried into the ruins and then around to the back here from under some palms could be had a fine view of the surrounding country  a hasty glance around revealed to dave the form of a man lying on the grass half asleep the country youth hurried forward gave a good look and uttered a little cry at which the man sat up suddenly  who are you asked the man and then he began to stare at dave very hard  is this mr dunston porter asked dave in a voice he tried in vain to steady  yes thats my name but you the man paused expectantly  i am dave porter i have come about seven thousand miles to see you  illustration i have come about seven thousand miles to see youpage 274  dave porter seven thousand miles to see me i must be dreaming the man leaped to his feet and came up to dave how is this wont you explain  i will try mr porter  they do look exactly alike said phil to roger in a whisper what an extraordinary likeness  no wonder billy dill was startled when he first met dave added the senators son  dunston porter heard the talk and looked at the others at this phil took a step forward  we are dave porters school chums he explained my name is phil lawrence and this is roger morr  glad to know you did you travel seven thousand miles to see me too went on the man  hardly that but we took the trip with dave answered roger  he wanted to find the man who looked like him continued phil for he saw dave could hardly speak for his emotion and he has found him you two look exactly alikethat is you would if your mustache was shaved off  yes dunston porter paused is that all  no no cried dave struggling to keep calm i came toto find out something about myself if i could its a long story and ill have to start at the beginning when i was a youngster about three years old i was picked up alongside a railroad track by some farming people they supposed i had been put off a train by somebody who wanted to get rid of me they asked me my name and i said something that sounded to them like davy and dundun and porter and so they called me dave porter  ah cried dunston porter and he was all attention go on  i was taken to the poorhouse and then went to live with some other folks who were very kind to me and one rich gentleman sent me to a boarding school while there i helped an old sailor named billy dill  billy dill well i never go on please  he was struck when he saw mesaid i was somebody else with my mustache shaved off and a lot more he finally told me about you and said you had told him about a crazy nurse and a lost child and so i made up my mind to find you if i could and see if you knew anything about my past daves lips began to quiver again can you tell me anything  iiperhaps so dunston porters voice was also quivering can you prove this story about being found near a railroad  yes  about thirteen years ago  yes  in the eastern part of the united states  yes near a village called crumville they say i said something about a bad man who wouldnt buy some candy for me it may be that that man put me off the train  he did almost shouted dunston porter it was sandy margot the worthless husband of the crazy nurse polly margot you just mentioned she took the child and turned the boy over to her husband margot wanted to make money out of the abduction but during his travels with the little one he learned that detectives were after him and when the train stopped one day he put the child off and promised it some candy to keep it from crying he got away and we never heard of him for about six years then he was rounded up in a burglary and badly wounded he confessed at the hospital but he could not tell the name of the place where the child had been dropped we made a search but could discover nothing margot died and so did his crazy wife and there the whole matter has been resting  but who am i cried dave unable to restrain the question any longer  oh you dont know that i thought billy dill knew if what you have told me is true you are the son of my twin brother david breslow porter     chapter xxxii  homeward boundconclusion   i am the son of your twin brother repeated dave while roger and phil listened with intense interest  yes answered dunston porter he lost his son exactly as described and the baby was said to resemble me very strongly  and where is your brother now  he is traveling for his health the last i heard of him he was in europe at one of the wellknown watering places  is his wife alive  no she died years ago but he has a daughter with him lauraabout a year younger than you dunston porter took daves hand this is simply marvelous i can hardly believe it my nephew dave why it sounds like a fairy tale  it is marvelous mr por  hold on if we are relatives youll have to call me uncle dunston and the man smiled pleasantly  well then uncle dunston are my father and my sister alone in the world  they are excepting for me we used to have other brothers and a sister but all of them are dead i am alone herean old bachelor  but you used to live with my father is that it  yes we were once in business togetherowned a chemical works in new york and another in chicago and we also had some patents for manufacturing gas by a new process but both of us liked to travel around and so we sold out and since that time we have been roaming around the world sometimes together and then again alone although he always takes laura with him no matter where he goes he is afraid to leave her behind for fear she will be lost to him just as you were  do you know his exact address now  no but i think a letter sent to a certain address in paris will be forwarded to him to tell the truth i have been out here so long i have partly lost track of him he will be amazed to hear from you i am sure and laura will be surprised too  i shall write to him as soon as possible answered dave  of course of course and i will write too rejoined dunston porter  after that sitting in the shade of the old temple and the palm trees dave and his chums told their story from beginning to end and then dunston porter related some of his own experiences and told much more concerning daves father and sister laura he said that he and his twin brother looked somewhat alike which accounted for daves resemblance to himself he was glad to add that both he and his brother were welltodo so they could come and go as they pleased  as you know i am hunting for a treasure of pearls and precious stones said dunston porter so far i have been unsuccessful but i feel sure that i shall find them some day and even if i dont the task of looking for the treasure pleases me and gives me the chance to visit many of these beautiful islands of the south seas  the boy who had brought dave and his chums to the old temple had been dismissed and dunston porter took them back to nanpi where he had accommodations in the best public house the place afforded here billy dill visited him  does my heart good to see ye again cried the old tar an aint it jest wonderful about dave now stand up side by side an look into thet glass as like as two beans say i and dunston porter agreed with him  of course the old sailor had to tell all he knew and dave brought out pictures of caspar potts and the wadsworths which he had brought along in return dunston porter gave dave pictures of his father and his sister laura the boy gazed at the photographs a long while and the tears filled his eyes as he did so  well there is one thing sure he murmured to roger at any rate i am no longer a poorhouse nobody  thats right dave returned the senators son warmly let me congratulate you by that picture your father must be a nice man and your sister is handsome  and to think that they are rich added phil thats the best of all  no the best of all is to find that i belong somewhere in this worldthat i am not a nobody answered dave earnestly  wont nat poole and gus plum stare when they hear of this went on roger i believe it will really make them feel sore  ben and sam and the others will be glad said phil and i am sure doctor clay will want to congratulate you dave it paid to take this trip to the south seas after all didnt it  i should say it did cried dave i shouldnt have wanted to miss it for the world  for several days dave felt as if he was dreaming and walking on air his heart was so light the more the boy saw of his uncle dunston the more he liked the man and dunston porter was equally pleased both had long talks regarding the past and the future and it was agreed that the man should return to the united states for the time being and instead of hunting for the treasure trace up the present address of david porter senior and daves sister laura  i wish to meet this caspar potts and also the wadsworths said dunston porter if i can i wish to repay them for all they have done for you  i am sure they will not take any money answered the boy but they will be glad to meet you later on dave took his uncle on board the stormy petrel where captain marshall gave the newly found relative a very enthusiastic welcome  the captain of the bark had thought to bring jasper van blott before the authorities at nanpi but was prevented by an accident which came close to terminating fatally and sending the bark up into smoke and flames jasper van blott attempted to break out of the oil closet in the bow of the stormy petrel and in so doing lit a match this fell on some oily waste in a corner and before an alarm could be given the former supercargo was seriously burned and the whole bow of the bark was on fire jasper van blott had to be taken to a hospital where it was said he would lose the sight of one eye and be disfigured for life under such circumstances it was decided to let the case against him drop the damage to the stormy petrel was so serious that the bark had to be laid up for repairs and in such an outoftheway place it was said these would take a month or six weeks  this has certainly proved to be a strange voyage said roger i must say i dont like the idea of staying here six weeks id like to get back home  just what i say answered dave  in the port was what is known as a tramp steamer that is one picking up any cargo to be found from one port to the next this steamer had secured a cargo for san francisco and was to sail on the following saturday  we might secure passage on her suggested dunston porter and inside of twentyfour hours it was arranged that he with dave and roger should sail on the steamer phil was to remain with captain marshall to straighten out the mess left by jasper van blott  but never mind said the shipowners son when the chums came to separate ill see you again sooner or laterand then well talk over all the many adventures we have had  dave and roger found the accommodations on the steamer fully as good as those on the bark and the voyage to san francisco passed pleasantly enough as soon as the boys went ashore they hurried to the postoffice where they found half a dozen letters awaiting them one from ben basswood to dave interested them greatly       you will be glad to learn that shadow hamilton is cleared of      the trouble that was laid at his door so ran the      communication doctor clay had somebody set a watch and as a      consequence it has been proved beyond a doubt that gus plum      took the stamps from where shadow placed them in his sleep      when plum was accused he said he didnt know they were the      doctors stamps it seems he needed money as his father is      down in the world and has cut off gus spending allowance      there was a big row but the plum family is hushing the matter      up and i understand doctor clay has agreed to give gus one      more chance at oak hall  it is just like doctor clay to give him another chance was rogers comment he is as kindhearted as any man in the world  if i ever go back to school i hope i have no more trouble with gus plum said dave but he did have trouble of a most peculiar kind and what it was will be told in another volume of this series to be entitled dave porters return to school or winning the medal of honor in this new volume we shall meet all our old friends once more and learn something further of daves father and sister laura  dave did not depend on the mails but as soon as he could had telegrams flashed to crumville and to doctor clay stating he had found an uncle and soon expected to meet his father and sister then the party of three took a pullman train for the east  i can tell you it feels good to get back to the united states once more said the senators son as the boys sat by the car window looking at the scenery as it glided by  do you know it seems an age to me since we went away declared dave and yet it is only a little over two months  that is because so much has happened in the meantime dave it was certainly a remarkable trip  and the trip brought remarkable results said dunston porter with a quiet smile  when dave arrived at crumville there was quite a gathering to receive him and the others all the wadsworths were there including jessie who rushed straight into his arms and caspar potts and ben basswood  oh i am so glad you are back cried jessie  we are all glad added ben  we cannot bear to think of losing you dave said mrs wadsworth anxiously you have become very dear to us all  you are not going to lose me that is not altogether answered the boy no matter what happens i shall never forget all my old friends  and all shook hands warmly and here kind reader let us take our departure  the end     dave porter series  by edward stratemeyer  12mo cloth illustrated 150 net each  mr stratemeyer has seldom introduced a
