52407248	men of iron  by howard pyle     introduction  the year 1400 opened with more than usual peacefulness in england only a few months before richard iiweak wicked and treacheroushad been dethroned and henry iv declared king in his stead but it was only a seeming peacefulness lasting but for a little while for though king henry proved himself a just and a merciful manas justice and mercy went with the men of iron of those daysand though he did not care to shed blood needlessly there were many noble families who had been benefited by king richard during his reign and who had lost somewhat of their power and prestige from the coming in of the new king  among these were a number of great lordsthe dukes of albemarle surrey and exeter the marquis of dorset the earl of gloucester and otherswho had been degraded to their former titles and estates from which king richard had lifted them these and others brewed a secret plot to take king henrys life which plot might have succeeded had not one of their own number betrayed them  their plan had been to fall upon the king and his adherents and to massacre them during a great tournament to be held at oxford but henry did not appear at the lists whereupon knowing that he had been lodging at windsor with only a few attendants the conspirators marched thither against him in the mean time the king had been warned of the plot so that instead of finding him in the royal castle they discovered through their scouts that he had hurried to london whence he was even then marching against them at the head of a considerable army so nothing was left them but flight some betook themselves one way some another some sought sanctuary here some there but one and another they were all of them caught and killed  the earl of kentone time duke of surreyand the earl of salisbury were beheaded in the marketplace at cirencester lord le despenceronce the earl of gloucesterand lord lumley met the same fate at bristol the earl of huntingdon was taken in the essex fens carried to the castle of the duke of gloucester whom he had betrayed to his death in king richards time and was there killed by the castle people those few who found friends faithful and bold enough to afford them shelter dragged those friends down in their own ruin  just such a case was that of the father of the boy hero of this story the blind lord gilbert reginald falworth baron of falworth and easterbridge who though having no part in the plot suffered through it ruin utter and complete  he had been a faithful counsellor and adviser to king richard and perhaps it was this as much and more than his roundabout connection with the plot that brought upon him the punishment he suffered    chapter 1  myles falworth was but eight years of age at that time and it was only afterwards and when he grew old enough to know more of the ins and outs of the matter that he could remember by bits and pieces the things that afterwards happened how one evening a knight came clattering into the courtyard upon a horse rednostrilled and smeared with the sweat and foam of a desperate ridesir john dale a dear friend of the blind lord  even though so young myles knew that something very serious had happened to make sir john so pale and haggard and he dimly remembered leaning against the knights ironcovered knees looking up into his gloomy face and asking him if he was sick to look so strange thereupon those who had been too troubled before to notice him bethought themselves of him and sent him to bed rebellious at having to go so early  he remembered how the next morning looking out of a window high up under the eaves he saw a great troop of horsemen come riding into the courtyard beneath where a powdering of snow had whitened everything and of how the leader a knight clad in black armor dismounted and entered the great hall doorway below followed by several of the band  he remembered how some of the castle women were standing in a frightened group upon the landing of the stairs talking together in low voices about a matter he did not understand excepting that the armed men who had ridden into the courtyard had come for sir john dale none of the women paid any attention to him so shunning their notice he ran off down the winding stairs expecting every moment to be called back again by some one of them  a crowd of castle people all very serious and quiet were gathered in the hall where a number of strange menatarms lounged upon the benches while two billmen in steel caps and leathern jacks stood guarding the great door the butts of their weapons resting upon the ground and the staves crossed barring the doorway  in the anteroom was the knight in black armor whom myles had seen from the window he was sitting at the table his great helmet lying upon the bench beside him and a quart beaker of spiced wine at his elbow a clerk sat at the other end of the same table with inkhorn in one hand and pen in the other and a parchment spread in front of him  master robert the castle steward stood before the knight who every now and then put to him a question which the other would answer and the clerk write the answer down upon the parchment  his father stood with his back to the fireplace looking down upon the floor with his blind eyes his brows drawn moodily together and the scar of the great wound that he had received at the tournament at yorkthe wound that had made him blindshowing red across his forehead as it always did when he was angered or troubled  there was something about it all that frightened myles who crept to his fathers side and slid his little hand into the palm that hung limp and inert in answer to the touch his father grasped the hand tightly but did not seem otherwise to notice that he was there neither did the black knight pay any attention to him but continued putting his questions to master robert  then suddenly there was a commotion in the hall without loud voices and a hurrying here and there the black knight half arose grasping a heavy iron mace that lay upon the bench beside him and the next moment sir john dale himself as pale as death walked into the antechamber he stopped in the very middle of the room i yield me to my lords grace and mercy said he to the black knight and they were the last words he ever uttered in this world  the black knight shouted out some words of command and swinging up the iron mace in his hand strode forward clanking towards sir john who raised his arm as though to shield himself from the blow two or three of those who stood in the hall without came running into the room with drawn swords and bills and little myles crying out with terror hid his face in his fathers long gown  the next instant came the sound of a heavy blow and of a groan then another blow and the sound of one falling upon the ground then the clashing of steel and in the midst lord falworth crying in a dreadful voice thou traitor thou coward thou murderer  master robert snatched myles away from his father and bore him out of the room in spite of his screams and struggles and he remembered just one instants sight of sir john lying still and silent upon his face and of the black knight standing above him with the terrible mace in his hand stained a dreadful red  it was the next day that lord and lady falworth and little myles together with three of the more faithful of their people left the castle  his memory of past things held a picture for myles of old diccon bowman standing over him in the silence of midnight with a lighted lamp in his hand and with it a recollection of being bidden to hush when he would have spoken and of being dressed by diccon and one of the women bewildered with sleep shuddering and chattering with cold  he remembered being wrapped in the sheepskin that lay at the foot of his bed and of being carried in diccon bowmans arms down the silent darkness of the winding stairway with the great black giant shadows swaying and flickering upon the stone wall as the dull flame of the lamp swayed and flickered in the cold breathing of the night air  below were his father and mother and two or three others a stranger stood warming his hands at a newlymade fire and little myles as he peeped from out the warm sheepskin saw that he was in ridingboots and was covered with mud he did not know till long years afterwards that the stranger was a messenger sent by a friend at the kings court bidding his father fly for safety  they who stood there by the red blaze of the fire were all very still talking in whispers and walking on tiptoes and myless mother hugged him in her arms sheepskin and all kissing him with the tears streaming down her cheeks and whispering to him as though he could understand their trouble that they were about to leave their home forever  then diccon bowman carried him out into the strangeness of the winter midnight  outside beyond the frozen moat where the osiers stood stark and stiff in their winter nakedness was a group of dark figures waiting for them with horses in the pallid moonlight myles recognized the wellknown face of father edward the prior of st marys  after that came a long ride through that silent night upon the saddlebow in front of diccon bowman then a deep heavy sleep that fell upon him in spite of the galloping of the horses  when next he woke the sun was shining and his home and his whole life were changed    chapter 2  from the time the family escaped from falworth castle that midwinter night to the time myles was sixteen years old he knew nothing of the great world beyond crosbeydale a fair was held twice in a twelvemonth at the markettown of wisebey and three times in the seven years old diccon bowman took the lad to see the sights at that place beyond these three glimpses of the outer world he lived almost as secluded a life as one of the neighboring monks of st marys priory  crosbeyholt their new home was different enough from falworth or easterbridge castle the former baronial seats of lord falworth it was a long low strawthatched farmhouse once when the church lands were divided into two holdings one of the bailiffs houses all around were the fruitful farms of the priory tilled by welltodo tenant holders and rich with fields of waving grain and meadowlands where sheep and cattle grazed in flocks and herds for in those days the church lands were under church rule and were governed by church laws and there when war and famine and waste and sloth blighted the outside world harvests flourished and were gathered and sheep were sheared and cows were milked in peace and quietness  the prior of st marys owed much if not all of the churchs prosperity to the blind lord falworth and now he was paying it back with a haven of refuge from the ruin that his former patron had brought upon himself by giving shelter to sir john dale  i fancy that most boys do not love the grinding of school lifethe lessons to be conned the close application during study hours it is not often pleasant to brisk lively lads to be so cooped up i wonder what the boys of today would have thought of myless training with him that training was not only of the mind but of the body as well and for seven years it was almost unremitting thou hast thine own way to make in the world sirrah his father said more than once when the boy complained of the grinding hardness of his life and to make ones way in those days meant a thousand times more than it does now it meant not only a heart to feel and a brain to think but a hand quick and strong to strike in battle and a body tough to endure the wounds and blows in return and so it was that myless body as well as his mind had to be trained to meet the needs of the dark age in which he lived  every morning winter or summer rain or shine he tramped away six long miles to the priory school and in the evenings his mother taught him french  myles being prejudiced in the school of thought of his day rebelled not a little at that last branch of his studies why must i learn that vile tongue said he  call it not vile said the blind old lord grimly belike when thou art grown a man thoult have to seek thy fortune in france land for england is haply no place for such as be of falworth blood and in afteryears true to his fathers prediction the vile tongue served him well  as for his physical training that pretty well filled up the hours between his morning studies at the monastery and his evening studies at home then it was that old diccon bowman took him in hand than whom none could be better fitted to shape his young body to strength and his hands to skill in arms the old bowman had served with lord falworths father under the black prince both in france and spain and in long years of war had gained a practical knowledge of arms that few could surpass besides the use of the broadsword the short sword the quarterstaff and the cudgel he taught myles to shoot so skilfully with the longbow and the crossbow that not a lad in the countryside was his match at the village butts attack and defence with the lance and throwing the knife and dagger were also part of his training  then in addition to this more regular part of his physical training myles was taught in another branch not so often included in the military education of the daythe art of wrestling it happened that a fellow lived in crosbey village by name ralphthesmith who was the greatest wrestler in the countryside and had worn the champion belt for three years every sunday afternoon in fair weather he came to teach myles the art and being wonderfully adept in bodily feats he soon grew so quick and active and firmfooted that he could cast any lad under twenty years of age living within a range of five miles  it is main ungentle armscraft that he learneth said lord falworth one day to prior edward saving only the broadsword the dagger and the lance there is but little that a gentleman of his strain may use nethless he gaineth quickness and suppleness and if he hath true blood in his veins he will acquire knightly arts shrewdly quick when the time cometh to learn them  but hard and grinding as myless life was it was not entirely without pleasures there were many boys living in crosbeydale and the village yeomens and farmers sons to be sure but nevertheless lads of his own age and that after all is the main requirement for friendship in boyhoods world then there was the river to bathe in there were the hills and valleys to roam over and the wold and woodland with their wealth of nuts and birdsnests and what not of boyhoods treasures  once he gained a triumph that for many a day was very sweet under the tongue of his memory as was said before he had been three times to the markettown at fairtime and upon the last of these occasions he had fought a bout of quarterstaff with a young fellow of twenty and had been the conqueror he was then only a little over fourteen years old  old diccon who had gone with him to the fair had met some cronies of his own with whom he had sat gossiping in the alebooth leaving myles for the nonce to shift for himself byandby the old man had noticed a crowd gathered at one part of the fairground and snuffing a fight had gone running alepot in hand then peering over the shoulders of the crowd he had seen his young master stripped to the waist fighting like a gladiator with a fellow a head taller than himself diccon was about to force his way through the crowd and drag them asunder but a second look had showed his practised eye that myles was not only holding his own but was in the way of winning the victory so he had stood with the others looking on withholding himself from any interference and whatever upbraiding might be necessary until the fight had been brought to a triumphant close lord falworth never heard directly of the redoubtable affair but old diccon was not so silent with the common folk of crosbeydale and so no doubt the father had some inkling of what had happened it was shortly after this notable event that myles was formally initiated into squirehood his father and mother as was the custom stood sponsors for him by them each bearing a lighted taper he was escorted to the altar it was at st marys priory and prior edward blessed the sword and girded it to the lads side no one was present but the four and when the good prior had given the benediction and had signed the cross upon his forehead myless mother stooped and kissed his brow just where the priests finger had drawn the holy sign her eyes brimmed bright with tears as she did so poor lady perhaps she only then and for the first time realized how big her fledgling was growing for his nest henceforth myles had the right to wear a sword   myles had ended his fifteenth year he was a bonny lad with brown face curling hair a square strong chin and a pair of merry laughing blue eyes his shoulders were broad his chest was thick of girth his muscles and thews were as tough as oak  the day upon which he was sixteen years old as he came whistling home from the monastery school he was met by diccon bowman  master myles said the old man with a snuffle in his voicemaster myles thy father would see thee in his chamber and bade me send thee to him as soon as thou didst come home oh master myles i fear me that belike thou art going to leave home tomorrow day  myles stopped short to leave home he cried  aye said old diccon belike thou goest to some grand castle to live there and be a page there and what not and then haply a gentlemanatarms in some great lords pay  what coil is this about castles and lords and gentlemenatarms said myles what talkest thou of diccon art thou jesting  nay said diccon i am not jesting but go to thy father and then thou wilt presently know all only this i do say that it is like thou leavest us tomorrow day  and so it was as diccon had said myles was to leave home the very next morning he found his father and mother and prior edward together waiting for his coming  we three have been talking it over this morning said his father and so think each one that the time hath come for thee to quit this poor home of ours an thou stay here ten years longer thoult be no more fit to go then than now tomorrow i will give thee a letter to my kinsman the earl of mackworth he has thriven in these days and i have fallen away but time was that he and i were true sworn companions and plighted together in friendship never to be sundered methinks as i remember him he will abide by his plighted troth and will give thee his aid to rise in the world so as i said tomorrow morning thou shalt set forth with diccon bowman and shall go to castle devlen and there deliver this letter which prayeth him to give thee a place in his household thou mayst have this afternoon to thyself to make read such things as thou shalt take with thee and bid me diccon to take the gray horse to the village and have it shod  prior edward had been standing looking out of the window as lord falworth ended he turned  and myles said he thou wilt need some money so i will give thee as a loan forty shillings which some day thou mayst return to me an thou wilt for this know myles a man cannot do in the world without money thy father hath it ready for thee in the chest and will give it thee tomorrow ere thou goest  lord falworth had the grim strength of manhoods hard sense to upbear him in sending his son into the world but the poor lady mother had nothing of that to uphold her no doubt it was as hard then as it is now for the mother to see the nestling thrust from the nest to shift for itself what tears were shed what words of love were spoken to the only manchild none but the mother and the son ever knew  the next morning myles and the old bowman rode away and no doubt to the boy himself the dark shadows of leavetaking were lost in the golden light of hope as he rode out into the great world to seek his fortune    chapter 3  what myles remembered of falworth loomed great and grand and big as things do in the memory of childhood but even memory could not make falworth the equal of devlen castle when as he and diccon bowman rode out of devlentown across the great rude stone bridge that spanned the river he first saw rising above the crowns of the trees those huge hoary walls and the steep roofs and chimneys clustered thickly together like the roofs and chimneys of a town  the castle was built upon a plateaulike rise of ground which was enclosed by the outer wall it was surrounded on three sides by a looplike bend of the river and on the fourth was protected by a deep broad artificial moat almost as wide as the stream from which it was fed the road from the town wound for a little distance along by the edge of this moat as myles and the old bowman galloped by with the answering echo of their horses hoofbeats rattling back from the smooth stone face of the walls the lad looked up wondering at the height and strength of the great ancient fortress in his aircastle building myles had pictured the earl receiving him as the son of his onetime comrade in armsreceiving him perhaps with somewhat of the rustic warmth that he knew at crosbeydale but now as he stared at those massive walls from below and realized his own insignificance and the greatness of this great earl he felt the first keen helpless ache of homesickness shoot through his breast and his heart yearned for crosbeyholt again  then they thundered across the bridge that spanned the moat and through the dark shadows of the great gaping gateway and diccon bidding him stay for a moment rode forward to bespeak the gatekeeper  the gatekeeper gave the two in charge of one of the menatarms who were lounging upon a bench in the archway who in turn gave them into the care of one of the houseservants in the outer courtyard so having been passed from one to another and having answered many questions myles in due time found himself in the outer waitingroom sitting beside diccon bowman upon a wooden bench that stood along the wall under the great arch of a glazed window  for a while the poor country lad sat stupidly bewildered he was aware of people coming and going he was aware of talk and laughter sounding around him but he thought of nothing but his aching homesickness and the oppression of his utter littleness in the busy life of this great castle  meantime old diccon bowman was staring about him with huge interest every now and then nudging his young master calling his attention now to this and now to that until at last the lad began to awaken somewhat from his despondency to the things around besides those servants and others who came and went and a knot of six or eight menatarms with bills and poleaxes who stood at the farther doorway talking together in low tones now and then broken by a stifled laugh was a group of four young squires who lounged upon a bench beside a doorway hidden by an arras and upon them myless eyes lit with a sudden interest three of the four were about his own age one was a year or two older and all four were dressed in the blackandyellow uniform of the house of beaumont  myles plucked the bowman by the sleeve be they squires diccon said he nodding towards the door  eh said diccon aye they be squires  and will my station be with them asked the boy  aye an the earl take thee to service thoult haply be taken as squire  myles stared at them and then of a sudden was aware that the young men were talking of him he knew it by the way they eyed him askance and spoke now and then in one anothers ears one of the four a gay young fellow with long ridingboots laced with green laces said a few words the others gave a laugh and poor myles knowing how ungainly he must seem to them felt the blood rush to his cheeks and shyly turned his head  suddenly as though stirred by an impulse the same lad who had just created the laugh arose from the bench and came directly across the room to where myles and the bowman sat  give thee goodden said he what best thy name and whence comest thou an i may make bold so to ask  my name is myles falworth said myles and i come from crosbeydale bearing a letter to my lord  never did i hear of crosbeydale said the squire but what seekest here if so be i may ask that much  i come seeking service said myles and would enter as an esquire such as ye be in my lords household  myless new acquaintance grinned thoult make a droll squire to wait in a lords household said he hast ever been in such service  nay said myles i have only been at school and learned latin and french and what not but diccon bowman here hath taught me use of arms  the young squire laughed outright byr lady thy talk doth tickle me friend myles said he thinkst thou such matters will gain thee footing here but stay thou didst say anon that thou hadst a letter to my lord from whom is it  it is from my father said myles he is of noble blood but fallen in estate he is a kinsman of my lords and one time his comrade in arms  sayst so said the other then mayhap thy chances are not so ill after all then after a moment he added my name is francis gascoyne and i will stand thy friend in this matter get thy letter ready for my lord and his grace of york are within and come forth anon the archbishop is on his way to dalworth and my lord escorts him so far as uppingham i and those others are to go along dost thou know my lord by sight  nay said myles i know him not  then i will tell thee when he cometh listen said he as a confused clattering sounded in the courtyard without yonder are the horses now they come presently busk thee with thy letter friend myles  the attendants who passed through the anteroom now came and went more hurriedly and myles knew that the earl must be about to come forth he had hardly time to untie his pouch take out the letter and tie the strings again when the arras at the doorway was thrust suddenly aside and a tall thin squire of about twenty came forth said some words to the young men upon the bench and then withdrew again instantly the squires arose and took their station beside the doorway a sudden hush fell upon all in the room and the menatarms stood in a line against the wall stiff and erect as though all at once transformed to figures of iron once more the arras was drawn back and in the hush myles heard voices in the other room  my lord cometh whispered gascoyne in his ear and myles felt his heart leap in answer  the next moment two noblemen came into the anteroom followed by a crowd of gentlemen squires and pages one of the two was a dignitary of the church the other myles instantly singled out as the earl of mackworth    chapter 4  he was a tall man taller even than myless father he had a thin face deepset bushy eyebrows and a hawk nose his upper lip was clean shaven but from his chin a flowing beard of irongray hung nearly to his waist he was clad in a ridinggown of black velvet that hung a little lower than the knee trimmed with otter fur and embroidered with silver goshawksthe crest of the family of beaumont  a light shirt of link mail showed beneath the gown as he walked and a pair of soft undressed leather ridingboots were laced as high as the knee protecting his scarlet hose from mud and dirt over his shoulders he wore a collar of enamelled gold from which hung a magnificent jewelled pendant and upon his fist he carried a beautiful iceland falcon  as myles stood staring he suddenly heard gascoynes voice whisper in his ear yon is my lord go forward and give him thy letter  scarcely knowing what he did he walked towards the earl like a machine his heart pounding within him and a great humming in his ears as he drew near the nobleman stopped for a moment and stared at him and myles as in a dream kneeled and presented the letter the earl took it in his hand turned it this way and that looked first at the bearer then at the packet and then at the bearer again  who art thou said he and what is the matter thou wouldst have of me  i am myles falworth said the lad in a low voice and i come seeking service with you  the earl drew his thick eyebrows quickly together and shot a keen look at the lad falworth said he sharplyfalworth i know no falworth  the letter will tell you said myles it is from one once dear to you  the earl took the letter and handing it to a gentleman who stood near bade him break the seal thou mayst stand said he to myles needst not kneel there forever then taking the opened parchment again he glanced first at the face and then at the back and seeing its length looked vexed then he read for an earnest moment or two skipping from line to line presently he folded the letter and thrust it into the pouch at his side so it is your grace said he to the lordly prelate that we who have luck to rise in the world must ever suffer by being plagued at all times and seasons here is one i chanced to know a dozen years ago who thinks he hath a claim upon me and saddles me with his son i must een take the lad too for the sake of peace and quietness he glanced around and seeing gascoyne who had drawn near beckoned to him take me this fellow said he to the buttery and see him fed and then to sir james lee and have his name entered in the castle books and stay sirrah he added bid me sir james if it may be so done to enter him as a squireatarms methinks he will be better serving so than in the household for he appeareth a soothly rough cub for a page  myles did look rustic enough standing clad in frieze in the midst of that gay company and a murmur of laughter sounded around though he was too bewildered to fully understand that he was the cause of the merriment then some hand drew him backit was gascoynesthere was a bustle of people passing and the next minute they were gone and myles and old diccon bowman and the young squire were left alone in the anteroom  gascoyne looked very sour and put out murrain upon it said he here is good sport spoiled for me to see thee fed i wish no ill to thee friend but i would thou hadst come this afternoon or tomorrow  methinks i bring trouble and dole to every one said myles somewhat bitterly it would have been better had i never come to this place methinks  his words and tone softened gascoyne a little neer mind said the squire it was not thy fault and is past mending now so come and fill thy stomach in heavens name  perhaps not the least hard part of the whole trying day for myles was his parting with diccon gascoyne and he had accompanied the old retainer to the outer gate in the archway of which they now stood for without a permit they could go no farther the old bowman led by the bridlerein the horse upon which myles had ridden that morning his own nag a vicious brute was restive to be gone but diccon held him in with tight rein he reached down and took myless sturdy brown hand in his crooked knotted grasp  farewell young master he croaked tremulously with a watery glimmer in his pale eyes thou wilt not forget me when i am gone  nay said myles i will not forget thee  aye aye said the old man looking down at him and shaking his head slowly from side to side thou art a great tall sturdy fellow now yet have i held thee on my knee many and manys the time and dandled thee when thou wert only a little weeny babe be still thou devils limb he suddenly broke off reining back his restive rawboned steed which began again to caper and prance myles was not sorry for the interruption he felt awkward and abashed at the parting and at the old mans reminiscences knowing that gascoynes eyes were resting amusedly upon the scene and that the menatarms were looking on certainly old diccon did look droll as he struggled vainly with his vicious highnecked nag nay a murrain on thee an thou wilt go go cried he at last with a savage dig of his heels into the animals ribs and away they clattered the ledhorse kicking up its heels as a final parting setting gascoyne fairly alaughing at the bend of the road the old man turned and nodded his head the next moment he had disappeared around the angle of the wall and it seemed to myles as he stood looking after him as though the last thread that bound him to his old life had snapped and broken as he turned he saw that gascoyne was looking at him  dost feel downhearted said the young squire curiously  nay said myles brusquely nevertheless his throat was tight and dry and the word came huskily in spite of himself    chapter 5  the earl of mackworth as was customary among the great lords in those days maintained a small army of knights gentlemen menatarms and retainers who were expected to serve him upon all occasions of need and from whom were supplied his quota of recruits to fill such levies as might be made upon him by the king in time of war  the knights and gentlemen of this little army of horse and foot soldiers were largely recruited from the company of squires and bachelors as the young novitiate soldiers of the castle were called  this company of esquires consisted of from eighty to ninety lads ranging in age from eight to twenty years those under fourteen years were termed pages and served chiefly the countess and her waiting gentlewomen in whose company they acquired the graces and polish of the times such as they were after reaching the age of fourteen the lads were entitled to the name of esquire or squire  in most of the great houses of the time the esquires were the especial attendants upon the lord and lady of the house holding such positions as bodysquires cupbearers carvers and sometimes the office of chamberlain but devlen like some other of the princely castles of the greatest nobles was more like a military post or a fortress than an ordinary household only comparatively few of the esquires could be used in personal attendance upon the earl the others were trained more strictly in arms and served rather in the capacity of a sort of bodyguard than as ordinary squires for as the earl rose in power and influence and as it so became well worth while for the lower nobility and gentry to enter their sons in his family the body of squires became almost cumbersomely large accordingly that part which comprised the squires proper as separate from the younger pages was divided into three classesfirst squires of the body who were those just past pagehood and who waited upon the earl in personal service second squires of the household who having regular hours assigned for exercise in the manual of arms were relieved from personal service excepting upon especial occasions and thirdly and lastly at the head of the whole body of lads a class called bachelorsyoung men ranging from eighteen to twenty years of age this class was supposed to exercise a sort of government over the other and younger squiresto keep them in order as much as possible to marshal them upon occasions of importance to see that their arms and equipments were kept in good order to call the roll for chapel in the morning and to see that those not upon duty in the house were present at the daily exercise at arms orders to the squires were generally transmitted through the bachelors and the head of that body was expected to make weekly reports of affairs in their quarters to the chief captain of the body  from this overlordship of the bachelors there had gradually risen a system of fagging such as is or was practised in the great english public schoolsenforced services exacted from the younger ladswhich at the time myles came to devlen had in the five or six years it had been in practice grown to be an absolute though unwritten law of the bodya law supported by all the prestige of longcontinued usage at that time the bachelors numbered but thirteen yet they exercised over the rest of the sixtyfour squires and pages a rule of iron and were taskmasters hard exacting and oftentimes cruel  the whole company of squires and pages was under the supreme command of a certain oneeyed knight by name sir james lee a soldier seasoned by the fire of a dozen battles bearing a score of wounds won in fight and tourney and withered by hardship and labor to a leatherlike toughness he had fought upon the kings side in all the late wars and had at shrewsbury received a wound that unfitted him for active service so that now he was fallen to the post of captain of esquires at devlen castlea man disappointed in life and with a temper imbittered by that failure as well as by cankering pain  yet perhaps no one could have been better fitted for the place he held than sir james lee the lads under his charge were a rude rough unruly set quick like their elders to quarrel and to quarrel fiercely even to the drawing of sword or dagger but there was a cold iron sternness about the grim old man that quelled them as the trainer with a lash of steel might quell a den of young wolves the apartments in which he was lodged with his clerk were next in the dormitory of the lads and even in the midst of the most excited brawlings the distant sound of his harsh voice silence messieurs would bring an instant hush to the loudest uproar  it was into his grim presence that myles was introduced by gascoyne sir james was in his office a room bare of ornament or adornment or superfluous comfort of any sortwithout even so much as a mat of rushes upon the cold stone pavement to make it less cheerless the old oneeyed knight sat gnawing his bristling mustaches to anyone who knew him it would have been apparent that as the castle phrase went the devil sat astride of his neck which meant that some one of his blind wounds was aching more sorely than usual  his clerk sat beside him with accountbooks and parchment spread upon the table and the head squire walter blunt a lad some three or four years older than myles and half a head taller blackbrowed powerfully built and with cheek and chin darkened by the soft budding of his adolescent beard stood making his report  sir james listened in grim silence while gascoyne told his errand  so then pardee i am bid to take another one of ye am i he snarled as though ye caused me not trouble enow and this one a cub looking a very boor in carriage and breeding mayhap the earl thinketh i am to train boys to his dillydally household service as well as to use of arms  sir said gascoyne timidly my lord sayeth he would have this one entered direct as a squire of the body so that he need not serve in the household  sayest so cried sir james harshly then take thou my message back again to thy lord not for mackworthno nor a better man than hewill i make any changes in my government an i be set to rule a pack of boys i will rule them as i list and not according to any mans bidding tell him sirrah that i will enter no lad as squire of the body without first testing an he be fit at arms to hold that place he sat for a while glowering at myles and gnawing his mustaches and for the time no one dared to break the grim silence what is thy name said he suddenly and then almost before myles could answer he asked the head squire whether he could find a place to lodge him  there is gillis whitlocks cot empty said blunt he is in the infirmary and belike goeth home again when he cometh thence the fever hath gotten into his bones and  that will do said the knight interrupting him impatiently let him take that place or any other that thou hast and thou jerome said he to his clerk thou mayst enter him upon the roll though whether it be as page or squire or bachelor shall be as i please and not as mackworth biddeth me now get ye gone  old bruins wound smarteth him sore gascoyne observed as the two lads walked across the armory court he had goodnaturedly offered to show the newcomer the many sights of interest around the castle and in the hour or so of ramble that followed the two grew from acquaintances to friends with a quickness that boyhood alone can bring about they visited the armory the chapel the stables the great hall the painted chamber the guardhouse the messroom and even the scullery and the kitchen with its great range of boilers and furnaces and ovens last of all myless new friend introduced him to the armorsmithy  my lord hath sent a piece of milan armor thither to be repaired said he belike thou would like to see it  aye said myles eagerly that would i  the smith was a gruff goodnatured fellow and showed the piece of armor to myles readily and willingly enough it was a beautiful bascinet of inlaid workmanship and was edged with a rim of gold myles scarcely dared touch it he gazed at it with an unconcealed delight that warmed the smiths honest heart  i have another piece of milan here said he did i ever show thee my dagger master gascoyne  nay said the squire  the smith unlocked a great oaken chest in the corner of the shop lifted the lid and brought thence a beautiful dagger with the handle of ebony and silvergilt and a sheath of spanish leather embossed and gilt the keen welltempered blade was beautifully engraved and inlaid with niellowork representing a group of figures in a then popular subjectthe dance of death it was a weapon at once unique and beautiful and even gascoyne showed an admiration scarcely less keen than myless openlyexpressed delight  to whom doth it belong said he trying the point upon his thumb nail  there said the smith is the jest of the whole for it belongeth to me sir william beauclerk bade me order the weapon through master gildersworthy of london town and by the time it came hither lo he had died and so it fell to my hands no one here payeth the price for the trinket and so i must een keep it myself though i be but a poor man  how much dost thou hold it for said gascoyne  seventeen shillings buyeth it said the armorer carelessly  aye aye said gascoyne with a sigh so it is to be poor and not be able to have such things as one loveth and would fain possess seventeen shillings is nigh as much by half again as all my yearly wage  then a sudden thought came to myles and as it came his cheeks glowed as hot as fire master gascoyne said he with gruff awkwardness thou hast been a very good true friend to me since i have come to this place and hast befriended me in all ways thou mightest do and i as well i know but a poor rustic clod now i have forty shillings by me which i may spend as i list and so i do beseech thee that thou wilt take yon dagger of me as a lovegift and have and hold it for thy very own  gascoyne stared openmouthed at myles dost mean it said he at last  aye said myles i do mean it master smith give him the blade  at first the smith grinned thinking it all a jest but he soon saw that myles was serious enough and when the seventeen shillings were produced and counted down upon the anvil he took off his cap and made myles a low bow as he swept them into his pouch now by my faith and troth quoth he that i do call a true lordly gift is it not so master gascoyne  aye said gascoyne with a gulp it is in soothly earnest and thereupon to myless great wonderment he suddenly flung his arms about his neck and giving him a great hug kissed him upon the cheek dear myles said he i tell thee truly and of a verity i did feel warm towards thee from the very first time i saw thee sitting like a poor oaf upon the bench up yonder in the anteroom and now of a sooth i give thee assurance that i do love thee as my own brother yea i will take the dagger and will stand by thee as a true friend from this time forth mayhap thou mayst need a true friend in this place ere thou livest long with us for some of us esquires be soothly rough and knocks are more plenty here than broad pennies so that one new come is like to have a hard time gaining a footing  i thank thee said myles for thy offer of love and friendship and do tell thee upon my part that i also of all the world would like best to have thee for my friend  such was the manner in which myles formed the first great friendship of his life a friendship that was destined to last him through many years to come as the two walked back across the great quadrangle upon which fronted the main buildings of the castle their arms were wound across one anothers shoulders after the manner as a certain great writer says of boys and lovers    chapter 6  a boys life is of a very flexible sort it takes but a little while for it to shape itself to any new surroundings in which it may be thrown to make itself new friends to settle itself to new habits and so it was that myles fell directly into the ways of the lads of devlen on his first morning as he washed his face and hands with the other squires and pages in a great tank of water in the armory courtyard he presently found himself splashing and dashing with the others laughing and shouting as loud as any and calling some by their christian names as though he had known them for years instead of overnight during chapel he watched with sympathetic delight the covert pranks of the youngsters during the halfhour that father emmanuel droned his latin and with his dagger point he carved his own name among the many cut deep into the back of the bench before him when after breakfast the squires poured like schoolboys into the great armory to answer to the rollcall for daily exercise he came storming in with the rest beating the lad in front of him with his cap  boys are very keen to feel the influence of a forceful character a lad with a strong will is quick to reach his proper level as a greater or lesser leader among the others and myles was of just the masterful nature to make his individuality felt among the devlen squires he was quick enough to yield obedience upon all occasions to proper authority but would never bend an inch to the usurpation of tyranny in the school at st marys priory at crosbeydale he would submit without a murmur or offer of resistance to chastisement by old father ambrose the regular teacher but once when the fat old monk was sick and a great longlegged strapping young friar who had temporarily taken his place undertook to administer punishment myles with a wrestling trip flung him sprawling backward over a bench into the midst of a shoal of small boys amid a hubbub of riotous confusion he had been flogged soundly for it under the supervision of prior edward himself but so soon as his punishment was over he assured the prior very seriously that should like occasion again happen he would act in the same manner flogging or no flogging  it was this bold outspoken spirit that gained him at once friends and enemies at devlen and though it first showed itself in what was but a little matter nevertheless it set a mark upon him that singled him out from the rest and although he did not suspect it at the time called to him the attention of sir james lee himself who regarded him as a lad of free and frank spirit  the first morning after the rollcall in the armory as walter blunt the head bachelor rolled up the slip of parchment and the temporary silence burst forth into redoubled noise and confusion each lad arming himself from a row of racks that stood along the wall he beckoned myles to him  my lord himself hath spoken to sir james lee concerning thee said he sir james maintaineth that he will not enter thee into the body till thou hast first practised for a while at the pels and shown what thou canst do at broadsword hast ever fought at the pel  aye answered myles and that every day of my life sin i became esquire four years ago saving only sundays and holy days  with shield and broadsword  sometimes said myles and sometimes with the short sword  sir james would have thee come to the tiltyard this morn he himself will take thee in hand to try what thou canst do thou mayst take the arms upon yonder rack and use them until otherwise bidden thou seest that the number painted above it on the wall is seventeen that will be thy number for the nonce  so myles armed himself from his rack as the others were doing from theirs the armor was rude and heavy used to accustom the body to the weight of the iron plates rather than for any defence it consisted of a cuirass or breastplate of iron opening at the side with hinges and catching with hooks and eyes epauliers or shoulderplates armplates and legpieces and a bascinet or openfaced helmet a great triangular shield covered with leather and studded with bosses of iron and a heavy broadsword pointed and dulled at the edges completed the equipment  the practice at the pels which myles was bidden to attend comprised the chief exercise of the day with the esquires of young cadet soldiers of that time and in it they learned not only all the strokes cuts and thrusts of swordplay then in vogue but also toughness endurance and elastic quickness the pels themselves consisted of upright posts of ash or oak about five feet six inches in height and in girth somewhat thicker than a mans thigh they were firmly planted in the ground and upon them the strokes of the broadsword were directed  at devlen the pels stood just back of the open and covered tilting courts and the archery ranges and thither those lads not upon household duty were marched every morning excepting fridays and sundays and were there exercised under the direction of sir james lee and two assistants the whole company was divided into two sometimes into three parties each of which took its turn at the exercise delivering at the word of command the various strokes feints attacks and retreats as the instructors ordered  after five minutes of this mock battle the perspiration began to pour down the faces and the breath to come thick and short but it was not until the lads could absolutely endure no more that the order was given to rest and they were allowed to fling themselves panting upon the ground while another company took its place at the triple row of posts  as myles struck and hacked at the pel assigned to him sir james lee stood beside him watching him in grim silence the lad did his best to show the knight all that he knew of upper cut under cut thrust and backhand stroke but it did not seem to him that sir james was very well satisfied with his skill  thou fightest like a clodpole said the old man ha that stroke was but illrecovered strike me it again and get thou in guard more quickly  myles repeated the stroke  pest cried sir james thou art too slow by a week here strike thou the blow at me  myles hesitated sir james held a stout staff in his hand but otherwise he was unarmed  strike i say said sir james what stayest thou for art afeard  it was myless answer that set the seal of individuality upon him nay said he boldly i am not afeard i fear not thee nor any man so saying he delivered the stroke at sir james with might and main it was met with a jarring blow that made his wrist and arm tingle and the next instant he received a stroke upon the bascinet that caused his ears to ring and the sparks to dance and fly before his eyes  pardee said sir james grimly an i had had a mace in my hand i would have knocked thy cockerel brains out that time thou mayst take that blow for answering me so pertly and now we are quits now strike me the stroke again an thou art not afeard  myless eyes watered in spite of himself and he shut the lids tight to wink the dimness away nevertheless he spoke up undauntedly as before aye marry will i strike it again said he and this time he was able to recover guard quickly enough to turn sir jamess blow with his shield instead of receiving it upon his head  so said sir james now mind thee of this that when thou strikest that lower cut at the legs recover thyself more quickly now then strike me it at the pel  gascoyne and other of the lads who were just then lying stretched out upon the grass beneath a tree at the edge of the open court where stood the pels were interested spectators of the whole scene not one of them in their memory had heard sir james so answered face to face as myles had answered him and after all perhaps the lad himself would not have done so had he been longer a resident in the squires quarters at devlen  by r lady thou art a cool blade myles said gascoyne as they marched back to the armory again never heard i one bespeak sir james as thou hast done this day  and after all said another of the young squires old bruin was not so illpleased methinks that was a shrewd blow he fetched thee on the crown falworth marry i would not have had it on my own skull for a silver penny    chapter 7  so little does it take to make a bodys reputation  that night all the squires quarters buzzed with the story of how the new boy falworth had answered sir james lee to his face without fear and had exchanged blows with him hand to hand walter blunt himself was moved to some show of interest  what said he to thee falworth asked he  he said naught said myles brusquely he only sought to show me how to recover from the under cut  it is passing strange that he should take so much notice of thee as to exchange blows with thee with his own hand haply thou art either very quick or parlous slow at arms  it is quick that he is said gascoyne speaking up in his friends behalf for the second time that falworth delivered the stroke sir james could not reach him to return so i saw with mine own eyes  but that very sterling independence that had brought myles so creditably through this adventure was certain to embroil him with the rude halfsavage lads about him some of whom especially among the bachelors were his superiors as well in age as in skill and training as said before the bachelors had enforced from the younger boys a fagging sort of attendance on their various personal needs and it was upon this point that myles first came to grief as it chanced several days passed before any demand was made upon him for service to the heads of the squirehood but when that demand was made the bachelors were very quick to see that the boy who was bold enough to speak up to sir james lee was not likely to be a willing fag for them  i tell thee francis he said as gascoyne and he talked over the matter one dayi tell thee i will never serve them prithee what shame can be fouler than to do such menial service saving for ones rightful lord  marry quoth gascoyne i reason not of shame at this or that all i know is that others serve them who are haply as good and maybe better than i be and that if i do not serve them i get knocked i th head therefore which same goeth soothly against my stomach  i judge not for thee said myles thou art used to these castle ways but only i know that i will not serve them though they be thirty against me instead of thirteen  then thou art a fool said gascoyne dryly  now in this matter of service there was one thing above all others that stirred myles falworths illliking the winter before he had come to devlen walter blunt who was somewhat of a sybarite in his way and who had a repugnance to bathing in the general tank in the open armory court in frosty weather had had dick carpenter build a trough in the corner of the dormitory for the use of the bachelors and every morning it was the duty of two of the younger squires to bring three pails of water to fill this private tank for the use of the head esquires it was seeing two of his fellowesquires fetching and carrying this water that myles disliked so heartily and every morning his bile was stirred anew at the sight  sooner would i die than yield to such vile service said he  he did not know how soon his protestations would be put to the test  one nightit was a week or two after myles had come to devlenblunt was called to attend the earl at livery the livery was the last meal of the day and was served with great pomp and ceremony about nine oclock at night to the head of the house as he lay in bed curfew had not yet rung and the lads in the squires quarters were still wrestling and sparring and romping boisterously in and out around the long row of rude cots in the great dormitory as they made ready for the night six or eight flaring links in wroughtiron brackets that stood out from the wall threw a great ruddy glare through the barracklike rooma light of all others to romp by myles and gascoyne were engaged in defending the passageway between their two cots against the attack of three other lads and myles held his sheepskin coverlet rolled up into a ball and balanced in his hand ready for launching at the head of one of the others so soon as it should rise from behind the shelter of a cot just then walter blunt dressed with more than usual care passed by on his way to the earls house he stopped for a moment and said mayhaps i will not be in until late tonight thou and falworth gascoyne may fetch water tomorrow  then he was gone myles stood staring after his retreating figure with eyes open and mouth agape still holding the ball of sheepskin balanced in his hand gascoyne burst into a helpless laugh at his blank stupefied face but the next moment he laid his hand on his friends shoulder  myles he said thou wilt not make trouble wilt thou  myles made no answer he flung down his sheepskin and sat him gloomily down upon the side of the cot  i said that i would sooner die than fetch water for them said he  aye aye said gascoyne but that was spoken in haste  myles said nothing but shook his head  but after all circumstances shape themselves the next morning when he rose up through the dark waters of sleep it was to feel some one shaking him violently by the shoulder  come cried gascoyne as myles opened his eyescome time passeth and we are late  myles bewildered with his sudden awakening and still fuddled with the fumes of sleep huddled into his doublet and hose hardly knowing what he was doing tying a point here and a point there and slipping his feet into his shoes then he hurried after gascoyne frowzy halfdressed and even yet only halfawake it was not until he was fairly out into the fresh air and saw gascoyne filling the three leathern buckets at the tank that he fully awakened to the fact that he was actually doing that hateful service for the bachelors which he had protested he would sooner die than render  the sun was just rising gilding the crown of the donjonkeep with a flame of ruddy light below among the lesser buildings the day was still gray and misty only an occasional noise broke the silence of the early morning a cough from one of the rooms the rattle of a pot or a pan stirred by some sleepy scullion the clapping of a door or a shutter and now and then the crowing of a cock back of the long row of stablesall sounding loud and startling in the fresh dewy stillness  thou hast betrayed me said myles harshly breaking the silence at last i knew not what i was doing or else i would never have come hither netheless even though i be come i will not carry the water for them  so be it said gascoyne tartly an thou canst not stomach it let be and i will een carry all three myself it will make me two journeys but thank heaven i am not so proud as to wish to get me hard knocks for naught so saying he picked up two of the buckets and started away across the court for the dormitory  then myles with a lowering face snatched up the third and hurrying after gave him his hand with the extra pail so it was that he came to do service after all  why tarried ye so long said one of the older bachelors roughly as the two lads emptied the water into the wooden trough he sat on the edge of the cot blowzed and untrussed with his long hair tumbled and disordered  his dictatorial tone stung myles to fury we tarried no longer than need be answered he savagely have we wings to fly withal at your bidding  he spoke so loudly that all in the room heard him the younger squires who were dressing stared in blank amazement and blunt sat up suddenly in his cot  why how now he cried answerest thou back thy betters so pertly sirrah by my soul i have a mind to crack thy head with this clog for thy unruly talk  he glared at myles as he spoke and myles glared back again with right goodwill matters might have come to a crisis only that gascoyne and wilkes dragged their friend away before he had opportunity to answer  an illconditioned knave as ever i did see growled blunt glaring after him  myles myles said gascoyne almost despairingly why wilt thou breed such mischief for thyself seest thou not thou hast got thee the illwill of every one of the bachelors from wat blunt to robin de ramsey  i care not said myles fiercely recurring to his grievance heard ye not how the dogs upbraided me before the whole room that blunt called me an illconditioned knave  marry said gascoyne laughing and so thou art  thus it is that boldness may breed one enemies as well as gain one friends my own notion is that ones enemies are more quick to act than ones friends    chapter 8  every one knows the disagreeable lurking discomfort that follows a quarrela discomfort that imbitters the very taste of life for the time being such was the dull distaste that myles felt that morning after what had passed in the dormitory every one in the proximity of such an open quarrel feels a reflected constraint and in myless mind was a disagreeable doubt whether that constraint meant disapproval of him or of his late enemies  it seemed to him that gascoyne added the last bitter twang to his unpleasant feelings when half an hour later they marched with the others to chapel  why dost thou breed such trouble for thyself myles said he recurring to what he had already said is it not foolish for thee to come hither to this place and then not submit to the ways thereof as the rest of us do  thou talkest not like a true friend to chide me thus said myles sullenly and he withdrew his arm from his friends  marry come up said gascoyne an i were not thy friend i would let thee jog thine own way it aches not my bones to have thine drubbed  just then they entered the chapel and words that might have led to a quarrel were brought to a close  myles was not slow to see that he had the ill will of the head of their company that morning in the armory he had occasion to ask some question of blunt the head squire stared coldly at him for a moment gave him a short gruff answer and then turning his back abruptly began talking with one of the other bachelors myles flushed hot at the others insulting manner and looked quickly around to see if any of the others had observed what had passed it was a comfort to him to see that all were too busy arming themselves to think of anything else nevertheless his face was very lowering as he turned away  some day i will show him that i am as good a man as he he muttered to himself an evilhearted dog to put shame upon me  the storm was brewing and ready to break   that day was exceptionally hot and close and permission had been asked by and granted to those squires not on duty to go down to the river for a bath after exercise at the pels but as myles replaced his arms in the rack a little page came with a bidding to come to sir james in his office  look now said myles here is just my illfortune why might he not have waited an hour longer rather than cause me to miss going with ye  nay said gascoyne let not that grieve thee myles wilkes and i will wait for thee in the dormitorywill we not edmund make thou haste and go to sir james  sir james was sitting at the table studying over a scroll of parchment when myles entered his office and stood before him at the table  well boy said he laying aside the parchment and looking up at the lad i have tried thee fairly for these few days and may say that i have found thee worthy to be entered upon the rolls as esquire of the body  i give thee thanks sir said myles  the knight nodded his head in acknowledgement but did not at once give the word of dismissal that myles had expected dost mean to write thee a letter home soon said he suddenly  aye said myles gaping in great wonderment at the strangeness of the question  then when thou dost so write said sir james give thou my deep regards to thy father then he continued after a brief pause him did i know well in times gone by and we were right true friends in hearty love and for his sake i would befriend theethat is in so much as is fitting  sir said myles but sir james held up his hand and he stopped short in his thanks  but boy said he that which i sent for thee for to tell thee was of more import than these dost thou know that thy father is an attainted outlaw  nay cried myles his cheeks blazing up as red as fire who sayeth that of him lieth in his teeth  thou dost mistake me said sir james quietly it is sometimes no shame to be outlawed and banned had it been so i would not have told thee thereof nor have bidden thee send my true love to thy father as i did but now but boy certes he standest continually in great dangergreater than thou wottest of were it known where he lieth hid it might be to his undoing and utter ruin methought that belike thou mightest not know that and so i sent for thee for to tell thee that it behoovest thee to say not one single word concerning him to any of these new friends of thine nor who he is nor what he is  but how came my father to be so banned said myles in a constrained and husky voice and after a long time of silence  that i may not tell thee just now said the old knight only thisthat i have been bidden to make it known to thee that thy father hath an enemy full as powerful as my lord the earl himself and that through that enemy all his illfortunehis blindness and everythinghath come moreover did this enemy know where thy father lieth he would slay him right speedily  sir cried myles violently smiting his open palm upon the table tell me who this man is and i will kill him  sir james smiled grimly thou talkest like a boy said he wait until thou art grown to be a man mayhap then thou mayst repent thee of these bold words for one time this enemy of thy fathers was reckoned the foremost knight in england and he is now the kings dear friend and a great lord  but said myles after another long time of heavy silence will not my lord then befriend me for the sake of my father who was one time his dear comrade  sir james shook his head it may not be said he neither thou nor thy father must look for open favor from the earl an he befriended falworth and it came to be known that he had given him aid or succor it might belike be to his own undoing no boy thou must not even look to be taken into the household to serve with gentlemen as the other squires do serve but must even live thine own life here and fight thine own way  myless eyes blazed then cried he fiercely it is shame and attaint upon my lord the earl and cowardice as well and never will i ask favor of him who is so untrue a friend as to turn his back upon a comrade in trouble as he turneth his back upon my father  thou art a foolish boy said sir james with a bitter smile and knowest naught of the world an thou wouldst look for man to befriend man to his own danger thou must look elsewhere than on this earth was i not one time mackworths dear friend as well as thy father it could cost him naught to honor me and here am i fallen to be a teacher of boys go to thou art a fool  then after a little pause of brooding silence he went on to say that the earl was no better or worse than the rest of the world that men of his position had many jealous enemies ever seeking their ruin and that such must look first of all each to himself or else be certainly ruined and drag down others in that ruin myles was silenced but the bitterness had entered his heart and abided with him for many a day afterwards  perhaps sir james read his feelings in his frank face for he sat looking curiously at him twirling his grizzled mustache the while thou art like to have hard knocks of it lad ere thou hast gotten thee safe through the world said he with more kindness in his harsh voice than was usual but get thee not into fights before thy time then he charged the boy very seriously to live at peace with his fellowsquires and for his fathers sake as well as his own to enter into none of the broils that were so frequent in their quarters  it was with this special admonition against brawling that myles was dismissed to enter before five minutes had passed into the first really great fight of his life   besides gascoyne and wilkes he found gathered in the dormitory six or eight of the company of squires who were to serve that day upon household duty among others walter blunt and three other bachelors who were changing their coarse service clothes for others more fit for the household  why didst thou tarry so long myles said gascoyne as he entered methought thou wert never coming  where goest thou falworth called blunt from the other end of the room where he was lacing his doublet  just now myles had no heart in the swimming or sport of any sort but he answered shortly i go to the river to swim  nay said blunt thou goest not forth from the castle today hast thou forgot how thou didst answer me back about fetching the water this morning this day thou must do penance so go thou straight to the armory and scour thou up my breastplate  from the time he had arisen that morning everything had gone wrong with myles he had felt himself already outrated in rendering service to the bachelors he had quarrelled with the head of the esquires he had nearly quarrelled with gascoyne and then had come the bitterest and worst of all the knowledge that his father was an outlaw and that the earl would not stretch out a hand to aid him or to give him any countenance blunts words brought the last bitter cut to his heart and they stung him to fury for a while he could not answer but stood glaring with a face fairly convulsed with passion at the young man who continued his toilet unconscious of the wrath of the new recruit  gascoyne and wilkes accepting myless punishment as a thing of course were about to leave the dormitory when myles checked them  stop francis he cried hoarsely thinkest thou that i will stay behind to do yon dogs dirty work no i go with ye  a moment or two of dumb silent amazement followed his bold words then blunt cried art thou mad  nay answered myles in the same hoarse voice i am not mad i tell thee a better man than thou shouldst not stay me from going an i list to go  i will break thy cockerel head for that speech said blunt furiously he stooped as he spoke and picked up a heavy clog that lay at his feet  it was no insignificant weapon either the shoes of those days were sometimes made of cloth and had long pointed toes stuffed with tow or wool in muddy weather thick heavy clogs or wooden soles were strapped like a skate to the bottom of the foot that clog which blunt had seized was perhaps eighteen or twenty inches long two or two and a half inches thick at the heel tapering to a point at the toe as the older lad advanced gascoyne stepped between him and his victim  do not harm him blunt he pleaded bear thou in mind how newcome he is among us he knoweth not our ways as yet  stand thou back gascoyne said blunt harshly as he thrust him aside i will teach him our ways so that he will not soon forget them  close to myless feet was another clog like that one which blunt held he snatched it up and set his back against the wall with a white face and a heart beating heavily and tumultuously but with courage steeled to meet the coming encounter there was a hard grim look in his blue eyes that for a moment perhaps quelled the elder lad he hesitated tom wat ned he called to the other bachelors come hither and lend me a hand with this knave  an ye come nigh me panted myles i will brain the first within reach  then gascoyne dodged behind the others and without being seen slipped out of the room for help  the battle that followed was quick sharp and short as blunt strode forward myles struck and struck with might and main but he was too excited to deliver his blow with calculation blunt parried it with the clog he held and the next instant dropping his weapon gripped myles tight about the body pinning his arms to his sides  myles also dropped the clog he held and wrenching out his right arm with a sudden heave struck blunt full in the face and then with another blow sent him staggering back it all passed in an instant the next the three other bachelors were upon him catching him by the body the arms the legs for a moment or two they swayed and stumbled hither and thither and then down they fell in a struggling heap  myles fought like a wildcat kicking struggling scratching striking with elbows and fists he caught one of the three by his collar and tore his jacket open from the neck to the waist he drove his foot into the pit of the stomach of another and knocked him breathless the other lads not in the fight stood upon the benches and the beds around but such was the awe inspired by the prestige of the bachelors that not one of them dared to lend hand to help him and so myles fought his fierce battle alone  but four to one were odds too great and though myles struggled as fiercely as ever byandby it was with less and less resistance  blunt had picked up the clog he had dropped when he first attacked the lad and now stood over the struggling heap white with rage the blood running from his lip cut and puffed where myles had struck him and murder looking out from his face if ever it looked out of the face of any mortal being  hold him a little said he fiercely and i will still him for you  even yet it was no easy matter for the others to do his bidding but presently he got his chance and struck a heavy cruel blow at myless head myles only partly warded it with his arm hitherto he had fought in silence now he gave a harsh cry  holy saints cried edmund wilkes they will kill him  blunt struck two more blows both of them upon the body and then at last they had the poor boy down with his face upon the ground and his arms pinned to his sides and blunt bracing himself for the stroke with a grin of rage raised a heavy clog for one terrible blow that should finish the fight    chapter 9  how now messieurs said a harsh voice that fell upon the turmoil like a thunderclap and there stood sir james lee instantly the struggle ceased and the combatants scrambled to their feet  the older lads stood silent before their chief but myles was deaf and blind and mad with passion he knew not where he stood or what he said or did white as death he stood for a while glaring about him catching his breath convulsively then he screamed hoarsely  who struck me who struck me when i was down i will have his blood that struck me he caught sight of blunt it was he that struck me he cried thou foul traitor thou coward and thereupon leaped at his enemy like a wildcat  stop cried sir james lee clutching him by the arm  myles was too blinded by his fury to see who it was that held him i will not stop he cried struggling and striking at the knight let me go i will have his life that struck me when i was down  the next moment he found himself pinned close against the wall and then as though his sight came back he saw the grim face of the old oneeyed knight looking into his  dost thou know who i am said a stern harsh voice  instantly myles ceased struggling and his arms fell at his side aye he said in a gasping voice i know thee he swallowed spasmodically for a moment or two and then in the sudden revulsion of feeling burst out sobbing convulsively  sir james marched the two off to his office he himself walking between them holding an arm of each the other lads following behind awestruck and silent entering the office sir james shut the door behind him leaving the group of squires clustered outside about the stone steps speculating in whispers as to what would be the outcome of the matter  after sir james had seated himself the two standing facing him he regarded them for a while in silence how now walter blunt said he at last what is to do  why this said blunt wiping his bleeding lip that fellow myles falworth hath been breeding mutiny and revolt ever sin he came hither among us and because he was thus mutinous i would punish him therefor  in that thou liest burst out myles never have i been mutinous in my life  be silent sir said sir james sternly i will hear thee anon  nay said myles with his lips twitching and writhing i will not be silent i am friendless here and ye are all against me but i will not be silent and brook to have lies spoken of me  even blunt stood aghast at myless boldness never had he heard any one so speak to sir james before he did not dare for the moment even to look up second after second of dead stillness passed while sir james sat looking at myles with a stern terrifying calmness that chilled him in spite of the heat of his passion  sir said the old man at last in a hard quiet voice thou dost know naught of rules and laws of such a place as this nevertheless it is time for thee to learn them so i will tell thee now that if thou openest thy lips to say only one single word more except at my bidding i will send thee to the black vault of the donjon to cool thy hot spirits on bread and water for a week there was something in the measured quietness of the old knights tone that quelled myles utterly and entirely a little space of silence followed now then blunt said sir james turning to the bachelor tell me all the ins and outs of this business without any more underdealing  this time blunts story though naturally prejudiced in his own favor was fairly true then myles told his side of the case the old knight listening attentively  why how now blunt said sir james when myles had ended i myself gave the lads leave to go to the river to bathe wherefore shouldst thou forbid one of them  i did it but to punish this fellow for his mutiny said the bachelor methought we at their head were to have oversight concerning them  so ye are said the knight but only to a degree ere ye take it upon ye to gainsay any of my orders or permits come ye first to me dost thou understand  aye answered blunt sullenly  so be it and now get thee gone said the knight and let me hear no more of beating out brains with wooden clogs an ye fight your battles let there not be murder in them this is twice that the like hath happed gin i hear more of such doings he did utter his threat but stopped short and fixed his one eye sternly upon the head squire now shake hands and be ye friends said he abruptly  blunt made a motion to obey but myles put his hand behind him  nay i shake not hands with any one who struck me while i was down  so be it said the knight grimly now thou mayst go blunt thou falworth stay i would bespeak thee further  tell me said he when the elder lad had left them why wilt thou not serve these bachelors as the other squires do such is the custom here why wilt thou not obey it  because said myles i cannot stomach it and they shall not make me serve them an thou bid me do it sir i will do it but not at their command  nay said the knight i do not bid thee do them service that lieth with thee to render or not as thou seest fit but how canst thou hope to fight singlehanded against the commands of a dozen lads all older and mightier than thou  i know not said myles but were they an hundred instead of thirteen they should not make me serve them  thou art a fool said the old knight smiling faintly for that best not courage but folly when one setteth about righting a wrong one driveth not full head against it for in so doing one getteth naught but hard knocks nay go deftly about it and then when the time is ripe strike the blow now our beloved king henry when he was the earl of derby what could he have gained had he stood so against the old king richard brooking the king face to face i tell thee he would have been knocked on the head as thou wert like to have been this day now were i thee and had to fight a fight against odds i would first get me friends behind me and then he stopped short but myles understood him well enough  sir said he with a gulp i do thank thee for thy friendship and ask thy pardon for doing as i did anon  i grant thee pardon said the knight but tell thee plainly an thou dost face me so again i will truly send thee to the black cell for a week now get thee away  all the other lads were gone when myles came forth save only the faithful gascoyne who sacrificed his bath that day to stay with his friend and perhaps that little act of selfdenial moved myles more than many a great thing might have done  it was right kind of thee francis said he laying his hand affectionately on his friends shoulder i know not why thou lovest me so  why for one thing this matter answered his friend because methinks thou art the best fighter and the bravest one of all of us squires  myles laughed nevertheless gascoynes words were a soothing balm for much that had happened that day i will fight me no more just now said he and then he told his friend all that sir james had advised about biding his time  gascoyne blew a long whistle beshrew me quoth he but methinks old bruin is on thy side of the quarrel myles an that be so i am with thee also and others that i can name as well  so be it said myles then am i content to abide the time when we may become strong enough to stand against them    chapter 10  perhaps there is nothing more delightful in the romance of boyhood than the finding of some secret hidingplace whither a body may creep away from the bustle of the worlds life to nestle in quietness for an hour or two more especially is such delightful if it happen that by peeping from out it one may look down upon the bustling matters of busy everyday life while one lies snugly hidden away unseen by any as though one were in some strange invisible world of ones own  such a hidingplace as would have filled the heart of almost any boy with sweet delight myles and gascoyne found one summer afternoon they called it their eyry and the name suited well for the roostingplace of the young hawks that rested in its windy stillness looking down upon the shifting castle life in the courts below  behind the north stable a great long rambling building thickwalled and black with age lay an older part of the castle than that peopled by the better class of lifea cluster of great thick walls rudely but strongly built now the dwellingplace of stablelads and hinds swine and poultry from one part of these ancient walls and fronting an inner court of the castle arose a tall circular heavybuttressed tower considerably higher than the other buildings and so mantled with a dense growth of aged ivy as to stand a shaft of solid green above its crumbling crown circled hundreds of pigeons white and pied clapping and clattering in noisy flight through the sunny air several windows some closed with shutters peeped here and there from out the leaves and near the top of the pile was a row of arched openings as though of a balcony or an airy gallery  myles had more than once felt an idle curiosity about this tower and one day as he and gascoyne sat together he pointed his finger and said what is yon place  that answered gascoyne looking over his shoulderthat they call brutus tower for why they do say that brutus he built it when he came hither to britain i believe not the tale mine own self netheless it is marvellous ancient and old robinthefletcher telleth me that there be stairways built in the wall and passageways and a maze wherein a body may get lost an he know not the way aright and never see the blessed light of day again  marry said myles those same be strange sayings who liveth there now  no one liveth there said gascoyne saving only some of the stable villains and that halfwitted gooseherd who flung stones at us yesterday when we mocked him down in the paddock he and his wife and those others dwell in the vaults beneath like rabbits in any warren no one else hath lived there since earl roberts day which belike was an hundred years agone the story goeth that earl roberts brotheror stepbrotherwas murdered there and some men say by the earl himself sin that day it hath been tight shut  myles stared at the tower for a while in silence it is a strangeseeming place from without said he at last and mayhap it may be even more strange inside hast ever been within francis  nay said gascoyne said i not it hath been fast locked since earl roberts day  byr lady said myles an i had lived here in this place so long as thou i wot i would have been within it ere this  beshrew me said gascoyne but i have never thought of such a matter he turned and looked at the tall crown rising into the warm sunlight with a new interest for the thought of entering it smacked pleasantly of adventure how wouldst thou set about getting within said he presently  why look said myles seest thou not yon hole in the ivy branches methinks there is a window at that place an i mistake not it is in reach of the stable eaves a body might come up by the fagot pile to the roof of the henhouse and then by the long stable to the north stable and so to that hole  gascoyne looked thoughtfully at the brutus tower and then suddenly inquired wouldst go there  aye said myles briefly  so be it lead thou the way in the venture i will follow after thee said gascoyne  as myles had said the climbing from roof to roof was a matter easy enough to an active pair of lads like themselves but when byandby they reached the wall of the tower itself they found the hidden window much higher from the roof than they had judged from belowperhaps ten or twelve feetand it was besides beyond the eaves and out of their reach  myles looked up and looked down above was the bushy thickness of the ivy the branches as thick as a womans wrist knotted and intertwined below was the stone pavement of a narrow inner court between two of the stable buildings  methinks i can climb to yon place said he  thoult break thy neck an thou tryest said gascoyne hastily  nay quoth myles i trust not but break or make we get not there without trying so here goeth for the venture  thou art a harebrained knave as ever drew breath of life quoth gascoyne and will cause me to come to grief some of these fine days netheless an thou be jack fool and lead the way go and i will be tom fool and follow anon if thy neck is worth so little mine is worth no more  it was indeed a perilous climb but that special providence which guards reckless lads befriended them as it has thousands of their kind before and since so by climbing from one knotted clinging stem to another they were presently seated snugly in the ivied niche in the window it was barred from within by a crumbling shutter the rusty fastening of which after some little effort upon the part of the two gave way and entering the narrow opening they found themselves in a small triangular passageway from which a steep flight of stone steps led down through a hollow in the massive wall to the room below  at the bottom of the steps was a heavy oaken door which stood ajar hanging upon a single rusty hinge and from the room within a dull gray light glimmered faintly myles pushed the door farther open it creaked and grated horribly on its rusty hinge and as in instant answer to the discordant shriek came a faint piping squeaking a rustling and a pattering of soft footsteps  the ghosts cried gascoyne in a quavering whisper and for a moment myles felt the chill of gooseflesh creep up and down his spine but the next moment he laughed  nay said he they be rats look at yon fellow francis best as big as mother joans kitten give me that stone he flung it at the rat and it flew clattering across the floor there was another pattering rustle of hundreds of feet and then a breathless silence  the boys stood looking around them and a strange enough sight it was the room was a perfect circle of about twenty feet across and was piled high with an indistinguishable mass of lumberrude tables ruder chairs ancient chests bits and remnants of cloth and sacking and leather old helmets and pieces of armor of a bygone time broken spears and poleaxes pots and pans and kitchen furniture of all sorts and kinds  a straight beam of sunlight fell through a broken shutter like a bar of gold and fell upon the floor in a long streak of dazzling light that illuminated the whole room with a yellow glow  by r lady said gascoyne at last in a hushed voice here is father times garret for sure didst ever see the like myles look at yon arbalist sure brutus himself used such an one  nay said myles but look at this saddle marry here best a rats nest in it  clouds of dust rose as they rummaged among the mouldering mass setting them coughing and sneezing now and then a great gray rat would shoot out beneath their very feet and disappear like a sudden shadow into some hole or cranny in the wall  come said myles at last brushing the dust from his jacket an we tarry here longer we will have chance to see no other sights the sun is falling low  an arched stairway upon the opposite side of the room from which they had entered wound upward through the wall the stone steps being lighted by narrow slits of windows cut through the massive masonry above the room they had just left was another of the same shape and size but with an oak floor sagging and rising into hollows and hills where the joist had rotted away beneath it was bare and empty and not even a rat was to be seen above was another room above that another all the passages and stairways which connected the one story with the other being built in the wall which was where solid perhaps fifteen feet thick  from the third floor a straight flight of steps led upward to a closed door from the other side of which shone the dazzling brightness of sunlight and whence came a strange noisea soft rustling a melodious murmur the boys put their shoulders against the door which was fastened and pushed with might and mainonce twice suddenly the lock gave way and out they pitched headlong into a blaze of sunlight a deafening clapping and uproar sounded in their ears and scores of pigeons suddenly disturbed rose in stormy flight  they sat up and looked around them in silent wonder they were in a bower of leafy green it was the top story of the tower the roof of which had crumbled and toppled in leaving it open to the sky with only here and there a slanting beam or two supporting a portion of the tiled roof affording shelter for the nests of the pigeons crowded closely together over everything the ivy had grown in a mantling sheeta network of shimmering green through which the sunlight fell flickering  this passeth wonder said gascoyne at last breaking the silence  aye said myles i did never see the like in all my life then look yonder is a room beyond let us see what it is francis  entering an arched doorway the two found themselves in a beautiful little vaulted chapel about eighteen feet long and twelve or fifteen wide it comprised the crown of one of the large massive buttresses and from it opened the row of arched windows which could be seen from below through the green shimmering of the ivy leaves the boys pushed aside the trailing tendrils and looked out and down the whole castle lay spread below them with the busy people unconsciously intent upon the matters of their daily work they could see the gardener with bowed back patiently working among the flowers in the garden the stableboys below grooming the horses a bevy of ladies in the privy garden playing at shuttlecock with battledoors of wood a group of gentlemen walking up and down in front of the earls house they could see the household servants hurrying hither and thither two little scullions at fisticuffs and a kitchen girl standing in the doorway scratching her frowzy head  it was all like a puppetshow of real life each acting unconsciously a part in the play the cool wind came in through the rustling leaves and fanned their cheeks hot with the climb up the winding stairway  we will call it our eyry said gascoyne and we will be the hawks that live here and that was how it got its name  the next day myles had the armorer make him a score of large spikes which he and gascoyne drove between the ivy branches and into the cement of the wall and so made a safe passageway by which to reach the window niche in the wall    chapter 11  the two friends kept the secret of the eyry to themselves for a little while now and then visiting the old tower to rummage among the lumber stored in the lower room or to loiter away the afternoon in the windy solitudes of the upper heights and in that little time when the ancient keep was to them a small world unknown to any but themselvesa world far away above all the dull matters of everyday lifethey talked of many things that might else never have been known to one another mostly they spoke the crude romantic thoughts and desires of boyhoods timechaff thrown to the wind in which however lay a few stray seeds fated to fall to good earth and to ripen to fruition in manhoods day  in the intimate talks of that time myles imparted something of his honest solidity to gascoynes somewhat weathercock nature and to myless ruder and more uncouth character gascoyne lent a tone of his gentler manners learned in his pagehood service as attendant upon the countess and her ladies  in other things also the character and experience of the one lad helped to supply what was lacking in the other myles was replete with old latin gestes fables and sermons picked up during his school life in those intervals of his more serious studies when prior edward had permitted him to browse in the greener pastures of the gesta romanorum and the disciplina clericalis of the monastery library and gascoyne was never weary of hearing him tell those marvellous stories culled from the crabbed latin of the old manuscript volumes  upon his part gascoyne was full of the lore of the waitingroom and the antechamber and myles who in all his life had never known a lady young or old excepting his mother was never tired of lying silently listening to gascoynes chatter of the gay doings of the castle gentlelife in which he had taken part so often in the merry days of his pagehood  i do wonder said myles quaintly that thou couldst ever find the courage to bespeak a young maid francis never did i do so nor ever could rather would i face three strong men than one young damsel  whereupon gascoyne burst out laughing marry quoth he they be no such terrible things but gentle and pleasant spoken and soft and smooth as any cat  no matter for that said myles i would not face one such for worlds  it was during the short time when so to speak the two owned the solitude of the brutus tower that myles told his friend of his fathers outlawry and of the peril in which the family stood and thus it was  i do marvel said gascoyne one day as the two lay stretched in the eyry looking down into the castle courtyard belowi do marvel now that thou art stablished here this month and more that my lord doth never have thee called to service upon household duty canst thou riddle me why it is so myles  the subject was a very sore one with myles until sir james had told him of the matter in his office that day he had never known that his father was attainted and outlawed he had accepted the change from their earlier state and the bald poverty of their life at crosbeyholt with the easy carelessness of boyhood and sir jamess words were the first to awaken him to a realization of the misfortunes of the house of falworth his was a brooding nature and in the three or four weeks that passed he had meditated so much over what had been told him that byandby it almost seemed as if a shadow of shame rested upon his fathers fair fame even though the attaint set upon him was unrighteous and unjust as myles knew it must be he had felt angry and resentful at the earls neglect and as days passed and he was not noticed in any way his heart was at times very bitter  so now gascoynes innocent question touched a sore spot and myles spoke with a sharp angry pain in his voice that made the other look quickly up sooner would my lord have yonder swineherd serve him in the household than me said he  why may that be myles said gascoyne  because answered myles with the same angry bitterness in his voice either the earl is a coward that feareth to befriend me or else he is a caitiff ashamed of his own flesh and blood and of me the son of his onetime comrade  gascoyne raised himself upon his elbow and opened his eyes wide in wonder afeard of thee myles quoth he why should he be afeared to befriend thee who art thou that the earl should fear thee  myles hesitated for a moment or two wisdom bade him remain silent upon the dangerous topic but his heart yearned for sympathy and companionship in his trouble i will tell thee said he suddenly and therewith poured out all of the story so far as he knew it to his listening wondering friend and his heart felt lighter to be thus eased of its burden and now said he as he concluded is not this earl a meanhearted caitiff to leave me the son of his onetime friend and kinsman thus to stand or to fall alone among strangers and in a strange place without once stretching me a helping hand he waited and gascoyne knew that he expected an answer  i know not that he is a meanhearted caitiff myles said he at last hesitatingly the earl hath many enemies and i have heard that he hath stood more than once in peril having been accused of dealings with the kings foes he was cousin to the earl of kent and i do remember hearing that he had a narrow escape at that time from ruin there be more reasons than thou wottest of why he should not have dealings with thy father  i had not thought said myles bitterly after a little pause that thou wouldst stand up for him and against me in this quarrel gascoyne him will i never forgive so long as i may live and i had thought that thou wouldst have stood by me  so i do said gascoyne hastily and do love thee more than any one in all the world myles but i had thought that it would make thee feel more easy to think that the earl was not against thee and indeed from all thou has told me i do soothly think that he and sir james mean to befriend thee and hold thee privily in kind regard  then why doth he not stand forth like a man and befriend me and my father openly even if it be to his own peril said myles reverting stubbornly to what he had first spoken  gascoyne did not answer but lay for a long while in silence knowest thou he suddenly asked after a while who is this great enemy of whom sir james speaketh and who seeketh so to drive thy father to ruin  nay said myles i know not for my father hath never spoken of these things and sir james would not tell me but this i know said he suddenly grinding his teeth together an i do not hunt him out some day and slay him like a dog he stopped abruptly and gascoyne looking askance at him saw that his eyes were full of tears whereupon he turned his looks away again quickly and fell to shooting pebbles out through the open window with his finger and thumb  thou wilt tell no one of these things that i have said said myles after a while  not i said gascoyne thinkest thou i could do such a thing  nay said myles briefly  perhaps this talk more than anything else that had ever passed between them knit the two friends the closer together for as i have said myles felt easier now that he had poured out his bitter thoughts and words and as for gascoyne i think that there is nothing so flattering to ones soul as to be made the confidant of a stronger nature   but the old tower served another purpose than that of a spot in which to pass away a few idle hours or in which to indulge the confidences of friendship for it was there that myles gathered a backing of strength for resistance against the tyranny of the bachelors and it is for that more than for any other reason that it has been told how they found the place and of what they did there feeling secure against interruption  myles falworth was not of a kind that forgets or neglects a thing upon which the mind has once been set perhaps his chief objective since the talk with sir james following his fight in the dormitory had been successful resistance to the exactions of the head of the body of squires he was now more than a month had passed looked upon by nearly if not all of the younger lads as an acknowledged leader in his own class so one day he broached a matter to gascoyne that had for some time been digesting in his mind it was the formation of a secret order calling themselves the knights of the rose their meetingplace to be the chapel of the brutus tower and their object to be the righting of wrongs as they said myles of arthur his roundtable did right wrongs  but prithee what wrongs are there to right in this place quoth gascoyne after listening intently to the plan which myles set forth  why first of all this said myles clinching his fists as he had a habit of doing when anything stirred him deeply that we set those vile bachelors to their right place and that is that they be no longer our masters but our fellows  gascoyne shook his head he hated clashing and conflict above all things and was for peace why should they thus rush to thrust themselves into trouble let matters abide as they were a little longer surely life was pleasant enough without turning it all topsyturvy then with a sort of indignation why should myles who had only come among them a month take such service more to heart than they who had endured it for years and finally with the hopefulness of so many of the rest of us he advised myles to let matters alone and they would right themselves in time  but myless mind was determined his active spirit could not brook resting passively under a wrong he would endure no longer and now or never they must make their stand  but look thee myles falworth said gascoyne all this is not to be done withouten fighting shrewdly wilt thou take that fighting upon thine own self as for me i tell thee i love it not  why aye said myles i ask no man to do what i will not do myself  gascoyne shrugged his shoulders so be it said he an thou hast appetite to run thy head against hard knocks do it i mercys name i for one will stand thee back while thou art taking thy raps  there was a spirit of drollery in gascoynes speech that rubbed against myless earnestness  out upon it cried he his patience giving way seest not that i am in serious earnest why then dost thou still jest like mad noll my lords fool an thou wilt not lend me thine aid in this matter say so and ha done with it and i will bethink me of somewhere else to turn  then gascoyne yielded at once as he always did when his friend lost his temper and having once assented to it entered into the scheme heart and soul three other ladsone of them that tall thin squire edmund wilkes before spoken ofwere sounded upon the subject they also entered into the plan of the secret organization with an enthusiasm which might perhaps not have been quite so glowing had they realized how very soon myles designed embarking upon active practical operations one day myles and gascoyne showed them the strange things that they had discovered in the old towerthe inner staircases the winding passageways the queer niches and cupboard and the black shaft of a well that pierced down into the solid wall and whence perhaps the old castle folk had one time drawn their supply of water in time of siege and with every new wonder of the marvellous place the enthusiasm of the three recruits rose higher and higher they rummaged through the lumber pile in the great circular room as myles and gascoyne had done and at last tired out they ascended to the airy chapel and there sat cooling themselves in the rustling freshness of the breeze that came blowing briskly in through the arched windows  it was then and there that the five discussed and finally determined upon the detailed plans of their organization canvassing the names of the squirehood and selecting from it a sufficient number of bold and daring spirits to make up a roll of twenty names in all  gascoyne had as i said entered into the matter with spirit and perhaps it was owing more to him than to any other that the project caught its delightful flavor of romance  perchance said he as the five lads lay in the rustling stillness through which sounded the monotonous and ceaseless cooing of the pigeonsperchance there may be dwarfs and giants and dragons and enchanters and evil knights and what not even nowadays and who knows but that if we knights of the rose hold together we may go forth into the world and do battle with them and save beautiful ladies and have tales and gestes written about us as they are writ about the seven champions and arthur his roundtable  perhaps myles who lay silently listening to all that was said was the only one who looked upon the scheme at all in the light of real utility but i think that even with him the fun of the matter outweighed the serious part of the business  so it was that the sacred order of the twenty knights of the rose came to be initiated they appointed a code of secret passwords and countersigns which were very difficult to remember and which were only used when they might excite the curiosity of the other and uninitiated boys by their mysterious sound they elected myles as their grand high commander and held secret meetings in the ancient tower where many mysteries were soberly enacted  of course in a day or two all the body of squires knew nearly everything concerning the knights of the rose and of their secret meetings in the old tower the lucky twenty were the objects of envy of all not so fortunate as to be included in this number and there was a marked air of secrecy about everything they did that appealed to every romantic notion of the youngsters looking on what was the stormy outcome of it all is now presently to be told    chapter 12  thus it was that myles with an eye to open war with the bachelors gathered a following to his support it was some little while before matters were brought to a crisisa week or ten days perhaps even myles had no great desire to hasten matters he knew that whenever war was declared he himself would have to bear the brunt of the battle and even the bravest man hesitates before deliberately thrusting himself into a fight  one morning myles and gascoyne and wilkes sat under the shade of two trees between which was a board nailed to the trunks making a rude benchalways a favorite loungingplace for the lads in idle moments myles was polishing his bascinet with lard and woodashes rubbing the metal with a piece of leather and wiping it clean with a fustian rag the other two who had just been relieved from household duty lay at length idly looking on  just then one of the smaller pages a boy of twelve or thirteen by name robin ingoldsby crossed the court he had been crying his face was red and blubbered and his body was still shaken with convulsive sniffs  myles looked up come hither robin he called from where he sat what is to do  the little fellow came slowly up to where the three rested in the shade mowbray beat me with a strap said he rubbing his sleeve across his eyes and catching his breath at the recollection  beat thee didst say said myles drawing his brows together why did he beat thee  because said robin i tarried overlong in fetching a pot of beer from the buttery for him and wyatt then with a boys sudden and easy quickness in forgetting past troubles tell me falworth said he when wilt thou give me that knife thou promised methe one thou break the blade of yesterday  i know not said myles bluntly vexed that the boy did not take the disgrace of his beating more to heart some time soon mayhap me thinks thou shouldst think more of thy beating than of a broken knife now get thee gone to thy business  the youngster lingered for a moment or two watching myles at his work what is that on the leather scrap falworth said he curiously  lard and ashes said myles testily get thee gone i say or i will crack thy head for thee and he picked up a block of wood with a threatening gesture  the youngster made a hideous grimace and then scurried away ducking his head lest in spite of myless wellknown goodnature the block should come whizzing after him  hear ye that now cried myles flinging down the block again and turning to his two friends beaten with straps because forsooth he would not fetch and carry quickly enough to please the haste of these bachelors oh this passeth patience and i for one will bear it no longer  nay myles said gascoyne soothingly the little imp is as lazy as a dormouse and as mischievous as a monkey ill warrant the hiding was his due and that more of the like would do him good  why how dost thou talk francis said myles turning upon him indignantly thou knowest that thou likest to see the boy beaten no more than i then after a meditative pause how many think ye we muster of our company of the rose today  wilkes looked doubtfully at gascoyne there be only seventeen of us here now said he at last brinton and lambourne are away to roby castle in lord georges train and will not be back till saturday next and watt newton is in the infirmary  seventeen best enou said myles grimly let us get together this afternoon such as may in the brutus tower for i as i did say will no longer suffer these vile bachelors  gascoyne and wilkes exchanged looks and then the former blew a long whistle  so that afternoon a gloomy set of young faces were gathered together in the eyryfifteen of the knights of the roseand all knew why they were assembled the talk which followed was conducted mostly by myles he addressed the others with a straightforward vim and earnestness but the response was only halfhearted and when at last having heated himself up with his own fire he sat down puffing out his red cheeks and glaring round a space of silence followed the lads looked doubtfully at one another myles felt the chill of their silence strike coldly on his enthusiasm and it vexed him  what wouldst thou do falworth said one of the knights at last wouldst have us open a quarrel with the bachelors  nay said myles gruffly i had thought that ye would all lend me a hand in a pitched battle but now i see that ye ha no stomach for that netheless i tell ye plainly i will not submit longer to the bachelors so now i will ask ye not to take any venture upon yourselves but only this that ye will stand by me when i do my fighting and not let five or seven of them fall upon me at once  there is walter blunt he is parlous strong said one of the others after a time of silence methinks he could conquer any two of us  nay said myles ye do fear him too greatly i tell ye i fear not to stand up to try battle with him and will do so too if the need arise only say ye that ye will stand by my back  marry said gascoyne quaintly an thou wilt dare take the heavy end upon thee i for one am willing to stand by and see that thou have thy fill of fighting  i too will stand thee by myles said edmund wilkes  and i and i and i said others chiming in  those who would still have held back were carried along by the stream and so it was settled that if the need should arise for myles to do a bit of fighting the others should stand by to see that he had fair play  when thinkest thou that thou wilt take thy stand against them myles asked wilkes  myles hesitated a moment tomorrow said he grimly  several of the lads whistled softly  gascoyne was prepared for an early opening of the war but perhaps not for such an early opening as this by r lady myles thou art hungry for brawling said he    chapter 13  after the first excitement of meeting discussing and deciding had passed myles began to feel the weight of the load he had so boldly taken upon himself he began to reckon what a serious thing it was for him to stand as a single champion against the tyranny that had grown so strong through years of custom had he let himself do so he might almost have repented but it was too late now for repentance he had laid his hand to the plough and he must drive the furrow  somehow the news of impending battle had leaked out among the rest of the body of squires and a buzz of suppressed excitement hummed through the dormitory that evening the bachelors to whom no doubt vague rumors had been blown looked lowering and talked together in low voices standing apart in a group some of them made a rather marked show of secreting knives in the straw of their beds and no doubt it had its effect upon more than one young heart that secretly thrilled at the sight of the shining blades however all was undisturbed that evening the lights were put out and the lads retired with more than usual quietness only for the murmur of whispering  all night myless sleep was more or less disturbed by dreams in which he was now conquering now being conquered and before the day had fairly broken he was awake he lay upon his cot keying himself up for the encounter which he had set upon himself to face and it would not be the truth to say that the sight of those knives hidden in the straw the night before had made no impression upon him byandby he knew the others were beginning to awake for he heard them softly stirring and as the light grew broad and strong saw them arise one by one and begin dressing in the gray morning then he himself arose and put on his doublet and hose strapping his belt tightly about his waist then he sat down on the side of his cot  presently that happened for which he was waiting two of the younger squires started to bring the bachelors morning supply of water as they crossed the room myles called to them in a loud voicea little uneven perhaps stop we draw no more water for any one in this house saving only for ourselves set ye down those buckets and go back to your places  the two lads stopped half turned and then stood still holding the three buckets undecidedly  in a moment all was uproar and confusion for by this time every one of the lads had arisen some sitting on the edge of their beds some nearly others quite dressed a halfdozen of the knights of the rose came over to where myles stood gathering in a body behind him and the others followed one after another  the bachelors were hardly prepared for such prompt and vigorous action  what is to do cried one of them who stood near the two lads with the buckets why fetch ye not the water  falworth says we shall not fetch it answered one of the lads a boy by the name of gosse  what mean ye by that falworth the young man called to myles  myless heart was beating thickly and heavily within him but nevertheless he spoke up boldly enough i mean said he that from henceforth ye shall fetch and carry for yourselves  lookee blunt called the bachelor here is falworth says they squires will fetch no more water for us  the head bachelor had heard all that had passed and was even then hastily slipping on his doublet and hose now then falworth said he at last striding forward what is to do ye will fetch no more water eh by r lady i will know the reason why  he was still advancing towards myles with two or three of the older bachelors at his heels when gascoyne spoke  thou hadst best stand back blunt said he else thou mayst be hurt we will not have ye bang falworth again as ye once did so stand thou back  blunt stopped short and looked upon the lads standing behind myles some of them with faces a trifle pale perhaps but all grim and determined looking enough then he turned upon his heel suddenly and walked back to the far end of the dormitory where the bachelors were presently clustered together a few words passed between them and then the thirteen began at once arming themselves some with wooden clogs and some with the knives which they had so openly concealed the night before at the sign of imminent battle all those not actively interested scuttled away to right and left climbing up on the benches and cots and leaving a free field to the combatants the next moment would have brought bloodshed  now myles thanks to the training of the crosbeydale smith felt tolerably sure that in a wrestling bout he was a matchperhaps more than a matchfor any one of the body of squires and he had determined if possible to bring the battle to a singlehanded encounter upon that footing accordingly he suddenly stepped forward before the others  lookee fellow he called to blunt thou art he who struck me whilst i was down some while since wilt thou let this quarrel stand between thee and me and meet me man to man without weapon see i throw me down mine own and will meet thee with bare hands and as he spoke he tossed the clog he held in his hand back upon the cot  so be it said blunt with great readiness tossing down a similar weapon which he himself held  do not go myles cried gascoyne he is a villain and a traitor and would betray thee to thy death i saw him when he first gat from bed hide a knife in his doublet  thou liest said blunt i swear by my faith i be barehanded as ye see me thy friend accuses me myles falworth because he knoweth thou art afraid of me  there thou liest most vilely exclaimed myles swear that thou hast no knife and i will meet thee  hast thou not heard me say that i have no knife said blunt what more wouldst thou have  then i will meet thee halfway said myles  gascoyne caught him by the sleeve and would have withheld him assuring him that he had seen the bachelor conceal a knife but myles hot for the fight broke away from his friend without listening to him  as the two advanced steadily towards one another a breathless silence fell upon the dormitory in sharp contrast to the uproar and confusion that had filled it a moment before the lads standing some upon benches some upon beds all watched with breathless interest the meeting of the two champions  as they approached one another they stopped and stood for a moment a little apart glaring the one upon the other they seemed ill enough matched blunt was fully half a head taller than myles and was thickset and closeknit in young manhood nothing but myless undaunted pluck could have led him to dare to face an enemy so much older and stouter than himself  the pause was only for a moment they who looked saw blunt slide his hand furtively towards his bosom myles saw too and in the flash of an instant knew what the gesture meant and sprang upon the other before the hand could grasp what it sought as he clutched his enemy he felt what he had in that instant expected to feelthe handle of a dagger the next moment he cried in a loud voice oh thou villain help gascoyne he hath a knife under his doublet  in answer to his cry for help myless friends started to his aid but the bachelors shouted stand back and let them fight it out alone else we will knife ye too and as they spoke some of them leaped from the benches whereon they stood drawing their knives and flourishing them  for just a few seconds myless friends stood cowed and in those few seconds the fight came to an end with a suddenness unexpected to all  a struggle fierce and silent followed between the two blunt striving to draw his knife and myles with the energy of despair holding him tightly by the wrist it was in vain the elder lad writhed and twisted he was strong enough to overbear myles but still was not able to clutch the haft of his knife  thou shalt not draw it gasped myles at last thou shalt not stab me  then again some of his friends started forward to his aid but they were not needed for before they came the fight was over  blunt finding that he was not able to draw the weapon suddenly ceased his endeavors and flung his arms around myles trying to bear him down upon the ground and in that moment his battle was lost  in an instantso quick so sudden so unexpected that no one could see how it happenedhis feet were whirled away from under him he spun with flying arms across myless loins and pitched with a thud upon the stone pavement where he lay still motionless while myles his face white with passion and his eyes gleaming stood glaring around like a young wildboar beset by the dogs  the next moment the silence was broken and the uproar broke forth with redoubled violence the bachelors leaping from the benches came hurrying forward on one side and myless friends from the other  thou shalt smart for this falworth said one of the older lads belike thou hast slain him  myles turned upon the speaker like a flash and with such a passion of fury in his face that the other a fellow nearly a head taller than he shrank back cowed in spite of himself then gascoyne came and laid his hand on his friends shoulder  who touches me cried myles hoarsely turning sharply upon him and then seeing who it was oh francis they would ha killed me  come away myles said gascoyne thou knowest not what thou doest thou art mad come away what if thou hadst killed him  the words called myles somewhat to himself i care not said he but sullenly and not passionately and then he suffered gascoyne and wilkes to lead him away  meantime blunts friends had turned him over and after feeling his temples his wrist and his heart bore him away to a bench at the far end of the room there they fell to chafing his hands and sprinkling water in his face a crowd of the others gathering about blunt was hidden from myles by those who stood around and the lad listened to the broken talk that filled the room with its confusion his anxiety growing keener as he became cooler but at last with a heartfelt joy he gathered from the confused buzz of words that the other lad had opened his eyes and after a while he saw him sit up leaning his head upon the shoulder of one of his fellowbachelors white and faint and sick as death  thank heaven that thou didst not kill him said edmund wilkes who had been standing with the crowd looking on at the efforts of blunts friends to revive him and who had now come and sat down upon the bed not far from myles  aye said myles gruffly i do thank heaven for that    chapter 14  if myles fancied that one single victory over his enemy would cure the evil against which he fought he was grievously mistaken wrongs are not righted so easily as that it was only the beginning other and far more bitter battles lay before him ere he could look around him and say i have won the victory  for a dayfor two daysthe bachelors were demoralized at the fall of their leader and the knights of the rose were proportionately uplifted  the day that blunt met his fall the wooden tank in which the water had been poured every morning was found to have been taken away the bachelors made a great show of indignation and inquiry who was it stole their tank if they did but know he should smart for it  ho ho roared edmund wilkes so that the whole dormitory heard him smoke ye not their tricks lads see ye not that they have stolen their own watertank so that they might have no need for another fight over the carrying of the water  the bachelors made an obvious show of not having heard what he said and a general laugh went around no one doubted that wilkes had spoken the truth in his taunt and that the bachelors had indeed stolen their own tank so no more water was ever carried for the head squires but it was plain to see that the war for the upperhand was not yet over  even if myles had entertained comforting thoughts to the contrary he was speedily undeceived one morning about a week after the fight as he and gascoyne were crossing the armory court they were hailed by a group of the bachelors standing at the stone steps of the great building  holloa falworth they cried knowest thou that blunt is nigh well again  nay said myles i knew it not but i am right glad to hear it  thou wilt sing a different song anon said one of the bachelors i tell thee he is hot against thee and swears when he cometh again he will carve thee soothly  aye marry said another i would not be in thy skin a week hence for a ducat only this morning he told philip mowbray that he would have thy blood for the fall thou gavest him look to thyself falworth he cometh again wednesday or thursday next thou standest in a parlous state  myles said gascoyne as they entered the great quadrangle i do indeed fear me that he meaneth to do thee evil  i know not said myles boldly but i fear him not nevertheless his heart was heavy with the weight of impending ill  one evening the bachelors were more than usually noisy in their end of the dormitory laughing and talking and shouting to one another  holloa you sirrah falworth called one of them along the length of the room blunt cometh again tomorrow day  myles saw gascoyne direct a sharp glance at him but he answered nothing either to his enemys words or his friends look  as the bachelor had said blunt came the next morning it was just after chapel and the whole body of squires was gathered in the armory waiting for the orders of the day and the calling of the roll of those chosen for household duty myles was sitting on a bench along the wall talking and jesting with some who stood by when of a sudden his heart gave a great leap within him  it was walter blunt he came walking in at the door as if nothing had passed and at his unexpected coming the hubbub of talk and laughter was suddenly checked even myles stopped in his speech for a moment and then continued with a beating heart and a carelessness of manner that was altogether assumed in his hand blunt carried the house orders for the day and without seeming to notice myles he opened it and read the list of those called upon for household service  myles had risen and was now standing listening with the others when blunt had ended reading the list of names he rolled up the parchment and thrust it into his belt then swinging suddenly on his heel he strode straight up to myles facing him front to front a moment or two of deep silence followed not a sound broke the stillness when blunt spoke every one in the armory heard his words  sirrah said he thou didst put foul shame upon me some time sin never will i forget or forgive that offence and will have a reckoning with thee right soon that thou wilt not forget to the last day of thy life  when myles had seen his enemy turn upon him he did not know at first what to expect he would not have been surprised had they come to blows there and then and he held himself prepared for any event he faced the other pluckily enough and without flinching and spoke up boldly in answer so be it walter blunt i fear thee not in whatever way thou mayst encounter me  dost thou not said blunt byr lady thoult have cause to fear me ere i am through with thee he smiled a baleful lingering smile and then turned slowly and walked away  what thinkest thou myles said gascoyne as the two left the armory together  i think naught said myles gruffly he will not dare to touch me to harm me i fear him not nevertheless he did not speak the full feelings of his heart  i know not myles said gascoyne shaking his head doubtfully walter blunt is a parlous evilminded knave and methinks will do whatever evil he promiseth  i fear him not said myles again but his heart foreboded trouble  the coming of the head squire made a very great change in the condition of affairs even before that coming the bachelors had somewhat recovered from their demoralization and now again they began to pluck up their confidence and to order the younger squires and pages upon this personal service or upon that  see ye not said myles one day when the knights of the rose were gathered in the brutus towersee ye not that they grow as bad as ever an we put not a stop to this overmastery now it will never stop  best let it be myles said wilkes they will kill thee an thou cease not troubling them thou hast bred mischief enow for thyself already  no matter for that said myles it is not to be borne that they order others of us about as they do i mean to speak to them tonight and tell them it shall not be  he was as good as his word that night as the youngsters were shouting and romping and skylarking as they always did before turning in he stood upon his cot and shouted silence list to me a little and then in the hush that followedi want those bachelors to hear this that we squires serve them no longer and if they would ha some to wait upon them they must get them otherwheres than here there be twenty of us to stand against them and haply more and we mean that they shall ha service of us no more  then he jumped down again from his elevated stand and an uproar of confusion instantly filled the place what was the effect of his words upon the bachelors he could not see what was the result he was not slow in discovering  the next day myles and gascoyne were throwing their daggers for a wager at a wooden target against the wall back of the armorers smithy wilkes gosse and one or two others of the squires were sitting on a bench looking on and now and then applauding a more than usually wellaimed cast of the knife suddenly that impish little page spoken of before robin ingoldsby thrust his shock head around the corner of the smithy and said ho falworth blunt is going to serve thee out today and i myself heard him say so he says he is going to slit thine ears and then he was gone as suddenly as he had appeared  myles darted after him caught him midway in the quadrangle and brought him back by the scuff of the neck squalling and struggling  there said he still panting from the chase and seating the boy by no means gently upon the bench beside wilkes sit thou there thou imp of evil and now tell me what thou didst mean by thy words anonan thou stop not thine outcry i will cut thy throat for thee and he made a ferocious gesture with his dagger  it was by no means easy to worm the story from the mischievous little monkey he knew myles too well to be in the least afraid of his threats but at last by dint of bribing and coaxing myles and his friends managed to get at the facts the youngster had been sent to clean the ridingboots of one of the bachelors instead of which he had lolled idly on a cot in the dormitory until he had at last fallen asleep he had been awakened by the opening of the dormitory door and by the sound of voicesamong them was that of his taskmaster fearing punishment for his neglected duty he had slipped out of the cot and hidden himself beneath it  those who had entered were walter blunt and three of the older bachelors blunts companions were trying to persuade him against something but without avail it wasmyless heart thrilled and his blood boiledto lie in wait for him to overpower him by numbers and to mutilate him by slitting his earsa disgraceful punishment administered as a rule only for thieving and poaching  he would not dare to do such a thing cried myles with heaving breast and flashing eyes  aye but he would said gascoyne his father lord reginald blunt is a great man over nottingham way and my lord would not dare to punish him even for such a matter as that but tell me robin ingoldsby dost know aught more of this matter prithee tell it me robin where do they propose to lie in wait for falworth  in the gateway of the buttery court so as to catch him when he passes by to the armory answered the boy  are they there now said wilkes  aye nine of them said robin i heard blunt tell mowbray to go and gather the others he heard thee tell gosse falworth that thou wert going thither for thy arbalist this morn to shoot at the rooks withal  that will do robin said myles thou mayst go  and therewith the little imp scurried off pulling the lobes of his ears suggestively as he darted around the corner  the others looked at one another for a while in silence  so comrades said myles at last what shall we do now  go and tell sir james said gascoyne promptly  nay said myles i take no such cowards part as that i say an they hunger to fight give them their stomachful  the others were very reluctant for such extreme measures but myles as usual carried his way and so a pitched battle was decided upon it was gascoyne who suggested the plan which they afterwards followed  then wilkes started away to gather together those of the knights of the rose not upon household duty and myles with the others went to the armor smith to have him make for them a set of knives with which to meet their enemiesknives with blades a foot long pointed and doubleedged  the smith leaning with his hammer upon the anvil listened to them as they described the weapons  nay nay master myles said he when myles had ended by telling the use to which he intended putting them thou art going all wrong in this matter with such blades ere this battle is ended some one would be slain and so murder done then the family of him who was killed would haply have ye cited and mayhap it might een come to the hanging for some of they boys ha great folkeys behind them go ye to tom fletcher master myles and buy of him good yew staves such as one might break a head withal and with them gin ye keep your wits ye may hold your own against knives or short swords i tell thee een though my trade be making of blades rather would i ha a good stout cudgel in my hand than the best dagger that ever was forged  myles stood thoughtfully for a moment or two then looking up methinks thou speaketh truly robin said he and it were ill done to have blood upon our hands    chapter 15  from the long narrow stonepaved armory court and connecting it with the inner buttery court ran a narrow arched passageway in which was a picketgate closed at night and locked from within it was in this arched passageway that according to little robert ingoldsbys report the bachelors were lying in wait for myles gascoynes plan was that myles should enter the court alone the knights of the rose lying ambushed behind the angle of the armory building until the bachelors should show themselves  it was not without trepidation that myles walked alone into the court which happened then to be silent and empty his heart beat more quickly than it was wont and he gripped his cudgel behind his back looking sharply this way and that so as not to be taken unawares by a flank movement of his enemies midway in the court he stopped and hesitated for a moment then he turned as though to enter the armory the next moment he saw the bachelors come pouring out from the archway  instantly he turned and rushed back towards where his friends lay hidden shouting to the rescue to the rescue  stone him roared blunt the villain escapes  he stopped and picked up a cobblestone as he spoke flinging it after his escaping prey it narrowly missed myless head had it struck him there might have been no more of this story to tell  to the rescue to the rescue shouted myless friends in answer and the next moment he was surrounded by them then he turned and swinging his cudgel rushed back upon his foes  the bachelors stopped short at the unexpected sight of the lads with their cudgels for a moment they rallied and drew their knives then they turned and fled towards their former place of hiding  one of them turned for a moment and flung his knife at myles with a deadly aim but myles quick as a cat ducked his body and the weapon flew clattering across the stony court then he who had flung it turned again to fly but in his attempt he had delayed one instant too long myles reached him with a longarm stroke of his cudgel just as he entered the passageway knocking him over like a bottle stunned and senseless  the next moment the picketgate was banged in their faces and the bolt shot in the staples and the knights of the rose were left shouting and battering with their cudgels against the palings  by this time the uproar of fight had aroused those in the rooms and offices fronting upon the armory court heads were thrust from many of the windows with the eager interest that a fight always evokes  beware shouted myles here they come again he bore back towards the entrance of the alleyway as he spoke those behind him scattering to right and left for the bachelors had rallied and were coming again to the attack shouting  they were not a moment too soon in this retreat either for the next instant the pickets flew open and a volley of stones flew after the retreating knights of the rose one smote wilkes upon the head knocking him down headlong another struck myles upon his left shoulder benumbing his arm from the fingertips to the armpit so that he thought at first the limb was broken  get ye behind the buttresses shouted those who looked down upon the fight from the windowsget ye behind the buttresses and in answer the lads scattering like a newlyflushed covey of partridges fled to and crouched in the sheltering angles of masonry to escape from the flying stones  and now followed a lull in the battle the bachelors fearing to leave the protection of the arched passageway lest their retreat should be cut off and the knights of the rose not daring to quit the shelter of the buttresses and angles of the wall lest they should be knocked down by the stones  the bachelor whom myles had struck down with his cudgel was sitting up rubbing the back of his head and wilkes had gathered his wits enough to crawl to the shelter of the nearest buttress myles peeping around the corner behind which he stood could see that the bachelors were gathered into a little group consulting together suddenly it broke asunder and blunt turned around  ho falworth he cried wilt thou hold truce whiles we parley with ye  aye answered myles  wilt thou give me thine honor that ye will hold your hands from harming us whiles we talk together  yea said myles i will pledge thee mine honor  i accept thy pledge see here we throw aside our stones and lay down our knives lay ye by your clubs and meet us in parley at the horseblock yonder  so be it said myles and thereupon standing his cudgel in the angle of the wall he stepped boldly out into the open courtyard those of his party came scatteringly from right and left gathering about him and the bachelors advanced in a body led by the head squire  now what is it thou wouldst have walter blunt said myles when both parties had met at the horseblock  it is to say this to thee myles falworth said the other one time not long sin thou didst challenge me to meet thee hand to hand in the dormitory then thou didst put a vile affront upon me for the which i ha brought on this battle today for i knew not then that thou wert going to try thy peasant tricks of wrestling and so without guarding myself i met thee as thou didst desire  but thou hadst thy knife and would have stabbed him couldst thou ha done so said gascoyne  thou liest said blunt i had no knife and then without giving time to answer thou canst not deny that i met thee then at thy bidding canst thou falworth  nay said myles nor haply canst thou deny it either and at this covert reminder of his defeat myless followers laughed scoffingly and blunt bit his lip  thou hast said it said he then sin i met thee at thy bidding i dare to thee to meet me now at mine and to fight this battle out between our two selves with sword and buckler and bascinet as gentles should and not in a wrestling match like two country hodges  thou art a coward caitiff walter blunt burst out wilkes who stood by with a swelling lump upon his head already as big as a walnut well thou knowest that falworth is no match for thee at broadsword play is he not four years younger than thou and hast thou not had three times the practice in arms that he hath had i say thou art a coward to seek to fight with cutting weapons  blunt made no answer to wilkess speech but gazed steadfastly at myles with a scornful smile curling the corners of his lips myles stood looking upon the ground without once lifting his eyes not knowing what to answer for he was well aware that he was no match for blunt with the broadsword  thou art afraid to fight me myles falworth said blunt tauntingly and the bachelors gave a jeering laugh in echo  then myles looked up and i cannot say that his face was not a trifle whiter than usual nay said he i am not afraid and i will fight thee blunt  so be it said blunt then let us go at it straightway in the armory yonder for they be at dinner in the great hall and just now there best no one by to stay us  thou shalt not fight him myles burst out gascoyne he will murther thee thou shalt not fight him i say  myles turned away without answering him  what is to do called one of those who were still looking out of the windows as the crowd of boys passed beneath  blunt and falworth are going to fight it out hand to hand in the armory answered one of the bachelors looking up  the brawling of the squires was a jest to all the adjoining part of the house so the heads were withdrawn again some laughing at the sparring of the cockerels  but it was no jesting matter to poor myles    chapter 16  i have no intention to describe the fight between myles falworth and walter blunt fisticuffs of nowadays are brutal and debasing enough but a fight with a sharpedged broadsword was not only brutal and debasing but cruel and bloody as well  from the very first of the fight myles falworth was palpably and obviously overmatched after fifteen minutes had passed blunt stood hale and sound as at first but poor myles had more than one red stain of warm blood upon doublet and hose and more than one bandage had been wrapped by gascoyne and wilkes about sore wounds  he had received no serious injury as yet for not only was his body protected by a buckler or small oblong shield which he carried upon his left arm and his head by a bascinet or light helmet of steel but perhaps after all blunt was not overanxious to do him any dangerous harm nevertheless there could be but one opinion as to how the fight tended and myless friends were gloomy and downcast the bachelors proportionately exultant shouting with laughter and taunting myles at every unsuccessful stroke  once as he drew back panting leaning upon gascoynes shoulder the faithful friend whispered with trembling lips oh dear myles carry it no further thou hurtest him not and he will slay thee ere he have done with thee  thereupon blunt who caught the drift of the speech put in a word thou art sore hurt myles falworth said he and i would do thee no grievous harm yield thee and own thyself beaten and i will forgive thee thou hast fought a good fight and there is no shame in yielding now  never cried myles hoarselynever will i yield me thou mayst slay me walter blunt and i reck not if thou dost do so but never else wilt thou conquer me  there was a tone of desperation in his voice that made all look serious  nay said blunt i will fight thee no more myles falworth thou hast had enough  by heavens cried myles grinding his teeth thou shalt fight me thou coward thou hast brought this fight upon us and either thou or i get our quittance here let go gascoyne he cried shaking loose his friends hold i tell thee he shall fight me  from that moment blunt began to lose his head no doubt he had not thought of such a serious fight as this when he had given his challenge and there was a savage bulldog tenacity about myles that could not but have had a somewhat demoralizing effect upon him  a few blows were given and taken and then myless friends gave a shout blunt drew back and placed his hand to his shoulder when he drew it away again it was stained with red and another red stain grew and spread rapidly down the sleeve of his jacket he stared at his hand for a moment with a halfdazed look and then glanced quickly to right and left  i will fight no more said he sullenly  then yield thee cried myles exultantly  the triumphant shouts of the knights of the rose stung blunt like a lash and the battle began again perhaps some of the older lads were of a mind to interfere at this point certainly some looked very serious but before they interposed the fight was ended  blunt grinding his teeth struck one undercut at his opponentthe same undercut that myles had that time struck at sir james lee at the knights bidding when he first practised at the devlen pels myles met the blow as sir james had met the blow that he had given and then struck in return as sir james had struckfull and true the bascinet that blunt wore glanced the blow partly but not entirely myles felt his sword bite through the light steel cap and blunt dropped his own blade clattering upon the floor it was all over in an instant but in that instant what he saw was stamped upon myless mind with an indelible imprint he saw the young man stagger backward he saw the eyes roll upward and a red streak shoot out from under the cap and run down across the cheek  blunt reeled half around and then fell prostrate upon his face and myles stood staring at him with the delirious turmoil of his battle dissolving rapidly into a dumb fear at that which he had done  once again he had won the victorybut what a victory is he dead he whispered to gascoyne  i know not said gascoyne with a very pale face but come away myles and he led his friend out of the room  some little while later one of the bachelors came to the dormitory where myles his wounds smarting and aching and throbbing lay stretched upon his cot and with a very serious face bade him to go presently to sir james who had just come from dinner and was then in his office  by this time myles knew that he had not slain his enemy and his heart was light in spite of the coming interview there was no one in the office but sir james and himself and myles without concealing anything told point by point the whole trouble sir james sat looking steadily at him for a while after he had ended  never said he presently did i know any one of ye squires in all the time that i have been here get himself into so many broils as thou myles falworth belike thou sought to take this lads life  nay said myles earnestly god forbid  netheless said sir james thou fetched him a main shrewd blow and it is by good hap and no fault of thine that he will live to do more mischief yet this is thy second venture at him the third time haply thou wilt end him for good then suddenly assuming his grimmest and sternest manner now sirrah do i put a stop to this and no more shall ye fight with edged tools get thee to the dormitory and abide there a full week without coming forth michael shall bring thee bread and water twice a day for that time that is all the food thou shalt have and we will see if that fare will not cool thy hot humors withal  myles had expected a punishment so much more severe than that which was thus meted to him that in the sudden relief he broke into a convulsive laugh and then with a hasty sweep wiped a brimming moisture from his eyes  sir james looked keenly at him for a moment thou art white i the face said he art thou wounded very sorely  nay said myles it is not much but i be sick in my stomach  aye aye said sir james i know that feeling well it is thus that one always feeleth in coming out from a sore battle when one hath suffered wounds and lost blood an thou wouldst keep thyself hale keep thyself from needless fighting now go thou to the dormitory and as i said come thou not forth again for a week stay sirrah he added i will send georgebarber to thee to look to thy sores green wounds are best drawn and salved ere they grow cold  i wonder what myles would have thought had he known that so soon as he had left the office sir james had gone straight to the earl and recounted the whole matter to him with a deal of dry gusto and that the earl listened laughing  aye said he when sir james had done the boy hath mettle sure nevertheless we must transplant this fellow blunt to the office of gentlemaninwaiting he must be old enough now and gin he stayeth in his present place either he will do the boy a harm or the boy will do him a harm  so blunt never came again to trouble the squires quarters and thereafter the youngsters rendered no more service to the elders  myless first great fight in life was won    chapter 17  the summer passed away and the bleak fall came myles had long since accepted his position as one set apart from the others of his kind and had resigned himself to the evident fact that he was never to serve in the household in waiting upon the earl i cannot say that it never troubled him but in time there came a compensation of which i shall have presently to speak  and then he had so much the more time to himself the other lads were sometimes occupied by their household duties when sports were afoot in which they would liked to have taken part myles was always free to enter into any matter of the kind after his daily exercise had been performed at the pels the butts or the tiltingcourt  but even though he was never called to do service in my lords house he was not long in gaining a sort of secondhand knowledge of all the family my lady a thin sallow faded dame not yet past middle age but looking ten years older the lady anne the daughter of the house a tall thin darkeyed darkhaired handsome young dame of twenty or twentyone years of age hawknosed like her father and silent proud and haughty myles heard the squires say lady alice the earl of mackworths niece and ward a great heiress in her own right a strikingly pretty blackeyed girl of fourteen or fifteen  these composed the earls personal family but besides them was lord george beaumont his earls brother and him myles soon came to know better than any of the chief people of the castle excepting sir james lee  for since myless great battle in the armory lord george had taken a laughing sort of liking to the lad encouraging him at times to talk of his adventures and of his hopes and aspirations  perhaps the earls younger brotherwho was himself somewhat a soldier of fortune having fought in spain france and germanyfelt a certain kinship in spirit with the adventurous youngster who had his unfriended way to make in the world however that might have been lord george was very kind and friendly to the lad and the willing service that myles rendered him reconciled him not a little to the earls obvious neglect  besides these of the more immediate family of the earl were a number of knights ladies and gentlemen some of them cadets some of them retainers of the house of beaumont for the princely nobles of those days lived in state little less royal than royalty itself  most of the knights and gentlemen myles soon came to know by sight meeting them in lord georges apartments in the south wing of the great house and some of them following the lead of lord george singled him out for friendly notice giving him a nod or a word in passing   every season has its pleasures for boys and the constant change that they bring is one of the greatest delights of boyhoods days  all of us as we grow older have in our memory pictures of bygone times that are somehow more than usually vivid the colors of some not blurring by time as others do one of which in remembering always filled myless heart in afteryears with an indefinable pleasure was the recollection of standing with others of his fellow squires in the crisp brown autumn grass of the paddock and shooting with the longbow at wildfowl which when the east wind was straining flew low overhead to pitch to the lake in the forbidden precincts of the deer park beyond the brow of the hill more than once a brace or two of these wildfowl shot in their southward flight by the lads and cooked by fat goodnatured mother joan graced the rude messtable of the squires in the long hall and even the toughest and fishiest drake so the fruit of their skill had a savor that somehow or other the daintiest fare lacked in afteryears  then fall passed and winter came bleak cold and drearynot winter as we know it nowadays with warm fires and bright lights to make the long nights sweet and cheerful with comfort but winter with all its grimness and sternness in the great cold stonewalled castles of those days the only fire and almost the only light were those from the huge blazing logs that roared and crackled in the great open stone fireplace around which the folks gathered sheltering their faces as best they could from the scorching heat and cloaking their shoulders from the biting cold for at the farther end of the room where giant shadows swayed and bowed and danced huge and black against the high walls the white frost glistened in the moonlight on the stone pavements and the breath went up like smoke  in those days were no books to read but at the best only rude stories and jests recited by some strolling mummer or minstrel to the listening circle gathered around the blaze and welcoming the coarse gross jests and coarser grosser songs with roars of boisterous laughter  yet bleak and dreary as was the winter in those days and cold and biting as was the frost in the cheerless windy halls and corridors of the castle it was not without its joys to the young lads for then as now boys could find pleasure even in slushy weather when the sodden snow is fit for nothing but to make snowballs of  thrice that bitter winter the moat was frozen over and the lads making themselves skates of marrowbones which they bought from the hall cook at a groat a pair went skimming over the smooth surface redchecked and shouting while the crows and the jackdaws looked down at them from the top of the bleak gray walls  then at yuletide which was somewhat of a rude semblance to the merry christmas season of our day a great feast was held in the hall and all the castle folk were fed in the presence of the earl and the countess oxen and sheep were roasted whole huge suet puddings made of barley meal sweetened with honey and stuffed with plums were boiled in great caldrons in the open courtyard whole barrels of ale and malmsey were broached and all the folk gentle and simple were bidden to the feast afterwards the minstrels danced and played a rude play and in the evening a miracle show was performed on a raised platform in the north hall  for a week afterwards the castle was fed upon the remains of the good things left from that great feast until everyone grew to loathe fine victuals and longed for honest beef and mustard again  then at last in that constant change the winter was gone and even the lads who had enjoyed its passing were glad when the winds blew warm once more and the grass showed green in sunny places and the leader of the wildfowl blew his horn as they who in the fall had flown to the south flew arrowlike northward again when the buds swelled and the leaves burst forth once more and crocuses and then daffodils gleamed in the green grass like sparks and flames of gold  with the spring came the outdoor sports of the season among others that of ballfor boys were boys and played at ball even in those faraway daysa game called trapball even yet in some parts of england it is played just as it was in myles falworths day and enjoyed just as myles and his friends enjoyed it  so now that the sun was warm and the weather pleasant the game of trapball was in full swing every afternoon the playground being an open space between the wall that surrounded the castle grounds and that of the privy gardenthe pleasance in which the ladies of the earls family took the air every day and upon which their apartments opened  now one fine breezy afternoon when the lads were shouting and playing at this then their favorite game myles himself was at the trap barehanded and barearmed the wind was blowing from behind him and aided perhaps by it he had already struck three of four balls nearly the whole length of the courtan unusual distanceand several of the lads had gone back almost as far as the wall of the privy garden to catch any ball that might chance to fly as far as that then once more myles struck throwing all his strength into the blow the ball shot up into the air and when it fell it was to drop within the privy garden  the shouts of the young players were instantly stilled and gascoyne who stood nearest myles thrust his hands into his belt giving a long shrill whistle  this time thou hast struck us all out myles said he there be no more play for us until we get another ball  the outfielders came slowly trooping in until they had gathered in a little circle around myles  i could not help it said myles in answer to their grumbling how knew i the ball would fly so far but if i ha lost the ball i can get it again i will climb the wall for it  thou shalt do naught of the kind myles said gascoyne hastily thou art as mad as a march hare to think of such a venture wouldst get thyself shot with a bolt betwixt the ribs like poor diccon cook  of all places about the castle the privy garden was perhaps the most sacred it was a small plot of ground only a few rods long and wide and was kept absolutely private for the use of the countess and her family only a little while before myles had first come to devlen one of the cooks men had been found climbing the wall whereupon the soldier who saw him shot him with his cross bow the poor fellow dropped from the wall into the garden and when they found him he still held a bunch of flowers in his hand which he had perhaps been gathering for his sweetheart  had myles seen him carried on a litter to the infirmary as gascoyne and some of the others had done he might have thought twice before venturing to enter the ladies private garden as it was he only shook his stubborn head and said again i will climb the wall and fetch it  now at the lower extremity of the court and about twelve or fifteen feet distant from the garden wall there grew a peartree some of the branches of which overhung into the garden beyond so first making sure that no one was looking that way and bidding the others keep a sharp lookout myles shinned up this tree and choosing one of the thicker limbs climbed out upon it for some little distance then lowering his body he hung at armslength the branch bending with his weight and slowly let himself down hand under hand until at last he hung directly over the top of the wall and perhaps a foot above it below him he could see the leafy top of an arbor covered with a thick growth of clematis and even as he hung there he noticed the broad smooth walks the grassy terrace in front of the countesss apartments in the distance the quaint flowerbeds the yewtrees trimmed into odd shapes and even the deaf old gardener working barearmed in the sunlight at a flowerbed in the far corner by the toolhouse  the top of the wall was pointed like a house roof and immediately below him was covered by a thick growth of green moss and it flashed through his mind as he hung there that maybe it would offer a very slippery foothold for one dropping upon the steep slopes of the top but it was too late to draw back now  bracing himself for a moment he loosed his hold upon the limb above the branch flew back with a rush and he dropped striving to grasp the sloping angle with his feet instantly the treacherous slippery moss slid away from beneath him he made a vain clutch at the wall his fingers sliding over the cold stones then with a sharp exclamation down he pitched bodily into the garden beneath a thousand thoughts flew through his brain like a cloud of flies and then a leafy greenness seemed to strike up against him a splintering crash sounded in his ears as the lattice top of the arbor broke under him and with one final clutch at the empty air he fell heavily upon the ground beneath  he heard a shrill scream that seemed to find an instant echo even as he fell he had a vision of faces and bright colors and when he sat up dazed and bewildered he found himself face to face with the lady anne the daughter of the house and her cousin the lady alice who clutching one another tightly stood staring at him with wide scared eyes    chapter 18  for a little time there was a pause of deep silence during which the fluttering leaves came drifting down from the broken arbor above  it was the lady anne who first spoke who art thou and whence comest thou said she tremulously  then myles gathered himself up sheepishly my name is myles falworth said he and i am one of the squires of the body  oh aye said the lady alice suddenly me thought i knew thy face art thou not the young man that i have seen in lord georges train  yes lady said myles wrapping and twining a piece of the broken vine in and out among his fingers lord george hath often had me of late about his person  and what dost thou do here sirrah said lady anne angrily how darest thou come so into our garden  i meant not to come as i did said myles clumsily and with a face hot and red but i slipped over the top of the wall and fell hastily into the garden truly lady i meant ye no harm or fright thereby  he looked so drolly abashed as he stood before them with his clothes torn and soiled from the fall his face red and his eyes downcast all the while industriously twisting the piece of clematis in and around his fingers that lady annes halffrightened anger could not last she and her cousin exchanged glances and smiled at one another  but said she at last trying to draw her pretty brows together into a frown tell me why didst thou seek to climb the wall  i came to seek a ball said myles which i struck over hither from the court beyond  and wouldst thou come into our privy garden for no better reason than to find a ball said the young lady  nay said myles it was not so much to find the ball but in good sooth i did truly strike it harder than need be and so gin i lost the ball i could do no less than come and find it again else our sport is done for the day so it was i came hither  the two young ladies had by now recovered from their fright the lady anne slyly nudged her cousin with her elbow and the younger could not suppress a halfnervous laugh myles heard it and felt his face grow hotter and redder than ever  nay said lady anne i do believe master giles  my name best myles corrected myles  very well then master myles i say i do believe that thou meanest no harm in coming hither netheless it was ill of thee so to do an my father should find thee here he would have thee shrewdly punished for such trespassing dost thou not know that no one is permitted to enter this placeno not even my uncle george one fellow who came hither to steal apples once had his ears shaven close to his head and not more than a year ago one of the cooks men who climbed the wall early one morning was shot by the watchman  aye said myles i knew of him who was shot and it did go somewhat against my stomach to venture knowing what had happed to him netheless an i gat not the ball how were we to play more today at the trap  marry thou art a bold fellow i do believe me said the young lady and sin thou hast come in the face of such peril to get thy ball thou shalt not go away empty whither didst thou strike it  over yonder by the cherrytree said myles jerking his head in that direction an i may go get it i will trouble ye no more as he spoke he made a motion to leave them  stay said the lady anne hastily remain where thou art an thou cross the open some one may haply see thee from the house and will give the alarm and thou wilt be lost i will go get thy ball  and so she left myles and her cousin crossing the little plots of grass and skirting the rosebushes to the cherrytree  when myles found himself alone with lady alice he knew not where to look or what to do but twisted the piece of clematis which he still held in and out more industriously than ever  lady alice watched him with dancing eyes for a little while haply thou wilt spoil that poor vine said she byandby breaking the silence and laughing then turning suddenly serious again didst thou hurt thyself by thy fall  nay said myles looking up such a fall as that was no great matter many and many a time i have had worse  hast thou so said the lady alice thou didst fright me parlously and my coz likewise  myles hesitated for a moment and then blurted out thereat i grieve for thee i would not fright for all the world  the young lady laughed and blushed all the world is a great matter said she  yea said he it is a great matter but it is a greater matter to fright thee and so i would not do it for that and more  the young lady laughed again but she did not say anything further and a space of silence fell so long that byandby she forced herself to say my cousin findeth not the ball presently  nay said myles briefly and then again neither spoke until byandby the lady anne came bringing the ball myles felt a great sense of relief at that coming and yet was somehow sorry then he took the ball and knew enough to bow his acknowledgment in a manner neither ill nor awkward  didst thou hurt thyself asked lady anne  nay said myles giving himself a shake seest thou not i be whole limb and bone nay i have had shrewdly worse falls than that once i fell out of an oaktree down by the river and upon a root and bethought me i did break a rib or more and then one time when i was a boy in crosbeydalethat was where i lived before i came hitheri did catch me hold of the blade of the windmill thinking it was moving slowly and that i would have a ride i th air and so was like to have had a fall ten thousand times worse than this  oh tell us more of that said the lady anne eagerly i did never hear of such an adventure as that come coz and sit down here upon the bench and let us have him tell us all of that happening  now the lads upon the other side of the wall had been whistling furtively for some time not knowing whether myles had broken his neck or had come off scotfree from his fall i would like right well to stay with ye said he irresolutely and would gladly tell ye that and more an ye would have me to do so but hear ye not my friends call me from beyond mayhap they think i break my back and are calling to see whether i be alive or no an i might whistle them answer and toss me this ball to them all would then be well and they would know that i was not hurt and so haply would go away  then answer them said the lady anne and tell us of that thing thou spokest of anonhow thou tookest a ride upon the windmill we young ladies do hear little of such matters not being allowed to talk with lads all that we hear of perils are of knights and ladies and jousting and such like it would pleasure us right well to have thee tell of thy adventures  so myles tossed back the ball and whistled in answer to his friends  then he told the two young ladies not only of his adventure upon the windmill but also of other boyish escapades and told them well with a straightforward smack and vigor for he enjoyed adventure and loved to talk of it in a little while he had regained his ease his shyness and awkwardness left him and nothing remained but the delightful fact that he was really and actually talking to two young ladies and that with just as much ease and infinitely more pleasure than could be had in discourse with his fellowsquires but at last it was time for him to go marry said he with a halfsigh methinks i did never ha so sweet and pleasant a time in all my life before never did i know a real lady to talk with saving only my mother and i do tell ye plain methinks i would rather talk with ye than with any he in christendomsaving perhaps only my friend gascoyne i would i might come hither again  the honest frankness of his speech was irresistible the two girls exchanged glances and then began laughing truly said lady anne who as was said before was some three or four years older than myles thou art a bold lad to ask such a thing how wouldst thou come hither wouldst tumble through our clematis arbor again as thou didst this day  nay said myles i would not do that again but if ye will bid me do so i will find the means to come hither  nay said lady anne i dare not bid thee do such a foolhardy thing nevertheless if thou hast the courage to come  yea said myles eagerly i have the courage  then if thou hast so we will be here in the garden on saturday next at this hour i would like right well to hear more of thy adventures but what didst thou say was thy name i have forgot it again  it is myles falworth  then we shall yclep thee sir myles for thou art a soothly errantknight and stay every knight must have a lady to serve how wouldst thou like my cousin alice here for thy true lady  aye said myles eagerly i would like it right well and then he blushed fiery red at his boldness  i want no errantknight to serve me said the lady alice blushing in answer thou dost ill tease me coz an thou art so free in choosing him a lady to serve thou mayst choose him thyself for thy pains  nay said the lady anne laughing i say thou shalt be his true lady and he shall be thy true knight who knows perchance he may serven thee in some wondrous adventure like as chaucer telleth of but now sir errantknight thou must take thy leave of us and i must een let thee privily out by the posternwicket and if thou wilt take the risk upon thee and come hither again prithee be wary in that coming lest in venturing thou have thine ears clipped in most unknightly fashion  that evening as he and gascoyne sat together on a bench under the trees in the great quadrangle myles told of his adventure of the afternoon and his friend listened with breathless interest  but myles cried gascoyne did the lady anne never once seem proud and unkind  nay said myles only at first when she chid me for falling through the roof of their arbor and to think francis lady anne herself bade me hold the lady alice as my true lady and to serve her in all knightliness then he told his friend that he was going to the privy garden again on the next saturday and that the lady anne had given him permission so to do  gascoyne gave a long wondering whistle and then sat quite still staring into the sky byandby he turned to his friend and said i give thee my pledge myles falworth that never in all my life did i hear of any one that had such marvellous strange happenings befall him as thou   whenever the opportunity occurred for sending a letter to crosbeyholt myles wrote one to his mother and one can guess how they were treasured by the good lady and read over and over again to the blind old lord as he sat staring into darkness with his sightless eyes  about the time of this escapade he wrote a letter telling of those doings wherein after speaking of his misadventure of falling from the wall and of his acquaintance with the young ladies he went on to speak of the matter in which he repeated his visits the letter was worded in the english of that daythe quaint and crabbed language in which chaucer wrote perhaps few boys could read it nowadays so modernizing it somewhat it ran thus  and now to let ye weet that thing that followed that happening that made me acquaint with they two young damoiselles i take me to the south wall of that garden one day four and twenty great spikes which peter smith did forge for me and for which i pay him fivepence and that all the money that i had left of my halfyears wage and wot not where i may get more at these present withouten i do betake me to sir james who as i did tell ye hath consented to hold those moneys that prior edward gave me till i need them  now these same spikes i say i take me them down behind the corner of the wall and there drave them betwixt the stones my very dear comrade and true friend gascoyne holping me thereto to do and so come saturday i climb me over the wall and to the roof of the toolhouse below seeking a fitting opportunity when i might so do without being in too great jeopardy  yea and who should be there but they two ladies biding my coming who seeing me made as though they had expected me not and gave me greatest rebuke for adventuring so moughtily yet methinks were they right well pleasured that i should so aventure which indeed i might not otherwise do seeing as i have telled to thee that one of them is mine own true lady for to serven and so was the only way that i might come to speech with her  such was myless own quaint way of telling how he accomplished his aim of visiting the forbidden garden and no doubt the smack of adventure and the savor of danger in the undertaking recommended him not a little to the favor of the young ladies  after this first acquaintance perhaps a month passed during which myles had climbed the wall some half a dozen times for the lady anne would not permit of too frequent visits and during which the first acquaintance of the three ripened rapidly to an honest pleasant friendship more than once myles when in lord georges train caught a covert smile or half nod from one or both of the girls not a little delightful in its very secret friendliness    chapter 19  as was said perhaps a month passed then myless visits came to an abrupt termination and with it ended in a certain sense a chapter of his life  one saturday afternoon he climbed the garden wall and skirting behind a long row of rosebushes that screened him from the countesss terrace came to a little summerhouse where the two young ladies had appointed to meet him that day  a pleasant halfhour or so was passed and then it was time for myles to go he lingered for a while before he took his final leave leaning against the doorpost and laughingly telling how he and some of his brother squires had made a figure of straw dressed in mens clothes and had played a trick with it one night upon a watchman against whom they bore a grudge  the young ladies were listening with laughing faces when suddenly as myles looked he saw the smile vanish from lady alices eyes and a wide terror take its place she gave a halfarticulate cry and rose abruptly from the bench upon which she was sitting  myles turned sharply and then his very heart seemed to stand still within him for there standing in the broad sunlight without and glaring in upon the party with baleful eyes was the earl of mackworth himself  how long was the breathless silence that followed myles could never tell he knew that the lady anne had also risen and that she and her cousin were standing as still as statues presently the earl pointed to the house with his staff and myles noted stupidly how it trembled in his hand  ye wenches said he at last in a hard harsh voiceye wenches what meaneth this would ye deceive me so and hold parlance thus secretly with this fellow i will settle with him anon meantime get ye straightway to the house and to your rooms and there abide until i give ye leave to come forth again go i say  father said lady anne in a breathless voiceshe was as white as death and moistened her lips with her tongue before she spokefather thou wilt not do harm to this young man spare him i do beseech thee for truly it was i who bade him come hither i know that he would not have come but at our bidding  the earl stamped his foot upon the gravel did ye not hear me said he still pointing towards the house with his trembling staff i bade ye go to your rooms i will settle with this fellow i say as i deem fitting  father began lady anne again but the earl made such a savage gesture that poor lady alice uttered a faint shriek and lady anne stopped abruptly trembling then she turned and passed out the farther door of the summerhouse poor little lady alice following holding her tight by the skirts and trembling and shuddering as though with a fit of the ague  the earl stood looking grimly after them from under his shaggy eyebrows until they passed away behind the yewtrees appeared again upon the terrace behind entered the open doors of the womens house and were gone myles heard their footsteps growing fainter and fainter but he never raised his eyes upon the ground at his feet were four pebbles and he noticed how they almost made a square and would do so if he pushed one of them with his toe and then it seemed strange to him that he should think of such a little foolish thing at that dreadful time  he knew that the earl was looking gloomily at him and that his face must be very pale suddenly lord mackworth spoke what hast thou to say said he harshly  then myles raised his eyes and the earl smiled grimly as he looked his victim over i have naught to say said the lad huskily  didst thou not hear what my daughter spake but now said the earl she said that thou came not of thy own freewill what sayst thou to that sirrahis it true  myles hesitated for a moment or two his throat was tight and dry nay said he at last she belieth herself it was i who first came into the garden i fell by chance from the tree yonderi was seeking a ballthen i asked those two if i might not come hither again and so have done some several times in all but as for hernay it was not at her bidding that i came but through mine own asking  the earl gave a little grunt in his throat and how often hast thou been here said he presently  myles thought a moment or two this maketh the seventh time said he  another pause of silence followed and myles began to pluck up some heart that maybe all would yet be well the earls next speech dashed that hope into a thousand fragments well thou knowest said he that it is forbid for any to come here well thou knowest that twice have men been punished for this thing that thou hast done and yet thou camest in spite of all now dost thou know what thou wilt suffer  myles picked with nervous fingers at a crack in the oaken post against which he leaned mayhap thou wilt kill me said he at last in a dull choking voice  again the earl smiled a grim smile nay said he i would not slay thee for thou hast gentle blood but what sayest thou should i shear thine ears from thine head or perchance have thee scourged in the great court  the sting of the words sent the blood flying back to myless face again and he looked quickly up nay said he with a boldness that surprised himself thou shalt do no such unlordly thing upon me as that i be thy peer sir in blood and though thou mayst kill me thou hast no right to shame me  lord mackworth bowed with a mocking courtesy marry said he methought it was one of mine own saucy popinjay squires that i caught sneaking here and talking to those two foolish young lasses and lo it is a young lordor mayhap thou art a young princeand commandeth me that i shall not do this and i shall not do that i crave your lordships honorable pardon if i have said aught that may have galled you  the fear myles had felt was now beginning to dissolve in rising wrath nay said he stoutly i be no lord and i be no prince but i be as good as thou for am i not the son of thy onetime very true comrade and thy kinsmanto wit the lord falworth whom as thou knowest is poor and broken and blind and helpless and outlawed and banned yet cried he grinding his teeth as the thought of it all rushed in upon him i would rather be in his place than in yours for though he be ruined you  he had just sense enough to stop there  the earl gripping his staff behind his back and with his head a little bent was looking keenly at the lad from under his shaggy gray brows well said he as myles stopped thou hast gone too far now to draw back say thy say to the end why wouldst thou rather be in thy fathers stead than in mine  myles did not answer  thou shalt finish thy speech or else show thyself a coward though thy father is ruined thou didst say i amwhat  myles keyed himself up to the effort and then blurted out thou art attainted with shame  a long breathless silence followed  myles falworth said the earl at last and even in the whirling of his wits myles wondered that he had the name so patmyles falworth of all the bold mad harebrained fools thou art the most foolish how dost thou dare say such words to me dost thou not know that thou makest thy coming punishment ten times more bitter by such a speech  aye cried myles desperately but what else could i do an i did not say the words thou callest me coward and coward i am not  by r lady said the earl i do believe thee thou art a bold impudent varlet as ever livedto beard me so forsooth harkee thou sayst i think naught of mine old comrade i will show thee that thou dost belie me i will suffer what thou hast said to me for his sake and for his sake will forgive thee thy coming hitherwhich i would not do in another case to any other man now get thee gone straightway and come hither no more yonder is the posterngate mayhap thou knowest the way but stay how camest thou hither  myles told him of the spikes he had driven in the wall and the earl listened stroking his beard when the lad had ended he fixed a sharp look upon him but thou drove not those spikes alone said he who helped thee do it  that i may not tell said myles firmly  so be it said the earl i will not ask thee to tell his name now get thee gone and as for those spikes thou mayst een knock them out of the wall sin thou drave them in play no more pranks an thou wouldst keep thy skin whole and now go i say  myles needed no further bidding but turned and left the earl without another word as he went out the posterngate he looked over his shoulder and saw the tall figure in its long furtrimmed gown still standing in the middle of the path looking after him from under the shaggy eyebrows  as he ran across the quadrangle his heart still fluttering in his breast he muttered to himself the old grizzlebeard an i had not faced him a bold front mayhap he would have put such shame upon me as he said i wonder why he stood so staring after me as i left the garden  then for the time the matter slipped from his mind saving only that part that smacked of adventure    chapter 20  so for a little while myles was disposed to congratulate himself upon having come off so well from his adventure with the earl but after a day or two had passed and he had time for second thought he began to misdoubt whether after all he might not have carried it with a better air if he had shown more chivalrous boldness in the presence of his true lady whether it would not have redounded more to his credit if he had in some way asserted his rights as the young dames knighterrant and defender was it not ignominious to resign his rights and privileges so easily and tamely at a signal from the earl  for in sooth said he to gascoyne as the two talked the matter over she hath in a certain way accepted me for her knight and yet i stood me there without saying so much as one single word in her behalf  nay said gascoyne i would not trouble me on that score methinks that thou didst come off wondrous well out of the business i would not have thought it possible that my lord could ha been so patient with thee as he showed himself methinks forsooth he must hold thee privily in right high esteem  truly said myles after a little pause of meditative silence i know not of any esteem yet i do think he was passing patient with me in this matter but netheless francis that changeth not my stand in the case yea i did shamefully so to resign my lady without speaking one word nor will i so resign her even yet i have bethought me much of this matter of late francis and now i come to thee to help me from my evil case i would have thee act the part of a true friend to melike that one i have told thee of in the story of the emperor justinian i would have thee when next thou servest in the house to so contrive that my lady alice shall get a letter which i shall presently write and wherein i may set all that is crooked straight again  heaven forbid said gascoyne hastily that i should be such a fool as to burn my fingers in drawing thy nuts from the fire deliver thy letter thyself good fellow  so spoke gascoyne yet after all he ended as he usually did by yielding to myless superior will and persistence so the letter was written and one day the goodnatured gascoyne carried it with him to the house and the opportunity offering gave it to one of the young ladies attendant upon the countesss familya lass with whom he had friendly intimacyto be delivered to lady alice  but if myles congratulated himself upon the success of this new adventure it was not for long that night as the crowd of pages and squires were making themselves ready for bed the call came through the uproar for myles falworth myles falworth  here i be cried myles standing up on his cot who calleth me  it was the groom of the earls bedchamber and seeing myles standing thus raised above the others he came walking down the length of the room towards him the wonted hubbub gradually silencing as he advanced and the youngsters turning staring and wondering  my lord would speak with thee myles falworth said the groom when he had come close enough to where myles stood busk thee and make ready he is at livery even now  the grooms words fell upon myles like a blow he stood for a while staring wideeyed my lord speak with me sayst thou he ejaculated at last  aye said the other impatiently get thee ready quickly i must return anon  myless head was in a whirl as he hastily changed his clothes for a better suit gascoyne helping him what could the earl want with him at this hour he knew in his heart what it was the interview could concern nothing but the letter that he had sent to lady alice that day as he followed the groom through the now dark and silent courts and across the corner of the great quadrangle and so to the earls house he tried to brace his failing courage to meet the coming interview nevertheless his heart beat tumultuously as he followed the other down the long corridor lit only by a flaring link set in a wroughtiron bracket then his conductor lifted the arras at the door of the bedchamber whence came the murmuring sound of many voices and holding it aside beckoned him to enter and myles passed within at the first he was conscious of nothing but a crowd of people and of the brightness of many lighted candles then he saw that he stood in a great airy room spread with a woven mat of rushes on three sides the walls were hung with tapestry representing hunting and battle scenes at the farther end where the bed stood the stone wall of the fourth side was covered with cloth of blue embroidered with silver goshawks even now in the ripe springtime of may the room was still chilly and a great fire roared and crackled in the huge gaping mouth of the stone fireplace not far from the blaze were clustered the greater part of those present buzzing in talk now and then swelled by murmuring laughter some of those who knew myles nodded to him and two or three spoke to him as he stood waiting whilst the groom went forward to speak to the earl though what they said and what he answered myles in his bewilderment and trepidation hardly knew  as was said before the livery was the last meal of the day and was taken in bed it was a simple repasta manchette or small loaf of bread of pure white flour a loaf of household bread sometimes a lump of cheese and either a great flagon of ale or of sweet wine warm and spiced the earl was sitting upright in bed dressed in a furred dressinggown and propped up by two cylindrical bolsters of crimson satin upon the coverlet and spread over his knees was a large wide napkin of linen fringed with silver thread and on it rested a silver tray containing the bread and some cheese two pages and three gentlemen were waiting upon him and mad noll the jester stood at the head of the bed now and then jingling his bawble and passing some quaint jest upon the chance of making his master smile upon a table near by were some dozen or so waxen tapers struck upon as many spiked candlesticks of silvergilt and illuminating that end of the room with their bright twinkling flames one of the gentlemen was in the act of serving the earl with a goblet of wine poured from a silver ewer by one of the squires as the groom of the chamber came forward and spoke the earl taking the goblet turned his head and as myles looked their eyes met then the earl turned away again and raised the cup to his lips while myles felt his heart beat more rapidly than ever  but at last the meal was ended and the earl washed his hands and his mouth and his beard from a silver basin of scented water held by another one of the squires then leaning back against the pillows he beckoned to myles  in answer myles walked forward the length of the room conscious that all eyes were fixed upon him the earl said something and those who stood near drew back as he came forward then myles found himself standing beside the bed looking down upon the quilted counterpane feeling that the other was gazing fixedly at him  i sent for thee said the earl at last still looking steadily at him because this afternoon came a letter to my hand which thou hadst written to my niece the lady alice i have it here said he thrusting his hand under the bolster and have just now finished reading it then after a moments pause whilst he opened the parchment and scanned it again i find no matter of harm in it but hereafter write no more such he spoke entirely without anger and myles looked up in wonder here take it said the earl folding the letter and tossing it to myles who instinctively caught it and henceforth trouble thou my niece no more either by letter or any other way i thought haply thou wouldst be at some such saucy trick and i made alice promise to let me know when it happed now i say let this be an end of the matter dost thou not know thou mayst injure her by such witless folly as that of meeting her privily and privily writing to her  i meant no harm said myles  i believe thee said the earl that will do now thou mayst go  myles hesitated  what wouldst thou say said lord mackworth  only this said myles an i have thy leave so to do that the lady alice hath chosen me to be her knight and so whether i may see her or speak with her or no the laws of chivalry give me who am gentle born the right to serve her as a true knight may  as a true fool may said the earl dryly why how now thou art not a knight yet nor anything but a raw lump of a boy what rights do the laws of chivalry give thee sirrah thou art a fool  had the earl been ever so angry his words would have been less bitter to myles than his cool unmoved patience it mortified his pride and galled it to the quick  i know that thou dost hold me in contempt he mumbled  out upon thee said the earl testily thou dost tease me beyond patience i hold thee in contempt forsooth why look thee hadst thou been other than thou art i would have had thee whipped out of my house long since thinkest thou i would have borne so patiently with another one of ye squires had such an one held secret meeting with my daughter and niece and tampered as thou hast done with my household sending through one of my people that letter go to thou art a fool myles falworth  myles stood staring at the earl without making an effort to speak the words that he had heard suddenly flashed as it were a new light into his mind in that flash he fully recognized and for the first time the strange and wonderful forbearance the great earl had shown to him a poor obscure boy what did it mean was lord mackworth his secret friend after all as gascoyne had more than once asserted so myles stood silent thinking many things  meantime the other lay back upon the cylindrical bolsters looking thoughtfully at him how old art thou said he at last  seventeen last april answered myles  then thou art old enough to have some of the thoughts of a man and to lay aside those of a boy haply thou hast had foolish things in thy head this short time past it is time that thou put them away harkee sirrah the lady alice is a great heiress in her own right and mayst command the best alliance in englandan earla duke she groweth apace to a woman and then her kind lieth in courts and great houses as for thee thou art but a poor lad penniless and without friends to aid thee to open advancement thy father is attainted and one whisper of where he lieth hid would bring him thence to the tower and haply to the block besides that he hath an enemy as sir james lee hath already told theean enemy perhaps more great and powerful than myself that enemy watcheth for thy father and for thee shouldst thou dare raise thy head or thy fortune ever so little he would haply crop them both and that parlously quick myles falworth how dost thou dare to lift thine eyes to the lady alice de mowbray  poor myles stood silent and motionless sir said he at last in a dry choking voice thou art right and i have been a fool sir i will never raise mine eyes to look upon the lady alice more  i say not that either boy said the earl but ere thou dost so dare thou must first place thyself and thy family whence ye fell till then as thou art an honest man trouble her not now get thee gone  as myles crossed the dark and silent courtyards and looked up at the clear still twinkle of the stars he felt a kind of dull wonder that they and the night and the world should seem so much the same and he be so different  the first stroke had been given that was to break in pieces his boyhood lifethe second was soon to follow    chapter 21  there are now and then times in the life of every one when new and strange things occur with such rapidity that one has hardly time to catch ones breath between the happenings it is as though the old were crumbling awaybreaking in piecesto give place to the new that is soon to take its place  so it was with myles falworth about this time the very next day after this interview in the bedchamber word came to him that sir james lee wished to speak with him in the office he found the lean grizzled old knight alone sitting at the heavy oaken table with a tankard of spiced ale at his elbow and a dish of wafers and some fragments of cheese on a pewter platter before him he pointed to his clerks seata joint stool somewhat like a campchair but made of heavy oaken braces and with a seat of hogskinand bade myles be seated  it was the first time that myles had ever heard of such courtesy being extended to one of the company of squires and much wondering he obeyed the invitation or rather command and took the seat  the old knight sat regarding him for a while in silence his one eye as bright and as steady as that of a hawk looking keenly from under the penthouse of its bushy brows the while he slowly twirled and twisted his bristling wiry mustaches as was his wont when in meditation at last he broke the silence how old art thou said he abruptly  i be turned seventeen last april myles answered as he had the evening before to lord mackworth  humph said sir james thou best big of bone and frame for thine age i would that thy heart were more that of a man likewise and less that of a giddy harebrained boy thinking continually of naught but mischief  again he fell silent and myles sat quite still wondering if it was on account of any special one of his latest escapades that he had been summoned to the officethe breaking of the window in the long hall by the stone he had flung at the rook or the climbing of the south tower for the jackdaws nest  thou hast a friend said sir james suddenly breaking into his speculations of such a kind that few in this world possess almost ever since thou hast been here he hath been watching over thee canst thou guess of whom i speak  haply it is lord george beaumont said myles he hath always been passing kind to me  nay said sir james it is not of him that i speak though methinks he liketh thee well enow canst thou keep a secret boy he asked suddenly  yea answered myles  and wilt thou do so in this case if i tell thee who it is that is thy best friend here  yea  then it is my lord who is that friendthe earl himself but see that thou breathe not a word of it  myles sat staring at the old knight in utter and profound amazement and presently sir james continued yea almost ever since thou hast come here my lord hath kept oversight upon all thy doings upon all thy mad pranks and thy quarrels and thy fights thy goings out and comings in what thinkest thou of that myles falworth  again the old knight stopped and regarded the lad who sat silent finding no words to answer he seemed to find a grim pleasure in the youngsters bewilderment and wonder then a sudden thought came to myles  sir said he did my lord know that i went to the privy garden as i did  nay said sir james of that he knew naught at first until thy father bade thy mother write and tell him  my father ejaculated myles  aye said sir james twisting his mustaches more vigorously than ever so soon as thy father heard of that prank he wrote straightway to my lord that he should put a stop to what might in time have bred mischief  sir said myles in an almost breathless voice i know not how to believe all these things or whether i be awake or adreaming  thou best surely enough awake answered the old man but there are other matters yet to be told my lord thinketh as others of us dolord george and myselfthat it is now time for thee to put away thy boyish follies and learn those things appertaining to manhood thou hast been here a year now and hast had freedom to do as thou might list but boyand the old warrior spoke seriously almost solemnlyupon thee doth rest matters of such great import that did i tell them to thee thou couldst not grasp them my lord deems that thou hast mayhap promise beyond the common of men netheless it remaineth yet to be seen an he be right it is yet to test whether that promise may be fulfilled next monday i and sir everard willoughby take thee in hand to begin training thee in the knowledge and the use of the jousting lance of arms and of horsemanship thou art to go to ralph smith and have him fit a suit of plain armor to thee which he hath been charged to make for thee against this time so get thee gone think well over all these matters and prepare thyself by next monday but stay sirrah he added as myles dazed and bewildered turned to obey breathe to no living soul what i ha told theethat my lord is thy friendneither speak of anything concerning him such is his own heavy command laid upon thee  then myles turned again without a word to leave the room but as he reached the door sir james stopped him a second time  stay he called i had nigh missed telling thee somewhat else my lord hath made thee a present this morning that thou wottest not of it isthen he stopped for a few moments perhaps to enjoy the full flavor of what he had to sayit is a great flemish horse of true breed and right mettle a horse such as a knight of the noblest strain might be proud to call his own myles falworth thou wert born upon a lucky day  sir cried myles and then stopped short then sir he cried again didst thou say itthe horsewas to be mine  aye it is to be thine  my very own  thy very own  how myles falworth left that place he never knew he was like one in some strange some wonderful dream he walked upon air and his heart was so full of joy and wonder and amazement that it thrilled almost to agony of course his first thought was of gascoyne how he ever found him he never could tell but find him he did  come francis he cried i have that to tell thee so marvellous that had it come upon me from paradise it could not be more strange  then he dragged him away to their eyryit had been many a long day since they had been thereand to all his friends speeches to all his wondering questions he answered never a word until they had climbed the stairs and so come to their old haunt then he spoke  sit thee down francis said he till i tell thee that which passeth wonder as gascoyne obeyed he himself stood looking about him this is the last time i shall ever come hither said he and thereupon he poured out his heart to his listening friend in the murmuring solitude of the airy height he did not speak of the earl but of the wonderful new life that had thus suddenly opened before him with its golden future of limitless hopes of dazzling possibilities of heroic ambitions he told everything walking up and down the whilefor he could not remain quiethis cheeks glowing and his eyes sparkling  gascoyne sat quite still staring straight before him he knew that his friend was ruffling eagle pinions for a flight in which he could never hope to follow and somehow his heart ached for he knew that this must be the beginning of the end of the dear delightful friendship of the year past    chapter 22  and so ended myles falworths boyhood three years followed during which he passed through that state which immediately follows boyhood in all mens livesa time when they are neither lads nor grown men but youths passing from the one to the other period through what is often an uncouth and uncomfortable age  he had fancied when he talked with gascoyne in the eyry that time that he was to become a man all at once he felt just then that he had forever done with boyish things but that is not the way it happens in mens lives changes do not come so suddenly and swiftly as that but by little and little for three or four days maybe he went his new way of life big with the great change that had come upon him and then now in this and now in that he drifted back very much into his old ways of boyish doings as was said ones young days do not end all at once even when they be so suddenly and sharply shaken and myles was not different from others he had been stirred to the core by that first wonderful sight of the great and glorious life of manhood opening before him but he had yet many a sport to enjoy many a game to play many a boisterous romp to riot in the dormitory many an expedition to make to copse and spinney and river on days when he was off duty and when permission had been granted  nevertheless there was a great and vital change in his life a change which he hardly felt or realized even in resuming his old life there was no longer the same vitality the same zest the same enjoyment in all these things it seemed as though they were no longer a part of himself the savor had gone from them and byandby it was pleasanter to sit looking on at the sports and the games of the younger lads than to take active part in them  these three years of his life that had thus passed had been very full full mostly of work grinding and monotonous of training dull dry laborious for sir james lee was a taskmaster as hard as iron and seemingly as cold as a stone for two perhaps for three weeks myles entered into his new exercises with all the enthusiasm that novelty brings but these exercises hardly varied a tittle from day to day and soon became a duty and finally a hard and grinding task he used in the earlier days of his castle life to hate the dull monotony of the triweekly hacking at the pels with a heavy broadsword as he hated nothing else but now though he still had that exercise to perform it was almost a relief from the heavy dulness of riding riding riding in the tiltyard with shield and lancecouchrecoveren passant  but though he had nowadays but little time for boyish plays and escapades his life was not altogether without relaxation now and then he was permitted to drive in mock battle with other of the younger knights and bachelors in the paddock near the outer walls it was a still more welcome change in the routine of his life when occasionally he would break a light lance in the tiltingcourt with sir everard willoughby lord george perhaps and maybe one or two others of the hall folk looking on  then one gilded day when lord dudleigh was visiting at devlen myles ran a course with a heavier lance in the presence of the earl who came down to the tiltyard with his guest to see the young novitiate ride against sir everard he did his best and did it well lord dudleigh praised his poise and carriage and lord george who was present gave him an approving smile and nod but the earl of mackworth only sat stroking his beard impassively as was his custom myles would have given much to know his thoughts  in all these years sir james lee almost never gave any expression either of approbation or disapprovalexcepting when myles exhibited some carelessness or oversight then his words were sharp and harsh enough more than once myless heart failed him and bitter discouragement took possession of him then nothing but his bulldog tenacity and stubbornness brought him out from the despondency of the dark hours  sir he burst out one day when his heart was heavy with some failure tell me i beseech thee do i get me any of skill at all is it in me ever to make a worthy knight fit to hold lance and sword with other men or am i only soothly a dull heavy block worth naught of any good  thou art a fool sirrah answered sir james in his grimmest tones thinkest thou to learn all of knightly prowess in a year and a half wait until thou art ripe and then i will tell thee if thou art fit to couch a lance or ride a course with a right knight  thou art an old bear muttered myles to himself as the old oneeyed knight turned on his heel and strode away beshrew me an i show thee not that i am as worthy to couch a lance as thou one of these fine days  however during the last of the three years the grinding routine of his training had not been quite so severe as at first his exercises took him more often out into the fields and it was during this time of his knightly education that he sometimes rode against some of the castle knights in friendly battle with sword or lance or wooden mace in these encounters he always held his own and held it more than well though in his boyish simplicity he was altogether unconscious of his own skill address and strength perhaps it was his very honest modesty that made him so popular and so heartily liked by all  he had by this time risen to the place of head squire or chief bachelor holding the same position that walter blunt had occupied when he himself had first come a raw country boy to devlen the lesser squires and pages fairly worshipped him as a hero albeit imposing upon his goodnature all took a pride in his practice in knightly exercises and fabulous tales were current among the young fry concerning his strength and skill  yet although myles was now at the head of his class he did not as other chief bachelors had done take a leading position among the squires in the earls household service lord mackworth for his own good reasons relegated him to the position of lord georges especial attendant nevertheless the earl always distinguished him from the other esquires giving him a cool nod whenever they met and myles upon his partnow that he had learned better to appreciate how much his lord had done for himwould have shed the last drop of blood in his veins for the head of the house of beaumont  as for the two young ladies he often saw them and sometimes even in the presence of the earl exchanged a few words with them and lord mackworth neither forbade it nor seemed to notice it  towards the lady anne he felt the steady friendly regard of a lad for a girl older than himself towards the lady alice now budding into ripe young womanhood there lay deep in his heart the resolve to be some day her true knight in earnest as he had been her knight in pretence in that time of boyhood when he had so perilously climbed into the privy garden  in body and form he was now a man and in thought and heart was quickly ripening to manhood for as was said before men matured quickly in those days he was a right comely youth for the promise of his boyish body had been fulfilled in a tall powerful wellknit frame his face was still round and boyish but on cheek and chin and lip was the curl of adolescent beardsoft yellow and silky his eyes were as blue as steel and quick and sharp in glance as those of a hawk and as he walked his arms swung from his broad square shoulders and his body swayed with pentup strength ready for action at any moment  if little lady alice hearing much talk of his doings and of his promise in these latter times thought of him now and then it is a matter not altogether to be wondered at  such were the changes that three years had wrought and from now the story of his manhood really begins   perhaps in all the history of devlen castle even at this the high tide of pride and greatness of the house of beaumont the most notable time was in the early autumn of the year 1411 when for five days king henry iv was entertained by the earl of mackworth the king was at that time making a progress through certain of the midland counties and with him travelled the comte de vermoise the count was the secret emissary of the dauphins faction in france at that time in the very bitterest intensity of the struggle with the duke of burgundy and had come to england seeking aid for his master in his quarrel  it was not the first time that royalty had visited devlen once in earl roberts day king edward ii had spent a week at the castle during the period of the scottish wars but at that time it was little else than a military post and was used by the king as such now the beaumonts were in the very flower of their prosperity and preparations were made for the coming visit of royalty upon a scale of such magnificence and splendor as earl robert or perhaps even king edward himself had never dreamed  for weeks the whole castle had been alive with folk hurrying hither and thither and with the daily and almost hourly coming of packhorses laden with bales and boxes from london from morning to night one heard the ceaseless chipchipping of the masons hammers and saw carriers of stones and mortar ascending and descending the ladders of the scaffolding that covered the face of the great north hall within that part of the building was alive with the scraping of the carpenters saws the clattering of lumber and the rapping and banging of hammers  the north hall had been assigned as the lodging place for the king and his court and st georges hall as the older building adjoining it was called had been set apart as the lodging of the comte de vermoise and the knights and gentlemen attendant upon him  the great north hall had been very much altered and changed for the accommodation of the king and his people a beautiful gallery of carved woodwork had been built within and across the south end of the room for the use of the ladies who were to look down upon the ceremonies below two additional windows had been cut through the wall and glazed and passageways had been opened connecting with the royal apartments beyond in the bedchamber a bed of carved wood and silver had been built into the wall and had been draped with hangings of pale blue and silver and a magnificent screen of wroughtiron and carved wood had been erected around the couch rich and beautiful tapestries brought from italy and flanders were hung upon the walls cushions of velvets and silks stuffed with down covered benches and chairs the floor of the hall was spread with mats of rushes stained in various colors woven into curious patterns and in the smaller rooms precious carpets of arras were laid on the cold stones  all of the cadets of the house had been assembled all of the gentlemen in waiting retainers and clients the castle seemed full to overflowing even the dormitory of the squires was used as a lodging place for many of the lesser gentry  so at last in the midst of all this bustle of preparation came the day of days when the king was to arrive the day before a courier had come bringing the news that he was lodging at donaster abbey overnight and would make progress the next day to devlen  that morning as myles was marshalling the pages and squires and with the list of names in his hand was striving to evolve some order out of the confusion assigning the various individuals their special dutiesthese to attend in the household those to ride in the escortone of the gentlemen of lord georges household came with an order for him to come immediately to the young noblemans apartments myles hastily turned over his duties to gascoyne and wilkes and then hurried after the messenger he found lord george in the antechamber three gentlemen squires arming him in a magnificent suit of ribbed milan  he greeted myles with a nod and a smile as the lad entered sirrah said he i have had a talk with mackworth this morn concerning thee and have a mind to do thee an honor in my poor way how wouldst thou like to ride today as my special squire of escort  myles flushed to the roots of his hair oh sir he cried eagerly an i be not too ungainly for thy purpose no honor in all the world could be such joy to me as that  lord george laughed a little matter pleases thee hugely said he but as to being ungainly who so sayeth that of thee belieth thee myles thou art not ungainly sirrah but that is not to the point i have chosen thee for my equerry today so make thou haste and don thine armor and then come hither again and hollingwood will fit thee with a wreathed bascinet i have within and a juppon embroidered with my arms and colors  when myles had made his bow and left his patron he flew across the quadrangle and burst into the armory upon gascoyne whom he found still lingering there chatting with one or two of the older bachelors  what thinkest thou francis he cried wild with excitement an honor hath been done me this day i could never have hoped to enjoy out of all this household lord george hath chose me his equerry for the day to ride to meet the king come hasten to help me to arm art thou not glad of this thing for my sake francis  aye glad am i indeed cried gascoyne that generous friend rather almost would i have this befall thee than myself and indeed he was hardly less jubilant than myles over the honor  five minutes later he was busy arming him in the little room at the end of the dormitory which had been lately set apart for the use of the head bachelor and to think he said looking up as he kneeled strapping the thighplates to his friends legs that he should have chosen thee before all others of the fine knights and lords and gentlemen of quality that are here  yea said myles it passeth wonder i know not why he should so single me out for such an honor it is strangely marvellous  nay said gascoyne there is no marvel in it and i know right well why he chooseth thee it is because he sees as we all see that thou art the stoutest and the bestskilled in arms and most easy of carriage of any man in all this place  myles laughed an thou make sport of me said he ill rap thy head with this dagger hilt thou art a silly fellow francis to talk so but tell me hast thou heard who rides with my lord  yea i heard wilkes say anon that it was sir james lee  i am right glad of that said myles for then he will show me what to do and how to bear myself it frights me to think what would hap should i make some mistake in my awkwardness methinks lord george would never have me with him more should i do amiss this day  never fear said gascoyne thou wilt not do amiss  and now at last the earl lord george and all their escort were ready then the orders were given to horse the bugle sounded and away they all rode with clashing of iron hoofs and ringing and jingling of armor out into the dewy freshness of the early morning the slant yellow sun of autumn blazing and flaming upon polished helmets and shields and twinkling like sparks of fire upon spear points myless heart thrilled within him for pure joy and he swelled out his sturdy young breast with great draughts of the sweet fresh air that came singing across the sunny hilltops sir james lee who acted as the earls equerry for the day rode at a little distance and there was an almost pathetic contrast between the grim steadfast impassiveness of the tough old warrior and myless passionate exuberance of youth  at the head of the party rode the earl and his brother side by side each clad capapie in a suit of milan armor the cuirass of each covered with a velvet juppon embroidered in silver with the arms and quarterings of the beaumonts the earl wore around his neck an s s collar with a jewelled st george hanging from it and upon his head a vizored bascinet ornamented with a wreath covered with black and yellow velvet and glistening with jewels  lord george as was said before was clad in a beautiful suit of ribbed milan armor it was rimmed with a thin thread of gold and like his brother he wore a bascinet wreathed with black and yellow velvet  behind the two brothers and their equerries rode the rest in their proper orderknights gentlemen esquires menatarmsto the number perhaps of two hundred and fifty spears and lances aslant and banners permons and pencels of black and yellow fluttering in the warm september air  from the castle to the town they rode and then across the bridge and thence clattering up through the stony streets where the folk looked down upon them from the windows above or crowded the fronts of the shops of the tradesmen lusty cheers were shouted for the earl but the great lord rode staring ever straight before him as unmoved as a stone then out of the town they clattered and away in a sweeping cloud of dust across the countryside  it was not until they had reached the windy top of willoughby croft ten miles away that they met the king and his company as the two parties approached to within forty or fifty yards of one another they stopped  as they came to a halt myles observed that a gentleman dressed in a plain bluegray ridinghabit and sitting upon a beautiful white gelding stood a little in advance of the rest of the party and he knew that that must be the king then sir james nodded to myles and leaping from his horse flung the reins to one of the attendants myles did the like and then still following sir jamess lead as he served lord mackworth went forward and held lord georges stirrup while he dismounted the two noblemen quickly removed each his bascinet and myles holding the bridlerein of lord georges horse with his left hand took the helmet in his right resting it upon his hip  then the two brothers walked forward bareheaded the earl a little in advance reaching the king he stopped and then bent his kneestiffly in the armored platesuntil it touched the ground thereupon the king reached him his hand and he rising again took it and set it to his lips  then lord george advancing kneeled as his brother had kneeled and to him also the king gave his hand  myles could hear nothing but he could see that a few words of greeting passed between the three and then the king turning beckoned to a knight who stood just behind him and a little in advance of the others of the troop in answer the knight rode forward the king spoke a few words of introduction and the stranger ceremoniously drawing off his right gauntlet clasped the hand first of the earl and then of lord george myles knew that he must be the great comte de vermoise of whom he had heard so much of late  a few moments of conversation followed and then the king bowed slightly the french nobleman instantly reined back his horse an order was given and then the whole company moved forward the two brothers walking upon either side of the king the earl lightly touching the bridlerein with his bare hand  whilst all this was passing the earl of mackworths company had been drawn up in a double line along the roadside leaving the way open to the other party as the king reached the head of the troop another halt followed while he spoke a few courteous words of greeting to some of the lesser nobles attendant upon the earl whom he knew  in that little time he was within a few paces of myles who stood motionless as a statue holding the bascinet and the bridlerein of lord georges horse  what myles saw was a plain rather stout man with a face fat smooth and waxy with paleblue eyes and baggy in the lids clean shaven except for a mustache and tuft covering lips and chin somehow he felt a deep disappointment he had expected to see something lionlike something regal and after all the great king henry was commonplace fat unwholesomelooking it came to him with a sort of a shock that after all a king was in nowise different from other men  meanwhile the earl and his brother replaced their bascinets and presently the whole party moved forward upon the way to mackworth    chapter 23  that same afternoon the squires quarters were thrown into such a ferment of excitement as had perhaps never before stirred them about one oclock in the afternoon the earl himself and lord george came walking slowly across the armory court wrapped in deep conversation and entered sir james lees office  all the usual hubbub of noise that surrounded the neighborhood of the dormitory and the armory was stilled at their coming and when the two noblemen had entered sir jamess office the lads and young men gathered in knots discussing with an almost awesome interest what that visit might portend  after some time sir james lee came to the door at the head of the long flight of stone steps and whistling beckoned one of the smaller pages to him he gave a short order that sent the little fellow flying on some mission in the course of a few minutes he returned hurrying across the stony court with myles falworth who presently entered sir jamess office it was then and at this sight that the intense halfsuppressed excitement reached its height of feverheat what did it all mean the air was filled with a thousand vague wild rumorsbut the very wildest surmises fell short of the real truth  perhaps myles was somewhat pale when he entered the office certainly his nerves were in a tremor for his heart told him that something very portentous was about to befall him the earl sat at the table and in the seat that sir james lee usually occupied lord george half sat half leaned in the windowplace sir james stood with his back to the empty fireplace and his hands clasped behind him all three were very serious  give thee good den myles falworth said the earl as myles bowed first to him and then to the others and i would have thee prepare thyself for a great happening then continuing directly to the point thou knowest sirrah why we have been training thee so closely these three years gone it is that thou shouldst be able to hold thine own in the world nay not only hold thine own but to show thyself to be a knight of prowess shouldst it come to a battle between thee and thy fathers enemy for there lieth no halfway place for thee and thou must be either great or else nothing well sir the time hath now come for thee to show thy mettle i would rather have chosen that thou hadst labored a twelvemonth longer but now as i said hath come a chance to prove thyself that may never come again sir james tells me that thou art passably ripe in skill thou must now show whether that be so or no hast thou ever heard of the sieur de la montaigne  yea my lord i have heard of him often answered myles it was he who won the prize at the great tourney at rochelle last year  i see that thou hast his fame pat to thy tongues end said the earl he is the chevalier of whom i speak and he is reckoned the best knight of dauphiny that one of which thou spokest was the third great tourney in which he was adjudged the victor i am glad that thou holdest his prowess highly knowest thou that he is in the train of the comte de vermoise  nay said myles flushing i did hear news he was in england but knew not that he was in this place  yea said lord mackworth he is here he paused for a moment then said suddenly tell me myles falworth an thou wert a knight and of rank fit to run a joust with the sieur de la montaigne wouldst thou dare encounter him in the lists  the earls question fell upon myles so suddenly and unexpectedly that for a moment or so he stood staring at the speaker with mouth agape meanwhile the earl sat looking calmly back at him slowly stroking his beard the while  it was sir james lees voice that broke the silence thou heardst thy lord speak said he harshly hast thou no tongue to answer sirrah  be silent lee said lord mackworth quietly let the lad have time to think before he speaketh  the sound of the words aroused myles he advanced to the table and rested his hand upon it my lordmy lord said he i know not what to say ii am amazed and afeard  how how cried sir james lee harshly afeard sayst thou an thou art afeard thou knave thou needst never look upon my face or speak to me more i have done with thee forever an thou art afeard even were the champion a sir alisander  peace peace lee said the earl holding up his hand thou art too hasty the lad shall have his will in this matter and thou and no one shall constrain him methinks also thou dost not understand him speak from thy heart myles why art thou afraid  because said myles i am so young sir i am but a raw boy how should i dare be so hardy as to venture to set lance against such an one as the sieur de la montaigne what would i be but a laughingstock for all the world who would see me so foolish as to venture me against one of such prowess and skill  nay myles said lord george thou thinkest not well enough of thine own skill and prowess thinkest thou we would undertake to set thee against him an we did not think that thou couldst hold thine own fairly well  hold mine own cried myles turning to lord george sir thou dost not meanthou canst not mean that i may hope or dream to hold mine own against the sieur de la montaigne  aye said lord george that was what i did mean  come myles said the earl now tell me wilt thou fight the sieur de la montaigne  yea said myles drawing himself to his full height and throwing out his chest yea and his cheeks and forehead flushed red an thou bid me do so i will fight him  there spake my brave lad cried lord george heartily  i give thee joy myles said the earl reaching him his hand which myles took and kissed and i give thee double joy i have talked with the king concerning thee this morning and he hath consented to knight theeyea to knight thee with all honors of the bathprovided thou wilt match thee against the sieur de la montaigne for the honor of england and mackworth just now the king lieth to sleep for a little while after his dinner have thyself in readiness when he cometh forth and i will have thee presented  then the earl turned to sir james lee and questioned him as to how the bachelors were fitted with clothes myles listened only half hearing the words through the tumbling of his thoughts he had dreamed in his daydreams that some time he might be knighted but that time always seemed very very distant to be knighted now in his boyhood by the king with the honors of the bath and under the patronage of the earl of mackworth to joustto actually joustwith the sieur de la montaigne one of the most famous chevaliers of france no wonder he only half heard the words half heard the earls questions concerning his clothes and the discussion which followed half heard lord george volunteer to array him in fitting garments from his own wardrobe  thou mayst go now said the earl at last turning to him but be thou at georges apartments by two of the clock to be dressed fittingly for the occasion  then myles went out stupefied dazed bewildered he looked around but he did not see gascoyne he said not a word to any of the others in answer to the eager questions poured upon him by his fellowsquires but walked straight away he hardly knew where he went but byandby he found himself in a grassy angle below the end of the south stable a spot overlooking the outer wall and the river beyond he looked around no one was near and he flung himself at length burying his face in his arms how long he lay there he did not know but suddenly some one touched him upon the shoulder and he sprang up quickly it was gascoyne  what is to do myles said his friend anxiously what is all this talk i hear concerning thee up yonder at the armory  oh francis cried myles with a husky choking voice i am to be knightedby the kingby the king himself and ii am to fight the sieur de la montaigne  he reached out his hand and gascoyne took it they stood for a while quite silent and when at last the stillness was broken it was gascoyne who spoke in a choking voice  thou art going to be great myles said he i always knew that it must be so with thee and now the time hath come yea thou wilt be great and live at court amongst noble folk and kings haply presently thou wilt not be with me any more and wilt forget me byandby  nay francis never will i forget thee answered myles pressing his friends hand i will always love thee better than any one in the world saving only my father and my mother  gascoyne shook his head and looked away swallowing at the dry lump in his throat suddenly he turned to myles wilt thou grant me a boon  yea answered myles what is it  that thou wilt choose me for thy squire  nay said myles how canst thou think to serve me as squire thou wilt be a knight thyself some day francis and why dost thou wish now to be my squire  because said gascoyne with a short laugh i would rather be in thy company as a squire than in mine own as a knight even if i might be banneret  myles flung his arm around his friends neck and kissed him upon the cheek thou shalt have thy will said he but whether knight or squire thou art ever mine own true friend  then they went slowly back together hand in hand to the castle world again  at two oclock myles went to lord georges apartments and there his friend and patron dressed him out in a costume better fitted for the ceremony of presentationa furtrimmed jacket of green brocaded velvet embroidered with golden thread a black velvet hoodcap rolled like a turban and with a jewel in the front a pair of crimson hose and a pair of black velvet shoes trimmed and stitched with goldthread myles had never worn such splendid clothes in his life before and he could not but feel that they became him well  sir said he as he looked down at himself sure it is not lawful for me to wear such clothes as these  in those days there was a law known as a sumptuary law which regulated by statute the clothes that each class of people were privileged to wear it was as myles said against the law for him to wear such garments as those in which he was cladeither velvet crimson stuff fur or silver or gold embroiderynevertheless such a solemn ceremony as presentation to the king excused the temporary overstepping of the law and so lord george told him as he laid his hand upon the lads shoulder and held him off at armslength he added and i pledge thee my word myles that thou art as lusty and handsome a lad as ever mine eyes beheld  thou art very kind to me sir said myles in answer  lord george laughed and then giving him a shake let go his shoulder  it was about three oclock when little edmond de montefort lord mackworths favorite page came with word that the king was then walking in the earls pleasance  come myles said lord george and then myles arose from the seat where he had been sitting his heart palpitating and throbbing tumultuously  at the wicketgate of the pleasance two gentlemenatarms stood guard in halfarmor they saluted lord george and permitted him to pass with his protege as he laid his hand upon the latch of the wicket he paused for a moment and turned  myles said he in a low voice thou art a thoughtful and cautious lad for thy fathers sake be thoughtful and cautious now do not speak his name or betray that thou art his son then he opened the wicketgate and entered  any lad of myless age even one far more used to the world than he would perhaps have felt all the oppression that he experienced under the weight of such a presentation he hardly knew what he was doing as lord george led him to where the king stood a little apart from the attendants with the earl and the comte de vermoise even in his confusion he knew enough to kneel and somehow his honest modest diffidence became the young fellow very well he was not awkward for one so healthful in mind and body as he could not bear himself very ill and he felt the assurance that in lord george he had a kind friend at his side and one well used to court ceremonies to lend him countenance then there is something always pleasing in frank modest manliness such as was stamped on myless handsome sturdy face no doubt the kings heart warmed towards the fledgling warrior kneeling in the pathway before him he smiled very kindly as he gave the lad his hand to kiss and that ceremony done held fast to the hard brown sinewy fist of the young man with his soft white hand and raised him to his feet  by the mass said he looking myles over with smiling eyes thou art a right champion in good sooth such as thou art haply was sir galahad when he came to arthurs court and so they tell me thou hast stomach to brook the sieur de la montaigne that tough old boar of dauphiny hast thou in good sooth the courage to face him knowest thou what a great thing it is that thou hast set upon thyselfto do battle even in sport with him  yea your majesty answered myles well i wot it is a task haply beyond me but gladly would i take upon me even a greater venture and one more dangerous to do your majestys pleasure  the king looked pleased now that was right well said young man said he and i like it better that it came from such young and honest lips dost thou speak french  yea your majesty answered myles in some small measure do i so  i am glad of that said the king for so i may make thee acquainted with sieur de la montaigne  he turned as he ended speaking and beckoned to a heavy thickset blackbrowed chevalier who stood with the other gentlemen attendants at a little distance he came instantly forward in answer to the summons and the king introduced the two to one another as each took the other formally by the hand he measured his opponent hastily body and limb and perhaps each thought that he had never seen a stronger stouter betterknit man than the one upon whom he looked but nevertheless the contrast betwixt the two was very greatmyles young boyish freshfaced the other bronzed weather beaten and seamed with a great white scar that ran across his forehead and cheek the one a novice the other a warrior seasoned in twoscore battles  a few polite phrases passed between the two the king listening smiling but with an absent and faraway look gradually stealing upon his face as they ended speaking a little pause of silence followed and then the king suddenly aroused himself  so said he i am glad that ye two are acquainted and now we will leave our youthful champion in thy charge beaumontand in thine mon sieur as welland so soon as the proper ceremonies are ended we will dub him knight with our own hands and now mackworth and thou my lord count let us walk a little i have bethought me further concerning these threescore extra men for dauphiny  then myles withdrew under the charge of lord george and the sieur de la montaigne and while the king and the two nobles walked slowly up and down the gravel path between the tall rosebushes myles stood talking with the gentlemen attendants finding himself with a certain triumphant exultation the peer of any and the hero of the hour  that night was the last that myles and gascoyne spent lodging in the dormitory in their squirehood service the next day they were assigned apartments in lord georges part of the house and thither they transported themselves and their belongings amid the awestruck wonder and admiration of their fellowsquires    chapter 24  in myles falworths day one of the greatest ceremonies of courtly life was that of the bestowal of knighthood by the king with the honors of the bath by far the greater number of knights were at that time created by other knights or by nobles or by officers of the crown to be knighted by the king in person distinguished the recipient for life it was this signal honor that the earl for his own purposes wished myles to enjoy and for this end he had laid not a few plans  the accolade was the term used for the creation of a knight upon the field of battle it was a reward of valor or of meritorious service and was generally bestowed in a more or less offhand way but the ceremony of the bath was an occasion of the greatest courtly moment and it was thus that myles falworth was to be knighted in addition to the honor of a royal belting  a quaint old book treating of knighthood and chivalry gives a full and detailed account of all the circumstances of the ceremony of a creation of a knight of the bath it tells us that the candidate was first placed under the care of two squires of honor grave and well seen in courtship and nurture and also in feats of chivalry which same were likewise to be governors in all things relating to the coming honors  first of all the barber shaved him and cut his hair in a certain peculiar fashion ordained for the occasion the squires of honor supervising the operation this being concluded the candidate was solemnly conducted to the chamber where the bath of tepid water was prepared hung within and without with linen and likewise covered with rich cloths and embroidered linen while in the bath two ancient grave and reverend knights attended the bachelor giving him meet instructions in the order and feats of chivalry the candidate was then examined as to his knowledge and acquirements and then all questions being answered to the satisfaction of his examiners the elder of the two dipped a handful of water out from the bath and poured it upon his head at the same time signing his left shoulder with the sign of the cross  as soon as this ceremony was concluded the two squires of honor helped their charge from the bath and conducted him to a plain bed without hangings where they let him rest until his body was warm and dry then they clad him in a white linen shirt and over it a plain robe of russet girdled about the loins with a rope and having a hood like unto a hermit  as soon as the candidate had arisen the two ancient knights returned and all being in readiness he was escorted to the chapel the two walking one upon either side of him his squires of honor marching before and the whole party preceded by sundry minstrels making a loud noise of music  when they came to the chapel the two knights who escorted him took leave of the candidate each saluting him with a kiss upon the cheek no one remained with him but his squires of honor the priest and the chandler  in the mean time the novitiates armor sword lance and helmet had been laid in readiness before the altar these he watched and guarded while the others slept keeping vigil until sunrise during which time he shall says the ancient authority pass the night in orisons prayers and meditation at daylight he confessed to the priest heard matins and communicated in mass and then presented a lighted candle at the altar with a piece of money stuck in it as close to the flame as could be done the candle being offered to the honor of god and the money to the honor of that person who was to make him a knight  so concluded the sacred ceremony which being ended his squires conducted the candidate to his chamber and there made him comfortable and left him to repose for a while before the second and final part of the ordinance  such is a shortened account of the preparatory stages of the ceremonies through which myles falworth passed  matters had come upon him so suddenly one after the other and had come with such bewildering rapidity that all that week was to him like some strange wonderful mysterious vision he went through it all like one in a dream lord george beaumont was one of his squires of honor the other by way of a fitting complement to the courage of the chivalrous lad was the sieur de la montaigne his opponent soon to be they were well versed in everything relating to knightcraft and myles followed all their directions with passive obedience then sir james lee and the comte de vermoise administered the ceremony of the bath the old knight examining him in the laws of chivalry  it occurs perhaps once or twice in ones lifetime that one passes through great happeningssometimes of joy sometimes of dreadful bitternessin just such a dazed state as myles passed through this it is only afterwards that all comes back to one so sharply and keenly that the heart thrills almost in agony in living it over again but perhaps of all the memory of that time when it afterwards came back piece by piece none was so clear to myless backturned vision as the long night spent in the chapel watching his armor thinking such wonderful thoughts and dreaming such wonderful wideeyed dreams at such times myles saw again the dark mystery of the castle chapel he saw again the halfmoon gleaming white and silvery through the tall narrow window and throwing a broad form of still whiteness across stone floor empty seats and still motionless figures of stone effigies at such times he stood again in front of the twinkling tapers that lit the altar where his armor lay piled in a heap heard again the deep breathing of his companions of the watch sleeping in some empty stall wrapped each in his cloak and saw the old chandler bestir himself and rise and come forward to snuff the candles at such times he saw again the day growing clearer and clearer through the tall glazed windows saw it change to a rosy pink and then to a broad ruddy glow that threw a halo of light around father thomass bald head bowed in sleep and lit up the banners and trophies hanging motionless against the stony face of the west wall heard again the stirring of life without and the sound of his companions arousing themselves saw them come forward and heard them wish him joy that his long watch was ended   it was nearly noon when myles was awakened from a fitful sleep by gascoyne bringing in his dinner but as might be supposed he had but little hunger and ate sparingly he had hardly ended his frugal meal before his two squires of honor came in followed by a servant carrying the garments for the coming ceremony he saluted them gravely and then arising washed his face and hands in a basin which gascoyne held then kneeled in prayer the others standing silent at a little distance as he arose lord george came forward  the king and the company come presently to the great hall myles said he it is needful for thee to make all the haste that thou art able  perhaps never had devlen castle seen a more brilliant and goodly company gathered in the great hall than that which came to witness king henry create myles falworth a knight bachelor  at the upper end of the hall was a raised dais upon which stood a throne covered with crimson satin and embroidered with lions and flowerdeluces it was the kings seat he and his personal attendants had not yet come but the rest of the company were gathered the day being warm and sultry the balcony was all aflutter with the feather fans of the ladies of the family and their attendants who from this high place looked down upon the hall below up the centre of the hall was laid a carpet of arras and the passage was protected by wooden railings upon the one side were tiers of seats for the castle gentlefolks and the guests upon the other stood the burghers from the town clad in sober dun and russet and yeomanry in green and brown the whole of the great vaulted hall was full of the dull hum of many people waiting and a ceaseless restlessness stirred the crowded throng but at last a whisper went around that the king was coming a momentary hush fell and through it was heard the noisy clatter of horses feet coming nearer and nearer and then stopping before the door the sudden blare of trumpets broke through the hush another pause and then in through the great doorway of the hall came the royal procession  first of all marched in the order of their rank and to the number of a score or more certain gentlemen esquires and knights chosen mostly from the kings attendants behind these came two pursuivantsatarms in tabards and following them a party of a dozen more bannerets and barons behind these again a little space intervening came two heralds also in tabards a group of the greater nobles attendant upon the king following in the order of their rank next came the kingatarms and at a little distance and walking with sober slowness the king himself with the earl and the count directly attendant upon himthe one marching upon the right hand and the other upon the left a breathless silence filled the whole space as the royal procession advanced slowly up the hall through the stillness could be heard the muffled sound of the footsteps on the carpet the dry rustling of silk and satin garments and the clear clink and jingle of chains and jewelled ornaments but not the sound of a single voice  after the moment or two of bustle and confusion of the king taking his place had passed another little space of expectant silence fell at last there suddenly came the noise of acclamation of those who stood without the doorcheering and the clapping of handssounds heralding the immediate advent of myles and his attendants the next moment the little party entered the hall  first of all gascoyne bearing myless sword in both hands the hilt resting against his breast the point elevated at an angle of fortyfive degrees it was sheathed in a crimson scabbard and the belt of spanish leather studded with silver bosses was wound crosswise around it from the hilt of the sword dangled the gilt spurs of his coming knighthood at a little distance behind his squire followed myles the centre of all observation he was clad in a novitiate dress arranged under lord georges personal supervision it had been made somewhat differently from the fashion usual at such times and was intended to indicate in a manner the candidates extreme youthfulness and virginity in arms the outer garment was a tabard robe of white wool embroidered at the hem with fine lines of silver and gathered loosely at the waist with a belt of lavender leather stitched with thread of silver beneath he was clad in armor a present from the earl new and polished till it shone with dazzling brightness the breastplate covered with a juppon of white satin embroidered with silver behind myles and upon either hand came his squires of honor sponsors and friendsa little company of some halfdozen in all as they advanced slowly up the great dim highvaulted room the whole multitude broke forth into a humming buzz of applause then a sudden clapping of hands began near the doorway ran down through the length of the room and was taken up by all with noisy clatter  saw i never youth so comely whispered one of the lady annes attendant gentlewomen sure he looketh as sir galahad looked when he came first to king arthurs court  myles knew that he was very pale he felt rather than saw the restless crowd of faces upon either side for his eyes were fixed directly before him upon the dais whereon sat the king with the earl of mackworth standing at his right hand the comte de vermoise upon the left and the others ranged around and behind the throne it was with the same tense feeling of dreamy unreality that myles walked slowly up the length of the hall measuring his steps by those of gascoyne suddenly he felt lord george beaumont touch him lightly upon the arm and almost instinctively he stopped shorthe was standing just before the covered steps of the throne  he saw gascoyne mount to the third step stop short kneel and offer the sword and the spurs he carried to the king who took the weapon and laid it across his knees then the squire bowed low and walking backward withdrew to one side leaving myles standing alone facing the throne the king unlocked the spur chains from the swordhilt and then holding the gilt spurs in his hand for a moment he looked myles straight in the eyes and smiled then he turned and gave one of the spurs to the earl of mackworth  the earl took it with a low bow turned and came slowly down the steps to where myles stood kneeling upon one knee and placing myless foot upon the other lord mackworth set the spur in its place and latched the chain over the instep he drew the sign of the cross upon myless bended knee set the foot back upon the ground rose with slow dignity and bowing to the king drew a little to one side  as soon as the earl had fulfilled his office the king gave the second spur to the comte de vermoise who set it to myless other foot with the same ceremony that the earl had observed withdrawing as he had done to one side  an instant pause of motionless silence followed and then the king slowly arose and began deliberately to unwind the belt from around the scabbard of the sword he held as soon as he stood the earl and the count advanced and taking myles by either hand led him forward and up the steps of the dais to the platform above as they drew a little to one side the king stooped and buckled the swordbelt around myless waist then rising again lifted his hand and struck him upon the shoulder crying in a loud voice  be thou a good knight  instantly a loud sound of applause and the clapping of hands filled the whole hall in the midst of which the king laid both hands upon myless shoulders and kissed him upon the right cheek so the ceremony ended myles was no longer myles falworth but sir myles falworth knight by order of the bath and by grace of the king    chapter 25  it was the custom to conclude the ceremonies of the bestowal of knighthood by a grand feast given in honor of the newlycreated knight but in myless instance the feast was dispensed with the earl of mackworth had planned that myles might be created a knight of the bath with all possible pomp and ceremony that his personality might be most favorably impressed upon the king that he might be so honorably knighted as to make him the peer of any who wore spurs in all england and finally that he might celebrate his new honors by jousting with some knight of high fame and approved valor all these desiderata chance had fulfilled in the visit of the king to devlen  as the earl had said to myles he would rather have waited a little while longer until the lad was riper in years and experience but the opportunity was not to be lost young as he was myles must take his chances against the years and grim experience of the sieur de la montaigne but it was also a part of the earls purpose that the king and myles should not be brought too intimately together just at that time though every particular of circumstance should be fulfilled in the ceremony it would have been ruination to the earls plans to have the knowledge come prematurely to the king that myles was the son of the attainted lord falworth the earl knew that myles was a shrewd coolheaded lad but the king had already hinted that the name was familiar to his ears and a single hasty answer or unguarded speech upon the young knights part might awaken him to a full knowledge such a mishap was of all things to be avoided just then for thanks to the machinations of that enemy of his father of whom myles had heard so much and was soon to hear more the king had always retained and still held a bitter and rancorous enmity against the unfortunate nobleman  it was no very difficult matter for the earl to divert the kings attention from the matter of the feast his majesty was very intent just then upon supplying a quota of troops to the dauphin and the chief object of his visit to devlen was to open negotiations with the earl looking to that end he was interestedmuch interested in myles and in the coming jousting in which the young warrior was to prove himself but he was interested in it by way of a relaxation from the other and more engrossing matter so though he made some passing and half preoccupied inquiry about the feast he was easily satisfied with the earls reasons for not holding it which were that he had arranged a consultation for that morning in regard to the troops for the dauphin to which meeting he had summoned a number of his own more important dependent nobles that the king himself needed repose and the hour or so of rest that his barbersurgeon had ordered him to take after his midday meal that father thomas had laid upon myles a petty penancethat for the first three days of his knighthood he should eat his meals without meat and in his own apartmentand various other reasons equally good and sufficient so the king was satisfied and the feast was dispensed with  the next morning had been set for the jousting and all that day the workmen were busy erecting the lists in the great quadrangle upon which as was said before looked the main buildings of the castle the windows of myless apartment opened directly upon the bustling scenethe carpenters hammering and sawing the upholsterers snipping cutting and tacking myles and gascoyne stood gazing out from the open casement with their arms lying across one anothers shoulders in the old boyhood fashion and myles felt his heart shrink with a sudden tight pang as the realization came sharply and vividly upon him that all these preparations were being made for him and that the next day he should with almost the certainty of death meet either glory or failure under the eyes not only of all the greater and lesser castle folk but of the king himself and noble strangers critically used to deeds of chivalry and prowess perhaps he had never fully realized the magnitude of the reality before in that tight pang at his heart he drew a deep breath almost a sigh gascoyne turned his head abruptly and looked at his friend but he did not ask the cause of the sigh no doubt the same thoughts that were in myless mind were in his also   it was towards the latter part of the afternoon that a message came from the earl bidding myles attend him in his private closet after myles had bowed and kissed his lordships hand the earl motioned him to take a seat telling him that he had some final words to say that might occupy a considerable time he talked to the young man for about half an hour in his quiet measured voice only now and then showing a little agitation by rising and walking up and down the room for a turn or two very many things were disclosed in that talk that had caused myles long hours of brooding thought for the earl spoke freely and without concealment to him concerning his father and the fortunes of the house of falworth  myles had surmised many things but it was not until then that he knew for a certainty who was his fathers malignant and powerful enemythat it was the great earl of alban the rival and bitter enemy of the earl of mackworth it was not until then that he knew that the present earl of alban was the lord brookhurst who had killed sir john dale in the anteroom at falworth castle that morning so long ago in his early childhood it was not until then that he knew all the circumstances of his fathers blindness that he had been overthrown in the melee at the great tournament at york and that that same lord brookhurst had ridden his ironshod warhorse twice over his enemys prostrate body before his squire could draw him from the press and had then and there given him the wound from which he afterwards went blind the earl swore to myles that lord brookhurst had done what he did wilfully and had afterwards boasted of it then with some hesitation he told myles the reason of lord brookhursts enmity and that it had arisen on account of lady falworth whom he had one time sought in marriage and that he had sworn vengeance against the man who had won her  piece by piece the earl of mackworth recounted every circumstance and detail of the revenge that the blind mans enemy had afterwards wreaked upon him he told myles how when his father was attainted of hightreason and his estates forfeited to the crown the king had granted the barony of easterbridge to the then newlycreated earl of alban in spite of all the efforts of lord falworths friends to the contrary that when he himself had come out from an audience with the king with others of his fathers friends the earl of alban had boasted in the anteroom in a loud voice evidently intended for them all to hear that now that he had falworths fat lands he would never rest till he had hunted the blind man out from his hiding and brought his head to the block  ever since then said the earl of mackworth he hath been striving by every means to discover thy fathers place of concealment some time haply he may find it and then  myles had felt for a long time that he was being moulded and shaped and that the earl of mackworths was the hand that was making him what he was growing to be but he had never realized how great were the things expected of him should he pass the first great test and show himself what his friends hoped to see him now he knew that all were looking upon him to act sometime as his fathers champion and when that time should come to challenge the earl of alban to the ordeal of single combat to purge his fathers name of treason to restore him to his rank and to set the house of falworth where it stood before misfortune fell upon it  but it was not alone concerning his and his fathers affairs that the earl of mackworth talked to myles he told him that the earl of alban was the earl of mackworths enemy also that in his younger days he had helped lord falworth who was his kinsman to win his wife and that then lord brookhurst had sworn to compass his ruin as he had sworn to compass the ruin of his friend he told myles how now that lord brookhurst was grown to be earl of alban and great and powerful he was forever plotting against him and showed myles how if lord falworth were discovered and arrested for treason he also would be likely to suffer for aiding and abetting him then it dawned upon myles that the earl looked to him to champion the house of beaumont as well as that of falworth  mayhap said the earl thou didst think that it was all for the pleasant sport of the matter that i have taken upon me this toil and endeavor to have thee knighted with honor that thou mightst fight the dauphiny knight nay nay myles falworth i have not labored so hard for such a small matter as that i have had the king unknown to himself so knight thee that thou mayst be the peer of alban himself and now i would have thee to hold thine own with the sieur de la montaigne to try whether thou best albans match and to approve thyself worthy of the honor of thy knighthood i am sorry netheless he added after a moments pause that this could not have been put off for a while longer for my plans for bringing thee to battle with that vile alban are not yet ripe but such a chance of the king coming hither haps not often and then i am glad of this muchthat a good occasion offers to get thee presently away from england i would have thee out of the kings sight so soon as may be after this jousting he taketh a liking to thee and i fear me lest he should inquire more nearly concerning thee and so all be discovered and spoiled my brother george goeth upon the first of next month to france to take service with the dauphin having under his command a company of tenscore menknights and archers thou shalt go with him and there stay till i send for thee to return  with this the protracted interview concluded the earl charging myles to say nothing further about the french expedition for the presenteven to his friendfor it was as yet a matter of secrecy known only to the king and a few nobles closely concerned in the venture  then myles arose to take his leave he asked and obtained permission for gascoyne to accompany him to france then he paused for a moment or two for it was strongly upon him to speak of a matter that had been lying in his mind all daya matter that he had dreamed of much with open eyes during the long vigil of the night before  the earl looked up inquiringly what is it thou wouldst ask said he  myless heart was beating quickly within him at the thought of his own boldness and as he spoke his cheeks burned like fire sir said he mustering his courage at last haply thou hast forgot it but i have not netheless a long time since when i spoke of serving thethe lady alice as her true knight thou didst wisely laugh at my words and bade me wait first till i had earned my spurs but now sir i have gotten my spurs andand do now crave thy gracious leave that i may serve that lady as her true knight  a space of dead silence fell in which myless heart beat tumultuously within him  i know not what thou meanest said the earl at last in a somewhat constrained voice how wouldst thou serve her what wouldst thou have  i would have only a little matter just now answered myles i would but crave of her a favor for to wear in the morrows battle so that she may know that i hold her for my own true lady and that i may have the courage to fight more boldly having that favor to defend  the earl sat looking at him for a while in brooding silence stroking his beard the while suddenly his brow cleared so be it said he i grant thee my leave to ask the lady alice for a favor and if she is pleased to give it to thee i shall not say thee nay but i set this upon thee as a provision that thou shalt not see her without the lady anne be present thus it was as i remember thou saw her first and with it thou must now be satisfied go thou to the long gallery and thither they will come anon if naught hinder them  myles waited in the long gallery perhaps some fifteen or twenty minutes no one was there but himself it was a part of the castle connecting the earls and the countesss apartments and was used but little during that time he stood looking absently out of the open casement into the stony courtyard beyond trying to put into words that which he had to say wondering with anxiety how soon the young ladies would come wondering whether they would come at all at last the door at the farther end of the gallery opened and turning sharply at the sound he saw the two young ladies enter lady alice leaning upon lady annes arm it was the first time that he had seen them since the ceremony of the morning and as he advanced to meet them the lady anne came frankly forward and gave him her hand which myles raised to his lips  i give thee joy of thy knighthood sir myles said she and do believe in good sooth that if any one deserveth such an honor thou art he  at first little lady alice hung back behind her cousin saying nothing until the lady anne turning suddenly said come coz has thou naught to say to our newmade knight canst thou not also wish him joy of his knighthood  lady alice hesitated a minute then gave myles a timid hand which he with a strange mixture of joy and confusion took as timidly as it was offered he raised the hand and set it lightly and for an instant to his lips as he had done with the lady annes hand but with very different emotions  i give you joy of your knighthood sir said lady alice in a voice so low that myles could hardly hear it  both flushed red and as he raised his head again myles saw that the lady anne had withdrawn to one side then he knew that it was to give him the opportunity to proffer his request  a little space of silence followed the while he strove to key his courage to the saying of that which lay at his mind lady said he at last and then againlady ihave a favor for to ask thee  what is it thou wouldst have sir myles she murmured in reply  lady said he ever sin i first saw thee i have thought that if i might choose of all the world thou only wouldst i choose forfor my true lady to serve as a right knight should here he stopped frightened at his own boldness lady alice stood quite still with her face turned away thouthou art not angered at what i say he said  she shook her head  i have longed and longed for the time said he to ask a boon of thee and now hath that time come lady tomorrow i go to meet a right good knight and one skilled in arms and in jousting as thou dost know yea he is famous in arms and i be nobody netheless i fight for the honor of england and mackworthandand for thy sake ithou art not angered at what i say  again the lady alice shook her head  i would that thoui would that thou would give me some favor for to wearthy veil or thy necklace  he waited anxiously for a little while but lady alice did not answer immediately  i fear me said myles presently that i have in sooth offended thee in asking this thing i know that it is a parlous bold matter for one so raw in chivalry and in courtliness as i am and one so poor in rank to ask thee for thy favor an i ha offended i prithee let it be as though i had not asked it  perhaps it was the young mans timidity that brought a sudden courage to lady alice perhaps it was the graciousness of her gentle breeding that urged her to relieve myless somewhat awkward humility perhaps it was something more than either that lent her bravery to speak even knowing that the lady anne heard all she turned quickly to him nay sir myles she said i am foolish and do wrong thee by my foolishness and silence for truly i am proud to have thee wear my favor she unclasped as she spoke the thin gold chain from about her neck i give thee this chain said she and it will bring me joy to have it honored by thy true knightliness and giving it i do wish thee all success then she bowed her head and turning left him holding the necklace in his hand  her cousin left the window to meet her bowing her head with a smile to myles as she took her cousins arm again and led her away he stood looking after them as they left the room and when they were gone he raised the necklace to his lips with a heart beating tumultuously with a triumphant joy it had never felt before    chapter 26  and now at last had come the day of days for myles falworth the day when he was to put to the test all that he had acquired in the three years of his training the day that was to disclose what promise of future greatness there was in his strong young body and it was a noble day one of those of late september when the air seems sweeter and fresher than at other times the sun bright and as yellow as gold the wind lusty and strong before which the great white clouds go sailing majestically across the bright blueness of the sky above while their dusky shadows skim across the brown face of the rusty earth beneath  as was said before the lists had been set up in the great quadrangle of the castle than which level and smooth as a floor no more fitting place could be chosen the course was of the usual sizesixty paces longand separated along its whole length by a barrier about five feet high upon the west side of the course and about twenty paces distant from it a scaffolding had been built facing towards the east so as to avoid the glare of the afternoon sun in the centre was a raised dais hung round with cloth of blue embroidered with lions rampant upon the dais stood a cushioned throne for the king and upon the steps below ranged in the order of their dignity were seats for the earl his guests the family the ladies knights and gentlemen of the castle in front the scaffolding was covered with the gayest tapestries and brightestcolored hangings that the castle could afford and above particolored pennants and streamers surmounted by the royal ensign of england waved and fluttered in the brisk wind  at either end of the lists stood the pavilions of the knights that of myles was at the southern extremity and was hung by the earls desire with cloth of the beaumont colors black and yellow while a wooden shield bearing three goshawks spread the crest of the house was nailed to the roof and a long streamer of black and yellow trailed out in the wind from the staff above myles partly armed stood at the doorway of the pavilion watching the folk gathering at the scaffolding the ladies of the house were already seated and the ushers were bustling hither and thither assigning the others their places a considerable crowd of common folk and burghers from the town had already gathered at the barriers opposite and as he looked at the restless and growing multitude he felt his heart beat quickly and his flesh grow cold with a nervous trepidationjust such as the lad of today feels when he sees the auditorium filling with friends and strangers who are to listen byandby to the reading of his prize poem  suddenly there came a loud blast of trumpets a great gate at the farther extremity of the lists was thrown open and the king appeared riding upon a white horse preceded by the kingatarms and the heralds attended by the earl and the comte de vermoise and followed by a crowd of attendants just then gascoyne who with wilkes was busied lacing some of the armor plates with new thongs called myles and he turned and entered the pavilion  as the two squires were adjusting these last pieces strapping them in place and tying the thongs lord george and sir james lee entered the pavilion lord george took the young man by the hand and with a pleasant smile wished him success in the coming encounter  sir james seemed anxious and disturbed he said nothing and after gascoyne had placed the open bascinet that supports the tilting helm in its place he came forward and examined the armor piece by piece carefully and critically testing the various straps and leather points and thongs to make sure of their strength  sir said gascoyne who stood by watching him anxiously i do trust that i have done all meetly and well  i see nothing amiss sirrah said the old knight half grudgingly so far as i may know he is ready to mount  just then a messenger entered saying that the king was seated and lord george bade myles make haste to meet the challenger  francis said myles prithee give me my pouch yonder  gascoyne handed him the velvet bag and he opened it and took out the necklace that the lady alice had given him the day before  tie me this around my arm said he he looked down keeping his eyes studiously fixed on gascoynes fingers as they twined the thin golden chain around the iron plates of his right arm knowing that lord georges eyes were upon him and blushing fiery red at the knowledge  sir james was at that moment examining the great tilting helm and lord george watched him smiling amusedly and hast thou then already chosen thee a lady he said presently  aye my lord answered myles simply  marry i trust we be so honored that she is one of our castle folk said the earls brother  for a moment myles did not reply then he looked up my lord said he the favor was given to me by the lady alice  lord george looked grave for the moment then he laughed marry thou art a bold archer to shoot for such high game  myles did not answer and at that moment two grooms led his horse up to the door of the pavilion gascoyne and wilkes helped him to his saddle and then gascoyne holding his horse by the bridlerein he rode slowly across the lists to the little open space in front of the scaffolding and the kings seat just as the sieur de la montaigne approached from the opposite direction  as soon as the two knights champion had reached each his appointed station in front of the scaffolding the marshal bade the speaker read the challenge which unrolling the parchment he began to do in a loud clear voice so that all might hear it was a quaint document wrapped up in the tangled heraldic verbiage of the time  the pith of the matter was that the sieur brian philip francis de la montaigne proclaimed before all men the greater chivalry and skill at arms of the knights of france and of dauphiny and likewise the greater fairness of the ladies of france and dauphiny and would there defend those sayings with his body without fear or attaint as to the truth of the same as soon as the speaker had ended the marshal bade him call the defendant of the other side  then myles spoke his part with a voice trembling somewhat with the excitement of the moment but loudly and clearly enough i myles edward falworth knight so created by the hand and by the grace of his majesty king henry iv of england do take upon me the gage of this battle and will defend with my body the chivalry of the knights of england and the fairness of the ladies thereof  then after the speaker ended his proclamation and had retired to his place the ceremony of claiming and redeeming the helmet to which all young knights were subjected upon first entering the lists was performed  one of the heralds cried in a loud voice i gilles hamerton herald to the most noble clarencieux kingatarms do claim the helm of sir myles edward falworth by this reason that he hath never yet entered joust or tourney  to which myles answered i do acknowledge the right of that claim and herewith proffer thee in ransom for the same this purse of one hundred marks in gold  as he spoke gascoyne stepped forward and delivered the purse with the money to the herald it was a more than usually considerable ransom and had been made up by the earl and lord george that morning  right nobly hast thou redeemed thy helm said the herald and hereafter be thou free to enter any jousting whatsoever and in whatever place  so all being ended both knights bowed to the king and then escorted each by his squire returned to his pavilion saluted by the spectators with a loud clapping of hands  sir james lee met myles in front of his tent coming up to the side of the horse the old man laid his hand upon the saddle looking up into the young mans face  thou wilt not fail in this venture and bring shame upon me said he  nay my dear master said myles i will do my best  i doubt it not said the old man and i believe me thou wilt come off right well from what he did say this morning methinks the sieur de la montaigne meaneth only to break three lances with thee and will content himself therewith without seeking to unhorse thee netheless be thou bold and watchful and if thou find that he endeavor to cast thee do thy best to unhorse him remember also those things which i have told thee ten thousand times before hold thy toes well down and grip the stirrup hard more especially at the moment of meeting bend thy body forward and keep thine elbow close to thy side bear thy lance point one foot above thine adversarys helm until within two lengths of meeting and strike thou in the very middle of his shield so myles thou mayst hold thine own and come off with glory  as he ended speaking he drew back and gascoyne mounting upon a stool covered his friends head and bascinet with the great jousting helm making fast the leathern points that held it to the iron collar  as he was tying the last thong a messenger came from the herald saying that the challenger was ready and then myles knew the time had come and reaching down and giving sir james a grip of the hand he drew on his gauntlet took the jousting lance that wilkes handed him and turned his horses head towards his end of the lists    chapter 27  as myles took his place at the south end of the lists he found the sieur de la montaigne already at his station through the peephole in the face of the huge helmet a transverse slit known as the occularium he could see like a strange narrow picture the farther end of the lists the spectators upon either side moving and shifting with ceaseless restlessness and in the centre of all his opponent sitting with spear point directed upward erect motionless as a statue of iron the sunlight gleaming and flashing upon his polished plates of steel and the trappings of his horse swaying and fluttering in the rushing of the fresh breeze  upon that motionless figure his sight gradually centred with every faculty of mind and soul he knew the next moment the signal would be given that was to bring him either glory or shame from that iron statue he ground his teeth together with stern resolve to do his best in the coming encounter and murmured a brief prayer in the hallow darkness of his huge helm then with a shake he settled himself more firmly in his saddle slowly raised his spear point until the shaft reached the exact angle and there suffered it to rest motionless there was a moment of dead tense breathless pause then he rather felt than saw the marshal raise his baton he gathered himself together and the next moment a bugle sounded loud and clear in one blinding rush he drove his spurs into the sides of his horse and in instant answer felt the noble steed spring forward with a bound  through all the clashing of his armor reverberating in the hollow depths of his helmet he saw the mailclad figure from the other end of the lists rushing towards him looming larger and larger as they came together he gripped his saddle with his knees clutched the stirrup with the soles of his feet and bent his body still more forward in the instant of meeting with almost the blindness of instinct he dropped the point of his spear against the single red flowerdeluce in the middle of the oncoming shield there was a thunderous crash that seemed to rack every joint he heard the crackle of splintered wood he felt the momentary trembling recoil of the horse beneath him and in the next instant had passed by as he checked the onward rush of his horse at the far end of the course he heard faintly in the dim hollow recess of the helm the loud shout and the clapping of hands of those who looked on and found himself gripping with nervous intensity the butt of a broken spear his mouth clammy with excitement and his heart thumping in his throat  then he realized that he had met his opponent and had borne the meeting well as he turned his horses head towards his own end of the lists he saw the other trotting slowly back towards his station also holding a broken spear shaft in his hand  as he passed the iron figure a voice issued from the helmet well done sir myles nobly done and his heart bounded in answer to the words of praise when he had reached his own end of the lists he flung away his broken spear and gascoyne came forward with another  oh myles he said with sob in his voice it was nobly done never did i see a better ridden course in all my life i did not believe that thou couldst do half so well oh myles prithee knock him out of his saddle an thou lovest me  myles in his highkeyed nervousness could not forbear a short hysterical laugh at his friends warmth of enthusiasm he took the fresh lance in his hand and then seeing that his opponent was walking his horse slowly up and down at his end of the lists did the same during the little time of rest before the next encounter  when in answer to the command of the marshal he took his place a second time he found himself calmer and more collected than before but every faculty no less intensely fixed than it had been at first once more the marshal raised his baton once more the horn sounded and once more the two rushed together with the same thunderous crash the same splinter of broken spears the same momentary trembling recoil of the horse and the same onward rush past one another once more the spectators applauded and shouted as the two knights turned their horses and rode back towards their station  this time as they met midway the sieur de la montaigne reined in his horse sir myles said his muffled voice i swear to thee by my faith i had not thought to meet in thee such an opponent as thou dost prove thyself to be i had thought to find in thee a raw boy but find instead a paladin hitherto i have given thee grace as i would give grace to any mere lad and thought of nothing but to give thee opportunity to break thy lance now i shall do my endeavor to unhorse thee as i would an acknowledged peer in arms nevertheless on account of thy youth i give thee this warning so that thou mayst hold thyself in readiness  i give thee gramercy for thy courtesy my lord answered myles speaking in french and i will strive to encounter thee as best i may and pardon me if i seem forward in so saying but were i in thy place my lord i would change me yon breastpiece and overgirth of my saddle they are sprung in the stitches  nay said the sieur de la montaigne laughing breastpiece and overgirth have carried me through more tilts than one and shall through this an thou give me a blow so true as to burst breastpiece and overgirth i will own myself fairly conquered by thee so saying he saluted myles with the butt of the spear he still held and passed by to his end of the lists  myles with gascoyne running beside him rode across to his pavilion and called to edmund wilkes to bring him a cup of spiced wine after gascoyne had taken off his helmet and as he sat wiping the perspiration from his face sir james came up and took him by the hand  my dear boy said he gripping the hand he held never could i hope to be so overjoyed in mine old age as i am this day thou dost bring honor to me for i tell thee truly thou dost ride like a knight seasoned in twenty tourneys  it doth give me tenfold courage to hear thee so say dear master answered myles and truly he added i shall need all my courage this bout for the sieur de la montaigne telleth me that he will ride to unhorse me this time  did he indeed so say said sir james then belike he meaneth to strike at thy helm thy best chance is to strike also at his doth thy hand tremble  not now answered myles  then keep thy head cool and thine eye true set thy trust in god and haply thou wilt come out of this bout honorably in spite of the rawness of thy youth  just then edmund wilkes presented the cup of wine to myles who drank it off at a draught and thereupon gascoyne replaced the helm and tied the thongs  the charge that sir james lee had given to myles to strike at his adversarys helm was a piece of advice he probably would not have given to so young a knight excepting as a last resort a blow perfectly delivered upon the helm was of all others the most difficult for the recipient to recover from but then a blow upon the helm was not one time in fifty perfectly given the huge cylindrical tilting helm was so constructed in front as to slope at an angle in all directions to one point that point was the centre of a cross formed by two iron bands welded to the steelface plates of the helm where it was weakened by the opening slit of the occularium or peephole in the very centre of this cross was a little flattened surface where the bands were riveted together and it was upon that minute point that the blow must be given to be perfect and that stroke myles determined to attempt  as he took his station edmund wilkes came running across from the pavilion with a lance that sir james had chosen and myles returning the one that gascoyne had just given him took it in his hand it was of seasoned oak somewhat thicker than the other a tough weapon not easily to be broken even in such an encounter as he was like to have he balanced the weapon and found that it fitted perfectly to his grasp as he raised the point to rest his opponent took his station at the farther extremity of the lists and again there was a little space of breathless pause myles was surprised at his own coolness every nervous tremor was gone before he had been conscious of the critical multitude looking down upon him now it was a conflict of man to man and such a conflict had no terrors for his young heart of iron  the spectators had somehow come to the knowledge that this was to be a more serious encounter than the two which had preceded it and a breathless silence fell for the moment or two that the knights stood in place  once more he breathed a short prayer holy mary guard me  then again for the third time the marshal raised his baton and the horn sounded and for the third time myles drove his spurs into his horses flanks again he saw the iron figure of his opponent rushing nearer nearer nearer he centred with a straining intensity every faculty of soul mind and body upon one pointthe cross of the occularium the mark he was to strike he braced himself for the tremendous shock which he knew must meet him and then in a flash dropped lance point straight and true the next instant there was a deafening stunning crasha crash like the stroke of a thunderbolt there was a dazzling blaze of blinding light and a myriad sparks danced and flickered and sparkled before his eyes he felt his horse stagger under him with the recoil and hardly knowing what he did he drove his spurs deep into its sides with a shout at the same moment there resounded in his ears a crashing rattle and clatter he knew not of what and then as his horse recovered and sprang forward and as the stunning bewilderment passed he found that his helmet had been struck off he heard a great shout arise from all and thought with a sickening bitter disappointment that it was because he had lost at the farther end of the course he turned his horse and then his heart gave a leap and a bound as though it would burst the blood leaped to his cheeks tingling and his bosom thrilled with an almost agonizing pang of triumph of wonder of amazement  there in a tangle of his horses harness and of embroidered trappings the sieur de la montaigne lay stretched upon the ground with his saddle near by and his riderless horse was trotting aimlessly about at the farther end of the lists  myles saw the two squires of the fallen knight run across to where their master lay he saw the ladies waving their kerchiefs and veils and the castle people swinging their hats and shouting in an ecstasy of delight then he rode slowly back to where the squires were now aiding the fallen knight to arise the senior squire drew his dagger cut the leather points and drew off the helm disclosing the knights facea face white as death and convulsed with rage mortification and bitter humiliation  i was not rightly unhorsed he cried hoarsely and with livid lips to the marshal and his attendants who had ridden up i unhelmed him fairly enough but my overgirth and breaststrap burst and my saddle slipped i was not unhorsed i say and i lay claim that i unhelmed him  sir said the marshal calmly and speaking in french surely thou knowest that the loss of helmet does not decide an encounter i need not remind thee my lord that it was so awarded by john of gaunt duke of lancaster when in the jousting match between reynand de roye and john de holland the sieur reynand left every point of his helm loosened so that the helm was beaten off at each stroke if he then was justified in doing so of his own choice and wilfully suffering to be unhelmed how then can this knight be accused of evil who suffered it by chance  nevertheless said the sieur de la montaigne in the same hoarse breathless voice i do affirm and will make my affirmation good with my body that i fell only by the breaking of my girth who says otherwise lies  it is the truth he speaketh said myles i myself saw the stitches were some little what burst and warned him thereof before we ran this course  sir said the marshal to the sieur de la montaigne how can you now complain of that thing which your own enemy advised you of and warned you against was it not right knightly for him so to do  the sieur de la montaigne stood quite still for a little while leaning on the shoulder of his chief squire looking moodily upon the ground then without making answer he turned and walked slowly away to his pavilion still leaning on his squires shoulder whilst the other attendant followed behind bearing his shield and helmet  gascoyne had picked up myless fallen helmet as the sieur de la montaigne moved away and lord george and sir james lee came walking across the lists to where myles still sat then the one taking his horse by the bridlerein and the other walking beside the saddle they led him before the raised dais where the king sat  even the comte de vermoise mortified and amazed as he must have been at the overthrow of his best knight joined in the praise and congratulation that poured upon the young conqueror myles his heart swelling with a passion of triumphant delight looked up and met the gaze of lady alice fixed intently upon him a red spot of excitement still burned in either cheek and it flamed to a rosier red as he bowed his head to her before turning away  gascoyne had just removed myless breastplate and gorget when sir james lee burst into the pavilion all his grim coldness was gone and he flung his arms around the young mans neck hugging him heartily and kissing him upon either cheek  ere he let him go mine own dear boy he said holding him off at armslength and winking his one keen eye rapidly as though to wink away a dampness of which he was ashamedmine own dear boy i do tell thee truly this is as sweet to me as though thou wert mine own son sweeter to me than when i first broke mine own lance in triumph and felt myself to be a right knight  sir answered myles what thou sayest doth rejoice my very heart netheless it is but just to say that both his breastpiece and overgirth were burst in the stitches before he ran his course for so i saw with mine own eyes  burst in the stitches snorted sir james thinkest thou he did not know in what condition was his horses gearing i tell thee he went down because thou didst strike fair and true and he did not so strike thee had he been guy of warwick he had gone down all the same under such a stroke and in such case    chapter 28  it was not until more than three weeks after the king had left devlen castle that lord george and his company of knights and archers were ready for the expedition to france two weeks of that time myles spent at crosbeydale with his father and mother it was the first time that he had seen them since four years ago he had quitted the low narrow whitewalled farmhouse for the castle of the great earl of mackworth he had never appreciated before how low and narrow and poor the farmhouse was now with his eyes trained to the bigness of devlen castle he looked around him with wonder and pity at his fathers humble surroundings he realized as he never else could have realized how great was the fall in fortune that had cast the house of falworth down from its rightful station to such a level as that upon which it now rested and at the same time that he thus recognized how poor was their lot how dependent upon the charity of others he also recognized how generous was the friendship of prior edward who perilled his own safety so greatly in affording the family of the attainted lord an asylum in its bitter hour of need and peril  myles paid many visits to the gentle old priest during those two weeks visit and had many long and serious talks with him one warm bright afternoon as he and the old man walked together in the priory garden after a game or two of draughts the young knight talked more freely and openly of his plans his hopes his ambitions than perhaps he had ever done he told the old man all that the earl had disclosed to him concerning the fallen fortunes of his fathers house and of how all who knew those circumstances looked to him to set the family in its old place once more prior edward added many things to those which myles already knewthings of which the earl either did not know or did not choose to speak he told the young man among other matters the reason of the bitter and lasting enmity that the king felt for the blind nobleman that lord falworth had been one of king richards council in times past that it was not a little owing to him that king henry when earl of derby had been banished from england and that though he was then living in the retirement of private life he bitterly and steadfastly opposed king richards abdication he told myles that at the time when sir john dale found shelter at falworth castle vengeance was ready to fall upon his father at any moment and it needed only such a pretext as that of sheltering so prominent a conspirator as sir john to complete his ruin  myles as he listened intently could not but confess in his own mind that the king had many rational perhaps just grounds for grievance against such an ardent opponent as the blind lord had shown himself to be but sir said he after a little space of silence when prior edward had ended to hold enmity and to breed treason are very different matters haply my father was bolingbrokes enemy but sure thou dost not believe he is justly and rightfully tainted with treason  nay answered the priest how canst thou ask me such a thing did i believe thy father a traitor thinkest thou i would thus tell his son thereof nay myles i do know thy father well and have known him for many years and this of him that few men are so honorable in heart and soul as he but i have told thee all these things to show that the king is not without some reason to be thy fathers unfriend neither haply is the earl of alban without cause of enmity against him so thou upon thy part shouldst not feel bitter rancor against the king for what hath happed to thy house nor even against william brookhursti mean the earl of albanfor i tell thee the worst of our enemies and the worst of men believe themselves always to have right and justice upon their side even when they most wish evil to others  so spoke the gentle old priest who looked from his peaceful haven with dreamy eyes upon the sweat and tussle of the worlds battle had he instead been in the thick of the fight it might have been harder for him to believe that his enemies ever had right upon their side  but tell me this said myles presently dost thou then think that i do evil in seeking to do a battle of life or death with this wicked earl of alban who hath so ruined my father in body and fortune  nay said prior edward thoughtfully i say not that thou doest evil war and bloodshed seem hard and cruel matters to me but god hath given that they be in the world and may he forbid that such a poor worm as i should say that they be all wrong and evil meseems even an evil thing is sometimes passing good when rightfully used  myles did not fully understand what the old man meant but this much he gathered that his spiritual father did not think ill of his fighting the earl of alban for his temporal fathers sake  so myles went to france in lord georges company a soldier of fortune as his captain was he was there for only six months but those six months wrought a great change in his life in the fierce factional battles that raged around the walls of paris in the evil life which he saw at the burgundian court in paris itself after the trucea court brilliant and wicked witty and cruelthe wonderful liquor of youth had evaporated rapidly and his character had crystallized as rapidly into the hardness of manhood the warfare the blood the evil pleasures which he had seen had been a fiery crucible test to his soul and i love my hero that he should have come forth from it so well he was no longer the innocent sir galahad who had walked in pure white up the long hall to be knighted by the king but his soul was of that grim sterling rugged sort that looked out calmly from his gray eyes upon the wickedness and debauchery around him and loved it not  then one day a courier came bringing a packet it was a letter from the earl bidding myles return straightway to england and to mackworth house upon the strand nigh to london without delay and myles knew that his time had come  it was a bright day in april when he and gascoyne rode clattering out through temple bar leaving behind them quaint old london town its blank stone wall its crooked dirty streets its highgabled wooden houses over which rose the sharp spire of st pauls towering high into the golden air before them stretched the straight broad highway of the strand on one side the great houses and palaces of princely priests and powerful nobles on the other the covent garden or the convent garden as it was then called and the rolling country where great stone windmills swung their slowmoving arms in the damp soft april breeze and away in the distance the scottish palace the white hall and westminster  it was the first time that myles had seen famous london town in that dim and distant time of his boyhood six months before he would have been wild with delight and enthusiasm now he jogged along with gascoyne gazing about him with calm interest at open shops and booths and tall gabled houses at the busy throng of merchants and craftsmen jostling and elbowing one another at townsfolkmen and damespicking their way along the muddy kennel of a sidewalk he had seen so much of the world that he had lost somewhat of interest in new things so he did not care to tarry but rode with a mind heavy with graver matters through the streets and out through the temple bar direct for mackworth house near the savoy palace  it was with a great deal of interest that myles and his patron regarded one another when they met for the first time after that halfyear which the young soldier had spent in france to myles it seemed somehow very strange that his lordships familiar face and figure should look so exactly the same to lord mackworth perhaps it seemed even more strange that six short months should have wrought so great a change in the young man the rugged exposure in camp and field during the hard winter that had passed had roughened the smooth bloom of his boyish complexion and bronzed his fair skin almost as much as a midsummers sun could have done his beard and mustache had grown again now heavier and more mannish from having been shaved and the white seam of a scar over the right temple gave if not a stern at least a determined look to the strong squarejawed young face so the two stood for a while regarding one another myles was the first to break the silence  my lord said he thou didst send for me to come back to england behold here am i  when didst thou land sir myles said the earl  i and my squire landed at dover upon tuesday last answered the young man  the earl of mackworth stroked his beard softly thou art marvellous changed said he i would not have thought it possible  myles smiled somewhat grimly i have seen such things my lord in france and in paris said he quietly as mayhap may make a lad a man before his time  from which i gather said the earl that many adventures have befallen thee methought thou wouldst find troublesome times in the dauphins camp else i would not have sent thee to france  a little space of silence followed during which the earl sat musingly half absently regarding the tall erect powerful young figure standing before him awaiting his pleasure in motionless patient almost dogged silence the strong sinewy hands were clasped and rested upon the long heavy sword around the scabbard of which the belt was loosely wrapped and the plates of mail caught and reflected in flashing broken pieces the bright sunlight from the window behind  sir myles said the earl suddenly breaking the silence at last dost thou know why i sent for thee hither  aye said myles calmly how can i else thou wouldst not have called me from paris but for one thing methinks thou hast sent for me to fight the earl of alban and lo i am here  thou speakest very boldly said the earl i do hope that thy deeds be as bold as thy words  that said myles thou must ask other men methinks no one may justly call me coward  by my troth said the earl smiling looking upon theelimbs and girth bone and sinewi would not like to be the he that would dare accuse thee of such a thing as for thy surmise i may tell thee plain that thou art right and that it was to fight the earl of alban i sent for thee hither the time is now nearly ripe and i will straightway send for thy father to come to london meantime it would not be safe either for thee or for me to keep thee in my service i have spoken to his highness the prince of wales who with other of the princes is upon our side in this quarrel he hath promised to take thee into his service until the fitting time comes to bring thee and thine enemy together and tomorrow i shall take thee to scotland yard where his highness is now lodging  as the earl ended his speech myles bowed but did not speak the earl waited for a little while as though to give him the opportunity to answer  well sirrah said he at last with a shade of impatience hast thou naught to say meseems thou takest all this with marvellous coolness  have i then my lords permission to speak my mind  aye said the earl say thy say  sir said myles i have thought and pondered this matter much while abroad and would now ask thee a plain question in all honest an i ha thy leave  the earl nodded his head  sir am i not right in believing that thou hast certain weighty purposes and aims of thine own to gain an i win this battle against the earl of alban  has my brother george been telling thee aught to such a purpose said the earl after a moment or two of silence  myles did not answer  no matter added lord mackworth i will not ask thee who told thee such a thing as for thy questionwell sin thou ask it frankly i will be frank with thee yea i have certain ends to gain in having the earl of alban overthrown  myles bowed sir said he haply thine ends are as much beyond aught that i can comprehend as though i were a little child only this i know that they must be very great thou knowest well that in any case i would fight me this battle for my fathers sake and for the honor of my house nevertheless in return for all that it will so greatly advantage thee wilt thou not grant me a boon in return should i overcome mine enemy  what is thy boon sir myles  that thou wilt grant me thy favor to seek the lady alice de mowbray for my wife  the earl of mackworth started up from his seat sir myles falworthhe began violently and then stopped short drawing his bushy eyebrows together into a frown stern if not sinister  myles withstood his look calmly and impassively and presently the earl turned on his heel and strode to the open window a long time passed in silence while he stood there gazing out of the window into the garden beyond with his back to the young man  suddenly he swung around again sir myles said he the family of falworth is as good as any in derbyshire just now it is poor and fallen in estate but if it is again placed in credit and honor thou who art the son of the house shalt have thy suit weighed with as much respect and consideration as though thou wert my peer in all things such is my answer art thou satisfied  i could ask no more answered myles    chapter 29  that night myles lodged at mackworth house the next morning as soon as he had broken his fast which he did in the privacy of his own apartments the earl bade him and gascoyne to make ready for the barge which was then waiting at the river stairs to take them to scotland yard  the earl himself accompanied them and as the heavy snubnosed boat rowed by the six oarsmen in mackworth livery slid slowly and heavily up against the stream the earl leaning back in his cushioned seat pointed out the various inns of the great priests or nobles palatial town residences standing mostly a little distance back from the water behind terraced highwalled gardens and lawns yon was the bishop of exeters close yon was the bishop of baths that was york house and that chester inn so passing by gardens and lawns and palaces they came at last to scotland yard stairs a broad flight of marble steps that led upward to a stone platform above upon which opened the gateway of the garden beyond  the scotland yard of myles falworths day was one of the more pretentious and commodious of the palaces of the strand it took its name from having been from ancient times the london inn which the tributary kings of scotland occupied when on their periodical visits of homage to england now during this time of scotlands independence the prince of wales had taken up his lodging in the old palace and made it noisy with the mad boisterous mirth of his court  as the watermen drew the barge close to the landingplace of the stairs the earl stepped ashore and followed by myles and gascoyne ascended to the broad gateway of the river wall of the garden three menatarms who lounged upon a bench under the shade of the little pent roof of a guardhouse beside the wall arose and saluted as the wellknown figure of the earl mounted the steps the earl nodded a cool answer and passing unchallenged through the gate led the way up a pleached walk beyond which as myles could see there stretched a little grassy lawn and a stonepaved terrace as the earl and the two young men approached the end of the walk they were met by the sound of voices and laughter the clinking of glasses and the rattle of dishes turning a corner they came suddenly upon a party of young gentlemen who sat at a late breakfast under the shade of a widespreading limetree they had evidently just left the tiltyard for two of the guestssturdy thickset young knightsyet wore a part of their tilting armor  behind the merry scene stood the gray hoary old palace a steep flight of stone steps and a long open stonearched gallery which evidently led to the kitchen beyond for along it hurried servingmen running up and down the tall flight of steps and bearing trays and dishes and cups and flagons it was a merry sight and a pleasant one the day was warm and balmy and the yellow sunlight fell in waving uncertain patches of light dappling the tablecloth and twinkling and sparkling upon the dishes cups and flagons  at the head of the table sat a young man some three or four years older than myles dressed in a full suit of rich blue brocaded velvet embroidered with goldthread and trimmed with black fur his face which was turned towards them as they mounted from the lawn to the little stoneflagged terrace was frank and open the cheeks smooth and fair the eyes dark and blue he was tall and rather slight and wore his thick yellow hair hanging to his shoulders where it was cut square across after the manner of the times myles did not need to be told that it was the prince of wales  ho gaffer fox he cried as soon as he caught sight of the earl of mackworth what wind blows thee hither among us wild mallard drakes i warrant it is not for love of us but only to fill thine own larder after the manner of sir fox among the drakes whom hast thou with thee some gosling thou art about to pluck  a sudden hush fell upon the company and all faces were turned towards the visitors  the earl bowed with a soft smile your highness said he smoothly is pleased to be pleasant sir i bring you the young knight of whom i spoke to you some time sincesir myles falworth you may be pleased to bring to mind that you so condescended as to promise to take him into your train until the fitting time arrived for that certain matter of which we spoke  sir myles said the prince of wales with a frank pleasant smile i have heard great reports of thy skill and prowess in france both from mackworth and from others it will pleasure me greatly to have thee in my household more especially he added as it will get thee callow as thou art out of my lord foxs clutches our faction cannot do without the earl of mackworths cunning wits sir myles netheless i would not like to put all my fate and fortune into his hands without bond i hope that thou dost not rest thy fortunes entirely upon his aid and countenance  all who were present felt the discomfort of the princes speech it was evident that one of his mad wild humors was upon him in another case the harebrained young courtiers around might have taken their cue from him but the earl of mackworth was no subject for their gibes and witticisms a constrained silence fell in which the earl alone maintained a perfect ease of manner  myles bowed to hide his own embarrassment your highness said he evasively i rest my fortune first of all upon god his strength and justice  thou wilt find safer dependence there than upon the lord of mackworth said the prince dryly but come he added with a sudden change of voice and manner these be jests that border too closely upon bitter earnest for a merry breakfast it is ill to idle with edged tools wilt thou not stay and break thy fast with us my lord  pardon me your highness said the earl bowing and smiling the same smooth smile his lips had worn from the firstsuch a smile as myles had never thought to have seen upon his haughty face i crave your good leave to decline i must return home presently for even now haply your uncle his grace of winchester is awaiting my coming upon the business you wot of haply your highness will find more joyance in a lusty young knight like sir myles than in an old fox like myself so i leave him with you in your good care  such was myless introduction to the wild young madcap prince of wales afterwards the famous henry v the conqueror of france  for a month or more thereafter he was a member of the princely household and after a little while a trusted and honored member perhaps it was the calm sturdy strength the courage of the young knight that first appealed to the princes royal heart perhaps afterwards it was the more sterling qualities that underlaid that courage that drew him to the young man certain it was that in two weeks myles was the acknowledged favorite he made no protestation of virtue he always accompanied the prince in those madcap ventures to london where he beheld all manner of wild revelry he never held himself aloof from his gay comrades but he looked upon all their mad sports with the same calm gaze that had carried him without taint through the courts of burgundy and the dauphin the gay roistering young lords and gentlemen dubbed him saint myles and jested with him about haircloth shirts and flagellations but witticism and jest alike failed to move myless patient virtue he went his own gait in the habits of his life and in so going knew as little as the others of the mad court that the princes growing liking for him was perhaps more than all else on account of that very temperance  then byandby the prince began to confide in him as he did in none of the others there was no great love betwixt the king and his son it has happened very often that the kings of england have felt bitter jealousy towards the heirsapparent as they have grown in power and such was the case with the great king henry iv the prince often spoke to myles of the clashing and jarring between himself and his father and the thought began to come to myless mind by degrees that maybe the kings jealousy accounted not a little for the princes reckless intemperance  once for instance as the prince leaned upon his shoulder waiting whilst the attendants made ready the barge that was to carry them down the river to the city he said abruptly myles what thinkest thou of us all doth not thy honesty hold us in contempt  nay highness said myles how could i hold contempt  marry said the prince i myself hold contempt and am not as honest a man as thou but prithee have patience with me myles some day perhaps i too will live a clean life now an i live seriously the king will be more jealous of me than ever and that is not a little maybe i live thus so that he may not know what i really am in soothly earnest  the prince also often talked to myles concerning his own affairs of the battle he was to fight for his fathers honor of how the earl of mackworth had plotted and planned to bring him face to face with the earl of alban he spoke to myles more than once of the many great changes of state and party that hung upon the downfall of the enemy of the house of falworth and showed him how no hand but his own could strike that enemy down if he fell it must be through the son of falworth sometimes it seemed to myles as though he and his blind father were the centre of a great web of plot and intrigue stretching far and wide that included not only the greatest houses of england but royalty and the political balance of the country as well and even before the greatness of it all he did not flinch  then at last came the beginning of the time for action it was in the early part of may and myles had been a member of the princes household for a little over a month one morning he was ordered to attend the prince in his privy cabinet and obeying the summons he found the prince his younger brother the duke of bedford and his uncle the bishop of winchester seated at a table where they had just been refreshing themselves with a flagon of wine and a plate of wafers  my poor myles said the prince smiling as the young knight bowed to the three and then stood erect as though on duty it shames my heart brotherand thou uncleit shames my heart to be one privy to this thing which we are set upon to do here be we the greatest lords of england making a catspaw of this ladfor he is only yet a boyand of his blind father for to achieve our ends against albans faction it seemeth not overhonorable to my mind  pardon me your highness said myles blushing to the roots of his hair but an i may be so bold as to speak i reck nothing of what your aims may be i only look to restoring my fathers honor and the honor of our house  truly said the prince smiling that is the only matter that maketh me willing to lay my hands to this business dost thou know why i have sent for thee it is because this day thou must challenge the duke of alban before the king the earl of mackworth has laid all his plans and the time is now ripe knowest that thy father is at mackworth house  nay said myles i knew it not  he hath been there for nearly two days said the prince just now the earl hath sent for us to come first to mackworth house then to go to the palace for he hath gained audience with the king and hath so arranged it that the earl of alban is to be there as well we all go straightway so get thyself ready as soon as may be  perhaps myless heart began beating more quickly within him at the nearness of that great happening which he had looked forward to for so long if it did he made no sign of his emotion but only asked how must i clothe myself your highness  wear thy light armor said the prince but no helmet a juppon bearing the arms and colors that the earl gave thee when thou wert knighted and carry thy righthand gauntlet under thy belt for thy challenge now make haste for time passes    chapter 30  adjoining the ancient palace of westminster where king henry iv was then holding his court was a no less ancient stone building known as the painted room upon the walls were depicted a series of battle scenes in long bands reaching around this room one above another some of these pictures had been painted as far back as the days of henry iii others had been added since his time they chronicled the various wars of the king of england and it was from them that the little hall took its name of the painted room  this ancient wing or offshoot of the main buildings was more retired from the hurlyburly of outer life than other parts of the palace and thither the sick king was very fond of retiring from the business of state which ever rested more and more heavily upon his shoulders sometimes to squander in quietness a spare hour or two sometimes to idle over a favorite book sometimes to play a game of chess with a favorite courtier the cold painted walls had been hung with tapestry and its floor had been spread with arras carpet these and the cushioned couches and chairs that stood around gave its gloomy antiquity an air of comfortan air even of luxury  it was to this favorite retreat of the kings that myles was brought that morning with his father to face the great earl of alban  in the anteroom the little party of princes and nobles who escorted the father and son had held a brief consultation then the others had entered leaving myles and his blind father in charge of lord lumley and two knights of the court sir reginald hallowell and sir piers averell  myles as he stood patiently waiting with his fathers arm resting in his could hear the muffled sound of voices from beyond the arras among others he recognized the wellremembered tones of the king he fancied that he heard his own name mentioned more than once and then the sound of talking ceased the next moment the arras was drawn aside and the earl entered the antechamber again  all is ready cousin said he to lord falworth in a suppressed voice essex hath done as he promised and alban is within there now then turning to myles speaking in the same low voice and betraying more agitation than myles had thought it possible for him to show sir myles said he remember all that hath been told thee thou knowest what thou hast to say and do then without further word he took lord falworth by the hand and led the way into the room myles following close behind  the king half sat half inclined upon a cushioned seat close to which stood the two princes there were some dozen others present mostly priests and noblemen of high quality who clustered in a group at a little distance myles knew most of them at a glance having seen them come and go at scotland yard but among them all he singled out only onethe earl of alban he had not seen that face since he was a little child eight years old but now that he beheld it again it fitted instantly and vividly into the remembrance of the time of that terrible scene at falworth castle when he had beheld the then lord brookhurst standing above the dead body of sir john dale with the bloody mace clinched in his hand there were the same heavy black brows sinister and gloomy the same hooked nose the same swarthy cheeks he even remembered the deep dent in the forehead where the brows met in perpetual frown so it was that upon that face his looks centred and rested  the earl of alban had just been speaking to some lord who stood beside him and a halfsmile still hung about the corners of his lips at first as he looked up at the entrance of the newcomers there was no other expression then suddenly came a flash of recognition a look of wideeyed amazement then the blood left the cheeks and the lips and the face grew very pale no doubt he saw at a flash that some great danger overhung him in this sudden coming of his old enemy for he was as keen and as astute a politician as he was a famous warrior at least he knew that the eyes of most of those present were fixed keenly and searchingly upon him after the first start of recognition his left hand hanging at his side gradually closed around the scabbard of his sword clutching it in a vicelike grip  meantime the earl of mackworth had led the blind lord to the king where both kneeled  why how now my lord said the king methought it was our young paladin whom we knighted at devlen that was to be presented and here thou bringest this old man a blind man ha what is the meaning of this  majesty said the earl i have taken this chance to bring to thy merciful consideration one who hath most wofully and unjustly suffered from thine anger yonder stands the young knight of whom we spake this is his father gilbert reginald whilom lord falworth who craves mercy and justice at thy hands  falworth said the king placing his hand to his head the name is not strange to mine ears but i cannot place it my head hath troubled me sorely today and i cannot remember  at this point the earl of alban came quietly and deliberately forward sire said he pardon my boldness in so venturing to address you but haply i may bring the name more clearly to your mind he is as my lord of mackworth said the whilom baron falworth the outlawed attainted traitor so declared for the harboring of sir john dale who was one of those who sought your majestys life at windsor eleven years ago sire he is mine enemy as well and is brought hither by my proclaimed enemies should aught occur to my harm i rest my case in your gracious hands  the dusty red flamed into the kings pale sickly face in answer and he rose hastily from his seat  aye said he i remember me nowi remember me the man and the name who hath dared bring him here before us all the dull heaviness of sickness was gone for the moment and king henry was the king henry of ten years ago as he rolled his eyes balefully from one to another of the courtiers who stood silently around  the earl of mackworth shot a covert glance at the bishop of winchester who came forward in answer  your majesty said he here am i your brother who beseech you as your brother not to judge overhastily in this matter it is true that this man has been adjudged a traitor but he has been so adjudged without a hearing i beseech thee to listen patiently to whatsoever he may have to say  the king fixed the bishop with a look of the bitterest deepest anger holding his nether lip tightly under his teetha trick he had when strongly moved with angerand the bishops eyes fell under the look meantime the earl of alban stood calm and silent no doubt he saw that the kings anger was likely to befriend him more than any words that he himself could say and he perilled his case with no more speech which could only prove superfluous  at last the king turned a face red and swollen with anger to the blind lord who still kneeled before him  what hast thou to say he said in a deep and sullen voice  gracious and merciful lord said the blind nobleman i come to thee the fountainhead of justice craving justice sire i do now and here deny my treason which denial i could not before make being blind and helpless and mine enemies strong and malignant but now sire heaven hath sent me help and therefore i do acclaim before thee that my accuser william bushy brookhurst earl of alban is a foul and an attainted liar in all that he hath accused me of to uphold which allegation and to defend me who am blinded by his unknightliness i do offer a champion to prove all that i say with his body in combat  the earl of mackworth darted a quick look at myles who came forward the moment his father had ended and kneeled beside him the king offered no interruption to his speech but he bent a look heavy with anger upon the young man  my gracious lord and king said myles i the son of the accused do offer myself as his champion in this cause beseeching thee of thy grace leave to prove the truth of the same being a belted knight by thy grace and of thy creation and the peer of any who weareth spurs thereupon rising he drew his iron gauntlet from his girdle and flung it clashing down upon the floor and with his heart swelling within him with anger and indignation and pity of his blind father he cried in a loud voice i do accuse thee william of alban that thou liest vilely as aforesaid and here cast down my gage daring thee to take it up  the earl of alban made as though he would accept the challenge but the king stopped him hastily  stop he cried harshly touch not the gage let it lielet it lie i tell thee my lord now then said he turning to the others tell me what meaneth all this coil who brought this man hither  he looked from one to another of those who stood silently around but no one answered  i see said he ye all have had to do with it it is as my lord of alban sayeth ye are his enemies and ye are my enemies as well in this i do smell a vile plot i cannot undo what i have done and since i have made this young man a knight with mine own hands i cannot deny that he is fit to challenge my lord of alban netheless the high court of chivalry shall adjudge this case meantime said he turning to the earl marshal who was present i give thee this attainted lord in charge convey him presently to the tower and let him abide our pleasure there also thou mayst take up yon gage and keep it till it is redeemed according to our pleasure  he stood thoughtfully for a moment and then raising his eyes looked fixedly at the earl of mackworth i know he said that i be a right sick man and there be some who are already plotting to overthrow those who have held up my hand with their own strength for all these years then speaking more directly my lord earl of mackworth i see your hand in this before all others it was thou who so played upon me as to get me to knight this young man and thus make him worthy to challenge my lord of alban it was thy doings that brought him here today backed by mine own sons and my brother and by these noblemen then turning suddenly to the earl of alban come my lord said he i am aweary with all this coil lend me thine arm to leave this place so it was that he left the room leaning upon the earl of albans arm and followed by the two or three of the alban faction who were present  your royal highness said the earl marshal i must een do the kings bidding and take this gentleman into arrest  do thy duty said the prince we knew it must come to this meanwhile he is to be a prisoner of honor and see that he be well lodged and cared for thou wilt find my barge at the stairs to convey him down the river and i myself will come this afternoon to visit him    chapter 31  it was not until the end of july that the high court of chivalry rendered its judgment there were many unusual points in the case some of which bore heavily against lord falworth some of which were in his favor he was very ably defended by the lawyers whom the earl of mackworth had engaged upon his side nevertheless under ordinary circumstances the judgment no doubt would have been quickly rendered against him as it was however the circumstances were not ordinary and it was rendered in his favor the court besought the king to grant the ordeal by battle to accept lord falworths champion and to appoint the time and place for the meeting  the decision must have been a most bitter galling one for the sick king he was naturally of a generous forgiving nature but lord falworth in his time of power had been an unrelenting and fearless opponent and his majesty who like most generous men could on occasions be very cruel and intolerant had never forgiven him he had steadily thrown the might of his influence with the court against the falworths case but that influence was no longer allpowerful for good or ill he was failing in health and it could only be a matter of a few years probably of only a few months before his successor sat upon the throne  upon the other hand the prince of waless faction had been steadily and of late rapidly increasing in power and in the earl of mackworth its virtual head it possessed one of the most capable politicians and astute intriguers in europe so as the outcome of all the plotting and counterplotting scheming and counterscheming the case was decided in lord falworths favor the knowledge of the ultimate result was known to the prince of waless circle almost a week before it was finally decided indeed the earl of mackworth had made pretty sure of that result before he had summoned myles from france but upon the king it fell like the shock of a sudden blow all that day he kept himself in moody seclusion nursing his silent bitter anger and making only one outbreak in which he swore by the holy rood that should myles be worsted in the encounter he would not take the battle into his own hands but would suffer him to be slain and furthermore that should the earl show signs of failing at any time he would do all in his power to save him one of the courtiers who had been present and who was secretly inclined to the prince of waless faction had repeated this speech at scotland yard and the prince had said that meaneth myles that thou must either win or die  and so i would have it to be my lord myles had answered  it was not until nearly a fortnight after the decision of the court of chivalry had been rendered that the king announced the time and place of battlethe time to be the 3d of september the place to be smithfielda spot much used for such encounters  during the three weeks or so that intervened between this announcement and the time of combat myles went nearly every day to visit the lists in course of erection often the prince went with him always two or three of his friends of the scotland yard court accompanied him  the lists were laid out in the usual form the true or principal list in which the combatants were to engage was sixty yards long and forty yards wide this rectangular space being surrounded by a fence about six feet high painted vermilion between the fence and the stand where the king and the spectators sat and surrounding the central space was the outer or false list also surrounded by a fence in the false list the constable and the marshal and their followers and attendants were to be stationed at the time of battle to preserve the general peace during the contest between the principals  one day as myles his princely patron and his friends entered the barriers leaving their horses at the outer gate they met the earl of alban and his followers who were just quitting the lists which they also were in the habit of visiting nearly every day as the two parties passed one another the earl spoke to a gentleman walking beside him and in a voice loud enough to be clearly overheard by the others yonder is the young sprig of falworth said he his father my lords is not content with forfeiting his own life for his treason but must forsooth throw away his sons also i have faced and overthrown many a better knight than that boy  myles heard the speech and knew that it was intended for him to hear it but he paid no attention to it walking composedly at the princes side the prince had also overheard it and after a little space of silence asked dost thou not feel anxiety for thy coming battle myles  yea my lord said myles sometimes i do feel anxiety but not such as my lord of alban would have me feel in uttering the speech that he spake anon it is anxiety for my fathers sake and my mothers sake that i feel for truly there are great matters for them pending upon this fight netheless i do know that god will not desert me in my cause for verily my father is no traitor  but the earl of alban said the prince gravely is reputed one of the bestskilled knights in all england moreover he is merciless and without generosity so that an he gain aught advantage over thee he will surely slay thee  i am not afraid my lord said myles still calmly and composedly  nor am i afraid for thee myles said the prince heartily putting his arm as he spoke around the young mans shoulder for truly wert thou a knight of forty years instead of one of twenty thou couldst not bear thyself with more courage  as the time for the duel approached the days seemed to drag themselves along upon leaden feet nevertheless the days came and went as all days do bringing with them at last the fateful 3d of september  early in the morning while the sun was still level and red the prince himself unattended came to myless apartment in the outer room of which gascoyne was bustling busily about arranging the armor piece by piece renewing straps and thongs but not whistling over his work as he usually did the prince nodded to him and then passed silently through to the inner chamber myles was upon his knees and father ambrose the princes chaplain was beside him the prince stood silently at the door until myles having told his last bead rose and turned towards him  my dear lord said the young knight i give you gramercy for the great honor you do me in coming so early for to visit me  nay myles give me no thanks said the prince frankly reaching him his hand which myles took and set to his lips i lay bethinking me of thee this morning while yet in bed and so as i could not sleep any more i was moved to come hither to see thee  quite a number of the princes faction were at the breakfast at scotland yard that morning among others the earl of mackworth all were more or less oppressed with anxiety for nearly all of them had staked much upon the coming battle if alban conquered he would be more powerful to harm them and to revenge himself upon them than ever and myles was a very young champion upon whom to depend myles himself perhaps showed as little anxiety as any he certainly ate more heartily of his breakfast that morning than many of the others  after the meal was ended the prince rose the boat is ready at the stairs said he if thou wouldst go to the tower to visit thy father myles before hearing mass i and cholmondeley and vere and poins will go with thee if ye lords and gentlemen will grant me your pardon for leaving you are there any others that thou wouldst have accompany thee  i would have sir james lee and my squire master gascoyne if thou art so pleased to give them leave to go answered myles  so be it said the prince we will stop at mackworth stairs for the knight  the barge landed at the west stairs of the tower wharf and the whole party were received with more than usual civilities by the governor who conducted them at once to the tower where lord falworth was lodged lady falworth met them at the head of the stairs her eyes were very red and her face pale and as myles raised her hand and set a long kiss upon it her lips trembled and she turned her face quickly away pressing her handkerchief for one moment to her eyes poor lady what agony of anxiety and dread did she not suffer for her boys sake that day myles had not hidden both from her and his father that he must either win or die  as myles turned from his mother prior edward came out from the inner chamber and was greeted warmly by him the old priest had arrived in london only the day before having come down from crosbey priory to be with his friends family during this their time of terrible anxiety  after a little while of general talk the prince and his attendants retired leaving the family together only sir james lee and gascoyne remaining behind  many matters that had been discussed before were now finally settled the chief of which was the disposition of lady falworth in case the battle should go against them then myles took his leave kissing his mother who began crying and comforting her with brave assurances prior edward accompanied him as far as the head of the tower stairs where myles kneeled upon the stone steps while the good priest blessed him and signed the cross upon his forehead the prince was waiting in the walled garden adjoining and as they rowed back again up the river to scotland yard all were thoughtful and serious even poins and veres merry tongues being stilled from their usual quips and jesting  it was about the quarter of the hour before eleven oclock when myles with gascoyne set forth for the lists the prince of wales together with most of his court had already gone on to smithfield leaving behind him six young knights of his household to act as escort to the young champion then at last the order to horse was given the great gate swung open and out they rode clattering and jingling the sunlight gleaming and flaming and flashing upon their polished armor they drew rein to the right and so rode in a little cloud of dust along the strand street towards london town with the breeze blowing merrily and the sunlight shining as sweetly and blithesomely as though they were riding to a wedding rather than to a grim and dreadful ordeal that meant either victory or death    chapter 32  in the days of king edward iii a code of laws relating to trial by battle had been compiled for one of his sons thomas of woodstock in this work each and every detail to the most minute had been arranged and fixed and from that time judicial combats had been regulated in accordance with its mandates  it was in obedience to this code that myles falworth appeared at the east gate of the lists the east gate being assigned by law to the challenger clad in full armor of proof attended by gascoyne and accompanied by two of the young knights who had acted as his escort from scotland yard  at the barriers he was met by the attorney willingwood the chief lawyer who had conducted the falworth case before the high court of chivalry and who was to attend him during the administration of the oaths before the king  as myles presented himself at the gate he was met by the constable the marshal and their immediate attendants the constable laying his hand upon the bridlerein said in a loud voice stand sir knight and tell me why thou art come thus armed to the gates of the lists what is thy name wherefore art thou come  myles answered i am myles falworth a knight of the bath by grace of his majesty king henry iv and by his creation and do come hither to defend my challenge upon the body of william bushy brookhurst earl of alban proclaiming him an unknightly knight and a false and perjured liar in that he hath accused gilbert reginald lord falworth of treason against our beloved lord his majesty the king and may god defend the right  as he ended speaking the constable advanced close to his side and formally raising the umbril of the helmet looked him in the face thereupon having approved his identity he ordered the gates to be opened and bade myles enter the lists with his squire and his friends  at the south side of the lists a raised scaffolding had been built for the king and those who looked on it was not unlike that which had been erected at devlen castle when myles had first jousted as belted knighthere were the same raised seat for the king the tapestries the hangings the fluttering pennons and the royal standard floating above only here were no fairfaced ladies looking down upon him but instead sternbrowed lords and knights in armor and squires and here were no merry laughing and buzz of talk and flutter of fans and kerchiefs but all was very quiet and serious  myles riding upon his horse with gascoyne holding the bridlerein and his attorney walking beside him with his hand upon the stirrups followed the constable across the lists to an open space in front of the seat where the king sat then having reached his appointed station he stopped and the constable advancing to the foot of the stairway that led to the dais above announced in a loud voice that the challenger had entered the lists  then called the defendant straightway said the king for noon draweth nigh  the day was very warm and the sun bright and unclouded shone fiercely down upon the open lists perhaps few men nowadays could bear the scorching heat of iron plates such as myles wore from which the body was only protected by a leathern jacket and hose but mens bodies in those days were tougher and more seasoned to hardships of weather than they are in these our times myles thought no more of the burning iron plates that incased him than a modern soldier thinks of his dress uniform in warm weather nevertheless he raised the umbril of his helmet to cool his face as he waited the coming of his opponent he turned his eyes upward to the row of seats on the scaffolding above and even in the restless bewildering multitude of strange faces turned towards him recognized those that he knew the prince of wales his companions of the scotland yard household the duke of clarence the bishop of winchester and some of the noblemen of the earl of mackworths party who had been buzzing about the prince for the past month or so but his glance swept over all these rather perceiving than seeing them and then rested upon a square boxlike compartment not unlike a prisoners dock in the courtroom of our day for in the box sat his father with the earl of mackworth upon one side and sir james lee upon the other the blind mans face was very pale but still wore its usual expression of calm serenitythe calm serenity of a blind face the earl was also very pale and he kept his eyes fixed steadfastly upon myles with a keen and searching look as though to pierce to the very bottom of the young mans heart and discover if indeed not one little fragment of dryrot of fear or uncertainty tainted the solid courage of his knighthood  then he heard the criers calling the defendant at the four corners of the list oyez oyez oyez william bushy brookhurst earl of alban come to this combat in which you be enterprised this day to discharge your sureties before the king the constable and the marshal and to encounter in your defence myles falworth knight the accepted champion upon behalf of gilbert reginald falworth the challenger oyez oyez oyez let the defendant come  so they continued calling until by the sudden turning of all faces myles knew that his enemy was at hand  then presently he saw the earl and his attendants enter the outer gate at the west end of the barrier he saw the constable and marshal meet him he saw the formal words of greeting pass he saw the constable raise the umbril of the helmet then the gate opened and the earl of alban entered clad capapie in a full suit of magnificent milan armor without juppon or adornment of any kind as he approached across the lists myles closed the umbril of his helmet and then sat quite still and motionless for the time was come  so he sat erect and motionless as a statue of iron half hearing the reading of the long intricatelyworded bills absorbed in many thoughts of past and present things at last the reading ended and then he calmly and composedly obeyed under the direction of his attorney the several forms and ceremonies that followed answered the various official questions took the various oaths then gascoyne leading the horse by the bridlerein conducted him back to his station at the east end of the lists  as the faithful friend and squire made one last and searching examination of arms and armor the marshal and the clerk came to the young champion and administered the final oath by which he swore that he carried no concealed weapons  the weapons allowed by the high court were then measured and attested they consisted of the long sword the short sword the dagger the mace and a weapon known as the handgisarm or glavelota heavy swordlike blade eight palms long a palm in breadth and riveted to a stout handle of wood three feet long  the usual lance had not been included in the list of arms the handgisarm being substituted in its place it was a fearful and murderous weapon though cumbersome unhandy and ill adapted for quick or dexterous stroke nevertheless the earl of alban had petitioned the king to have it included in the list and in answer to the kings expressed desire the court had adopted it in the stead of the lance yielding thus much to the royal wishes nor was it a small concession the handgisarm had been a weapon very much in vogue in king richards day and was now nearly if not entirely out of fashion with the younger generation of warriors the earl of alban was of course well used to the blade with myles it was strange and new either for attack or in defence  with the administration of the final oath and the examination of the weapons the preliminary ceremonies came to an end and presently myles heard the criers calling to clear the lists as those around him moved to withdraw the young knight drew off his mailed gauntlet and gave gascoynes hand one last final clasp strong earnest and intense with the close friendship of young manhood and poor gascoyne looked up at him with a face ghastly white  then all were gone the gates of the principal list and that of the false list were closed clashing and myles was alone face to face with his mortal enemy    chapter 33  there was a little while of restless rustling silence during which the constable took his place in the seat appointed for him directly in front of and below the kings throne a moment or two when even the restlessness and the rustling were quieted and then the king leaned forward and spoke to the constable who immediately called out in a loud clear voice  let them go then again let them go then for the third and last time let them go and do their endeavor in gods name  at this third command the combatants each of whom had till that moment been sitting as motionless as a statue of iron tightened rein and rode slowly and deliberately forward without haste yet without hesitation until they met in the very middle of the lists  in the battle which followed myles fought with the long sword the earl with the handgisarm for which he had asked the moment they met the combat was opened and for a time nothing was heard but the thunderous clashing and clamor of blows now and then beating intermittently now and then pausing occasionally as the combatants spurred together checked wheeled and recovered they would be hidden for a moment in a misty veil of dust which again drifting down the wind perhaps revealed them drawn a little apart resting their panting horses then again they would spur together striking as they passed wheeling and striking again  upon the scaffolding all was still only now and then for the buzz of muffled exclamations or applause of those who looked on mostly the applause was from myless friends for from the very first he showed and steadily maintained his advantage over the older man hah well struck well recovered look ye the sword bit that time nay look saw ye him pass the point of the gisarm then falworth falworth as some more than usually skilful stroke or parry occurred  meantime myless father sat straining his sightless eyeballs as though to pierce his bodys darkness with one ray of light that would show him how his boy held his own in the fight and lord mackworth leaning with his lips close to the blind mans ear told him point by point how the battle stood  fear not gilbert said he at each pause in the fight he holdeth his own right well then after a while god is with us gilbert alban is twice wounded and his horse faileth one little while longer and the victory is ours  a longer and more continuous interval of combat followed this last assurance during which myles drove the assault fiercely and unrelentingly as though to overbear his enemy by the very power and violence of the blows he delivered the earl defended himself desperately but was borne back back back farther and farther every nerve of those who looked on was stretched to breathless tensity when almost as his enemy was against the barriers myles paused and rested  out upon it exclaimed the earl of mackworth almost shrilly in his excitement as the sudden lull followed the crashing of blows why doth the boy spare him that is thrice he hath given him grace to recover an he had pushed the battle that time he had driven him back against the barriers  it was as the earl had said myles had three times given his enemy grace when victory was almost in his very grasp he had three times spared him in spite of all he and those dear to him must suffer should his cruel and merciless enemy gain the victory it was a false and foolish generosity partly the fault of his impulsive youthmore largely of his romantic training in the artificial code of french chivalry he felt that the battle was his and so he gave his enemy these three chances to recover as some chevalier or knighterrant of romance might have done instead of pushing the combat to a mercifully speedy endand his foolish generosity cost him dear  in the momentary pause that had thus stirred the earl of mackworth to a sudden outbreak the earl of alban sat upon his panting sweating warhorse facing his powerful young enemy at about twelve paces distant he sat as still as a rock holding his gisarm poised in front of him he had as the earl of mackworth had said been wounded twice and each time with the point of the sword so much more dangerous than a direct cut with the weapon one wound was beneath his armor and no one but he knew how serious it might be the other was under the overlapping of the epauhere and from it a fingersbreadth of blood ran straight down his side and over the housings of his horse from without the still motionless iron figure appeared calm and expressionless within who knows what consuming blasts of hate rage and despair swept his heart as with a fiery whirlwind  as myles looked at the motionless bleeding figure his breast swelled with pity my lord said he thou art sore wounded and the fight is against thee wilt thou not yield thee  no one but that other heard the speech and no one but myles heard the answer that came back hollow cavernous never thou dog never  then in an instant as quick as a flash his enemy spurred straight upon myles and as he spurred he struck a last desperate swinging blow in which he threw in one final effort all the strength of hate of fury and of despair myles whirled his horse backward warding the blow with his shield as he did so the blade glanced from the smooth face of the shield and whether by mistake or not fell straight and true and with almost undiminished force upon the neck of myless warhorse and just behind the ears the animal staggered forward and then fell upon its knees and at the same instant the other as though by the impetus of the rush dashed full upon it with all the momentum lent by the weight of iron it carried the shock was irresistible and the stunned and wounded horse was flung upon the ground rolling over and over as his horse fell myles wrenched one of his feet out of the stirrup the other caught for an instant and he was flung headlong with stunning violence his armor crashing as he fell in the cloud of dust that arose no one could see just what happened but that what was done was done deliberately no one doubted the earl at once checking and spurring his foaming charger drove the ironshod warhorse directly over myless prostrate body then checking him fiercely with the curb reined him back the hoofs clashing and crashing over the figure beneath so he had ridden over the father at york and so he rode over the son at smithfield  myles as he lay prostrate and half stunned by his fall had seen his enemy thus driving his rearing horse down upon him but was not able to defend himself a fallen knight in full armor was utterly powerless to rise without assistance myles lay helpless in the clutch of the very iron that was his defence he closed his eyes involuntarily and then horse and rider were upon him there was a deafening sparkling crash a glimmering faintness then another crash as the horse was reined furiously back again and then a humming stillness  in a moment upon the scaffolding all was a tumult of uproar and confusion shouting and gesticulation only the king sat calm sullen impassive the earl wheeled his horse and sat for a moment or two as though to make quite sure that he knew the kings mind the blow that had been given was foul unknightly but the king gave no sign either of acquiescence or rebuke he had willed that myles was to die  then the earl turned again and rode deliberately up to his prostrate enemy  when myles opened his eyes after that moment of stunning silence it was to see the other looming above him on his warhorse swinging his gisarm for one last mortal blowpitiless merciless  the sight of that looming peril brought back myless wandering senses like a flash of lightning he flung up his shield and met the blow even as it descended turning it aside it only protracted the end  once more the earl of alban raised the gisarm swinging it twice around his head before he struck this time though the shield glanced it the blow fell upon the shoulderpiece biting through the steel plate and leathern jack beneath even to the bone then myles covered his head with his shield as a last protecting chance for life  for the third time the earl swung the blade flashing and then it fell straight and true upon the defenceless body just below the left arm biting deep through the armor plates for an instant the blade stuck fast and that instant was myless salvation under the agony of the blow he gave a muffled cry and almost instinctively grasped the shaft of the weapon with both hands had the earl let go his end of the weapon he would have won the battle at his leisure and most easily as it was he struggled violently to wrench the gisarm away from myles in that short fierce struggle myles was dragged to his knees and then still holding the weapon with one hand he clutched the trappings of the earls horse with the other the next moment he was upon his feet the other struggled to thrust him away but myles letting go the gisarm which he held with his left hand clutched him tightly by the swordbelt in the intense viselike grip of despair in vain the earl strove to beat him loose with the shaft of the gisarm in vain he spurred and reared his horse to shake him off myles held him tight in spite of all his struggles  he felt neither the streaming blood nor the throbbing agony of his wounds every faculty of soul mind body every power of life was centered in one intense burning effort he neither felt thought nor reasoned but clutching with the blindness of instinct the heavy spiked ironheaded mace that hung at the earls saddlebow he gave it one tremendous wrench that snapped the plaited leathern thongs that held it as though they were skeins of thread then grinding his teeth as with a spasm he struck as he had never struck beforeonce twice thrice full upon the front of the helmet crash crash and then even as the earl toppled sidelong crash and the iron plates split and crackled under the third blow myles had one flashing glimpse of an awful face and then the saddle was empty  then as he held tight to the horse panting dizzy sick to death he felt the hot blood gushing from his side filling his body armor and staining the ground upon which he stood still he held tightly to the saddlebow of the fallen mans horse until through his glimmering sight he saw the marshal the lieutenant and the attendants gather around him he heard the marshal ask him in a voice that sounded faint and distant if he was dangerously wounded he did not answer and one of the attendants leaping from his horse opened the umbril of his helmet disclosing the dull hollow eyes the ashy colorless lips and the waxy forehead upon which stood great beads of sweat  water water he cried hoarsely give me to drink then quitting his hold upon the horse he started blindly across the lists towards the gate of the barrier a shadow that chilled his heart seemed to fall upon him it is death he muttered then he stopped then swayed for an instant and then toppled headlong crashing as he fell    conclusion  but myles was not dead those who had seen his face when the umbril of the helmet was raised and then saw him fall as he tottered across the lists had at first thought so but his faintness was more from loss of blood and the sudden unstringing of nerve and sense from the intense furious strain of the last few moments of battle than from the vital nature of the wound indeed after myles had been carried out of the lists and laid upon the ground in the shade between the barriers master thomas the princes barbersurgeon having examined the wounds declared that he might be even carried on a covered litter to scotland yard without serious danger the prince was extremely desirous of having him under his care and so the venture was tried myles was carried to scotland yard and perhaps was none the worse therefore the prince the earl of mackworth and two or three others stood silently watching as the worthy shaver and leecher assisted by his apprentice and gascoyne washed and bathed the great gaping wound in the side and bound it with linen bandages myles lay with closed eyelids still pallid weak as a little child presently he opened his eyes and turned them dull and languid to the prince  what hath happed my father my lord said he in a faint whispering voice  thou hath saved his life and honor myles the prince answered he is here now and thy mother hath been sent for and cometh anon with the priest who was with them this morn  myles dropped his eyelids again his lips moved but he made no sound and then two bright tears trickled across his white cheek  he maketh a woman of me the prince muttered through his teeth and then swinging on his heel he stood for a long time looking out of the window into the garden beneath  may i see my father said myles presently without opening his eyes  the prince turned around and looked inquiringly at the surgeon  the good man shook his head not today said he haply tomorrow he may see him and his mother the bleeding is but new stanched and such matters as seeing his father and mother may make the heart to swell and so maybe the wound burst afresh and he die an he would hope to live he must rest quiet until tomorrow day  but though myless wound was not mortal it was very serious the fever which followed lingered longer than commonperhaps because of the hot weatherand the days stretched to weeks and the weeks to months and still he lay there nursed by his mother and gascoyne and prior edward and now and again by sir james lee  one day a little before the good priest returned to saint marys priory as he sat by myless bedside his hands folded and his sight turned inward the young man suddenly said tell me holy father is it always wrong for man to slay man  the good priest sat silent for so long a time that myles began to think he had not heard the question but byandby he answered almost with a sigh it is a hard question my son but i must in truth say meseems it is not always wrong  sir said myles i have been in battle when men were slain but never did i think thereon as i have upon this matter did i sin in so slaying my fathers enemy  nay said prior edward quietly thou didst not sin it was for others thou didst fight my son and for others it is pardonable to do battle had it been thine own quarrel it might haply have been more hard to have answered thee  who can gainsay even in these days of light the truth of this that the good priest said to the sick lad so far away in the past   one day the earl of mackworth came to visit myles at that time the young knight was mending and was sitting propped up with pillows and was wrapped in sir james lees cloak for the day was chilly after a little time of talk a pause of silence fell  my lord said myles suddenly dost thou remember one part of a matter we spoke of when i first came from france  the earl made no pretence of ignorance i remember said he quietly looking straight into the young mans thin white face  and have i yet won the right to ask for the lady alice de mowbray to wife said myles the red rising faintly to his cheeks  thou hast won it said the earl with a smile  myless eyes shone and his lips trembled with the pang of sudden joy and triumph for he was still very weak my lord said he presently belike thou camest here to see me for this very matter  the earl smiled again without answering and myles knew that he had guessed aright he reached out one of his weak pallid hands from beneath the cloak the earl of mackworth took it with a firm pressure then instantly quitting it again rose as if ashamed of his emotion stamped his feet as though in pretence of being chilled and then crossed the room to where the fire crackled brightly in the great stone fireplace   little else remains to be told only a few loose strands to tie and the story is complete  though lord falworth was saved from death at the block though his honor was cleansed from stain he was yet as poor and needy as ever the king in spite of all the pressure brought to bear upon him refused to restore the estates of falworth and easterbridgethe latter of which had again reverted to the crown upon the death of the earl of alban without issueupon the grounds that they had been forfeited not because of the attaint of treason but because of lord falworth having refused to respond to the citation of the courts so the business dragged along for month after month until in january the king died suddenly in the jerusalem chamber at westminster then matters went smoothly enough and falworth and mackworth swam upon the floodtide of fortune   so myles was married for how else should the story end and one day he brought his beautiful young wife home to falworth castle which his father had given him for his own and at the gateway of which he was met by sir james lee and by the newlyknighted sir francis gascoyne  one day soon after this homecoming as he stood with her at an open window into which came blowing the pleasant maytime breeze he suddenly said what didst thou think of me when i first fell almost into thy lap like an apple from heaven  i thought thou wert a great goodhearted boy as i think thou art now said she twisting his strong sinewy fingers in and out  if thou thoughtst me so then what a very fool i must have looked to thee when i so clumsily besought thee for thy favor for my jousting at devlen did i not so  thou didst look to me the most noble handsome young knight that did ever live thou didst look to me sir galahad as they did call thee withouten taint or stain  myles did not even smile in answer but looked at his wife with such a look that she blushed a rosy red then laughing she slipped from his hold and before he could catch her again was gone  i am glad that he was to be rich and happy and honored and beloved after all his hard and noble fighting
