  sir martin marall   sir martin marall is imitated from the french of moliere nor even with that qualification is it entirely the work of dryden william cavendish duke of newcastle renowned for his loyalty and gallantry during the civil wars whether in compliance with the general custom amongst the men of wit and honour at the court of charles or in order to place himself upon a level with that voluminous authoress his duchess thought fit to compose several plays amongst other lucubrations he translated molieres letourdi and presented it to our author by whom it was adapted for the stage from respect to his grace it was published anonymously until 1697 when it appeared with drydens name the noble duke being far more eminent as a soldier and an equestrian than as an author it may be readily allowed that what is diverting in the piece has been inserted by our author upon the stage indeed the repeated and incorrigible blunders of sir martin must have appeared very diverting since the play ran for no less than thirtythree nights and was four times acted at court nokes who acted this unfortunate coxcomb with inimitable humour is said to have contributed much to this uncommon success molieres play is followed with considerable exactness allowing for such variations as the change of the scene from paris to london appeared naturally to demand one remarkable difference occurs in the conclusion coelie is in the original at length united to her inconsiderate and blundering admirer mrs millisent the corresponding character in sir martin marall rewards with her hand and fortune the ingenious warner who has all along laboured to gain her for his master the alternative was a little embarrassing but the decorum of the french stage would not have permitted the union of a lady with an intriguing domestic nor would an english audience have been less shocked with seeing her bestowed on a fool besides sir martin marall is a more contemptible character than lelie who is less conceited and foolish than thoughtless and inconsequential but although the character of a menial was not quite so low in the 17th as in the 18th centuryfor pages and the higher class of attendants in a noblemans family were often men of some birthyet there is much grossness in the conduct of the lady who in pure admiration of wit marries a man who never thought of her  lamant indiscret of quinault another french play has also been consulted by dryden in furbishing forth the duke of newcastles labours in that part of the play which occasions its second title of the feigned innocence the reader will hardly find wit enough to counterbalance the want of delicacy  sir martin marall was performed by the duke of yorks servants probably at the desire of the duke of newcastle as dryden was engaged to write for the other house it seems to have been acted in 1667 and was published but without the authors name in 1668     prologue     fools which each man meets in his dish each day   are yet the great regalios of a play   in which to poets you but just appear   to prize that highest which cost them so dear   fops in the town more easily will pass   one story makes a statutable ass   but such in plays must be much thicker sown   like yolks of eggs a dozen beat to one   observing poets all their walks invade   as men watch woodcocks gliding through a glade   and when they have enough for comedy   they stow their several bodies in a pye   the poets but the cook to fashion it   for gallants you yourselves have found the wit   to bid you welcome would your

sword and buckler were the common weapons of old when englishmen were fenced with bucklers as with a rampier nothing was more common with them than to fight about taking the right or left hand on the wall or upon any unpleasing countenance clashing of swords was then daily music in every street morysons itinerary part iii book ivthe buckler was disused in the latter end of queen elizabeths reign

ground of matrimony  l dupe but there are advantages enough for you if you will be wise and follow my advice  chr madam my friends left me to your care therefore i will wholly follow your counsel with secrecy and obedience  l dupe sweetheart it shall be the better for you another day well then this lord that pretends to you is crafty and false as most men are especially in love therefore we must be subtle to meet with all his plots and have countermines against his works to blow him up  chr as how madam  l dupe why girl hell make fierce love to you but you must not suffer him to ruffle you or steal a kiss but you must weep and sigh and say youll tell me ont and that you will not be used so and play the innocent just like a child and seem ignorant of all  chr i warrant you ill be very ignorant madam  l dupe and be sure when he has towsed you not to appear at supper that night that you may fright him  chr no madam  l dupe that he may think you have told me  chr ay madam  l dupe and keep your chamber and say your head aches  chr o most extremely madam  l dupe and lock the door and admit of no night visits at supper ill ask wheres my cousin and being told you are not well ill start from the table to visit you desiring his lordship not to incommode himself for i will presently wait on him again  chr but how when you are returned madam  l dupe then somewhat discomposed ill say i doubt the meazles or smallpox will seize on you and then the girl is spoiled saying poor thing her portion is her beauty and her virtue and often send to see how you do by whispers in my servants ears and have those whispers of your health returned to mine if his lordship thereupon asks how you do i will pretend it was some other thing  chr right madam for that will bring him further in suspence  l dupe a hopeful girl then will i eat nothing that night feigning my grief for you but keep his lordship company at meal and seem to strive to put my passion off yet shew it still by small mistakes  chr and broken sentences  l dupe a dainty girl and after supper visit you again with promise to return strait to his lordship but after i am gone send an excuse that i have given you a cordial and mean to watch that night in person with you  chr his lordship then will find the prologue of his trouble doubting i have told you of his ruffling  l dupe and more than that fearing his father should know of it and his wife who is a termagant lady but when he finds the coast is clear and his late ruffling known to none but you he will be drunk with joy  chr finding my simple innocence which will inflame him more  l dupe then what the lions skin has failed him in the foxs subtlety must next supply and that is just sweetheart as i would have it for crafty folks treaties are their advantage especially when his passion must be satisfied at any rate and you keep shop to set the price of love so now you see the market is your own  chr truly madam this is very rational and by the blessing of heaven upon my poor endeavours i do not doubt to play my part  l dupe my blessing and my prayers go along with thee  enter sir john swallow mrs millisent and rose her maid  chr i

country vicars when the sermons done   run headlong to the benediction   well knowing though the better sort may stay   the vulgar rout will run unblest away   so we when once our play is done make haste   with a short epilogue to close your taste   in thus withdrawing we seem mannerly   but when the curtains down we peep and see   a jury of the wits who still stay late   and in their club

will be   we by tomorrow will our fortune cast   as he tells all things when the year is past       the    tempest     or the    enchanted island     a    comedy     the tempest   in this alteration of the tempest dryden acknowledges his obligation to sir william davenant whom he extols for his quick and piercing imagination sir william was the son of an innkeeper in oxford whose house was frequented by our immortal shakespeare and hence an illfounded tradition ascribed to him a paternal interest in young davenant but this slander on shakespeares moral character has been fully refuted in the prolegomena to johnson and steevens edition of his plays davenant was appointed poet laureat upon the death of ben jonson during the civil wars he distinguished himself on the royal side was lieutenantgeneral of ordnance to the earl of newcastle and was knighted by charles at the siege of gloucester he was afterwards much trusted by henrietta the queendowager and was finally made prisoner by an english man of war in attempting to convey a colony of loyalists to virginia after a long captivity in the tower he was liberated through the intercession of the lordkeeper whitelocke the wisest and most temperate of the counsellors of the ruling power through his countenance sir william was protected or connived at in bringing forward certain interludes and operas even during the rigid sway of fanaticism after the restoration he became manager of a company of players called the duke of yorks servants in distinction to the kings company which was directed by killigrew he introduced upon the stage much pomp in dress scenery and decoration as if to indemnify the theatrical muses for the poor shifts to which they had been reduced during the usurpation sir william davenant died in 1668 at the age of 63  gondibert his greatest performance incurred when first published more ridicule and in latter times more neglect than its merits deserve an epic poem in elegiac stanzas must always be tedious because no structure of verse is more unfavourable to narration than that which almost peremptorily requires each sentence to be restricted or protracted to four lines but the liveliness of davenants imagination which dryden has pointed out as his most striking attribute has illuminated even the dull and dreary path which he has chosen and perhaps few poems afford more instances of vigorous conceptions and even felicity of expression than the neglected gondibertc  the alteration of the tempest was davenants last work and it seems to have been undertaken chiefly with a view to give room for scenical decoration few readers will think the play much improved by the introduction of the sealanguage which davenant had acquired during the adventurous period of his life nevertheless the ludicrous contest betwixt the sailors for the dukedom and viceroyship of a barren island gave much amusement at the time and some of the expressions were long after proverbiald much cannot be said for davenants ingenuity in contrasting the character of a woman who had never seen a man with that of a man who had never seen a woman or in inventing a sister monster for caliban the majestic simplicity of shakespeares plan is injured by thus doubling his characters and his wild landscape is converted into a formal parterre where each alley has its brother in sketching characters drawn from fancy and not from observation the palm of genius must rest with the first inventor others are but copyists and a copy shews no where to such disadvantage as when placed by the original besides although we are delighted with the feminine simplicity of miranda it becomes unmanly childishness in hippolito and the premature coquetry of dorinda is disgusting when contrasted with the maidenly purity that chastens the simplicity of shakespeares heroine the latter seems to display as it were by instinct the innate dignity of her sex the former to shew even in solitude the germ of those vices by which in a voluptuous age the female character becomes degraded the wild and savage character of caliban is also sunk into low and vulgar buffoonery  dryden has not informed us of the share he had in this alteration it was probably little more than the care of adapting it to the stage the prologue is one of the most masterly tributes ever paid at the shrine of shakespeare  from the epilogue the tempest appears to have been acted in 1667 although dryden was under engagements to the kings company this play was performed by the dukes servants probably because written in conjunction with davenant their manager it was not published until 1670   footnotes  footnote c an excellent critical essay upon the beauties and defects of davenants epic may be found in aikins miscellanies those who are insensible to theme rits of the poem may admire the courage of the author who wrote some part of it when he conceived himself within a week of being hanged a tradition prevails that his life was saved by milton whose life in return he saved at the restoration were the story true how vast was the requital  footnote d as peace and the but c     preface  the writing of prefaces to plays was probably invented by some very ambitious poet who never thought he had done enough perhaps by some ape of the french eloquence which uses to make a business of a letter of gallantry an examen of a farce and in short a great pomp and ostentation of words on every trifle this is certainly the talent of that nation and ought not to be invaded by any other they do that out of gaiety which would be an impositione upon us  we may satisfy ourselves with surmounting them in the scene and safely leave them those trappings of writings and flourishes of the pen with which they adorn the borders of their plays and which are indeed no more than good landscapes to a very indifferent picture i must proceed no farther in this argument lest i run myself beyond my excuse for writing this give me leave therefore to tell you reader that i do not set a value on any thing i have written in this play but out of gratitude to the memory of sir william davenant who did me the honour to join me with him in the alteration of it  it was originally shakespeares a poet for whom he had particularly a high veneration and whom he first taught me to admire the play itself had formerly been acted with success in the black friars and our excellent fletcher had so great a value for it that he thought fit to make use of the same design not much varied a second time those who have seen his seavoyage may easily discern that it was a copy of shakespeares tempest the storm the desert island and the woman who had never seen a man are all sufficient testimonies of it but fletcher was not the only poet who made use of shakespeares plot sir john suckling a professed admirer of our author has followed his footsteps in his goblins his regmella being an open imitation of shakespeares miranda and his spirits though counterfeit yet are copied from ariel but sir william davenant as he was a man of a quick and piercing imagination soon found that somewhat might be added to the design of shakespeare of which neither fletcher nor suckling had ever thought and therefore to put the last hand to it he designed the counterpart to shakespeares plot namely that of a man who had never seen a woman that by this means those two characters of innocence and love might the more illustrate and commend each other this excellent contrivance he was pleased to communicate to me and to desire my assistance in it i confess that from the very first moment it so pleased me that i never writ any thing with more delight i must likewise do him that justice to acknowledge that my writing received daily his amendments and that is the reason why it is not so faulty as the rest which i have done without the help or correction of so judicious a friend the comical parts of the sailors were also of his invention and for the most part his writing as you will easily discover by the style in the time i writ with him i had the opportunity to observe somewhat more nearly of him than i had formerly done when i had only a bare acquaintance with him i found him then of so quick a fancy that nothing was proposed to him on which he could not suddenly produce a thought extremely pleasant and surprising and those first thoughts of his contrary to the old latin proverb were not always the least happy and as his fancy was quick so likewise were the products of it remote and new he borrowed not of any other and his imaginations were such as could not easily enter into any other man his corrections were sober and judicious and he corrected his own writings much more severely than those of another man bestowing twice the time and labour in polishing which he used in invention it had perhaps been easy enough for me to have arrogated more to myself than was my due in the writing of this play and to have passed by his name with silence in the publication of it with the same ingratitude which others have used to him whose writings he hath not only corrected as he hath done this but has had a greater inspection over them and sometimes added whole scenes together which may as easily be distinguished from the rest as true gold from counterfeit by the weight but besides the unworthiness of the action which deterred me from it there being nothing so base as to rob the dead of his reputation i am satisfied i could never have received so much honour in being thought the author of any poem how excellent soever as i shall from the joining my imperfections with the merit and name of shakespeare and sir william davenant                                                          john dryden    december 1 1669   footnote e a task imposed on us     prologue  as when a trees cut down the secret root lives under ground and thence new branches shoot so from old shakespeares honoured dust this day springs up and buds a newreviving play shakespeare who taught by none did first impart to fletcher wit to labouring jonson art he monarchlike gave those his subjects law and is that nature which they paint and draw fletcher reached that which on his heights did grow whilst jonson crept and gathered all below this did his love and this his mirth digest one imitates him most the other best if they have since outwrit all other men tis with the drops which fell from shakespeares pen the storm which vanished on the neighbouring shore was taught by shakespeares tempest first to roar that innocence and beauty which did smile in fletcher grew on this enchanted isle but shakespeares magic could not copied be within that circle none durst walk but he i must confess twas bold nor would you now that liberty to vulgar wits allow which works by magic supernatural things but shakespeares power is sacred as a kings those legends from old priesthood were received and he then writ as people

by large wreathed columns of the corinthian order the wreathings of the columns are beautified with roses wound round them and several cupids flying about them on the cornice just over the capitals

desired your own virtue and my great obligations to your grace have justly given you the precedence for what could be more glorious to me than to have acquired some part of your esteem who are admired and honoured by all good men who have been for so many years together the pattern and standard of honour to the nation and whose whole life has been so great an example of heroic virtue that we might wonder how it happened into an age so corrupt as ours if it had not likewise been a part of the former as you came into the world with all the advantages of a noble birth and education so you have rendered both yet more conspicuous by your virtue fortune indeed has perpetually crowned your undertakings with success but she has only waited on your valour not conducted it she has ministered to your glory like a slave and has been led in triumph by it or at most while honour led you by the hand to greatness fortune only followed to keep you from sliding back in the ascent that which plutarch accounted her favour to cymon and lucullus was but her justice to your grace and never to have been overcome where you led in person as it was more than hannibal could boast so it was all that providence could do for that party which it had resolved to ruin thus my lord the last smiles of victory were on your arms and everywhere else declaring for the rebels she seemed to suspend herself and to doubt before she took her flight whether she were able wholly to abandon that cause for which you foughth  but the greatest trials of your courage and constancy were yet to come many had ventured their fortunes and exposed their lives to the utmost dangers for their king and country who ended their loyalty with the war and submitting to the iniquity of the times chose rather to redeem their former plenty by acknowledging an usurper than to suffer with an unprofitable fidelity as those meaner spirits called it for their lawful sovereign but as i dare not accuse so many of our nobility who were content to accept their patrimonies from the clemency of the conqueror and to retain only a secret veneration for their prince amidst the open worship which they were forced to pay to the usurper who had dethroned him so i hope i may have leave to extol that virtue which acted more generously and which was not satisfied with an inward devotion to monarchy but produced itself to view and asserted the cause by open martyrdom of these rare patterns of loyalty your grace was chief those examples you could not find you made some few catos there were with you whose invincible resolution could not be conquered by that usurping c√¶sar your virtue opposed itself to his fortune and overcame it by not submitting to it the last and most difficult enterprize he had to effect when he had conquered three nations was to subdue your spirit and he died weary of that war and unable to finish it  in the mean time you lived more happily in your exile than the other on his throne your loyalty made you friends and servants amongst foreigners and you lived plentifully without a fortune for you lived on your own desert and reputation the glorious name of the valiant and faithful newcastle was a patrimony which could never be exhausted  thus my lord the morning of your life was clear and calm and though it was afterwards overcast yet in that general storm you were never without a shelter and now you are happily arrived to the evening of a day as serene as the dawn of it was glorious but such an evening as i hope and almost prophecy is far from night tis the evening of a summers sun which keeps the daylight long within the skies the health of your body is maintained by the vigour of your mind neither does the one shrink from the fatigue of exercise nor the other bend under the pains of study methinks i behold in you another caius marius who in the extremity of his age exercised himself almost every morning in the campus martius amongst the youthful nobility of rome and afterwards in your retirements when you do honour to poetry by employing part of your leisure in it i regard you as another silius italicus who having passed over his consulship with applause dismissed himself from business and from the gown and employed his age amongst the shades in the reading and imitation of virgil  in which lest any thing should be wanting to your happiness you have by a rare effect of fortune found in the person of your excellent lady not only a lover but a partner of your studies a lady whom our age may justly equal with the sappho of the greeks or the sulpitia of the romans who by being taken into your bosom seems to be inspired with your genius and by writing the history of your lifei in so masculine a style has already placed you in the number of the heroes she has anticipated that great portion of fame which envy often hinders a living virtue from possessing which would indeed have been given to your ashes but with a later payment and of which you could have no present use except it were by a secret presage of that which was to come when you were no longer in a possibility of knowing it so that if that were a praise or satisfaction to the greatest of emperors which the most judicious of poets gives him      pr√¶senti tibi maturos largimur honores c  that the adoration which was not allowed to hercules and romulus till after death was given to augustus living then certainly it cannot be denied but that your grace has received a double satisfaction the one to see yourself consecrated to immortality while you are yet alive the other to have your praises celebrated by so dear so just and so pious an historian  it is the consideration of this that stops my pen though i am loth to leave so fair a subject which gives me as much field as poetry could wish and yet no more than truth can justify but to attempt any thing of a panegyric were to enterprize on your ladys right and to seem to affect those praises which none but the duchess of newcastle can deserve when she writes the actions of her lord i shall therefore leave that wider space and contract myself to those narrow bounds which best become my fortune and employment  i am obliged my lord to return you not only my own acknowledgments but to thank you in the names of former poets the names of jonson and davenantj seem to require it from me that those favours which you placed on them and which they wanted opportunity to own in public yet might not be lost to the knowledge of posterity with a forgetfulness unbecoming of the muses who are the daughters of memory and give me leave my lord to avow so much of vanity as to say i am proud to be their remembrancer for by relating how gracious you have been to them and are to me i in some measure join my name with theirs and the continued descent of your favours to me is the best title which i can plead for my succession i only wish that i had as great reason to be satisfied with myself in the return of our common acknowledgments as your grace may justly take in the conferring them for i cannot but be very sensible that the present of an ill comedy which i here make you is a very unsuitable way of giving thanks for them who themselves have written so many better this pretends to nothing more than to be a foil to those scenes which are composed by the most noble poet of our age and nation and to be set as a watermark of the lowest ebb to which the wit of my predecessor has sunk and run down in me but though all of them have surpassed me in the scene there is one part of glory in which i will not yield to any of them i mean my lord that honour and veneration which they had for you in their lives and which i preserve after them more holily than the vestal fires were maintained from age to age but with a greater degree of heat and of devotion than theirs as being with more respect and passion than they ever were    your graces               most obliged most humble                      and most obedient servant                             john dryden   footnote g william cavendish duke of newcastle distinguished himself in the civil wars of charles i he might have possessed himself of hull had the king more early resolved on an open rupture with the parliament when the war broke out he levied an army of 8000 men secured the northern counties for the king and raised the siege of york the invasion of the scots prevented his farther success but he defeated the parliamentary forces in several actions and shewed all the talents of a great soldier after the loss of the battle of marston moor which prince rupert hazarded in opposition to his advice he left england in disgust and did not return till the restoration he was much respected when abroad and acquired the favour of many princes and amongst others of don john of austria his skill in the equestrian art was perhaps as great a recommendation as his noble birth and unstained loyalty during the wars he had been raised from the rank of earl to that of marquis and after the restoration he was created duke of newcastle he wrote several plays of which we know only the names the country captain variety the humourous lovers and the triumphant widow he also translated molieres letourdi which our author converted into sir martin marall but his most noted work is a splendid folio on horsemanship with engravings in which after his grace has been represented in every possible attitude and dress he is at length depicted mounted on pegasus and in the act of ascending from a circle of houyhnhnms kneeling around him in the act of adoration  his once celebrated duchess was margaret daughter of sir charles lucas she was his graces second wife and married to him during his exile a most voluminous author she wrote nineteen plays besides philosophical essays letters and orations for the former she has condescended to leave the following apology  the latin phrases i could never tell but jonson could which made him write so well greek latin poets i could never read nor their historians but our english speed i could not steal their wit nor plots outtake all my plays plots my own poor brain did make from plutarchs story i neer took a plot nor from romances nor from don quixote  her graces assiduity was equal to her originality she kept a bevy of maidens of honour who were obliged at all hours of the night to attend the summons of her bell with a light and materials to register her graces conceptions which we beg the reader to understand were all of a literary or philosophical nature  the good duchesss conceptions are now forgotten but it should not be forgotten that her kind solicitude soothed and supported her husband through a weary exile of eighteen years when their fortunes were reduced to the lowest ebb in gratitude he appears to have encouraged her pursuits and admired the productions of her muse in the sessions of poets he is introduced as founding upon her literary pretensions rather than his own      newcastle ands horse for entrance next strives       wellstuffed was his cloakbag and so was his breeches     and         pulled out his wifes poems plays essays

gained many advantages after the earl of newcastle had left england the north was irrecoverably lost to his cause  footnote i the duchess wrote her husbands life which was translated into latin it is certainly the best of her graces performances  footnote j jonson and davenant were both protected by the duke of newcastle jonson has addressed several verses to him and composed a masque for the splendid entertainment which he gave to charles i at his house at wellbeck when the king was on his first northern journey     an evenings love   our author acknowledges that this play of the mock astrologer is founded on le feint astrologue by the younger corneille which he in his turn had imitated from el astrologo fingido of calderon but dryden has also laid moliere under contribution most part of the quarrelling scene betwixt wildblood and jacintha in the fourth act is literally copied from that betwixt lucile eraste marinette and gros ren√© in le depit amoureux the absurd loquacity of don alonzo and his friends mode of silencing him by ringing a bell in his ears is imitated from the scene betwixt albert and metaphraste in the same play and it must be allowed it is an expedient which might be more decently resorted to against an inundation of nonsense from a pedantic schoolmaster as in moliere than to stop the mouth of a noble old spaniard the uncle of don lopez mistress the play itself is more lively than most of drydens comedies wildblood and jacintha are far more pleasant than their prototypes celadon and florimel and the spanish bustle of the plot is well calculated to keep up the attention the character of aurelia was perhaps suggested by the precieuses ridicules of moliere but cannot with any justice be said to be copied from them the preface contains some excellent remarks on the old comedy there is also an elaborate defence the first our poet deigned to make against the charge of plagiarism on this point he quotes the words of charles ii who had only desired that they who accused dryden of theft would steal him such plays as drydens and he vindicates the right of an author to take his plot where he could best find it in history or romance providing that the conduct and disposition of the action with the dialogue character and poetical ornaments were original our authors use of the terms and technical phrases of judicial astronomy intimate his acquaintance with that pretended science in which he is known to have placed some confidence  the mock astrologer appears to have been acted and published in 1668       the    preface                                       i had thought reader in this preface to have written somewhat concerning the difference betwixt the plays of our age and those of our predecessors on the english stage to have shewn in what parts of dramatic poesy we were excelled by ben jonson i mean humour and contrivance of comedy and in what we may justly claim precedence of shakespeare and fletcher namely in heroic plays but this design i have waved on second considerations at least deferred it till i publish the conquest of granada where the discourse will be more proper i had also prepared to treat of the improvement of our language since fletchers and jonsons days and consequently of our refining the courtship raillery and conversation of plays but as i am willing to decline that envy which i should draw on myself from some old opiniatre judges of the stage so likewise i am prest in time so much that i have not leisure at present to go through with it neither indeed do i value a reputation gained from comedy so far as to concern myself about it any more than i needs must in my own defence for i think it in its own nature inferior to all sorts of dramatick writing low comedy especially requires on the writers part much of conversation with the vulgar and much of ill nature in the observation of their follies but let all men please themselves according to their several tastes that which is not pleasant to me may be to others who judge better and to prevent an accusation from my enemies i am sometimes ready to imagine that my disgust of low comedy proceeds not so much from my judgment as from my temper which is the reason why i so seldom write it and that when i succeed in it i mean so far as to please the audience yet i am nothing satisfied with what i have done but am often vexed to hear the people laugh and clap as they perpetually do where intended them no jest while they let pass the better things without taking notice of them yet even this confirms me in my opinion of slighting popular applause and of contemning that approbation which those very people give equally with me to the zany of a mountebank or to the appearance of an antick on the theatre without wit on the poets part or any occasion of laughter from the actor besides the ridiculousness of his habit and his grimaces  but i have descended before i was aware from comedy to farce which consists principally of grimaces that i admire not any comedy equally with tragedy is perhaps from the sullenness of my humour but that i detest those farces which are now the most frequent entertainments of the stage i am sure i have reason on my side comedy consists though of low persons yet of natural actions and characters i mean such humours adventures and designs as are to be found and met with in the world farce on the other side consists of forced humours and unnatural events comedy presents us with the imperfections of human nature farce entertains us with what is monstrous and chimerical the one causes laughter in those who can judge of men and manners by the lively representation of their folly or corruption the other produces the same effect in those who can judge of neither and that only by its extravagances the first works on the judgment and fancy the latter on the fancy only there is more of satisfaction in the former kind of laughter and in the latter more of scorn but how it happens that an impossible adventure should cause our mirth i cannot so easily imagine something there may be in the oddness of it because on the stage it is the common effect of things unexpected to surprise us into a delight and that is to be ascribed to the strange appetite as i may call it of the fancy which like that of a longing woman often runs out into the most extravagant desires and is better satisfied sometimes with loam or with the rinds of trees than with the wholesome nourishments of life in short there is the same difference betwixt farce and comedy as betwixt an empirick and a true physician both of them may attain their ends but what the one performs by hazard the other does by skill and as the artist is often unsuccessful while the mountebank succeeds so farces more commonly take the people than comedies for to write unnatural things is the most probable way of pleasing them who understand not nature and a true poet often misses of applause because he cannot debase himself to write so ill as to please his audience  after all it is to be acknowledged that most of those comedies which have been lately written have been allied too much to farce and this must of necessity fall out till we forbear the translation of french plays for their poets wanting judgment to make or to maintain true characters strive to cover their defects with ridiculous figures and grimaces while i say this i accuse myself as well as others and this very play would rise up in judgment against me if i would defend all things i have written to be natural but i confess i have given too much to the people in it and am ashamed for them as well as for myself that i have pleased them at so cheap a rate not that there is any thing here which i would not defend to an illnatured judge for i despise their censures who i am sure would write worse on the same subject but because i love to deal clearly and plainly and to speak of my own faults with more criticism than i would of another poets yet i think it no vanity to say that this comedy has as much of entertainment in it as many others which have been lately written and if i find my own errors in it i am able at the same time to arraign all my contemporaries for greater as i pretend not that i can write humour so none of them can reasonably pretend to have written it as they ought jonson was the only man of all ages and nations who has performed it well and that but in three or four of his comedies the rest are but a crambe bis cocta the same humours a little varied and written worse neither was it more allowable in him than it is in our present poets to represent the follies of particular persons of which many have accused him parcere personis dicere de vitiis is the rule of plays and horace tells you that the old comedy amongst the grecians was silenced for the too great liberties of the poets      in vitium libertas excidit et vim     dignam lege regi lex est accepta chorusque     turpiter obticuit sublato jure nocendi  of which he gives you the reason in another place where having given the precept      neve immunda crepent ignominiosaque dicta  he immediately subjoins      offenduntur enim quibus est equus et pater et res  but ben jonson is to be admired for many excellencies and can be taxed with fewer failings than any english poet i know i have been accused as an enemy of his writings but without any other reason than that i do not admire him blindly and without looking into his imperfections for why should he only be exempted from those frailties from which homer and virgil are not free or why should there be any ipse dixit in our poetry any more than there is in our philosophy i admire and applaud him where i ought those who do more do but value themselves in their admiration of him and by telling you they extol ben jonsons way would insinuate to you that they can practise it for my part i declare that i want judgment to imitate him and should think it a great impudence in myself to attempt it to make men appear pleasantly ridiculous on the stage was as i have said his talent and in this he needed not the acumen of wit but that of judgment for the characters and representations of folly are only the effects of observation and observation is an effect of judgment some ingenious men for whom i have a particular esteem have thought i have much injured ben jonson when i have not allowed his wit to be extraordinary but they confound the notion of what is witty with what is pleasant that ben jonsons plays were pleasant he must want reason who denies but that pleasantness was not properly wit or the sharpness of conceit but the natural imitation of folly which i confess to be excellent in its kind but not to be of that kind which they pretend yet if we will believe quintilian in his chapter de movendo risu he gives his opinion of both in these following words stulta reprehendere facillimum est nam per se sunt ridicula et √† derisu non procul abest risus sed rem urbanam facit aliqua ex nobis adjectio  and some perhaps would be apt to say of jonson as it was said of demosthenesnon displicuisse illi jocos sed non contigisse i will not deny but that i approve most the mixt way of comedy that which is neither all wit nor all humour but the result of both neither so little of humour as fletcher shews nor so little of love and wit as jonson neither all cheat with which the best plays of the one are filled nor all adventure which is the common practice of the other i would have the characters well chosen and kept distant from interfering with each other which is more than fletcher or shakespeare did but i would have more of the urbana venusta salsa faceta and the rest which quintilian reckons up as the ornaments of wit and these are extremely wanting in ben jonson as for repartee in particular as it is the very soul of conversation so it is the greatest grace of comedy where it is proper to the characters there may be much of acuteness in a thing well said but there is more in a quick reply sunt enim long√® venustiora omnia in respondendo qu√†m in provocando of one thing i am sure that no man ever will decry wit but he who despairs of it himself and who has no other quarrel to it but that which the fox had to the grapes yet as mr cowley who had a greater portion of it than any man i know tells us in his character of witrather than all wit let there be none i think there is no folly so great in any poet of our age as the superfluity and waste of wit was in some of our predecessors particularly we may say of fletcher and of shakespeare what was said of ovid in omni ejus ingenio facilius quod rejici qu√†m quod adjici potest invenies the contrary of which was true in virgil and our incomparable jonson  some enemies of repartee have observed to us that there is a great latitude in their characters which are made to speak it and that it is easier to write wit than humour because in the characters of humour the poet is confined to make the person speak what is only proper to it whereas all kind of wit is proper in the character of a witty person but by their favour there are as different characters in wit as in folly neither is all kind of wit proper in the mouth of every ingenious person a witty coward and a witty brave must speak differently falstaff and the liar speak not like don john in the chances and valentine in wit without money and jonsons truewit in the silent woman is a character different from all of them yet it appears that this one character of wit was more difficult to the author than all his images of humour in the play for those he could describe and manage from his observations of men this he has taken at least a part of it from books witness the speeches in the first act translated verbatim out of ovid de arte amandi to omit what afterwards he borrowed from the sixth satire of juvenal against women  however if i should grant that there were a greater latitude in characters of wit than in those of humour yet that latitude would be of small advantage to such poets who have too narrow an imagination to write it and to entertain an audience perpetually with humour is to carry them from the conversation of gentlemen and treat them with the follies and extravagancies of bedlam  i find i have launched out farther than i intended in the beginning of this preface and that in the heat of writing i have touched at something which i thought to have avoided it is time now to draw homeward and to think rather of defending myself than assaulting others i have already acknowledged that this play is far from perfect but i do not think myself obliged to discover the imperfections of it to my adversaries any more than a guilty person is bound to accuse himself before his judges it is charged upon me that i make debauched persons such as they say my astrologer and gamester are my protagonists or the chief persons of the drama and that i make them happy in the conclusion of my play against the law of comedy which is to reward virtue and punish vice i answer first that i know no such law to have been constantly observed in comedy either by the ancient or modern poets ch√¶rea is made happy in the eunuch after having deflowered a virgin and terence generally does the same through all his plays where you perpetually see not only debauched young men enjoy their mistresses but even the courtezans themselves rewarded and honoured in the catastrophe the same may be observed in plautus almost everywhere ben jonson himself after whom i may be proud to err has given me more than once the example of it that in the alchemist is notorious where face after having contrived and carried on the great cozenage of the play and continued in it without repentance to the last is not only forgiven by his master but enriched by his consent with the spoils of those whom he had cheated and which is more his master himself a grave man and a widower is introduced taking his mans counsel debauching the widow first in hope to marry her afterward in the silent woman dauphine who with the other two gentlemen is of the same character with my celadon in the maiden queen and with wildblood in this professes himself in love with all the collegiate ladies and they likewise are all of the same character with each other excepting only madam otter who has something singular yet this naughty dauphine is crowned in the end with the possession of his uncles estate and with the hopes of enjoying all his mistresses and his friend mr truewit the best character of a gentleman which ben jonson ever made is not ashamed to pimp for him as for beaumont and fletcher i need not allege examples out of them for that were to quote almost all their comedies but now it will be objected that i patronise vice by the authority of former poets and extenuate my own faults by recrimination i answer that as i defend myself by their example so that example i defend by reason and by the end of all dramatic poesy in the first place therefore give me leave to shew you their mistake who have accused me they have not distinguished as they ought betwixt the rules of tragedy and comedy in tragedy where the actions and persons are great and the crimes horrid the laws of justice are more strictly observed and examples of punishment to be made to deter mankind from the pursuit of vice faults of this kind have been rare amongst the ancient poets for they have punished in oedipus and in his posterity the sin which he knew not he had committed medea is the only example i remember at present who escapes from punishment after murder thus tragedy fulfils one great part of its institution which is by example to instruct but in comedy it is not so for the chief end of it is divertisement and delight and that so much that it is disputed i think by heinsius before horaces art of poetry whether instruction be any part of its employment at least i am sure it can be but its secondary end for the business of the poet is to make you laugh when he writes humour he makes folly ridiculous when wit he moves you if not always to laughter yet to a pleasure that is more noble and if he works a cure on folly and the small imperfections in mankind by exposing them to public view that cure is not performed by an immediate operation for it works first on the illnature of the audience they are moved to laugh by the representation of deformity and the shame of that laughter teaches us to amend what is ridiculous in our manners this being then established that the first end of comedy is delight and instruction only the second it may reasonably be inferred that comedy is not so much obliged to the punishment of faults which it represents as tragedy for the persons in comedy are of a lower quality the action is little and the faults and vices are but the sallies of youth and the frailties of human nature and not premeditated crimes such to which all men are obnoxious not such as are attempted only by few and those abandoned to all sense of virtue such as move pity and commiseration not detestation and horror such in short as may be forgiven not such as must of necessity be punished but lest any man should think that i write this to make libertinism amiable or that i cared not to debase the end and institution of comedy so i might thereby maintain my own errors and those of better poets i must further declare both for them and for myself that we make not vicious persons happy but only as heaven makes sinners so that is by reclaiming them first from vice for so it is to be supposed they are when they resolve to marry for then enjoying what they desire in one they cease to pursue the love of many so ch√¶rea is made happy by terence in marrying her whom he had deflowered and so are wildblood and the astrologer in this play  there is another crime with which i am charged at which i am yet much less concerned because it does not relate to my manners as the former did but only to my reputation as a poet a name of which i assure the reader i am nothing proud and therefore cannot be very solicitous to defend it i am taxed with stealing all my plays and that by some who should be the last men from whom i would steal any part of them there is one answer which i will not make but it has been made for me by him to whose grace and patronage i owe all things      et spes et ratio studiorum in c√¶sare tantum  and without whose command they should no longer be troubled with any thing of minethat he only desired that they who accused me of theft would always steal him plays like mine but though i have reason to be proud of this defence yet i should wave it because i have a worse opinion of my own comedies than any of my enemies can have it is true that wherever i have liked any story in a romance novel or foreign play i have made no difficulty nor ever shall to take the foundation of it to build it up and to make it proper for the english stage and i will be so vain to say it has lost nothing in my hands but it always cost me so much trouble to heighten it for our theatre which is incomparably more curious in all the ornaments of dramatic poesy than the french or spanish that when i had finished my play it was like the hulk of sir francis drake so strangely altered that there scarcely remained any plank of the timber which first built it to witness this i need go no farther than this play it was first spanish and called el astrologo fingido then made french by the younger corneille and is now translated into english and in print under the name of the feigned astrologer what i have performed in this will best appear by comparing it with those you will see that i have rejected some adventures which i judged were not divertising that i have heightened those which i have chosen and that i have added others which were neither in the french nor spanish and besides you will easily discover that the walk of the astrologer is the least considerable in my play for the design of it turns more on the parts of wildblood and jacinta who are the chief persons in it i have farther to add that i seldom use the wit and language of any romance or play which i undertake to alter because my own invention as bad as it is can furnish me with nothing so dull as what is there those who have called virgil terence and tasso plagiaries though they much injured them had yet a better colour for their accusation for virgil has evidently translated theocritus hesiod and homer in many places besides what he has taken from ennius in his own language terence was not only known to translate menander which he avows also in his prologues but was said also to be helped in those translations by scipio the african and l√¶lius and tasso the most excellent of modern poets and whom i reverence next to virgil has taken both from homer many admirable things which were left untouched by virgil and from virgil himself where homer could not furnish him yet the bodies of virgils and tassos poems were their own and so are all the ornaments of language and elocution in them the same if there were any thing commendable in this play i could say for it but i will come nearer to our own countrymen most of shakespeares plays i mean the stories of them are to be found in the hecatomithi or hundred novels of cinthio i have myself read in his italian that of romeo and juliet the moor of venice and many others of them beaumont and fletcher had most of theirs from spanish novels witness the chances the spanish curate rule a wife and have a wife the little french lawyer and so many others of them as compose the greatest part of their volume in folio ben jonson indeed has designed his plots himself but no man has borrowed so much from the ancients as he has done and he did well in it for he has thereby beautified our language  but these little critics do not well consider what is the work of a poet and what the graces of a poem the story is the least part of either i mean the foundation of it before it is modelled by the art of him who writes it who forms it with more care by exposing only the beautiful parts of it to view than a skilful lapidary sets a jewel on this foundation of the story the characters are raised and since no story can afford characters enough for the variety of the english stage it follows that it is to be altered and enlarged with new persons accidents and designs which will almost make it new when this is done the forming it into acts and scenes disposing of actions and passions into their proper places and beautifying both with descriptions similitudes and propriety of language is the principal employment of the poet as being the largest field of fancy which is the principal quality required in him for so much the word greek poi√™t√™s implies judgment indeed is necessary in him but it is fancy that gives the lifetouches and the secret graces to it especially in serious plays which depend not much on observation for to write humour in comedy which is the theft of poets from mankind little of fancy is required the poet observes only what is ridiculous and pleasant folly and by judging exactly what is so he pleases in the representation of it  but in general the employment of a poet is like that of a curious gunsmith or watchmaker the iron or silver is not his own but they are the least part of that which gives the value the price lies wholly in the workmanship and he who works dully on a story without moving laughter in a comedy or raising concernment in a serious play is no more to be accounted a good poet than a gunsmith of the minories is to be compared with the best workman of the town  but i have said more of this than i intended and more perhaps than i needed to have done i shall but laugh at them hereafter who accuse me with so little reason and withal contemn their dulness who if they could ruin that little reputation i have got and which i value not yet would want both wit and learning to establish their own or to be remembered in after ages for any thing but only that which makes them ridiculous in this     prologue     when first our poet set himself to write   like a young bridegroom on his weddingnight   he laid about him and did so bestir him   his muse could never lie in quiet for him   but now his honeymoon is gone and past   yet the ungrateful drudgery must last   and he is bound as civil husbands do   to strain himself in complaisance to you   to write in pain and counterfeit a bliss   like the faint smacking of an afterkiss   but you like wives ill pleased supply his want   each writing monsieur is a fresh gallant   and though perhaps twas done as well before   yet still theres something in a new amour   your several poets work with several tools   one gets you wits another gets you fools   this pleases you with

soon fell flat before ye   their useless weight with patience long was born   but at the last you threw them off with scorn   as for the poet of this present night                 though now he claims in you a husbands right         he will not hinder you of fresh delight               he like a seaman seldom will appear   and means to trouble home but thrice ayear   that only time from your

treachery could have been in nature especially to a lady who had so obliged him  lop twas this madam which gave me the confidence to wait upon you at an hour which would be otherwise unseasonable  aur you are the most obliging person in the world  lop but to clear it to you that he is false he is at this very minute at an assignation with your cousin in the garden i am sure he was endeavouring it not an hour ago  aur i swear this evenings air begins to incommode me extremely with a cold but yet in hope of detecting this perjured man i am content to stay abroad  lop but withal you must permit me to tell you madam that it is but just i should have some share in a heart which i endeavour to redeem in the law of arms you know that they who pay the ransom have right to dispose of the prisoner  aur the prize is so very inconsiderable that tis not worth the claiming  lop if i thought the boon were small i would not importune my princess with the asking it but since my life depends upon the grant  cam maam i must needs tell your laship that don lopez has deserved you for he has acted all along like a cavalier and more for your interest than his own besides maam don melchor is as poor as he is false for my part i shall never endure to call him master  aur don lopez go along with me i can promise nothing but i swear i will do my best to disengage my heart from this furious tender which i have for him  cam if i had been a man i could never have forsaken you ah those languishing casts maam and that pouting lip of your laship like a cherrybough weighed down with the weight of fruit

lopez is too noble to be refused any thing within my power and i am ready to do him any service after i have asked my cousin if ever don melchor pretended to her  aur tis the very question which i was furiously resolved to have asked of you  theo i must confess he has made some professions to me and withal i will acknowledge my own weakness so far as to tell you i have given way he should often visit me when the world believed him absent  aur o cavalier astrologer how have you betrayed me did you not assure me that don melchors tender and inclination was for me only  bel i had it from his star madam i do assure you and if that twinkled false i cannot help it the truth is theres no trusting the planet of an inconstant man he was moving to you when i looked on it and if since it has changed the course i am not to be blamed for it  lop now madam the truth is evident and for this cavalier he might easily be deceived in melchor for i dare affirm it to you both he never knew to which of you he was most inclined for he visited one and writ letters to the other  bel to theo then madam i must claim your promise since i have discovered to you that don melchor is unworthy of your favours that you would make me happy who amongst my many imperfections can never be guilty of such a falsehood  theo if i have been deceived in melchor whom i have known so long you cannot reasonably expect i should trust you at a days acquaintance  bel for that madam you may know as much of me in a day as you can in all your life all my humours circulate like my blood at farthest within

speak for me too my cause is the same with yours only it has not so good an advocate  aur since i cannot make myself happy i will have the glory to felicitate another and therefore i declare i will

for a judgment or a wit   like jews i saw them scattered through the pit   and where a knot of smilers lent an ear   to one that talked i knew the foe was there   the club of jests went round he who had none   borrowed othe next and told it for his own   among the rest they kept a fearful stir   in whispering that he stole the astrologer   and said betwixt a french and english plot   he eased his halftired muse on pace and trot   up starts a monsieur new come oer and warm   in the french stoop and the pullback othe arm   morbleu dit il and cocks i am a rogue   but he has quite spoiled the feigned astrologue   pox says another heres so great a stir   with a son of a whore farce thats regular   a rule where nothing must decorum shock   damme tis as dull as dining by the clock   an evening why the devil should we be vext   whether he gets the wench this night or next   when i heard this i to the poet went              told him the house was full of discontent          and asked him what excuse he could invent          he neither swore or stormed as poets do   but most unlike an author vowed twas true   yet said he used the french like enemies   and did not steal their plots but made them prize   but should he all the pains and charges count   of taking them the bill so high would mount   that like prizegoods which through the office come   he could have had them much more cheap at home   he still must write and banquierlike each day   accept new bills and he must break or pay   when through his hands such sums must yearly run   you cannot think the stock is all his own   his haste his other errors might excuse   but theres no mercy for a guilty muse   for like a mistress she must stand or fall   and please you to a height or not at all       tyrannic love    or the    royal martyr    a    tragedy     tyrannic love   the royal martyr is one of drydens most characteristic productions the character of maximin in particular is drawn on his boldest plan and only equalled by that of almanzor in the conquest of granada indeed although in action the latter exhibits a larger proportion of that extravagant achievement peculiar to the heroic drama it may be questioned whether the language of maximin does not abound more with the flights of fancy which hover betwixt the confines of the grand and the bombast and which our author himself has aptly termed the dalilahs of the theatre certainly in some of those rants which occasionally burst from the emperor our poet appears shorn of his locks as for example      look to it gods for you the aggressors are     keep you your rain and sunshine in your skies     and ill keep back my flame and sacrifice     your trade of heaven will soon be at a stand     and all your goods lie dead upon your hand  indeed dryden himself acknowledged in the dedication to the spanish friar that some verses of maximin and almanzor cry vengeance upon him for their extravagance and heartily wishes them in the same fire with statius and chapman but he pleads in apology that he knew they were bad enough to please even when he wrote them although he is now resolved no longer to seek credit from the approbation of fools johnson has doubted with apparent reason whether this confession be sufficiently ample and whether the poet did not really give his love to those enticing seducers of his imagination although he contemned them in his more sober judgment in the prologue he has boldly stated and justified his determination to rush forwards and hazard the disgrace of a fall rather than the loss of the race certainly a genius which dared so greatly as that of dryden cannot always be expected to check its flight upon the verge of propriety and we are often hurried along with it into the extravagant and bombast when we can seldom discover the error till a second reading of the passage take for example the often quoted account of the death of charinus      with a fierce haste he led our troops the way     while fiery showers of sulphur on him rained     nor left he till the battlements he gained     there with a forest of their darts he strove     and stood like capaneus defying jove     with his broad sword the boldest beating down     while fate grew pale lest he should win the town     and turned the iron leaves of its dark book     to make new dooms or mend what it mistook     till sought by many deaths he sunk though late     and by his fall asserted doubtful fate  although this passage upon examination will be found to contain much tumid bombast yet like others in the same tone it conveys at first a dark impression of grandeur and sublimity which only vanishes on a critical examination such passages pronounced with due emphasis on the stage will always meet with popular applause they are like the fanciful shapes into which a mist is often wreathed it requires a near approach and an attentive consideration to discover their emptiness and vanity on the other hand we meet with many passages in maximin where the impression of sublimity becomes more deep in proportion to the attention we bestow on them such is the speech of st catharine to her mother      could we live always life were worth our cost     but now we keep with care what must be lost     here we stand shivering on the bank and cry     when we should plunge into eternity     one moment ends our pain     and yet the shock of death we dare not stand     by thought scarce measured and too swift for sand     tis but because the living death neer knew     they fear to prove it as a thing thats new     let me the experiment before you try     ill show you first how easy tis to die  in the same scene occurs an instance of a different kind of beauty less commonly found in dryden the tender description given by felicia of her attachment to her child in infancy is exquisitely beautiful  the introduction of magic and of the astral spirits who have little to do with the catastrophe was perhaps contrived for the sake of music and scenery the supernatural has however been fashionable at all periods and we learn from a passage in the dedication to prince arthur that the duchess of monmouth whom dryden calls his first and best patroness was pleased with the parts of airy and earthy spirits and with that fairy kind of writing which depends upon the force of imagination it is probable therefore that in a play inscribed to her husband that style of composition was judiciously intermingled to which our poet knew the duchess was partial there is much fine description in the first account of the wizard but the lyrical dialogue of the spirits is rather puerile and is ridiculed with great severity in the rehearsal  mr malone has fixed the first acting of this play to the end of 1668 or beginning of 1669 it was printed in 1670 and a revised edition came forth in 1672       to the most illustrious prince    james    duke of monmouth and buccleugh    one of his majestys most honourable privycouncil and knight of the   most noble order of the garter ck   sir  the favourable reception which your excellent lady afforded to one of my former playsl has encouraged me to double my presumption in addressing this to your graces patronage so dangerous a thing it is to admit a poet into your family that you can never afterwards be free from the chiming of ill verses perpetually sounding in your ears and more troublesome than the neighbourhood of steeples i have been favourable to myself in this expression a zealous fanatick would have gone farther and have called me the serpent who first presented the fruit of my poetry to the wife and so gained the opportunity to seduce the husband yet i am ready to avow a crime so advantageous to me but the world which will condemn my boldness i am sure will justify and applaud my choice all men will join with me in the adoration which i pay you they would wish only i had brought you a more noble sacrifice instead of an heroick play you might justly expect an heroick poem filled with the past glories of your ancestors and the future certainties of your own heaven has already taken care to form you for an hero you

want a homer or a tasso to make you equal to them youth beauty and courage all which you possess in the height of their perfection are the most desirable gifts of heaven and heaven is never prodigal of such treasures but to some uncommon purpose so goodly a fabric was never framed by an almighty architect for a vulgar guest he shewed the value which he set upon your mind when he took care to have it so nobly and so beautifully lodged to a graceful fashion and deportment of body you have joined a winning conversation and an easy greatness derived to you from the best and bestbeloved of princes and with a great power of obliging the world has observed in you a desire to oblige even beyond your power this and all that i can say on so excellent and large a subject is only history in which fiction has no part i can employ nothing of poetry in it any more than i do in that humble protestation which i make to continue ever      your graces most obedient            and most devoted servant                           john dryden  footnote k for some account of the duke of monmouth we refer our readers to the poem of absalom and achitophel in which dryden has described that unfortunate young nobleman under the character of absalom  footnote l see the dedication to the indian emperor     preface  i was moved to write this play by many reasons amongst others the commands of some persons of honour for whom i have a most particular respect were daily sounding in my ears that it would be of good example to undertake a poem of this nature neither were my own inclinations wanting to second their desires i considered that pleasure was not the only end of poesy and that even the instructions of morality were not so wholly the business of a poet as that the precepts and examples of piety were to be omitted for to leave that employment altogether to the clergy were to forget that religion was first taught in verse which the laziness or dulness of succeeding priesthood turned afterwards into prose and it were also to grant which i never shall that representations of this kind may not as well be conducing to holiness as to good manners yet far be it from me to compare the use of dramatick poesy with that of divinity i only maintain against the enemies of the stage that patterns of piety decently represented and equally removed from the extremes of superstition and profaneness may be of excellent use to second the precepts of our religion by the harmony of words we elevate the mind to a sense of devotion as our solemn musick which is inarticulate poesy does in churches and by the lively images of piety adorned by action through the senses allure the soul which while it is charmed in a silent joy of what it sees and hears is struck at the same time with a secret veneration of things celestial and is wound up insensibly into the practice of that which it admires now if instead of this we sometimes see on our theatres the examples of vice rewarded or at least unpunished yet it ought not to be an argument against the art any more than the extravagances and impieties of the pulpit in the late times of rebellion can be against the office and dignity of the clergy  but many times it happens that poets are wrongfully accused as it is my own case in this very play where i am charged by some ignorant or malicious persons with no less crimes than profaneness and irreligion  the part of maximin against which these holy critics so much declaim was designed by me to set off the character of st catharine and those who have read the roman history may easily remember that maximin was not only a bloody tyrant vastus corpore animo ferus as herodian describes him but also a persecutor of the church against which he raised the sixth persecution so that whatsoever he speaks or acts in this tragedy is no more than a record of his life and manners a picture as near as i could take it from the original if with much pains and some success i have drawn a deformed piece there is as much of art and as near an imitation of nature in a lazar as in a venus maximin was an heathen and what he speaks against religion is in contempt of that which he professed he defies the gods of rome which is no more than st catharine might with decency have done if it be urged that a person of such principles who scoffs at any religion ought not to be presented on the stage why then are the lives and sayings of so many wicked and profane persons recorded in the holy scriptures i know it will be answered that a due use may be made of them that they are remembered with a brand of infamy fixed upon them and set as seamarks for those who behold them to avoid and what other use have i made of maximin have i proposed him as a pattern to be imitated whom even for his impiety to his false gods i have so severely punished nay as if i had foreseen this objection i purposely removed the scene of the play which ought to have been at alexandria in egypt where st catharine suffered and laid it under the walls of aquileia in italy where maximin was slain that the punishment of his crime might immediately succeed its execution  this reader is what i owed to my just defence and the due reverence of that religion which i profess to which all men who desire to be esteemed good or honest are obliged i have neither leisure nor occasion to write more largely on this subject because i am already justified by the sentence of the best and most discerning prince in the world by the suffrage of all unbiassed judges and above all by the witness of my own conscience which abhors the thought of such a crime to which i ask leave to add my outward conversation which shall never be justly taxed with the note of atheism or profaneness  in what else concerns the play i shall be brief for the faults of the writing and contrivance i leave them to the mercy of the reader for i am as little apt to defend my own errors as to find those of other poets only i observe that the great censors of wit and poetry either produce nothing of their own or what is more ridiculous than any thing they reprehend much of ill nature and a very little judgment go far in finding the mistakes of writers  i pretend not that any thing of mine can be correct this poem especially which was contrived and written in seven weeks though afterwards hindered by many accidents from a speedy representation which would have been its just excuse  yet the scenes are every where unbroken and the unities of place and time more exactly kept than perhaps is requisite in a tragedy or at least than i have since preserved them in the conquest of granada  i have not everywhere observed the equality of numbers in my verse partly by reason of my haste but more especially because i would not have my sense a slave to syllables  it is easy to discover that i have been very bold in my alteration of the story which of itself was too barren for a play and that i have taken from the church two martyrs in the persons of porphyrius and the empress who suffered for the christian faith under the tyranny of maximin  i have seen a french play called the martyrdom of st catharine but those who have read it will soon clear me from stealing out of so dull an author i have only borrowed a mistake from him of one maximin for another for finding him in the french poet called the son of a thracian herdsman and an alane woman i too easily believed him to have been the same maximin mentioned in herodian till afterwards consulting eusebius and metaphrastes i found the frenchman had betrayed me into an error when it was too late to alter it by mistaking that first maximin for a second the contemporary of constantine the great and one of the usurpers of the eastern empire  but neither was the other name of my play more fortunate for as some who had heard of a tragedy of st catharine imagined i had taken my plot from thence so others who had heard of another play called lamour tyrannique with the same ignorance accused me to have borrowed my design from it because i have accidentally given my play the same title not having to this day seen it and knowing only by report that such a comedy is extant in french under the name of monsieur scudery  as for what i have said of astral or a√´rial spirits it is no invention of mine but taken from those who have written on that subject whether there are such beings or not it concerns not me it is sufficient for my purpose that many have believed the affirmative and that these heroic representations which are of the same nature with the epic are not limited but with the extremest bounds of what is credible  for the little critics who pleased themselves with thinking they have found a flaw in that line of the prologue      and he who servilely creeps after sense is safe cm  as if i patronized my own nonsense i may reasonably suppose they have never read horace serpit humi tutus c are his words he who creeps after plain dull common sense is safe from committing absurdities but can never reach any height or excellence of wit and sure i could not mean that any excellence were to be found in nonsense with the same ignorance or malice they would accuse me for usingempty arms when i write of a ghost or shadow which has only the appearance of a body or limbs and is empty or void of flesh and blood and vacuis amplectitur ulnis was an expression of ovids on the same subject some fool before them had charged me in the indian emperor with nonsense in these words      and follow fate which does too fast pursue  which was borrowed from virgil in the eleventh of his √Üneids      eludit gyro interior sequiturque sequentemn  i quote not these to prove that i never writ nonsense but only to shew that they are so unfortunate as not to have found it                                                                vale   footnote m see the prologue to this play  footnote n we may be allowed to suspect that this resemblance was discovered ex post facto     prologue     selflove which never rightly understood   makes poets still conclude their plays are good   and malice in all critics reigns so high   that for small errors they whole plays decry   so that to see this fondness and that spite   youd think that none but madmen judge or write   therefore our poet as he thinks not fit   t impose upon you what he writes for wit   so hopes that leaving you your censures free         you equal judges of the whole will be                  they judge but half who only faults will see          poets like lovers should be bold and dare   they spoil their business with an overcare   and he who servilely creeps after sense   is safe but neer will reach an excellence   hence tis our poet in his conjuring   allowed his fancy the full scope and swing   but when a tyrant for his theme he had   he loosed the reins and bid his muse run mad   and though he stumbles in a full career   yet rashness is a better fault than fear   he saw his way but in so swift a pace   to chuse the ground might be to lose the race   they then who of each trip the advantage take   find but those faults which they
