54012552	the abbots ghost  or maurice trehernes temptation  a christmas story  by am barnard  1867        chapter i   dramatis personae  how goes it frank down first as usual  the early bird gets the worm major  deuced ungallant speech considering that the lovely octavia is the worm and with a significant laugh the major assumed an englishmans favorite attitude before the fire  his companion shot a quick glance at him and an expression of anxiety passed over his face as he replied with a wellfeigned air of indifference you are altogether too sharp major i must be on my guard while you are in the house any new arrivals i thought i heard a carriage drive up not long ago  it was general snowdon and his charming wife maurice treherne came while we were out and ive not seen him yet poor fellow  aye you may well say that his is a hard case if what i heard is true im not booked up in the matter and i should be lest i make some blunder here so tell me how things stand major weve a good half hour before dinner sir jasper is never punctual  yes youve a right to know if you are going to try your fortune with octavia  the major marched through the three drawing rooms to see that no inquisitive servant was eavesdropping and finding all deserted he resumed his place while young annon lounged on a couch as he listened with intense interest to the majors story  you know it was supposed that old sir jasper being a bachelor would leave his fortune to his two nephews but he was an oddity and as the title must go to young jasper by right the old man said maurice should have the money he was poor young jasper rich and it seemed but just though madame mère was very angry when she learned how the will was made  but maurice didnt get the fortune how was that  there was some mystery there which i shall discover in time all went smoothly till that unlucky yachting trip when the cousins were wrecked maurice saved jaspers life and almost lost his own in so doing i fancy he wishes he had rather than remain the poor cripple he is exposure exertion and neglect afterward brought on paralysis of the lower limbs and there he isa fine talented spirited fellow tied to that cursed chair like a decrepit old man  how does he bear it asked annon as the major shook his gray head with a traitorous huskiness in his last words  like a philosopher or a hero he is too proud to show his despair at such a sudden end to all his hopes too generous to complain for jasper is desperately cut up about it and too brave to be daunted by a misfortune which would drive many a man mad  is it true that sir jasper knowing all this made a new will and left every cent to his namesake  yes and there lies the mystery not only did he leave it away from poor maurice but so tied it up that jasper cannot transfer it and at his death it goes to octavia  the old man must have been demented what in heavens name did he mean by leaving maurice helpless and penniless after all his devotion to jasper had he done anything to offend the old party  no one knows maurice hasnt the least idea of the cause of this sudden whim and the old man would give no reason for it he died soon after and the instant jasper came to the title and estate he brought his cousin home and treats him like a brother jasper is a noble fellow with all his faults and this act of justice increases my respect for him said the major heartily  what will maurice do now that he cant enter the army as he intended asked annon who now sat erect so full of interest was he  marry octavia and come to his own i hope  an excellent little arrangement but miss treherne may object said annon rising with sudden kindling of the eye  i think not if no one interferes pity with women is akin to love and she pities her cousin in the tenderest fashion no sister could be more devoted and as maurice is a handsome talented fellow one can easily foresee the end if as i said before no one interferes to disappoint the poor lad again  you espouse his cause i see and tell me this that i may stand aside thanks for the warning major but as maurice treherne is a man of unusual power in many ways i think we are equally matched in spite of his misfortune nay if anything he has the advantage of me for miss treherne pities him and that is a strong ally for my rival ill be as generous as i can but ill not stand aside and relinquish the woman i love without a trial first  with an air of determination annon faced the major whose keen eyes had read the truth which he had but newly confessed to himself major royston smiled as he listened and said briefly as steps approached do your best maurice will win  we shall see returned annon between his teeth  here their host entered and the subject of course was dropped but the majors words rankled in the young mans mind and would have been doubly bitter had he known that their confidential conversation had been overheard on either side of the great fireplace was a door leading to a suite of rooms which had been old sir jaspers these apartments had been given to maurice treherne and he had just returned from london whither he had been to consult a certain famous physician entering quietly he had taken possession of his rooms and having rested and dressed for dinner rolled himself into the library to which led the curtained door on the right sitting idly in his light wheeled chair ready to enter when his cousin appeared he had heard the chat of annon and the major as he listened over his usually impassive face passed varying expressions of anger pain bitterness and defiance and when the young man uttered his almost fierce we shall see treherne smiled a scornful smile and clenched his pale hand with a gesture which proved that a year of suffering had not conquered the mans spirit though it had crippled his strong body  a singular face was maurice trehernes wellcut and somewhat haughty features a fine brow under the dark locks that carelessly streaked it and remarkably piercing eyes slight in figure and wasted by pain he still retained the grace as native to him as the stern fortitude which enabled him to hide the deep despair of an ambitious nature from every eye and bear his affliction with a cheerful philosophy more pathetic than the most entire abandonment to grief carefully dressed and with no hint at invalidism but the chair he bore himself as easily and calmly as if the doom of lifelong helplessness did not hang over him a single motion of the hand sent him rolling noiselessly to the curtained door but as he did so a voice exclaimed behind him wait for me cousin and as he turned a young girl approached smiling a glad welcome as she took his hand adding in a tone of soft reproach home again and not let me know it till i heard the good news by accident  was it good news octavia and maurice looked up at the frank face with a new expression in those penetrating eyes of his his cousins open glance never changed as she stroked the hair off his forehead with the caress one often gives a child and answered eagerly the best to me the house is dull when you are away for jasper always becomes absorbed in horses and hounds and leaves mamma and me to mope by ourselves but tell me maurice what they said to you since you would not write  a little hope with time and patience help me to wait dear help me to wait  his tone was infinitely sad and as he spoke he leaned his cheek against the kind hand he held as if to find support and comfort there the girls face brightened beautifully though her eyes filled for to her alone did he betray his pain and in her alone did he seek consolation  i will i will with heart and hand thank heaven for the hope and trust me it shall be fulfilled you look very tired maurice why go in to dinner with all those people let me make you cozy here she added anxiously  thanks id rather go in it does me good and if i stay away jasper feels that he must stay with me i dressed in haste am i right little nurse  she gave him a comprehensive glance daintily settled his cravat brushed back a truant lock and with a maternal air that was charming said my boy is always elegant and im proud of him now well go in but with her hand on the curtain she paused saying quickly as a voice reached her who is that  frank annon didnt you know he was coming maurice eyed her keenly  no jasper never told me why did he ask him  to please you  me when he knows i detest the man no matter ive got on the color he hates so he wont annoy me and mrs snowdon can amuse herself with him the general has come you know  treherne smiled well pleased for no sign of maiden shame or pleasure did the girls face betray and as he watched her while she peeped he thought with satisfaction annon is right i have the advantage and ill keep it at all costs  here is mamma we must go in said octavia as a stately old lady made her appearance in the drawing room  the cousins entered together and annon watched them covertly while seemingly intent on paying his respects to madame mère as his hostess was called by her family  handsomer than ever he muttered as his eye rested on the blooming girl looking more like a rose than ever in the peachcolored silk which he had once condemned because a rival admired it she turned to reply to the major and annon glanced at treherne with an irrepressible frown for sickness had not marred the charm of that peculiar face so colorless and thin that it seemed cut in marble but the keen eyes shone with a wonderful brilliancy and the whole countenance was alive with a power of intellect and will which made the observer involuntarily exclaim that man must suffer a daily martyrdom so crippled and confined if it last long he will go mad or die  general and mrs snowden announced the servant and a sudden pause ensued as everyone looked up to greet the newcomers  a feeble whitehaired old man entered leaning on the arm of an indescribably beautiful woman not thirty yet tall and nobly molded with straight black brows over magnificent eyes rippling dark hair gathered up in a great knot and ornamented with a single band of gold a sweeping dress of winecolored velvet set off with a dazzling neck and arms decorated like her stately head with ornaments of roman gold at the first glance she seemed a cold haughty creature born to dazzle but not to win a deeper scrutiny detected lines of suffering in that lovely face and behind the veil of reserve which pride forced her to wear appeared the anguish of a strongwilled woman burdened by a heavy cross no one would dare express pity or offer sympathy for her whole air repelled it and in her gloomy eyes sat scorn of herself mingled with defiance of the scorn of others a strange almost tragicallooking woman in spite of beauty grace and the cold sweetness of her manner a faint smile parted her lips as she greeted those about her and as her husband seated himself beside lady treherne she lifted her head with a long breath and a singular expression of relief as if a burden was removed and for the time being she was free sir jasper was at her side and as she listened her eye glanced from face to face  who is with you now she asked in a low mellow voice that was full of music  my sister and my cousin are yonder you may remember tavia as a child she is little more now maurice is an invalid but the finest fellow breathing  i understand and mrs snowdons eyes softened with a sudden glance of pity for one cousin and admiration for the other for she knew the facts  major royston my fathers friend and frank annon my own do you know him asked sir jasper  no  then allow me to make him happy by presenting him may i  not now id rather see your cousin  thanks you are very kind ill bring him over  stay let me go to him began the lady with more feeling in face and voice than one would believe her capable of showing  pardon it will offend him he will not be pitied or relinquish any of the duties or privileges of a gentleman which he can possibly perform he is proud we can understand the feeling so let us humor the poor fellow  mrs snowdon bowed silently and sir jasper called out in his hearty blunt way as if nothing was amiss with his cousin maurice ive an honor for you come and receive it  divining what it was treherne noiselessly crossed the room and with no sign of selfconsciousness or embarrassment was presented to the handsome woman thinking his presence might be a restraint sir jasper went away the instant his back was turned a change came over both an almost grim expression replaced the suavity of trehernes face and mrs snowdons smile faded suddenly while a deep flush rose to her brow as her eyes questioned his beseechingly  how dared you come he asked below his breath  the general insisted  and you could not change his purpose poor woman  you will not be pitied neither will i and her eyes flashed then the fire was quenched in tears and her voice lost all its pride in a pleading tone  forgive me i longed to see you since your illness and so i dared to come  you shall be gratified look quite helpless crippled for life perhaps  the chair was turned from the groups about the fire and as he spoke with a bitter laugh treherne threw back the skin which covered his knees and showed her the useless limbs once so strong and fleet she shrank and paled put out her hand to arrest him and cried in an indignant whisper no no not that you know i never meant such cruel curiosity such useless pain to both  be still someone is coming he returned inaudibly adding aloud as he adjusted the skin and smoothed the rich fur as if speaking of it yes it is a very fine one jasper gave it to me he spoils me like a dear generoushearted fellow as he is ah octavia what can i do for you  nothing thank you i want to recall myself to mrs snowdons memory if she will let me  no need of that i never forget happy faces and pretty pictures two years ago i saw you at your first ball and longed to be a girl again  as she spoke mrs snowdon pressed the hand shyly offered and smiled at the spirited face before her though the shadow in her own eyes deepened as she met the bright glance of the girl  how kind you were that night i remember you let me chatter away about my family my cousin and my foolish little affairs with the sweetest patience and made me very happy by your interest i was homesick and aunt could never bear to hear of those things it was before your marriage and all the kinder for you were the queen of the night yet had a word for poor little me  mrs snowdon was pale to the lips and maurice impatiently tapped the arm of his chair while the girl innocently chatted on  i am sorry the general is such an invalid yet i dare say you find great happiness in taking care of him it is so pleasant to be of use to those we love and as she spoke octavia leaned over her cousin to hand him the glove he had dropped  the affectionate smile that accompanied the act made the color deepen again in mrs snowdons cheek and lit a spark in her softened eyes her lips curled and her voice was sweetly sarcastic as she answered yes it is charming to devote ones life to these dear invalids and find ones reward in their gratitude youth beauty health and happiness are small sacrifices if one wins a little comfort for the poor sufferers  the girl felt the sarcasm under the soft words and drew back with a troubled face  maurice smiled and glanced from one to the other saying significantly well for me that my little nurse loves her labor and finds no sacrifice in it i am fortunate in my choice  i trust it may prove so mrs snowdon got no further for at that moment dinner was announced and sir jasper took her away annon approached with him and offered his arm to miss treherne but with an air of surprise and a little gesture of refusal she said coldly  my cousin always takes me in to dinner be good enough to escort the major and with her hand on the arm of the chair she walked away with a mischievous glitter in her eyes  annon frowned and fell back saying sharply come major what are you doing there  making discoveries     chapter ii   byplay  a right splendid old dowager was lady treherne in her black velvet and point lace as she sat erect and stately on a couch by the drawingroom fire a couch which no one dare occupy in her absence or share uninvited the gentlemen were still over their wine and the three ladies were alone my lady never dozed in public mrs snowdon never gossiped and octavia never troubled herself to entertain any guests but those of her own age so long pauses fell and conversation languished till mrs snowdon roamed away into the library as she disappeared lady treherne beckoned to her daughter who was idly making chords at the grand piano seating herself on the ottoman at her mothers feet the girl took the still handsome hand in her own and amused herself with examining the oldfashioned jewels that covered it a pretext for occupying her telltale eyes as she suspected what was coming  my dear im not pleased with you and i tell you so at once that you may amend your fault began madame mère in a tender tone for though a haughty imperious woman she idolized her children  what have i done mamma asked the girl  say rather what have you left undone you have been very rude to mr annon it must not occur again not only because he is a guest but because he is yourbrothers friend  my lady hesitated over the word lover and changed it for to her octavia still seemed a child and though anxious for the alliance she forbore to speak openly lest the girl should turn willful as she inherited her mothers high spirit  im sorry mamma but how can i help it when he teases me so that i detest him said octavia petulantly  how tease my love  why he follows me about like a dog puts on a sentimental look when i appear blushes and beams and bows at everything i say if i am polite frowns and sighs if im not and glowers tragically at every man i speak to even poor maurice oh mamma what foolish creatures men are and the girl laughed blithely as she looked up for the first time into her mothers face  my lady smiled as she stroked the bright head at her knee but asked quickly why say even poor maurice as if it were impossible for anyone to be jealous of him  but isnt it mamma i thought strong well men regarded him as one set apart and done with since his sad misfortune  not entirely while women pity and pet the poor fellow his comrades will be jealous absurd as it is  no one pets him but me and i have a right to do it for he is my cousin said the girl feeling a touch of jealousy herself  rose and blanche talbot outdo you my dear and there is no cousinship to excuse them  then let frank annon be jealous of them and leave me in peace they promised to come today im afraid something has happened to prevent them and octavia gladly seized upon the new subject but my lady was not to be eluded  they said they could not come till after dinner they will soon arrive before they do so i must say a few words tavia and i beg you to give heed to them i desire you to be courteous and amiable to mr annon and before strangers to be less attentive and affectionate to maurice you mean it kindly but it looks ill and causes disagreeable remarks  who blames me for being devoted to my cousin can i ever do enough to repay him for his devotion mamma you forget he saved your sons life  indignant tears filled the girls eyes and she spoke passionately forgetting that mrs snowdon was within earshot of her raised voice with a frown my lady laid her hand on her daughters lips saying coldly i do not forget and i religiously discharge my every obligation by every care and comfort it is in my power to bestow you are young romantic and tenderhearted you think you must give your time and health must sacrifice your future happiness to this duty you are wrong and unless you learn wisdom in season you will find that you have done harm not good  god forbid how can i do that tell me and i will be wise in time  turning the earnest face up to her own lady treherne whispered anxiously has maurice ever looked or hinted anything of love during this year he has been with us and you his constant companion  never mamma he is too honorable and too unhappy to speak or think of that i am his little nurse sister and friend no more nor ever shall be do not suspect us or put such fears into my mind else all our comfort will be spoiled  flushed and eager was the girl but her clear eyes betrayed no tender confusion as she spoke and all her thought seemed to be to clear her cousin from the charge of loving her too well lady treherne looked relieved paused a moment then said seriously but gently this is well but child i charge you tell me at once if ever he forgets himself for this thing cannot be once i hoped it might now it is impossible remember that he continue a friend and cousin nothing more i warn you in time but if you neglect the warning maurice must go no more of this recollect my wish regarding mr annon and let your cousin amuse himself without you in public  mamma do you wish me to like frank annon  the abrupt question rather disturbed my lady but knowing her daughters frank impetuous nature she felt somewhat relieved by this candor and answered decidedly i do he is your equal in all respects he loves you jasper desires it i approve and you being heartwhole can have no just objection to the alliance  has he spoken to you  no to your brother  you wish this much mamma  very much my child  i will try to please you then and stifling a sigh the girl kissed her mother with unwonted meekness in tone and manner  now i am well pleased be happy my love no one will urge or distress you let matters take their course and if this hope of ours can be fulfilled i shall be relieved of the chief care of my life  a sound of girlish voices here broke on their ears and springing up octavia hurried to meet her friends exclaiming joyfully they have come they have come  two smiling blooming girls met her at the door and being at an enthusiastic age they gushed in girlish fashion for several minutes making a pretty group as they stood in each others arms all talking at once with frequent kisses and little bursts of laughter as vents for their emotion madame mère welcomed them and then went to join mrs snowdon leaving the trio to gossip unrestrained  my dearest creature i thought we never should get here for papa had a tiresome dinner party and we were obliged to stay you know cried rose the lively sister shaking out the pretty dress and glancing at herself in the mirror as she fluttered about the room like a butterfly  we were dying to come and so charmed when you asked us for we havent seen you this age darling added blanche the pensive one smoothing her blond curls after a fresh embrace  im sorry the ulsters couldnt come to keep christmas with us for we have no gentlemen but jasper frank annon and the major sad isnt it said octavia with a look of despair which caused a fresh peal of laughter  one apiece my dear it might be worse and rose privately decided to appropriate sir jasper  where is your cousin asked blanche with a sigh of sentimental interest  he is here of course i forget him but he is not on the flirting list you know we must amuse him and not expect him to amuse us though really all the capital suggestions and plans for merrymaking always come from him  he is better i hope asked both sisters with real sympathy making their young faces womanly and sweet  yes and has hopes of entire recovery at least they tell him so though dr ashley said there was no chance of it  dear dear how sad shall we see him tavia  certainly he is able to be with us now in the evening and enjoys society as much as ever but please take no notice of his infirmity and make no inquiries beyond the usual how do you do he is sensitive and hates to be considered an invalid more than ever  how charming it must be to take care of him he is so accomplished and delightful i quite envy you said blanche pensively  sir jasper told us that the general and mrs snowdon were coming i hope they will for ive a most intense curiosity to see her began rose  hush she is here with mamma why curious what is the mystery for you look as if there was one questioned octavia under her breath  the three charming heads bent toward one another as rose replied in a whisper if i knew i shouldnt be inquisitive there was a rumor that she married the old general in a fit of pique and now repents i asked mamma once but she said such matters were not for young girls to hear and not a word more would she say nimporte i have wits of my own and i can satisfy myself the gentlemen are coming am i all right dear and the three glanced at one another with a swift scrutiny that nothing could escape then grouped themselves prettily and waited with a little flutter of expectation in each young heart  in came the gentlemen and instantly a new atmosphere seemed to pervade the drawing room for with the first words uttered several romances began sir jasper was taken possession of by rose blanche intended to devote herself to maurice treherne but annon intercepted her and octavia was spared any effort at politeness by this unexpected move on the part of her lover  he is angry and wishes to pique me by devoting himself to blanche i wish he would with all my heart and leave me in peace poor maurice he expects me and i long to go to him but must obey mamma and octavia went to join the group formed by my lady mrs snowdon the general and the major  the two young couples flirted in different parts of the room and treherne sat alone watching them all with eyes that pierced below the surface reading the hidden wishes hopes and fears that ruled them a singular expression sat on his face as he turned from octavias clear countenance to mrs snowdons gloomy one he leaned his head upon his hand and fell into deep thought for he was passing through one of those fateful moments which come to us all and which may make or mar a life such moments come when least looked for an unexpected meeting a peculiar mood some trivial circumstance or careless word produces it and often it is gone before we realize its presence leaving aftereffects to show us what we have gained or lost treherne was conscious that the present hour and the acts that filled it possessed unusual interest and would exert an unusual influence on his life before him was the good and evil genius of his nature in the guise of those two women edith snowdon had already tried her power and accident only had saved him octavia all unconscious as she was never failed to rouse and stimulate the noblest attributes of mind and heart a year spent in her society had done much for him and he loved her with a strange mingling of passion reverence and gratitude he knew why edith snowdon came he felt that the old fascination had not lost its charm and though fear was unknown to him he was ill pleased at the sight of the beautiful dangerous woman on the other hand he saw that lady treherne desired her daughter to shun him and smile on annon he acknowledged that he had no right to win the young creature crippled and poor as he was and a pang of jealous pain wrung his heart as he watched her  then a sense of power came to him for helpless poor and seemingly an object of pity he yet felt that he held the honor peace and happiness of nearly every person present in his hands it was a strong temptation to this man so full of repressed passion and power so set apart and shut out from the more stirring duties and pleasures of life a few words from his lips and the pity all felt for him would be turned to fear respect and admiration why not utter them and enjoy all that was possible he owed the trehernes nothing why suffer injustice dependence and the compassion that wounds a proud man deepest wealth love pleasure might be his with a breath why not secure them now  his pale face flushed his eye kindled and his thin hand lay clenched like a vise as these thoughts passed rapidly through his mind a look a word at that moment would sway him he felt it and leaned forward waiting in secret suspense for the glance the speech which should decide him for good or ill who shall say what subtle instinct caused octavia to turn and smile at him with a wistful friendly look that warmed his heart he met it with an answering glance which thrilled her strangely for love gratitude and some mysterious intelligence met and mingled in the brilliant yet soft expression which swiftly shone and faded in her face what it was she could not tell she only felt that it filled her with an indescribable emotion never experienced before in an instant it all passed lady treherne spoke to her and blanche talbot addressed maurice wondering as she did so if the enchanting smile he wore was meant for her  mr annon having mercifully set me free i came to try to cheer your solitude but you look as if solitude made you happier than society does the rest of us she said without her usual affectation for his manner impressed her  you are very kind and very welcome i do find pleasures to beguile my loneliness which gayer people would not enjoy and it is well that i can else i should turn morose and tyrannical and doom some unfortunate to entertain me all day long he answered with a gentle courtesy which was his chief attraction to womankind  pray tell me some of your devices im often alone in spirit if not so in the flesh for rose though a dear girl is not congenial and i find no kindred soul  a humorous glimmer came to trehernes eyes as the sentimental damsel beamed a soft sigh and drooped her long lashes effectively ignoring the topic of kindred souls he answered coldly my favorite amusement is studying the people around me it may be rude but tied to my corner i cannot help watching the figures around me and discovering their little plots and plans im getting very expert and really surprise myself sometimes by the depth of my researches  i can believe it your eyes look as if they possessed that gift pray dont study me and the girl shrank away with an air of genuine alarm  treherne smiled involuntarily for he had read the secret of that shallow heart long ago and was too generous to use the knowledge however flattering it might be to him in a reassuring tone he said turning away the keen eyes she feared i give you my word i never will charming as it might be to study the white pages of a maidenly heart i find plenty of others to read so rest tranquil miss blanche  who interests you most just now asked the girl coloring with pleasure at his words mrs snowdon looks like one who has a romance to be read if you have the skill  i have read it my lady is my study just now i thought i knew her well but of late she puzzles me human minds are more full of mysteries than any written book and more changeable than the cloud shapes in the air  a fine old lady but i fear her so intensely i should never dare to try to read her as you say blanche looked toward the object of discussion as she spoke and added poor tavia how forlorn she seems let me ask her to join us may i  with all my heart was the quick reply  blanche glided away but did not return for my lady kept her as well as her daughter  that test satisfies me well i submit for a time but i think i can conquer my aunt yet and with a patient sigh treherne turned to observe mrs snowdon  she now stood by the fire talking with sir jasper a handsome reckless generoushearted young gentleman who very plainly showed his great admiration for the lady when he came she suddenly woke up from her listless mood and became as brilliantly gay as she had been unmistakably melancholy before as she chatted she absently pushed to and fro a small antique urn of bronze on the chimneypiece and in doing so she more than once gave treherne a quick significant glance which he answered at last by a somewhat haughty nod then as if satisfied she ceased toying with the ornament and became absorbed in sir jaspers gallant badinage  the instant her son approached mrs snowdon madame mère grew anxious and leaving octavia to her friends and lover she watched jasper but her surveillance availed little for she could neither see nor hear anything amiss yet could not rid herself of the feeling that some mutual understanding existed between them when the party broke up for the night she lingered till all were gone but her son and nephew  well madame ma mère what troubles you asked sir jasper as she looked anxiously into his face before bestowing her goodnight kiss  i cannot tell yet i feel ill at ease remember my son that you are the pride of my heart and any sin or shame of yours would kill me good night maurice and with a stately bow she swept away  lounging with both elbows on the low chimneypiece sir jasper smiled at his mothers fears and said to his cousin the instant they were alone she is worried about es odd isnt it what instinctive antipathies women take to one another  why did you ask es here demanded treherne  my dear fellow how could i help it my mother wanted the general my fathers friend and of course his wife must be asked also i couldnt tell my mother that the lady had been a most arrant coquette to put it mildly and had married the old man in a pet because my cousin and i declined to be ruined by her  you could have told her what mischief she makes wherever she goes and for octavias sake have deferred the generals visit for a time i warn you jasper harm will come of it  to whom you or me  to both perhaps certainly to you she was disappointed once when she lost us both by wavering between your title and my supposed fortune she is miserable with the old man and her only hope is in his death for he is very feeble you are free and doubly attractive now so beware or she will entangle you before you know it  thanks mentor ive no fear and shall merely amuse myself for a weekthey stay no longer and with a careless laugh sir jasper strolled away  much mischief may be done in a week and this is the beginning of it muttered treherne as he raised himself to look under the bronze vase for the note it was gone     chapter iii   who was it  who had taken it this question tormented treherne all that sleepless night he suspected three persons for only these had approached the fire after the note was hidden he had kept his eye on it he thought till the stir of breaking up in that moment it must have been removed by the major frank annon or my lady sir jasper was out of the question for he never touched an ornament in the drawing room since he had awkwardly demolished a whole étagère of costly trifles to his mothers and sisters great grief the major evidently suspected something annon was jealous and my lady would be glad of a pretext to remove her daughter from his reach trusting to his skill in reading faces he waited impatiently for morning resolving to say nothing to anyone but mrs snowdon and from her merely to inquire what the note contained  treherne usually was invisible till lunch often till dinner therefore fearing to excite suspicion by unwonted activity he did not appear till noon the mailbag had just been opened and everyone was busy over their letters but all looked up to exchange a word with the newcomer and octavia impulsively turned to meet him then checked herself and hid her suddenly crimsoned face behind a newspaper trehernes eye took in everything and saw at once in the unusually late arrival of the mail a pretext for discovering the pilferer of the note  all have letters but me yet i expected one last night major have you got it among yours and as he spoke treherne fixed his penetrating eyes full on the person he addressed  with no sign of consciousness no trace of confusion the major carefully turned over his pile and replied in the most natural manner not a trace of it i wish there was for nothing annoys me more than any delay or mistake about my letters  he knows nothing of it thought treherne and turned to annon who was deep in a long epistle from some intimate friend with a talent for imparting news to judge from the readers interest  annon i appeal to you for i must discover who has robbed me of my letter  i have but one read it if you will and satisfy yourself was the brief reply  no thank you i merely asked in joke it is doubtless among my ladys jaspers letters and mine often get mixed and my lady takes care of his for him i think you must have it aunt  lady treherne looked up impatiently my dear maurice what a coil about a letter we none of us have it so do not punish us for the sins of your correspondent or the carelessness of the post  she was not the thief for she is always intensely polite when she intends to thwart me thought treherne and apologizing for his rudeness in disturbing them he rolled himself to his nook in a sunny window and became apparently absorbed in a new magazine  mrs snowdon was opening the generals letters for him and having finished her little task she roamed away into the library as if in search of a book presently returning with one she approached treherne and putting it into his hand said in her musically distinct voice be so kind as to find for me the passage you spoke of last night i am curious to see it  instantly comprehending her stratagem he opened it with apparent carelessness secured the tiny note laid among the leaves and selecting a passage at hazard returned her book and resumed his own behind the cover of it he unfolded and read these words      i understand but do not be anxious the line i left was merely     thisi must see you alone tell me when and where no one can     make much of it and i will discover the thief before dinner do     nothing but watch to whom i speak first on entering when we meet     in the evening and beware of that person  quietly transferring the note to the fire with the wrapper of the magazine he dismissed the matter from his mind and left mrs snowdon to play detective as she pleased while he busied himself about his own affairs  it was a clear bright december day and when the young people separated to prepare for a ride while the general and the major sunned themselves on the terrace lady treherne said to her nephew i am going for an airing in the pony carriage will you be my escort maurice  with pleasure replied the young man well knowing what was in store for him  my lady was unusually taciturn and grave yet seemed anxious to say something which she found difficult to utter treherne saw this and ended an awkward pause by dashing boldly into the subject which occupied both  i think you want to say something to me about tavie aunt am i right  yes  then let me spare you the pain of beginning and prove my sincerity by openly stating the truth as far as i am concerned i love her very dearly but i am not mad enough to dream of telling her so i know that it is impossible and i relinquish my hopes trust me i will keep silent and see her marry annon without a word of complaint if you will it i see by her altered manner that you have spoken to her and that my little friend and nurse is to be mine no longer perhaps you are wise but if you do this on my account it is in vainthe mischief is done and while i live i shall love my cousin if you do it to spare her i am dumb and will go away rather than cause her a care or pain  do you really mean this maurice and lady treherne looked at him with a changed and softened face  turning upon her treherne showed her a countenance full of suffering and sincerity of resignation and resolve as he said earnestly i do mean it prove me in any way you please i am not a bad fellow aunt and i desire to be better since my misfortune ive had time to test many things myself among others and in spite of many faults i do cherish the wish to keep my soul honest and true even though my body be a wreck it is easy to say these things but in spite of temptation i think i can stand firm if you trust me  my dear boy i do trust you and thank you gratefully for this frankness i never forget that i owe jaspers life to you and never expect to repay that debt remember this when i seem cold or unkind and remember also that i say now had you been spared this affliction i would gladly have given you my girl but  but aunt hear one thing broke in treherne they tell me that any sudden and violent shock of surprise joy or sorrow may do for me what they hope time will achieve i said nothing of this for it is but a chance yet while there is any hope need i utterly renounce octavia  it is hard to refuse and yet i cannot think it wise to build upon a chance so slight once let her have you and both are made unhappy if the hope fail no maurice it is better to be generous and leave her free to make her own happiness elsewhere annon loves her she is heartwhole and will soon learn to love him if you are silent my poor boy it seems cruel but i must say it  shall i go away aunt was all his answer very firmly uttered though his lips were white  not yet only leave them to themselves and hide your trouble if you can yet if you prefer you shall go to town and benson shall see that you are comfortable your health will be a reason and i will come or write often if you are homesick it shall depend on you for i want to be just and kind in this hard case you shall decide  then i will stay i can hide my love and to see them together will soon cease to wound me if octavia is happy  so let it rest then for a time you shall miss your companion as little as possible for i will try to fill her place forgive me maurice and pity a mothers solicitude for these two are the last of many children and i am a widow now  lady trehernes voice faltered and if any selfish hope or plan lingered in her nephews mind that appeal banished it and touched his better nature pressing her hand he said gently dear aunt do not lament over me i am one set apart for afflictions yet i will not be conquered by them let us forget my youth and be friendly counselors together for the good of the two whom we both love i must say a word about jasper and you will not press me to explain more than i can without breaking my promise  thank you thank you it is regarding that woman i know tell me all you can i will not be importunate but i disliked her the instant i saw her beautiful and charming as she seems  when my cousin and i were in paris just before my illness we met her she was with her father then a gay old man who led a life of pleasure and was no fit guardian for a lovely daughter she knew our story and having fascinated both paused to decide which she would accept jasper for his title or me for my fortune this was before my uncle changed his will and i believed myself his heir but before she made her choice something dont ask me what if you please occurred to send us from paris on our return voyage we were wrecked and then came my illness disinheritance and helplessness edith dubarry heard the story but rumor reported it falsely and she believed both of us had lost the fortune her father died penniless and in a moment of despair she married the general whose wealth surrounds her with the luxury she loves and whose failing health will soon restore her liberty  and then maurice interrupted my lady  she hopes to win jasper i think  never we must prevent that at all costs i had rather see him dead before me than the husband of such a woman why is she permitted to visit homes like mine i should have been told this sooner exclaimed my lady angrily  i should have told you had i known it and i reproved jasper for his neglect do not be needlessly troubled aunt there is no blemish on mrs snowdons name and as the wife of a brave and honorable man she is received without question for beauty grace or tact like hers can make their way anywhere she stays but a week and i will devote myself to her this will save jasper and if necessary convince tavie of my indifference then he paused to stifle a sigh  but yourself have you no fears for your own peace maurice you must not sacrifice happiness or honor for me or mine  i am safe i love my cousin and that is my shield whatever happens remember that i tried to serve you and sincerely endeavored to forget myself  god bless you my son let me call you so and feel that though i deny you my daughter i give you heartily a mothers care and affection  lady treherne was as generous as she was proud and her nephew had conquered her by confidence and submission he acted no part yet even in relinquishing all he cherished a hope that he might yet win the heart he coveted silently they parted but from that hour a new and closer bond existed between the two and exerted an unsuspected influence over the whole household                                       maurice waited with some impatience for mrs snowdons entrance not only because of his curiosity to see if she had discovered the thief but because of the part he had taken upon himself to play he was equal to it and felt a certain pleasure in it for a threefold reason it would serve his aunt and cousin would divert his mind from its own cares and perhaps by making octavia jealous waken love for though he had chosen the right he was but a man and moreover a lover  mrs snowdon was late she always was for her toilet was elaborate and she liked to enjoy its effects upon others the moment she entered trehernes eye was on her and to his intense surprise and annoyance she addressed octavia saying blandly my dear miss treherne ive been admiring your peacocks pray let me see you feed them tomorrow miss talbot says it is a charming sight  if you are on the terrace just after lunch you will find them there and may feed them yourself if you like was the cool civil reply  she looks like a peacock herself in that splendid green and gold dress doesnt she whispered rose to sir jasper with a wicked laugh  faith so she does i wish tavies birds had voices like mrs snowdons their squalling annoys me intensely  i rather like it for it is honest and no malice or mischief is hidden behind it i always distrust those smooth sweet voices they are insincere i like a full clear tone sharp if you please but decided and true  well said octavia i agree with you and your own is a perfect sample of the kind you describe and treherne smiled as he rolled by to join mrs snowdon who evidently waited for him while octavia turned to her brother to defend her pets  are you sure how did you discover said maurice affecting to admire the ladys bouquet as he paused beside her  i suspected it the moment i saw her this morning she is no actress and dislike distrust and contempt were visible in her face when we met till you so cleverly told me my note was lost i fancied she was disturbed about her brotheror you  a sudden pause and a keen glance followed the last softly uttered word but treherne met it with an inscrutable smile and a quiet well what next  the moment i learned that you did not get the note i was sure she had it and knowing that she must have seen me put it there in spite of her apparent innocence i quietly asked her for it this surprised her this robbed the affair of any mystery and i finished her perplexity by sending it to the major the moment she returned it to me as if it had been intended for him she begged pardon said her brother was thoughtless and she watched over him lest he should get into mischief professed to think i meant the line for him and behaved like a charming simpleton as she is  quite a tumult about nothing poor little tavie you doubtlessly frightened her so that we may safely correspond hereafter  you may give me an answer now and here  very well meet me on the terrace tomorrow morning the peacocks will make the meeting natural enough i usually loiter away an hour or two there in the sunny part of the day  but the girl  ill send her away  you speak as if it would be an easy thing to do  it will both easy and pleasant  now you are mysterious or uncomplimentary you either care nothing for a têteàtête with her or you will gladly send her out of my way which is it  you shall decide can i have this  she looked at him as he touched a rose with a warning glance for the flower was both an emblem of love and of silence did he mean to hint that he recalled the past or to warn her that someone was near she leaned from the shadow of the curtain where she sat and caught a glimpse of a shadow gliding away  who was it she asked below her breath  a rose he answered laughing then as if the danger was over he said how will you account to the major for the message you sent him  easily by fabricating some interesting perplexity in which i want sage counsel he will be flattered and by seeming to take him into my confidence i can hoodwink the excellent man to my hearts content for he annoys me by his odd way of mounting guard over me at all times now take me in to dinner and be your former delightful self  that is impossible he said yet proved that it was not     chapter iv   feeding the peacocks  it was indeed a charming sight the twelve stately birds perched on the broad stone balustrade or prancing slowly along the terrace with the sun gleaming on their green and golden necks and the glories of their gorgeous plumes widespread or sweeping like rich trains behind them in pretty contrast to the splendid creatures was their young mistress in her simple morning dress and furtrimmed hood and mantle as she stood feeding the tame pets from her hand calling their fanciful names laughing at their pranks and heartily enjoying the winter sunshine the fresh wind and the girlish pastime as treherne slowly approached he watched her with lovers eyes and found her very sweet and blithe and dearer in his sight than ever she had shunned him carefully all the day before had parted at night with a hasty handshake and had not come as usual to bid him goodmorning in the library he had taken no notice of the change as yet but now remembering his promise to his aunt he resolved to let the girl know that he fully understood the relation which henceforth was to exist between them  goodmorning cousin shall i drive you away if i take a turn or two here he said in a cheerful tone but with a halfreproachful glance  she looked at him an instant then went to him with extended hand and cheeks rosier than before while her frank eyes filled and her voice had a traitorous tremor in it as she said impetuously i will be myself for a moment in spite of everything maurice dont think me unkind dont reproach me or ask my leave to come where i am there is a reason for the change you see in me its not caprice it is obedience  my dear girl i know it i meant to speak of it and show you that i understand annon is a good fellow as worthy of you as any man can be and i wish you all the happiness you deserve  do you and her eyes searched his face keenly  yes do you doubt it and so well did he conceal his love that neither face voice nor manner betrayed a hint of it  her eyes fell a cloud passed over her clear countenance and she withdrew her hand as if to caress the hungry bird that gently pecked at the basket she held as if to change the conversation she said playfully poor argus you have lost your fine feathers and so all desert you except kind little juno who never forgets her friends there take it all and share between you  treherne smiled and said quickly i am a human argus and you have been a kind little juno to me since i lost my plumes continue to be so and you will find me a very faithful friend  i will and as she answered her old smile came back and her eyes met his again  thanks now we shall get on happily i dont ask or expect the old lifethat is impossible i knew that when lovers came the friend would fall into the background and i am content to be second where i have so long been first do not think you neglect me be happy with your lover dear and when you have no pleasanter amusement come and see old maurice  she turned her head away that he might not see the angry color in her cheeks the trouble in her eyes and when she spoke it was to say petulantly i wish jasper and mamma would leave me in peace i hate lovers and want none if frank teases ill go into a convent and so be rid of him  maurice laughed and turned her face toward himself saying in his persuasive voice give him a trial first to please your mother it can do no harm and may amuse you frank is already lost and as you are heartwhole why not see what you can do for him i shall have a new study then and not miss you so much  you are very kind ill do my best i wish mrs snowdon would come if she is coming ive an engagement at two and frank will look tragical if im not ready he is teaching me billiards and i really like the game though i never thought i should  that looks well i hope youll learn a double lesson and annon find a docile pupil in both  you are very pale this morning are you in pain maurice suddenly asked octavia dropping the tone of assumed ease and gaiety under which she had tried to hide her trouble  yes but it will soon pass mrs snowdon is coming i saw her at the hall door a moment ago i will show her the peacocks if you want to go she wont mind the change i dare say as you dont like her and i do  no i am sure of that it was an arrangement perhaps i understand i will not play mademoiselle de trop  sudden fire shone in the girls eyes sudden contempt curled her lip and a glance full of meaning went from her cousin to the door where mrs snowdon appeared waiting for her maid to bring her some additional wrappings  you allude to the note you stole how came you to play that prank tavie asked treherne tranquilly  i saw her put it under the urn i thought it was for jasper and i took it she said boldly  why for jasper  i remembered his speaking of meeting her long ago and describing her beauty enthusiasticallyand so did you  you have a good memory  i have for everything concerning those i love i observed her manner of meeting my brother his devotion to her and when they stood laughing together before the fire i felt sure that she wished to charm him again  again then she did charm him once asked treherne anxious to know how much jasper had told his sister  he always denied it and declared that you were the favorite  then why not think the note for me he asked  i do now was the sharp answer  but she told you it was for the major and sent it  she deceived me i am not surprised i am glad jasper is safe and i wish you a pleasant têteàtête  bowing with unwonted dignity octavia set down her basket and walked away in one direction as mrs snowdon approached in another  i have done it now sighed treherne turning from the girlish figure to watch the stately creature who came sweeping toward him with noiseless grace  brilliancy and splendor became mrs snowdon she enjoyed luxury and her beauty made many things becoming which in a plainer woman would have been out of taste and absurd she had wrapped herself in a genuine eastern burnous of scarlet blue and gold the hood drawn over her head framed her fine face in rich hues and the great gilt tassels shone against her rippling black hair she wore it with grace and the barbaric splendor of the garment became her well the fresh air touched her cheeks with a delicate color her usually gloomy eyes were brilliant now and the smile that parted her lips was full of happiness  welcome cleopatra cried treherne with difficulty repressing a laugh as the peacocks screamed and fled before the rustling amplitude of her drapery  i might reply by calling you thaddeus of warsaw for you look very romantic and polish with your pale pensive face and your splendid furs she answered as she paused beside him with admiration very visibly expressed in her eyes  treherne disliked the look and rather abruptly said as he offered her the basket of bread i have disposed of my cousin and offered to do the honors of the peacocks here they arewill you feed them  no thank youi care nothing for the fowls as you know i came to speak to you she said impatiently  i am at your service  i wish to ask you a question or twois it permitted  what man ever refused mrs snowdon a request  nay no compliments from you they are only satirical evasions i was deceived when abroad and rashly married that old man tell me truly how things stand  jasper has all i have nothing  i am glad of it  many thanks for the hearty speech you at least speak sincerely he said bitterly  i do mauricei do let me prove it  trehernes chair was close beside the balustrade mrs snowdon leaned on the carved railing with her back to the house and her face screened by a tall urn looking steadily at him she said rapidly and low you thought i wavered between you and jasper when we parted two years ago i did but it was not between title and fortune that i hesitated it was between duty and love my father a fond foolish old man had set his heart on seeing me a lady i was his all my beauty was his delight and no untitled man was deemed worthy of me i loved him tenderly you may doubt this knowing how selfish reckless and vain i am but i have a heart and with better training had been a better woman no matter it is too late now next my father i loved you nay hear mei will clear myself in your eyes i mean no wrong to the general he is kind indulgent generous i respect himi am grateful and while he lives i shall be true to him  then be silent now do not recall the past edith let it sleep for both our sakes began treherne but she checked him imperiously  it shall when i am done i loved you maurice for of all the gay idle pleasureseeking men i saw about me you were the only one who seemed to have a thought beyond the folly of the hour under the seeming frivolity of your life lay something noble heroic and true i felt that you had a purpose that your present mood was but transitorya young mans holiday before the real work of his life began this attracted this won me for even in the brief regard you then gave me there was an earnestness no other man had shown i wanted your respect i longed to earn your love to share your life and prove that even in my neglected nature slept the power of canceling a frivolous past by a noble future oh maurice had you lingered one week more i never should have been the miserable thing i am  there her voice faltered and failed for all the bitterness of lost love peace and happiness sounded in the pathetic passion of that exclamation she did not weep for tears seldom dimmed those tragical eyes of hers but she wrung her hands in mute despair and looked down into the frostblighted gardens below as if she saw there a true symbol of her own ruined life treherne uttered not a word but set his teeth with an almost fierce glance toward the distant figure of sir jasper who was riding gaily away like one unburdened by a memory or a care  hurriedly mrs snowdon went on my father begged and commanded me to choose your cousin i could not break his heart and asked for time hoping to soften him while i waited that mysterious affair hurried you from paris and then came the wreck the illness and the rumor that old sir jasper had disinherited both nephews they told me you were dying and i became a passive instrument in my fathers hands i promised to recall and accept your cousin but the old man died before it was done and then i cared not what became of me  general snowdon was my fathers friend he pitied me he saw my desolate destitute state my despair and helplessness he comforted sustained and saved me i was grateful and when he offered me his heart and home i accepted them he knew i had no love to give but as a friend a daughter i would gladly serve him and make his declining years as happy as i could it was all over when i heard that you were alive afflicted and poor i longed to come and live for you my new bonds became heavy fetters then my wealth oppressed me and i was doubly wretchedfor i dared not tell my trouble and it nearly drove me mad i have seen you now i know that you are happy i read your cousins love and see a peaceful life in store for you this must content me and i must learn to bear it as i can  she paused breathless and pale and walked rapidly along the terrace as if to hide or control the agitation that possessed her  treherne still sat silent but his heart leaped within him as he thought she sees that octavia loves me a womans eye is quick to detect love in another and she asserts what i begin to hope my cousins manner just now her dislike of annon her new shyness with me it may be true and if it isheaven help mewhat am i saying i must not hope nor wish nor dream i must renounce and forget  he leaned his head upon his hand and sat so still mrs snowdon rejoined him pale but calm and selfpossessed as she drew near she marked his attitude the bitter sadness of his face and hope sprang up within her perhaps she was mistaken perhaps he did not love his cousin perhaps he still remembered the past and still regretted the loss of the heart she had just laid bare before him her husband was failing and might die any day and then free rich beautiful and young what might she not become to treherne helpless poor and ambitious with all her faults she was generous and this picture charmed her fancy warmed her heart and comforted her pain  maurice she said softly pausing again beside him if i mistake you and your hopes it is because i dare ask nothing for myself but if ever a time shall come when i have liberty to give or help ask of me anything and it is gladly yours  he understood her pitied her and seeing that she found consolation in a distant hope he let her enjoy it while she might gravely yet gratefully he spoke and pressed the hand extended to him with an impulsive gesture  generous as ever edith and impetuously frank thank you for your sincerity your kindness and the affection you once gave me i say once for now duty truth and honor bar us from each other my life must be solitary yet i shall find work to do and learn to be content you owe all devotion to the good old man who loves you and will not fail him i am sure leave the future and the past but let us make the present what it may bea time to forgive and forget to take heart and begin anew christmas is a fitting time for such resolves and the birth of friendship such as ours may be  something in his tone and manner struck her and eyeing him with soft wonder she exclaimed how changed you are  need you tell me that and he glanced at his helpless limbs with a bitter yet pathetic look of patience  no nonot so i mean in mind not body once you were gay and careless eager and fiery like jasper now you are grave and quiet or cheerful and so very kind yet in spite of illness and loss you seem twice the man you were and something wins respect as well as admirationand love  her dark eyes filled as the last word left her lips and the beauty of a touched heart shone in her face maurice looked up quickly asking with sudden earnestness do you see it then it is true yes i am changed thank god and she has done it  who demanded his companion jealously  octavia unconsciously yet surely she has done much for me and this year of seeming loss and misery has been the happiest most profitable of my life i have often heard that afflictions were the best teachers and i believe it now  mrs snowdon shook her head sadly  not always they are tormentors to some but dont preach maurice i am still a sinner though you incline to sainthood and i have one question more to ask what was it that took you and jasper so suddenly away from paris  that i can never tell you  i shall discover it for myself then  it is impossible  nothing is impossible to a determined woman  you can neither wring surprise nor bribe this secret from the two persons who hold it i beg of you to let it rest said treherne earnestly  i have a clue and i shall follow it for i am convinced that something is wrong and you are  dear mrs snowdon are you so charmed with the birds that you forget your fellowbeings or so charmed with one fellowbeing that you forget the birds  as the sudden question startled both rose talbot came along the terrace with hands full of holly and a face full of merry mischief adding as she vanished i shall tell tavie that feeding the peacocks is such congenial amusement for lovers she and mr annon had better try it  saucy gypsy muttered treherne  but mrs snowdon said with a smile of double meaning many a true word is spoken in jest     chapter v   under the mistletoe  unusually gay and charming the three young friends looked dressed alike in fleecy white with holly wreaths in their hair as they slowly descended the wide oaken stairway arm in arm a footman was lighting the hall lamps for the winter dusk gathered early and the girls were merrily chatting about the evenings festivity when suddenly a loud long shriek echoed through the hall a heavy glass shade fell from the mans hand with a crash and the young ladies clung to one another aghast for mortal terror was in the cry and a dead silence followed it  what was it john demanded octavia very pale but steady in a moment  ill go and see miss and the man hurried away  where did the dreadful scream come from asked rose collecting her wits as rapidly as possible  above us somewhere oh let us go down among people i am frightened to death whispered blanche trembling and faint  hurrying into the parlor they found only annon and the major both looking startled and both staring out of the windows  did you hear it what could it be dont go and leave us cried the girls in a breath as they rushed in  the gentlemen had heard couldnt explain the cry and were quite ready to protect the pretty creatures who clustered about them like frightened fawns john speedily appeared looking rather wild and as eager to tell his tale as they to listen  its patty one of the maids miss in a fit she went up to the north gallery to see that the fires was right for it takes a power of wood to warm the gallery even enough for dancing as you know miss well it was dark for the fires was low and her candle went out as she whisked open the door being flurried as the maids always is when they go in there halfway down the gallery she says she heard a rustling and stopped shes the pluckiest of em all and she called out i see you thinking it was some of us trying to fright her nothing answered and she went on a bit when suddenly the fire flared up one flash and there right before her was the ghost  dont be foolish john tell us what it was said octavia sharply though her face whitened and her heart sank as the last word passed the mans lips  it was a tall black figger miss with a deadwhite face and a black hood she see it plain and turned to go away but she hadnt gone a dozen steps when there it was again before her the same tall dark thing with the deadwhite face looking out from the black hood it lifted its arm as if to hold her but she gave a spring and dreadful screech and ran to mrs bensons room where she dropped in a fit  how absurd to be frightened by the shadows of the figures in armor that stand along the gallery said rose boldly enough though she would have declined entering the gallery without a light  nay i dont wonder its a ghostly place at night how is the poor thing asked blanche still hanging on the majors arm in her best attitude  if mamma knows nothing of it tell mrs benson to keep it from her please she is not well and such things annoy her very much said octavia adding as the man turned away did anyone look in the gallery after patty told her tale  no miss ill go and do it myself im not afraid of man ghost or devil saving your presence ladies replied john  where is sir jasper suddenly asked the major  here i am what a deuce of a noise someone has been making it disturbed a capital dream why tavie what is it and sir jasper came out of the library with a sleepy face and tumbled hair  they told him the story whereat he laughed heartily and said the maids were a foolish set to be scared by a shadow while he still laughed and joked mrs snowdon entered looking alarmed and anxious to know the cause of the confusion  how interesting i never knew you kept a ghost tell me all about it sir jasper and soothe our nerves by satisfying our curiosity she said in her halfpersuasive halfcommanding way as she seated herself on lady trehernes sacred sofa  theres not much to tell except that this place used to be an abbey in fact as well as in name an ancestor founded it and for years the monks led a jolly life here as one may see for the cellar is twice as large as the chapel and much better preserved but another ancestor a gay and gallant baron took a fancy to the site for his castle and in spite of prayers anathemas and excommunication he turned the poor fellows out pulled down the abbey and built this fine old place abbot boniface as he left his abbey uttered a heavy curse on all who should live here and vowed to haunt us till the last treherne vanished from the face of the earth with this amiable threat the old party left baron roland to his doom and died as soon as he could in order to begin his cheerful mission  did he haunt the place asked blanche eagerly  yes most faithfully from that time to this some say many of the monks still glide about the older parts of the abbey for roland spared the chapel and the north gallery which joined it to the modern building poor fellows they are welcome and once a year they shall have a chance to warm their ghostly selves by the great fires always kindled at christmas in the gallery  mrs benson once told me that when the ghost walked it was a sure sign of a coming death in the family is that true asked rose whose curiosity was excited by the expression of octavias face and a certain uneasiness in sir jaspers manner in spite of his merry mood  there is a stupid superstition of that sort in the family but no one except the servants believes it of course in times of illness some silly maid or croaking old woman can easily fancy they see a phantom and if death comes they are sure of the ghostly warning benson saw it before my father died and old roger the night my uncle was seized with apoplexy patty will never be made to believe that this warning does not forebode the death of maurice or myself for the gallant spirit leaves the ladies of our house to depart in peace how does it strike you cousin  turning as he spoke sir jasper glanced at treherne who had entered while he spoke  i am quite skeptical and indifferent to the whole affair but i agree with octavia that it is best to say nothing to my aunt if she is ignorant of the matter her rooms are a long way off and perhaps she did not hear the confusion  you seem to hear everything you were not with us when i said that and octavia looked up with an air of surprise  smiling significantly treherne answered i hear see and understand many things that escape others jasper allow me to advise you to smooth the hair which your sleep has disarranged mrs snowdon permit me this rich velvet catches the least speck and with his handkerchief he delicately brushed away several streaks of white dust which clung to the ladys skirt  sir jasper turned hastily on his heel and went to remake his toilet mrs snowdon bit her lip but thanked treherne sweetly and begged him to fasten her glove as he did so she said softly be more careful next time octavia has keen eyes and the major may prove inconvenient  i have no fear that you will he whispered back with a malicious glance  here the entrance of my lady put an end to the ghostly episode for it was evident that she knew nothing of it octavia slipped away to question john and learn that no sign of a phantom was to be seen treherne devoted himself to mrs snowdon and the major entertained my lady while sir jasper and the girls chatted apart  it was christmas eve and a dance in the great gallery was the yearly festival at the abbey all had been eager for it but the maids story seemed to have lessened their enthusiasm though no one would own it this annoyed sir jasper and he exerted himself to clear the atmosphere by affecting gaiety he did not feel the moment the gentlemen came in after dinner he whispered to his mother who rose asked the general for his arm and led the way to the north gallery whence the sound of music now proceeded the rest followed in a merry procession even treherne for two footmen carried him up the great stairway chair and all  nothing could look less ghostly now than the haunted gallery fires roared up a wide chimney at either end long rows of figures clad in armor stood on each side one mailed hand grasping a lance the other bearing a lighted candle a device of sir jaspers narrow windows pierced in the thick walls let in gleams of wintry moonlight ivy holly and evergreen glistened in the ruddy glow of mingled firelight and candle shine from the arched stone roof hung tattered banners and in the midst depended a great bunch of mistletoe redcushioned seats stood in recessed window nooks and from behind a highcovered screen of oak sounded the blithe air of sir roger de coverley  with the utmost gravity and stateliness my lady and the general led off the dance for according to the good old fashion the men and maids in their best array joined the gentlefolk and danced with their betters in a high state of pride and bashfulness sir jasper twirled the old housekeeper till her head spun around and around and her decorous skirts rustled stormily mrs snowdon captivated the grayhaired butler by her condescension and john was made a proud man by the hand of his young mistress the major came out strong among the pretty maids and rose danced the footmen out of breath long before the music paused  the merriment increased from that moment and when the general surprised my lady by gallantly saluting her as she unconsciously stood under the mistletoe the applause was immense everyone followed the old gentlemans example as fast as opportunities occurred and the young ladies soon had as fine a color as the housemaids more dancing games songs and all manner of festival devices filled the evening yet under cover of the gaiety more than one little scene was enacted that night and in an hour of seeming frivolity the current of several lives was changed  by a skillful maneuver annon led octavia to an isolated recess as if to rest after a brisk game and taking advantage of the auspicious hour pleaded his suit she heard him patiently and when he paused said slowly yet decidedly and with no sign of maiden hesitation thanks for the honor you do me but i cannot accept it for i do not love you i think i never can  have you tried he asked eagerly  yes indeed i have i like you as a friend but no more i know mamma desires it that jasper hopes for it and i try to please them but love will not be forced so what can i do and she smiled in spite of herself at her own blunt simplicity  no but it can be cherished strengthened and in time won with patience and devotion let me try octavia it is but fair unless you have already learned from another the lesson i hope to teach is it so  no i think not i do not understand myself as yet i am so young and this so sudden give me time frank  she blushed and fluttered now looked half angry half beseeching and altogether lovely  how much time shall i give it cannot take long to read a heart like yours dear and fancying her emotion a propitious omen he assumed the lover in good earnest  give me time till the new year i will answer then and meantime leave me free to study both myself and you we have known each other long i own but still this changes everything and makes you seem another person be patient frank and i will try to make my duty a pleasure  i will god bless you for the kind hope octavia it has been mine for years and if i lose it it will go hardly with me  later in the evening general snowdon stood examining the antique screen in many places carved oak was pierced quite through so that voices were audible from behind it the musicians had gone down to supper the young folk were quietly busy at the other end of the hall and as the old gentleman admired the quaint carving the sound of his own name caught his ear the housekeeper and butler still remained though the other servants had gone and sitting cosily behind the screen chatted in low tones believing themselves secure  it was mrs snowdon adam as im a living woman though i wouldnt say it to anyone but you she and sir jasper were here wrapped in cloaks and up to mischief ill be bound she is a beauty but i dont envy her and therell be trouble in the house if she stays long  but how do you know mrs benson she was here wheres your proof mum asked the pompous butler  look at this and then look at the outlandish trimming of the ladys dress you men are so dull about such matters youd never observe these little points well i was here first after patty and my light shone on this jet ornament lying near where she saw the spirit no one has any such tasty trifles but mrs snowdon and these are all over her gown if that aint proof what is  well admitting it i then say what on earth should she and master be up here for at such a time asked the slowwitted butler  adam we are old servants of the family and to you ill say what tortures shouldnt draw from to another master has been wild as you know and its my belief that he loved this lady abroad there was a talk of some mystery or misdeed or misfortune more than a year ago and she was in it im loath to say it but i think master loves her still and she him the general is an old man she is but young and so spirited and winsome she cant in reason care for him as for a fine gallant gentleman like sir jasper theres trouble brewing adam mark my words theres trouble brewing for the trehernes  so low had the voices fallen that the listener could not have caught the words had not his ear been strained to the utmost he did hear all and his wasted face flashed with the wrath of a young man then grew pale and stern as he turned to watch his wife she stood apart from the others talking to sir jasper who looked unusually handsome and debonair as he fanned her with a devoted air  perhaps it is true thought the old man bitterly they are well matched were lovers once no doubt and long to be so again poor edith i was very blind and with his gray head bowed upon his breast the general stole away carrying an arrow in his brave old heart                                       blanche come here and rest you will be ill tomorrow and i promised mamma to take care of you with which eldersisterly command rose led the girl to an immense old chair which held them both now listen to me and follow my advice for i am wise in my generation though not yet gray they are all busy so leave them alone and let me show you what is to be done  rose spoke softly but with great resolution and nodded her pretty head so energetically that the holly berries came rolling over her white shoulders  we are not as rich as we might be and must establish ourselves as soon and as well as possible i intend to be lady treherne you can be the honorable mrs annon if you give your mind to it  my dear child are you mad whispered blanche  far from it but you will be if you waste your time on maurice he is poor and a cripple though very charming i admit he loves tavie and she will marry him i am sure she cant endure frank but tries to because my lady commands it nothing will come of it so try your fascinations and comfort the poor man sympathy now will foster love hereafter  dont talk so here rose someone will hear us began her sister but the other broke in briskly  no fear a crowd is the best place for secrets now remember what i say and make your game while the ball is rolling other people are careful not to put their plans into words but im no hypocrite and say plainly what i mean bear my sage counsel in mind and act wisely now come and begin  treherne was sitting alone by one of the great fires regarding the gay scene with serious air for him there was neither dancing nor games he could only roam about catching glimpses of forbidden pleasures impossible delights and youthful hopes forever lost to him sad but not morose was his face and to octavia it was a mute reproach which she could not long resist coming up as if to warm herself she spoke to him in her usually frank and friendly way and felt her heart beat fast when she saw how swift a change her cordial manner wrought in him  how pretty your holly is do you remember how we used to go and gather it for festivals like this when we were happy children he asked looking up at her with eyes full of tender admiration  yes i remember everyone wears it tonight as a badge but you have none let me get you a bit i like to have you one of us in all things  she leaned forward to break a green sprig from the branch over the chimneypiece the strong draft drew in her fleecy skirt and in an instant she was enveloped in flames  maurice save me help me cried a voice of fear and agony and before anyone could reach her before he himself knew how the deed was done treherne had thrown himself from his chair wrapped the tiger skin tightly about her and knelt there clasping her in his arms heedless of fire pain or the incoherent expressions of love that broke from his lips     chapter vi   miracles  great was the confusion and alarm which reigned for many minutes but when the panic subsided two miracles appeared octavia was entirely uninjured and treherne was standing on his feet a thing which for months he had not done without crutches in the excitement of the moment no one observed the wonder all were crowding about the girl who pale and breathless but now selfpossessed was the first to exclaim pointing to her cousin who had drawn himself up with the help of his chair and leaned there smiling with a face full of intense delight  look at maurice oh jasper help him or hell fall  sir jasper sprung to his side and put a strong arm about him while a chorus of wonder sympathy and congratulations rose about them  why lad what does it mean have you been deceiving us all this time cried jasper as treherne leaned on him looking exhausted but truly happy  it means that i am not to be a cripple all my life that they did not deceive me when they said a sudden shock might electrify me with a more potent magnetism than any they could apply it has and if i am cured i owe it all to you octavia  he stretched his hands to her with a gesture of such passionate gratitude that the girl covered her face to hide its traitorous tenderness and my lady went to him saying brokenly as she embraced him with maternal warmth god bless you for this act maurice and reward you with a perfect cure to you i owe the lives of both my children how can i thank you as i ought  i dare not tell you yet he whispered eagerly then added i am growing faint aunt get me away before i make a scene  this hint recalled my lady to her usual state of dignified selfpossession bidding jasper and the major help treherne to his room without delay she begged rose to comfort her sister who was sobbing hysterically and as they all obeyed her she led her daughter away to her own apartment for the festivities of the evening were at an end  at the same time mrs snowdon and annon bade my lady goodnight as if they also were about to retire but as they reached the door of the gallery mrs snowdon paused and beckoned annon back they were alone now and standing before the fire which had so nearly made that christmas eve a tragical one she turned to him with a face full of interest and sympathy as she said nodding toward the blackened shreds of octavias dress and the scorched tiger skin which still lay at their feet that was both a fortunate and an unfortunate little affair but i fear maurices gain will be your loss pardon my frankness for octavias sake she is a fine creature and i long to see her given to one worthy of her i am a woman to read faces quickly i know that your suit does not prosper as you would have it and i desire to help you may i  indeed you may and command any service of me in return but to what do i owe this unexpected friendliness cried annon both grateful and surprised  to my regard for the young lady my wish to save her from an unworthy man  do you mean treherne asked annon more and more amazed  i do octavia must not marry a gambler  my dear lady you labor under some mistake treherne is by no means a gambler i owe him no goodwill but i cannot hear him slandered  you are generous but i am not mistaken can you on your honor assure me that maurice never played  mrs snowdons keen eyes were on him and he looked embarrassed for a moment but answered with some hesitation why no i cannot say that but i can assure you that he is not an habitual gambler all young men of his rank play more or less especially abroad it is merely an amusement with most and among men is not considered dishonorable or dangerous ladies think differently i believe at least in england  at the word abroad mrs snowdons face brightened and she suddenly dropped her eyes as if afraid of betraying some secret purpose  indeed we do and well we may many of us having suffered from this pernicious habit i have had special cause to dread and condemn it and the fear that octavia should in time suffer what i have suffered as a girl urges me to interfere where otherwise i should be dumb mr annon there was a rumor that maurice was forced to quit paris owing to some dishonorable practices at the gaming table is this true  nay dont ask me upon my soul i cannot tell you i only know that something was amiss but what i never learned various tales were whispered at the clubs and sir jasper indignantly denied them all the bravery with which maurice saved his cousin and the sad affliction which fell upon him silenced the gossip and it was soon forgotten  mrs snowdon remained silent for a moment with brows knit in deep thought while annon uneasily watched her suddenly she glanced over her shoulder drew nearer and whispered cautiously did the rumors of which you speak charge him with and the last word was breathed into annons ear almost inaudibily  he started as if some new light broke on him and stared at the speaker with a troubled face for an instant saying hastily no but now you remind me that when an affair of that sort was discussed the other day treherne looked very odd and rolled himself away as if it didnt interest him i cant believe it and yet it may be something of the kind that would account for old sir jaspers whim and trehernes steady denial of any knowledge of the cause how in heavens name did you learn this  my womans wit suggested it and my womans will shall confirm or destroy the suspicion my lady and octavia evidently know nothing but they shall if there is any danger of the girls being won by him  you would not tell her exclaimed annon  i will unless you do it was the firm answer  never to betray a friend even to gain the woman i love is a thing i cannot do my honor forbids it  mrs snowdon smiled scornfully  mens code of honor is a strong one and we poor women suffer from it leave this to me do your best and if all other means fail you may be glad to try my device to prevent maurice from marrying his cousin gratitude and pity are strong allies and if he recovers his strong will will move heaven and earth to gain her good night and leaving her last words to rankle in annons mind mrs snowdon departed to endure sleepless hours full of tormenting memories newborn hopes and alternations of determination and despair  trehernes prospect of recovery filled the whole house with delight for his patient courage and unfailing cheerfulness had endeared him to all it was no transient amendment for day by day he steadily gained strength and power passing rapidly from chair to crutches from crutches to a cane and a friends arm which was always ready for him pain returned with returning vitality but he bore it with a fortitude that touched all who witnessed it at times motion was torture yet motion was necessary lest the torpidity should return and treherne took his daily exercise with unfailing perseverance saying with a smile though great drops stood upon his forehead i have something dearer even than health to win hold me up jasper and let me stagger on in spite of everything till my twelve turns are made  he remembered lady trehernes words if you were well id gladly give my girl to you this inspired him with strength endurance and a happiness which could not be concealed it overflowed in looks words and acts it infected everyone and made these holidays the blithest the old abbey had seen for many a day  annon devoted himself to octavia and in spite of her command to be left in peace till the new year she was very kindso kind that hope flamed up in his heart though he saw that something like compassion often shone on him from her frank eyes and her compliance had no touch of the tender docility which lovers long to see she still avoided treherne but so skillfully that few observed the change but annon and himself in public sir jasper appeared to worship at the sprightly roses shrine and she fancied her game was prospering well  but had any one peeped behind the scenes it would have been discovered that during the half hour before dinner when everyone was in their dressing rooms and the general taking his nap a pair of ghostly black figures flitted about the haunted gallery where no servant ventured without orders the major fancied himself the only one who had made this discovery for mrs snowdon affected trehernes society in public and was assiduous in serving and amusing the dear convalescent as she called him but the general did not sleep he too watched and waited longing yet dreading to speak and hoping that this was but a harmless freak of ediths for her caprices were many and till now he had indulged them freely this hesitation disgusted the major who being a bachelor knew little of womens ways and less of their powers of persuasion the day before new year he took a sudden resolution and demanded a private interview with the general  i have come on an unpleasant errand sir he abruptly began as the old man received him with an expression which rather daunted the major my friendship for lady treherne and my guardianship of her children makes me jealous of the honor of the family i fear it is in danger sir pardon me for saying it but your wife is the cause  may i trouble you to explain major royston was all the generals reply as his old face grew stern and haughty  i will sir briefly i happen to know from jasper that there were love passages between miss dubarry and himself a year or more ago in paris a whim parted them and she married so far no reproach rests upon either but since she came here it has been evident to others as well as myself that jaspers affection has revived and that mrs snowdon does not reject and reprove it as she should they often meet and from jaspers manner i am convinced that mischief is afloat he is ardent headstrong and utterly regardless of the worlds opinion in some cases i have watched them and what i tell you is true  prove it  i will they meet in the north gallery wrapped in dark cloaks and play ghost if anyone comes i concealed myself behind the screen last evening at dusk and satisfied myself that my suspicions were correct i heard little of their conversation but that little was enough  repeat it if you please  sir jasper seemed pleading for some promise which she reluctantly gave saying while you live i will be true to my word with everyone but him he will suspect and it will be useless to keep it from him  he will shoot me for this if he knows i am the traitor expostulated jasper  he shall not know that i can hoodwink him easily and serve my purpose also  you are mysterious but i leave all to you and wait for my reward when shall i have it edith she laughed and answered so low i could not hear for they left the gallery as they spoke forgive me general for the pain i inflict you are the only person to whom i have spoken and you are the only person who can properly and promptly prevent this affair from bringing open shame and scandal on an honorable house to you i leave it and will do my part with this infatuated young man if you will withdraw the temptation which will ruin him  i will thank you major trust to me and by tomorrow i will prove that i can act as becomes me  the grief and misery in the generals face touched the major he silently wrung his hand and went away thanking heaven more fervently than ever that no cursed coquette of a woman had it in her power to break his heart  while this scene was going on above another was taking place in the library treherne sat there alone thinking happy thoughts evidently for his eyes shone and his lips smiled as he mused while watching the splendors of a winter sunset a soft rustle and the faint scent of violets warned him of mrs snowdons approach and a sudden foreboding told him that danger was near the instant he saw her face his fear was confirmed for exultation resolve and love met and mingled in the expression it wore leaning in the window recess where the red light shone full on her lovely face and queenly figure she said softly yet with a ruthless accent below the softness dreaming dreams maurice which will never come to pass unless i will it i know your secret and i shall use it to prevent the fulfillment of the foolish hope you cherish  who told you he demanded with an almost fierce flash of the eye and an angry flush  i discovered it as i warned you i should my memory is good i recall the gossip of long ago i observe the faces words and acts of those whom i suspect and unconscious hints from them give me the truth  i doubt it and treherne smiled securely  she stooped and whispered one short sentence into his ear whatever it was it caused him to start up with a pale panicstricken face and eye her as if she had pronounced his doom  do you doubt it now she asked coldly  he told you even your skill and craft could not discover it alone he muttered  nay i told you nothing was impossible to a determined woman i needed no help for i knew more than you think  he sank down again in a despairing attitude and hid his face saying mournfully i might have known you would hunt me down and dash my hopes when they were surest how will you use this unhappy secret  i will tell octavia and make her duty less hard it will be kind to both of you for even with her this memory would mar your happiness and it saves her from the shame and grief of discovering when too late that she has given herself to a  stop he cried in a tone that made her start and pale as he rose out of his chair white with a stern indignation which awed her for a moment you shall not utter that wordyou know but half the truth and if you wrong me or trouble the girl i will turn traitor also and tell the general the game you are playing with my cousin you feign to love me as you feigned before but his title is the bait now as then and you fancy that by threatening to mar my hopes you will secure my silence and gain your end  wrong quite wrong jasper is nothing to me i use him as a tool not you if i threaten it is to keep you from octavia who cannot forgive the past and love you for yourself as i have done all these miserable months you say i know but half the truth tell me the whole and i will spare you  if ever a man was tempted to betray a trust it was treherne then a word and octavia might be his silence and she might be lost for this woman was in earnest and possessed the power to ruin his good name forever the truth leaped to his lips and would have passed them had not his eye fallen on the portrait of jaspers father this man had loved and sheltered the orphan all his life had made of him a son and dying urged him to guard and serve and save the rebellious youth he left when most needing a fathers care  i promised and i will keep my promise at all costs sighed treherne and with a gesture full of pathetic patience he waved the fair tempter from him saying steadily i will never tell you though you rob me of that which is dearer than my life go and work your will but remember that when you might have won the deepest gratitude of the man you profess to love you chose instead to earn his hatred and contempt  waiting for no word of hers he took refuge in his room and edith snowdon sank down upon the couch struggling with contending emotions of love and jealousy remorse and despair how long she sat there she could not tell an approaching step recalled her to herself and looking up she saw octavia as the girl approached down the long vista of the drawing rooms her youth and beauty innocence and candor touched that fairer and more gifted woman with an envy she had never known before something in the girls face struck her instantly a look of peace and purity a sweet serenity more winning than loveliness more impressive than dignity or grace with a smile on her lips yet a halfsad halftender light in her eyes and a cluster of pale winter roses in her hand she came on till she stood before her rival and offering the flowers said in words as simple as sincere dear mrs snowdon i cannot let the last sun of the old year set on any misdeeds of mine for which i may atone i have disliked distrusted and misjudged you and now i come to you in all humility to say forgive me  with the girlish abandon of her impulsive nature octavia knelt down before the woman who was plotting to destroy her happiness laid the roses like a little peace offering on her lap and with eloquently pleading eyes waited for pardon for a moment mrs snowdon watched her fancying it a wellacted ruse to disarm a dangerous rival but in that sweet face there was no art one glance showed her that the words smote her to the heart and won her in spite of pride or passion as she suddenly took the girl into her arms weeping repentant tears neither spoke but in the silence each felt the barrier which had stood between them vanishing and each learned to know the other better in that moment than in a year of common life octavia rejoiced that the instinct which had prompted her to make this appeal had not misled her but assured her that behind the veil of coldness pride and levity which this woman wore there was a heart aching for sympathy and help and love mrs snowdon felt her worser self slip from her leaving all that was true and noble to make her worthy of the test applied art she could meet with equal art but nature conquered her for spite of her misspent life and faulty character the germ of virtue which lives in the worst was there only waiting for the fostering sun and dew of love to strengthen it even though the harvest be a late one  forgive you she cried brokenly it is i who should ask forgiveness of youi who should atone confess and repent pardon me pity me love me for i am more wretched than you know  dear i do with heart and soul believe it and let me be your friend was the soft answer  god knows i need one sighed the poor woman still holding fast the only creature who had wholly won her child i am not good but not so bad that i dare not look in your innocent face and call you friend i never had one of my own sex i never knew my mother and no one ever saw in me the possibility of goodness truth and justice but you trust and love and help me octavia and i will reward you with a better life if i can do no more  i will and the new year shall be happier than the old  god bless you for that prophecy may i be worthy of it  then as a bell warned them away the rivals kissed each other tenderly and parted friends as mrs snowdon entered her room she saw her husband sitting with his gray head in his hands and heard him murmur despairingly to himself my life makes her miserable but for the sin of it id die to free her  no live for me and teach me to be happy in your love the clear voice startled him but not so much as the beautiful changed face of the wife who laid the gray head on her bosom saying tenderly my kind and patient husband you have been deceived from me you shall know all the truth and when you have forgiven my faulty past you shall see how happy i will try to make your future     chapter vii   a ghostly revel  bless me how dull we are tonight exclaimed rose as the younger portion of the party wandered listlessly about the drawing rooms that evening while my lady and the major played an absorbing game of piquet and the general dozed peacefully at last  it is because maurice is not here he always keeps us going for he is a fellow of infinite resources replied sir jasper suppressing a yawn  have him out then said annon  he wont come the poor lad is blue tonight in spite of his improvement something is amiss and there is no getting a word from him  sad memories afflict him perhaps sighed blanche  dont be absurd dear sad memories are all nonsense melancholy is always indigestion and nothing is so sure a cure as fun said rose briskly im going to send in a polite invitation begging him to come and amuse us hell accept i havent a doubt  the message was sent but to roses chagrin a polite refusal was returned  he shall come sir jasper do you and mr annon go as a deputation from us and return without him at your peril was her command  they went and while waiting their reappearance the sisters spoke of what all had observed  how lovely mrs snowdon looks tonight i always thought she owed half her charms to her skill in dress but she never looked so beautiful as in that plain black silk with those roses in her hair said rose  what has she done to herself replied blanche i see a change but cant account for it she and tavie have made some beautifying discovery for both look altogether uplifted and angelic all of a sudden  here come the gentlemen and as im a talbot they havent got him cried rose as the deputation appeared looking very crestfallen dont come near me she added irefully you are disloyal cowards and i doom you to exile till i want you i am infinite in resources as well as this recreant man and come he shall mrs snowdon would you mind asking mr treherne to suggest something to wile away the rest of this evening we are in despair and can think of nothing and you are allpowerful with him  i must decline since he refuses you was the decided answer as mrs snowdon moved away  tavie dear do go we must have him he always obeys you and you would be such a public benefactor you know  without a word octavia wrote a line and sent it by a servant several minutes passed and the gentlemen began to lay wagers on the success of her trial he will not come for me you may be sure said octavia as the words passed her lips he appeared  a general laugh greeted him but taking no notice of the jests at his expense he turned to octavia saying quietly what can i do for you cousin  his colorless face and weary eyes reproached her for disturbing him but it was too late for regret and she answered hastily we are in want of some new and amusing occupation to wile away the evening can you suggest something appropriate  why not sit round the hall fire and tell stories while we wait to see the old year out as we used to do long ago he asked after a moments thought  i told you so there it is just what we want and sir jasper looked triumphant  its capitallet us begin at once it is after ten now so we shall not have long to wait cried rose and taking sir jaspers arm she led the way to the hall  a great fire always burned there and in wintertime thick carpets and curtains covered the stone floor and draped the tall windows plants blossomed in the warm atmosphere and chairs and lounges stood about invitingly the party was soon seated and treherne was desired to begin  we must have ghost stories and in order to be properly thrilling and effective the lights must be put out said rose who sat next him and spoke first as usual  this was soon done and only a ruddy circle of firelight was left to oppose the rapt gloom that filled the hall where shadows now seemed to lurk in every corner  dont be very dreadful or i shall faint away pleaded blanche drawing nearer to annon for she had taken her sisters advice and laid close siege to that gentlemans heart  i think your nerves will bear my little tale replied treherne when i was in india four years ago i had a very dear friend in my regimenta scotchman im half scotch myself you know and clannish of course gordon was sent up the country on a scouting expedition and never returned his men reported that he left them one evening to take a survey and his horse came home bloody and riderless we searched but could not find a trace of him and i was desperate to discover and avenge his murder about a month after his disappearance as i sat in my tent one fearfully hot day suddenly the canvas door flap was raised and there stood gordon i saw him as plainly as i see you jasper and should have sprung to meet him but something held me back he was deathly pale dripping with water and in his bonny blue eyes was a wild woeful look that made my blood run cold i stared dumbly for it was awful to see my friend so changed and so unearthly stretching his arm to me he took my hand saying solemnly come the touch was like ice an ominous thrill ran through me i started up to obey and he was gone  a horrid dream of course is that all asked rose  with his eyes on the fire and his left hand half extended treherne went on as if he had not heard her  i thought it was a fancy and soon recovered myself for no one had seen or heard anything of gordon and my native servant lay just outside my tent a strange sensation remained in the hand the phantom touched it was cold damp and white i found it vain to try to forget this apparition it took strong hold of me i told yermid my man and he bade me consider it a sign that i was to seek my friend that night i dreamed i was riding up the country in hot haste what led me i know not but i pressed on and on longing to reach the end a halfdried river crossed my path and riding down the steep bank to ford it i saw gordons body lying in the shallow water looking exactly as the vision looked i woke in a strange mood told the story to my commanding officer and as nothing was doing just then easily got leave of absence for a week taking yermid i set out on my sad quest i thought it folly but i could not resist the impulse that drew me on for seven days i searched and the strangest part of the story is that all that time i went on exactly as in the dream seeing what i saw then and led by the touch of a cold hand on mine on the seventh day i reached the river and found my friends body  how horrible is it really true cried mrs snowdon  as true as i am a living man nor is that all this left hand of mine never has been warm since that time see and feel for yourselves  he opened both hands and all satisfied themselves that the left was smaller paler and colder than the right  pray someone tell another story to put this out of my mind it makes me nervous said blanche  ill tell one and you may laugh to quiet your nerves i want to have mine done with so that i can enjoy the rest with a free mind with these words rose began her tale in the good old fashion  once upon a time when we were paying a visit to my blessed grandmamma i saw a ghost in this wise the dear old lady was ill with a cold and kept her room leaving us to mope for it was very dull in the great lonely house blanche and i were both homesick but didnt like to leave till she was better so we ransacked the library and solaced ourselves with all manner of queer books one day i found grandmamma very low and nervous and evidently with something on her mind she would say nothing but the next day was worse and i insisted on knowing the cause for the trouble was evidently mental charging me to keep it from blanche who was and is a sad coward she told me that a spirit had appeared to her two successive nights if it comes a third time i shall prepare to die said the foolish old lady  no you wont for ill come and stay with you and lay your ghost i said with some difficulty i made her yield and after blanche was asleep i slipped away to grandmamma with a book and candle for a long watch as the spirit didnt appear till after midnight she usually slept with her door unlocked in case of fire or fright and her maid was close by that night i locked the door telling her that spirits could come through the oak if they chose and i preferred to have a fair trial well i read and chatted and dozed till dawn and nothing appeared so i laughed at the whole affair and the old lady pretended to be convinced that it was all a fancy  next night i slept in my own room and in the morning was told that not only grandmamma but janet had seen the spirit all in white with streaming hair a pale face and a red streak at the throat it came and parted the bedcurtains looking in a moment and then vanished janet had slept with grandmamma and kept a lamp burning on the chimney so both saw it  i was puzzled but not frightened i never am and i insisted on trying again the door was left unlocked as on the previous night and i lay with grandmamma a light burning as before about two she clutched me as i was dropping off i looked and there peeping in between the dark curtains was a pale face with long hair all about it and a red streak at the throat it was very dim the light being low but i saw it and after one breathless minute sprang up caught my foot fell down with a crash and by the time i was around the bed not a vestige of the thing appeared i was angry and vowed id succeed at all hazards though ill confess i was just a bit daunted  next time janet and i sat up in easy chairs with bright lights burning and both wide awake with the strongest coffee we could make as the hour drew near we got nervous and when the white shape came gliding in janet hid her face i didnt and after one look was on the point of laughing for the spirit was blanche walking in her sleep she wore a coral necklace in those days and never took it off and her long hair half hid her face which had the unnatural uncanny look somnambulists always wear i had the sense to keep still and tell janet what to do so the poor child went back unwaked and grandmammas spirit never walked again for i took care of that  why did you haunt the old lady asked annon as the laughter ceased  i dont know unless it was that i wanted to ask leave to go home and was afraid to do it awake so tried when asleep i shall not tell any story as i was the heroine of this but will give my turn to you mr annon said blanche with a soft glance which was quite thrown away for the gentlemans eyes were fixed on octavia who sat on a low ottoman at mrs snowdons feet in the full glow of the firelight  ive had very small experience in ghosts and can only recall a little fright i once had when a boy at college id been out to a party got home tired couldnt find my matches and retired in the dark toward morning i woke and glancing up to see if the dim light was dawn or moonshine i was horrified to see a coffin standing at the beds foot i rubbed my eyes to be sure i was awake and looked with all my might there it was a long black coffin and i saw the white plate in the dusk for the moon was setting and my curtain was not drawn its some trick of the fellows i thought ill not betray myself but keep cool easy to say but hard to do for it suddenly flashed into my mind that i might be in the wrong room i glanced about but there were the familiar objects as usual as far as the indistinct light allowed me to see and i made sure by feeling on the wall at the beds head for my watchcase it was there and mine beyond a doubt being peculiar in shape and fabric had i been to a college wine party i could have accounted for the vision but a quiet evening in a grave professors wellconducted family could produce no ill effects its an optical illusion or a prank of my mates ill sleep and forget it i said and for a time endeavored to do so but curiosity overcame my resolve and soon i peeped again judge of my horror when i saw the sharp white outline of a dead face which seemed to be peeping up from the coffin it gave me a terrible shock for i was but a lad and had been ill i hid my face and quaked like a nervous girl still thinking it some joke and too proud to betray fear lest i should be laughed at how long i lay there i dont know but when i looked again the face was farther out and the whole figure seemed rising slowly the moon was nearly down i had no lamp and to be left in the dark with that awesome thing was more than i could bear joke or earnest i must end the panic and bolting out of my room i roused my neighbor he told me i was mad or drunk but lit a lamp and returned with me to find my horror only a heap of clothes thrown on the table in such a way that as the moons pale light shot it it struck upon my black students gown with a white card lying on it and produced the effect of a coffin and plate the face was a crumpled handkerchief and what seemed hair a brown muffler as the moon sank these outlines changed and incredible as it may seem grew like a face my friend not having had the fright enjoyed the joke and coffins was my sobriquet for a long while  you get worse and worse sir jasper do vary the horrors by a touch of fun or i shall run away said blanche glancing over her shoulder nervously  ill do my best and tell a story my uncle used to relate of his young days i forget the name of the place but it was some little country town famous among anglers my uncle often went to fish and always regretted that a deserted house near the trout stream was not occupied for the inn was inconveniently distant speaking of this one evening as he lounged in the landladys parlor he asked why no one took it and let the rooms to strangers in the fishing season for fear of the ghostissess your honor replied the woman and proceeded to tell him that three distinct spirits haunted the house in the garret was heard the hum of a wheel and the tap of highheeled shoes as the ghostly spinner went to and fro in a chamber sounded the sharpening of a knife followed by groans and the drip of blood the cellar was made awful by a skeleton sitting on a halfburied box and chuckling fiendishly it seems a miser lived there once and was believed to have starved his daughter in the garret keeping her at work till she died the second spirit was that of the girls rejected lover who cut his throat in the chamber and the third of the miser who was found dead on the money chest he was too feeble to conceal my uncle laughed at all this and offered to lay the ghosts if anyone would take the house  this offer got abroad and a crusty old fellow accepted it hoping to turn a penny he had a pretty girl whose love had been thwarted by the old man and whose lover was going to sea in despair my uncle knew this and pitied the young people he had made acquaintance with a wandering artist and the two agreed to conquer the prejudices against the house by taking rooms there they did so and after satisfying themselves regarding the noises consulted a wise old woman as to the best means of laying the ghosts she told them if any young girl would pass a night in each haunted room praying piously the while that all would be well peggy was asked if she would do it and being a stouthearted lass she consented for a round sum to try it the first night was in the garret and peggy in spite of the prophecies of the village gossips came out alive though listeners at the door heard the weird humming and tapping all night long the next night all went well and from that time no more sharpening groaning or dripping was heard the third time she bade her friends goodbye and wrapped in her red cloak with a lamp and prayer book went down into the cellar alas for pretty peggy when day came she was gone and with her the misers empty box though his bones remained to prove how well she had done her work  the town was in an uproar and the old man furious some said the devil had flown away with her others that the bones were hers and all agreed that henceforth another ghost would haunt the house my uncle and the artist did their best to comfort the father who sorely reproached himself for thwarting the girls love and declared that if jack would find her he should have her but jack had sailed and the old man was left lamenting the house was freed from its unearthly visitors however for no ghost appeared and when my uncle left old martin found money and letter informing him that peggy had spent her first two nights preparing for flight and on the third had gone away to marry and sail with jack the noises had been produced by the artist who was a ventriloquist the skeleton had been smuggled from the surgeons and the whole thing was a conspiracy to help peggy and accommodate the fishermen  it is evident that roguery is hereditary laughed rose as the narrator paused  i strongly suspect that sir jasper the second was the true hero of that story added mrs snowdon  think what you like ive done my part and leave the stage for you madam  i will come last it is your turn dear as mrs snowdon softly uttered the last word and octavia leaned upon her knee with an affectionate glance treherne leaned forward to catch a glimpse of the two changed faces and looked as if bewildered when both smiled at him as they sat hand in hand while the girl told her story  long ago a famous actress suddenly dropped dead at the close of a splendidly played tragedy she was carried home and preparations were made to bury her the play had been gotten up with great care and expense and a fine actor was the hero the public demanded a repetition and an inferior person was engaged to take the dead ladys part a days delay had been necessary but when the night came the house was crowded they waited both before and behind the curtain for the debut of the new actress with much curiosity she stood waiting for her cue but as it was given to the amazement of all the great tragedienne glided upon the stage pale as marble and with a strange fire in her eyes strange pathos in her voice strange power in her acting she went through her part and at the close vanished as mysteriously as she came great was the excitement that night and intense the astonishment and horror next day when it was whispered abroad that the dead woman never had revived but had lain in her coffin before the eyes of watchers all the evening when hundreds fancied they were applauding her at the theater the mystery never was cleared up and paris was divided by two opinions one that some person marvelously like madame z had personated her for the sake of a sensation the other that the ghost of the dead actress unable to free itself from the old duties so full of fascination to an ambitious and successful woman had played for the last time the part which had made her famous  where did you find that tavie its very french and not bad if you invented it said sir jasper  i read it in an old book where it was much better told now edith there is just time for your tale  as the word edith passed her lips again treherne started and eyed them both and again they smiled as mrs snowdon caressed the smooth cheek leaning on her knee and looking full at him began the last recital  you have been recounting the pranks of imaginary ghosts let me show you the workings of some real spirits evil and good that haunt every heart and home making its misery or joy at christmastime in a country house a party of friends met to keep the holidays and very happily they might have done so had not one person marred the peace of several love jealousy deceit and nobleness were the spirits that played their freaks with these people the person of whom i speak was more haunted than the rest and much tormented being willful proud and jealous heaven help her she had had no one to exorcise these ghosts for her and they goaded her to do much harm among these friends there were more than one pair of lovers and much tangling of plots and plans for hearts are wayward and mysterious things and cannot love as duty bids or prudence counsels this woman held the key to all the secrets of the house and having a purpose to gain she used her power selfishly for a time to satisfy a doubt she feigned a fancy for a gentleman who once did her the honor of admiring her and to the great scandal of certain sage persons permitted him to show his regard for her knowing that it was but a transient amusement on his part as well as upon hers in the hands of this woman lay a secret which could make or mar the happiness of the best and dearest of the party the evil spirits which haunted her urged her to mar their peace and gratify a sinful hope on the other side honor justice and generosity prompted her to make them happy and while she wavered there came to her a sweet enchantress who with a word banished the tormenting ghosts forever and gave the haunted woman a talisman to keep her free henceforth  there the earnest voice faltered and with a sudden impulse mrs snowdon bent her head and kissed the fair forehead which had bent lower and lower as she went on each listener understood the truth lightly veiled in that hasty fable and each found in it a different meaning sir jasper frowned and bit his lips annon glanced anxiously from face to face octavia hid hers and trehernes flashed with sudden intelligence while rose laughed low to herself enjoying the scene blanche who was getting sleepy said with a stifled gape that is a very nice moral little story but i wish there had been some real ghosts in it  there was will you come and see them  as she put the question mrs snowdon rose abruptly wishing to end the séance and beckoning them to follow glided up the great stairway all obeyed wondering what whim possessed her and quite ready for any jest in store for them     chapter viii   jasper  she led them to the north gallery and pausing at the door said merrily the ghostor ghosts rather for there were twowhich frightened patty were sir jasper and myself meeting to discuss certain important matters which concerned mr treherne if you want to see spirits we will play phantom for you and convince you of our power  good let us go and have a ghostly dance as a proper finale of our revel answered rose as they flocked into the long hall  at that moment the great clock struck twelve and all paused to bid the old year adieu sir jasper was the first to speak for angry with mrs snowdon yet thankful to her for making a jest to others of what had been earnest to him he desired to hide his chagrin under a gay manner and taking rose around the waist was about to waltz away as she proposed saying cheerily come one and all and dance the new year in when a cry from octavia arrested him and turning he saw her stand pale and trembling pointing to the far end of the hall  eight narrow gothic windows pierced either wall of the north gallery a full moon sent her silvery light strongly in upon the eastern side making broad bars of brightness across the floor no fires burned there now and wherever the moonlight did not fall deep shadows lay as octavia cried out all looked and all distinctly saw a tall dark figure moving noiselessly across the second bar of light far down the hall  is it some jest of yours asked sir jasper of mrs snowdon as the form vanished in the shadow  no upon my honor i know nothing of it i only meant to relieve octavias superstitious fears by showing her our pranks was the whispered reply as mrs snowdons cheek paled and she drew nearer to jasper  who is there called treherne in a commanding tone  no answer but a faint cold breath of air seemed to sigh along the arched roof and die away as the dark figure crossed the third streak of moonlight a strange awe fell upon them all and no one spoke but stood watching for the appearance of the shape nearer and nearer it came with soundless steps and as it reached the sixth window its outlines were distinctly visible a tall wasted figure all in black with a rosary hanging from the girdle and a dark beard half concealing the face  the abbots ghost and very well got up said annon trying to laugh but failing decidedly for again the cold breath swept over them causing a general shudder  hush whispered treherne drawing octavia to his side with a protecting gesture  once more the phantom appeared and disappeared and as they waited for it to cross the last bar of light that lay between it and them mrs snowdon stepped forward to the edge of the shadow in which they stood as if to confront the apparition alone out of the darkness it came and in the full radiance of the light it paused mrs snowdon being nearest saw the face first and uttering a faint cry dropped down upon the stone floor covering up her eyes nothing human ever wore a look like that of the ghastly holloweyed palelipped countenance below the hood all saw it and held their breath as it slowly raised a shadowy arm and pointed a shriveled finger at sir jasper  speak whatever you are or ill quickly prove whether you are man or spirit cried jasper fiercely stepping forward as if to grasp the extended arm that seemed to menace him alone  an icy gust swept through the hall and the phantom slowly receded into the shadow jasper sprang after it but nothing crossed the second stream of light and nothing remained in the shade like one possessed by a sudden fancy he rushed down the gallery to find all fast and empty and to return looking very strangely blanche had fainted away and annon was bearing her out of the hall rose was clinging to mrs snowdon and octavia leaned against her cousin saying in a fervent whisper thank god it did not point at you  am i then dearer than your brother he whispered back  there was no audible reply but one little hand involuntarily pressed his though the other was outstretched toward jasper who came up white and startled but firm and quiet affecting to make light of it he said forcing a smile as he raised mrs snowdon it is some stupid joke of the servants let us think no more of it come edith this is not like your usual self  it was nothing human jasper you know it as well as i oh why did i bring you here to meet the warning phantom that haunts your house  nay if my time is near the spirit would have found me out wherever i might be i have no faith in that absurd superstitioni laugh at and defy it come down and drink my health in wine from the abbots own cellar  but no one had heart for further gaiety and finding lady treherne already alarmed by annon they were forced to tell her all and find their own bewilderment deepened by her unalterable belief in the evil omen  at her command the house was searched the servants crossquestioned and every effort made to discover the identity of the apparition all in vain the house was as usual and not a man or maid but turned pale at the idea of entering the gallery at midnight at my ladys request all promised to say no more upon the mystery and separated at last to such sleep as they could enjoy  very grave were the faces gathered about the breakfast table next morning and very anxious the glances cast on sir jasper as he came in late as usual looking uncommonly blithe and well nothing serious ever made a deep impression on his mercurial nature treherne had more the air of a doomed man being very pale and worn in spite of an occasional gleam of happiness as he looked at octavia he haunted jasper like a shadow all the morning much to that young gentlemans annoyance for both his mother and sister hung about him with faces of illdissembled anxiety by afternoon his patience gave out and he openly rebelled against the tender guard kept over him ringing for his horse he said decidedly im bored to death with the solemnity which pervades the house today so im off for a brisk gallop before i lose my temper and spirits altogether  come with me in the pony carriage jasper ive not had a drive with you for a long while and should enjoy it so much said my lady detaining him  mrs snowdon looks as if she needed air to revive her roses and the pony carriage is just the thing for her so i will cheerfully resign my seat to her he answered laughing as he forced himself from his mothers hand  take the girls in the clarence we all want a breath of air and you are the best whip we know be gallant and say yes dear  no thank you tavie that wont do rose and blanche are both asleep and you are dying to go and do likewise after your vigils last night as a man and a brother i beg youll do so and let me ride as i like  suppose you ask annon to join you began treherne with wellassumed indifference but sir jasper frowned and turned sharply on him saying halfpetulantly halfjocosely  upon my life i should think i was a boy or a baby by the manner in which you mount guard over me today if you think im going to live in daily fear of some mishap you are all much mistaken ghost or no ghost i shall make merry while i can a short life and a jolly one has always been my motto you know so fare you well till dinnertime  they watched him gallop down the avenue and then went their different ways still burdened with a nameless foreboding octavia strolled into the conservatory thinking to refresh herself with the balmy silence which pervaded the place but annon soon joined her full of a lovers hopes and fears  miss treherne i have ventured to come for my answer is my new year to be a blissful or a sad one he asked eagerly  forgive me if i give you an unwelcome reply but i must be true and so regretfully refuse the honor you do me she said sorrowfully  may i ask why  because i do not love you  and you do love your cousin he cried angrily pausing to watch her halfaverted face  she turned it fully toward him and answered with her native sincerity yes i do with all my heart and now my mother will not thwart me for maurice has saved my life and i am free to devote it all to him  happy man i wish i had been a cripple sighed annon then with a manful effort to be just and generous he added heartily say no more he deserves you i want no sacrifice to duty i yield and go away praying heaven to bless you now and always  he kissed her hand and left her to seek my lady and make his adieus for no persuasion could keep him leaving a note for sir jasper he hurried away to the great relief of treherne and the deep regret of blanche who however lived in hopes of another trial later in the season  here comes jasper mamma safe and well cried octavia an hour or two later as she joined her mother on the terrace where my lady had been pacing restlessly to and fro nearly ever since her son rode away  with a smile of intense relief she waved her handkerchief as he came clattering up the drive and seeing her he answered with hat and hand he usually dismounted at the great hall door but a sudden whim made him ride along the wall that lay below the terrace for he was a fine horseman and mrs snowdon was looking from her window as he approached the peacocks fled screaming and one flew up just before the horses eyes as his master was in the act of dismounting the spirited creature was startled sprang partway up the low broad steps of the terrace and being sharply checked slipped fell and man and horse rolled down together  never did those who heard it forget the cry that left lady trehernes lips as she saw the fall it brought out both guests and servants to find octavia recklessly struggling with the frightened horse and my lady down upon the stones with her sons bleeding head in her arms  they bore in the senseless shattered body and for hours tried everything that skill and sciences could devise to save the young mans life but every effort was in vain and as the sun set sir jasper lay dying conscious at last and able to speak he looked about him with a troubled glance and seemed struggling with some desire that overmastered pain and held death at bay  i want maurice he feebly said at length  dear lad im here answered his cousins voice from a seat in the shadow of the halfdrawn curtains  always near when i need you many a scrape have you helped me out of but this is beyond your power and a faint smile passed over jaspers lips as the past flitted before his mind but the smile died and a groan of pain escaped him as he cried suddenly quick let me tell it before it is too late maurice never will but bear the shame all his life that my dead name may be untarnished bring edith she must hear the truth  she was soon there and lying in his mothers arms one hand in his cousins and one on his sisters bent head jasper rapidly told the secret which had burdened him for a year  i did it i forged my uncles name when i had lost so heavily at play that i dared not tell my mother or squander more of my own fortune i deceived maurice and let him think the check a genuine one i made him present it and get the money and when all went well i fancied i was safe but my uncle discovered it secretly said nothing and believing maurice the forger disinherited him i never knew this till the old man died and then it was too late i confessed to maurice and he forgave me he said i am helpless now shut out from the world with nothing to lose or gain and soon to be forgotten by those who once knew me so let the suspicion of shame if any such there be still cling to me and do you go your way rich happy honorable and untouched by any shadow on your fame mother i let him do it unconscious as he was that many knew the secret sin and fancied him the doer of it  hush jasper let it pass i can bear it i promised your dear father to be your staunch friend through life and i have only kept my word  god knows you have but now my life ends and i cannot die till you are cleared edith i told you half the truth and you would have used it against him had not some angel sent this girl to touch your heart you have done your part to atone for the past now let me do mine mother tavie loves him he has risked life and honor for me repay him generously and give him this  with feeble touch sir jasper tried to lay his sisters hand in trehernes as he spoke mrs snowdon helped him and as my lady bowed her head in silent acquiescence a joyful smile shone on the dying mans face  one more confession and then i am ready he said looking up into the face of the woman whom he had loved with all the power of a shallow nature it was a jest to you edith but it was bitter earnest to me for i loved you sinful as it was ask your husband to forgive me and tell him it was better i should die than live to mar a good mans peace kiss me once and make him happy for my sake  she touched his cold lips with remorseful tenderness and in the same breath registered a vow to obey that dying prayer  tavie dear maurice my brother god bless you both goodbye mother he will be a better son than i have been to you then the reckless spirit of the man surviving to the last sir jasper laughed faintly as he seemed to beckon some invisible shape and died saying gaily now father abbot lead on ill follow you                                       a year later three weddings were celebrated on the same day and in the same church maurice treherne a well man led up his cousin frank annon rewarded blanches patient siege by an unconditional surrender and to the infinite amusement of mrs grundy major royston publicly confessed himself outgeneraled by merry rose the triple wedding feast was celebrated at treherne abbey and no uncanny visitor marred its festivities for never again was the north gallery haunted by the ghostly abbot
