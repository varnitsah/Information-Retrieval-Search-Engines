taste in gratitude for her condemnation of all superior authors and in the hope of propitiating her creators and expounders this volume is reverentially dedicated by her devout worshipper  the author       preface      the atrocities constituting this cold collation of diabolisms are taken mainly from various californian journals they are cast in the american language and liberally enriched with unintelligibility if they shall prove incomprehensible on this side of the atlantic the reader can pass to the other side at a moderately extortionate charge in the pursuit of my design i think i have killed a good many people in one way and another but the reader will please to observe that they were not people worth the trouble of leaving alive besides i had the interests of my collaborator to consult in writing as in compiling i have been ably assisted by my scholarly friend mr satan and to this worthy gentleman must be attributed most of the views herein set forth while the plan of the work is partly my own its spirit is wholly his and this illustrates the ascendancy of the creative over the merely imitative mind palmam qui meruit ferati shall be content with the profit  dod grile       some fiction  one more unfortunate      it was midnighta black wet midnightin a great city by the sea the church clocks were booming the hour in tones halfsmothered by the marching rain when an officer of the watch saw a female figure glide past him like a ghost in the gloom and make directly toward a wharf the officer felt that some dreadful tragedy was about to be enacted and started in pursuit through the sleeping city sped those two dark figures like shadows athwart a tomb out along the deserted wharf to its farther end fled the mysterious fugitive the guardian of the night vainly endeavouring to overtake and calling to her to stay soon she stood upon the extreme end of the pier in the scourging rain which lashed her fragile figure and blinded her eyes with other tears than those of grief the night wind tossed her tresses wildly in air and beneath her bare feet the writhing billows struggled blackly upward for their prey at this fearful moment the panting officer stumbled and fell he was badly bruised he felt angry and misanthropic instead of rising to his feet he sat doggedly up and began chafing his abraded shin the desperate woman raised her white arms heavenward for the final plunge and the voice of the gale seemed like the dread roaring of the waters in her ears as down down she wentin imaginationto a black death among the spectral piles she backed a few paces to secure an impetus cast a last look upon the stony officer with a wild shriek sprang to the awful verge and came near losing her balance recovering herself with an effort she turned her face again to the officer who was clawing about for his missing club having secured it he started to leave  in a cosy vineembowered cottage near the sounding sea lives and suffers a blighted female nothing being known of her past history she is treated by her neighbours with marked respect she never speaks of the past but it has been remarked that whenever the stalwart form of a

the wake of a horseopera and the same sojourned at colusa enters unto the side show a powerful young man of the colusa sort and would see his moneys worth blandly and with conscious pride the professor directs the young mans attention to his fine collection of living snakes lithely the blacksnake uncoils in his sight voluminously the bloated boa convolves before him all horrent the cobra exalts his hooded head and the spanning jaws fly open quivers and chitters the tail of the cheerful rattlesnake silently slips out the forked tongue and is as silently absorbed the fangless adder warps up the leg of the professor lays clammy coils about his neck and pokes a flattened head curiously into his open mouth the young man of colusa is interested his feelings transcend expression not a syllable breathes he but with a deepdrawn sigh he turns his broad back upon the astonishing display and goes thoughtfully forth into his native wild half an hour later might have been seen that brawny colusan emerging from an adjacent forest with a strong faggot  then this colusa young man unto the appalled professor thus ther aint no good place yer in kerloosy fur fittin out serpence to be

credit to a lean porker garnering the strewn kernels behind a deaf old man who plants his field with corn he started in upon that reptilian host and exterminated it with a careful thoroughness of extermination       the glad new year      a poor brokendown drunkard returned to his dilapidated domicile early on new years morn the great bells of the churches were jarring the creamy moonlight which lay above the soggy undercrust of mud and snow as he heard their joyous peals announcing the birth of a new year his heart smote his old waistcoat like a remorseful sledgehammer  why soliloquized he should not those bells also proclaim the advent of a new resolution i have not made one for several weeks and its about time ill swear off  he did it and at that moment a new light seemed to be shed upon his pathway his wife came out of the house with a tin lantern he rushed frantically to meet her she saw the new and holy purpose in his eye she recognised it readilyshe had seen it before they embraced and wept then stretching the wreck of what had once been a manly form to its full length he raised his eyes to heaven and one hand as near there as he could get it and there in the pale moonlight with only his wondering wife and the angels and a cow or two for witnesses he swore he would from that moment abstain from all intoxicating liquors until death should them part then looking down and tenderly smiling into the eyes of his wife he said is it not well dear one with a face beaming all over with a new happiness she replied  indeed it is johnlets take a drink and they took one she with sugar and he plain  the spot is still pointed out to the traveller the late dowling senior  my friend jacob dowling esq had been spending the day very agreeably in his countingroom with some companions and at night retired to the domestic circle to ravel out some intricate accounts seated at his parlour table he ordered his wife and children out of the room and addressed himself to business while clambering wearily up a column of figures he felt upon his cheek the touch of something that seemed to cling clammily to the skin like the caress of a naked oyster thoughtfully setting down the result of his addition so far as he had proceeded with it he turned about and looked up  i beg your pardon sir said he but you have not the advantage of my acquaintance  why jake replied the apparitionwhom i have thought it useless to describedont you know me  i confess that your countenance is familiar returned my friend but i cannot at this moment recall your name i never forget a face but names i cannot remember  jake rumbled the spectre with sepulchral dignity a look of displeasure crawling across his pallid features youre foolin  i give you my word i am quite serious oblige me with your name and favour me with a statement of your business with me at this hour  the disembodied party sank uninvited into a chair spread out his knees and stared blankly at a dutch clock with an air of weariness and profound discouragement perceiving that his guest was making himself tolerably comfortable my friend turned again to his figures and silence reigned supreme the fire in the grate burned noiselessly with a mysterious blue light as if it could do more if it wished the dutch clock looked wise and swung its pendulum with studied exactness like one who is determined to do his precise duty and shun responsibility the cat assumed an attitude of intelligent neutrality finally the spectre trained his pale eyes upon his host pulled in a long breath and remarked  jake im yur dead father i come back to have a talk with ye bout the way things is agoin on i want to know f you think its right notter recognise yur dead parent  it is a little rough on you dear replied the son without looking up but the fact is that 7 and 3 are 10 and 2 are 12 and 6 are 18 it is so long since you have been about and 3 off are 15 that i had kind of forgotten and 2 into 4

youve no idee how exclusive they are where i am  this dutiful son laid down his pencil and effected a stiffly vertical attitude he was all attention  anything else today he askedrather sneeringly i grieve to state  nooo i dont think of anything special drawled the ghost reflectively id like to have an iron fence around it to keep the cows off but i spose thats included  of course and a gravel

that  with pleasure sir but that will be extra now indulge me in one question you spoke of the society where you reside where do you reside  the dutch clock pounded clamorously upon its brazen gong a countless multitude of hours the glowing coals fell like an avalanche through the grate spilling all over the cat who exalted her voice in a squawk like the deathwail of a stuck pig and dashed affrighted through the window a smell of scorching fur pervaded the place and under cover of it the aged spectre walked into the mirror vanishing like a dream loves labour lost  joab was a beef who was tired of being courted for his clean smooth skin so he backed through a narrow gateway six or eight times which made his hair stand the wrong way he then went and rubbed his fat sides against a charred log this made him look untidy you never looked worse in your life than joab did  now said he i shall be loved for myself alone i will change my name and hie me to pastures new and all the affection that is then lavished upon me will be pure and disinterested  so he strayed off into the woods and came out at old abner davis ranch the two things abner valued most were a windmill and a scratchingpost for hogs they were equally beautiful and the fame of their comeliness had gone widely abroad to them joab naturally paid his attention the windmill who was called lucille ashtonbury clifford received him with expressions of the liveliest disgust his protestations of affection were met by creakings of contempt and as he turned sadly away he was rewarded by a sound spank from one of her fans like a gentlemanly beef he did not deign to avenge the insult by overturning lucille ashtonbury and it is well for him that he did not for old abner stood by with a pitchfork and a trinity of dogs  disgusted with the selfish heartlessness of society joab shambled off and was passing the scratchingpost without noticing her her name was arabella cliftonbury howard suddenly she kicked away a multitude of pigs who were at her feet and called to the rolling beef of uncanny exterior  comeer  joab paused looked at her with his oxeyes and gravely marching up commenced a vigorous scratching against her  arabella said he do you think you could love a shaggyhided beef with black hair could you love him for himself alone  arabella had observed that the black rubbed off and the hair lay sleek when stroked the right way  yes i think so could you  this was a poser joab had expected her to talk business he did not reply it was only her arch way she thought naturally that the best way to win any bodys love was to be a fool she saw her mistake she had associated with hogs all her life and this fellow was a beef mistakes must be rectified very speedily in these matters  sir i have for you a peculiar feeling i may say a tenderness hereafter you and you only shall scratch against arabella cliftonbury howard  joab was delighted he stayed and scratched all day he was loved for himself alone and he did not care for anything but that then he went home made an elaborate toilet and returned to astonish her alas old abner had been about and seeing how joab had worn her smooth and useless had cut her down for firewood joab gave one glance then walked solemnly away into a clearing and getting comfortably astride a blazing heap of logs made a barbacue of himself  after all lucille ashtonbury clifford the lightheaded windmill seems to have got the best of all this i have observed that the lightheaded commonly get the best of everything in this world which the woodenheaded and the beefheaded regard as an outrage i am not prepared to say if it is or not a comforter  william bunker had paid a fine of two hundred dollars for beating his wife after getting his receipt he went moodily home and seated himself at the domestic hearth observing his abstracted and melancholy demeanour the good wife approached and tenderly inquired the cause its a delicate subject dear said he with love light in his eyes lets talk about something good to eat  then with true wifely instinct she sought to cheer him up with pleasing prattle of a new bonnet he had promised her ah darling he sighed absently picking up the firepoker and turning it in his hands let us change the subject  then his souls idol chirped an inspiring ballad kissed him on the top of his head and sweetly mentioned that the dressmaker had sent in her bill let us talk only of love returned he thoughtfully rolling up his dexter sleeve  and so she spoke of the vineenfolded cottage in which she fondly hoped they might soon sip together the conjugal sweets william became rigidly erect a look not of earth was in his face his breast heaved and the firepoker quivered with emotion william felt deeply mine own said the good woman now busily irrigating a mass of snowy dough for the evening meal do you know that there is not a bite of meat in the house  it is a cold unlovely trutha sad heartsickening factbut it must be told by the conscientious novelist william repaid all this affectionate solicitudeall this womanly devotion all this trust confidence and abnegation in a manner that needs not be particularly specified  a short sharp curve in the middle of that iron firepoker is eloquent of a wrong redressed little isaac  mr gobwottle came home from a meeting of the temperance legion extremely drunk he went to the bed piled himself loosely atop of it and forgot his identity about the middle of the night his wife who was sitting up darning stockings heard a voice from the profoundest depths of the bolster say jane  jane gave a vicious stab with the needle impaling one of her fingers and continued her work there was a long silence faintly punctuated by the bark of a distant dog again that voicesayjane  the lady laid aside her work and wearily replied isaac do go to sleep they are off  another and longer pause during which the ticking of the clock became painful in the intensity of the silence it seemed to be measuring jane whats off why your boots to be sure replied the petulant woman losing patience i pulled them off when you first lay down  again the prostrate gentleman was still then when the candle of the waking housewife had burned low down to the socket and the wasted flame on the hearth was expiring bluely in convulsive leaps the head of the family resumed jane who said anything about boots  there was no reply apparently none was expected for the man immediately rose lengthened himself out like a telescope and continued jane i must have smothered that brat and im fernal sorry  what brat asked the wife becoming interested  why oursour little isaac i saw you put im in bed last week and ive been layin right onto im  what under the sun do you mean asked the good wife we havent any brat and never had and his name should not be isaac if we had i believe you are crazy  the man balanced his bulk rather unsteadily looked hard into the eyes of his companion and triumphantly emitted the following conundrum jane lookahere if we havent any brat whatn thunders the use o bein married  pending the solution of the momentous problem its author went out and searched the night for a whiskyskin       the heels of her      passing down commercialstreet one fine day i observed a lady standing alone in the middle of the sidewalk with no obvious business there but with apparently no intention of going on she was outwardly very calm and seemed at first glance to be lost in some serene philosophical meditation a closer examination however revealed a peculiar restlessness of attitude and a barely noticeable uneasiness of expression the conviction came upon me that the lady was in distress and as delicately as possible i inquired of her if such were not the case intimating at the same time that i should esteem it a great favour to be permitted to do something the lady smiled blandly and replied that she was merely waiting for a gentleman it was tolerably evident that i was not required and with a stammered apology i hastened away passed clear around the block came up behind her and took up a position on a drygoods box it lacked an hour to dinner time and i had leisure the lady maintained her attitude but with momently increasing impatience which found expression in singular wavelike undulations of her lithe figure and an occasional unmistakeable contortion several gentlemen approached but were successively and politely dismissed suddenly she experienced a quick convulsion strode sharply forward one step stopped short had another convulsion and walked rapidly away approaching the spot i found a small iron grating in the sidewalk and between the bars two little boot heels riven from their kindred soles and unsightly with snaggy nails  heaven only knows why that entrapped female had declined the proffered assistance of her specieswhy she had elected to ruin her boots in preference to having them removed from her feet upon that day when the grave shall give up its dead and the secrets of all hearts shall be revealed i shall know all about it but i want to know now a tale of two feet  my friend zacharias was accustomed to sleep with a heated stone at his feet for the feet of mr zacharias were as the feet of the dead one night he retired as usual and it chanced that he awoke some hours afterwards with a welldefined smell of burning leather making it pleasant for his nostrils  mrs zacharias said he nudging his snoring spouse i wish you would get up and look about i think one of the children must have fallen into the fire  the lady who from habit had her own feet stowed comfortably away against the warm stomach of her lord and master declined to make the investigation demanded and resumed the nocturnal melody mr zacharias was angered for the first time since she had sworn to love honour and obey this female was in open rebellion he decided upon prompt and vigorous action he quietly moved over to the back side of the bed and braced his shoulders against the wall drawing up his sinewy knees to a level with his breast he placed the soles of his feet broadly against the back of the insurgent with the design of propelling her against the opposite wall there was a strangled snort then a shriek of female agony and the neighbours came in  mutual explanations followed and mr zacharias walked the streets of grass valley next day as if he were treading upon eggs worth a dollar a dozen the scolliver pig  one of thomas jeffersons maxims is as follows when angry count ten before you speak if very angry count a hundred i once knew a man to square his conduct by this rule with a most gratifying result jacob scolliver a man prone to bad temper one day started across the fields to visit his father whom he generously permitted to till a small corner of the old homestead he found the old gentleman behind the barn bending over a barrel that was canted over at an angle of seventy degrees and from which issued a cloud of steam scolliver père was evidently scalding one end of a dead pigan operation essential to the loosening of the hair that the corpse may be plucked and shaven  good morning father said mr scolliver approaching and displaying a long cheerful smile got a nice roaster there the elder gentlemans head turned slowly and steadily as upon a swivel until his eyes pointed backward then he drew his arms out of the barrel and finally revolving his body till it matched his head he deliberately mounted upon the supporting block and sat down upon the sharp edge of the barrel in the hot steam then he replied good mornin jacob fine mornin  a little warm in spots i should imagine returned the son do you find that a comfortable seat whyyesits good enough for an old man he answered in a slightly husky voice and with an uneasy gesture of the legs dont make much difference in this life where we set if were gooddoes it this world aint heaven anyhow i sspose  there i do not entirely agree with you rejoined the young man composing his body upon a stump for a philosophical argument i dont neither added the old one absently screwing about on the edge of the barrel and constructing a painful grimace there was no argument but a silence instead suddenly the aged party sprang off that barrel with exceeding great haste as of one who has made up his mind to do a thing and is impatient of delay the seat of his trousers was steaming grandly the barrel upset and there was a great wash of hot water leaving a deposit of spotted pig in life that pig had belonged to mr scolliver the younger mr scolliver the younger was angry but remembering jeffersons maxim he rattled off the number ten finishing up with youthief then perceiving himself very angry he began all over again and ran up to one hundred as a monkey scampers up a ladder as the last syllable shot from his lips he planted a dreadful blow between the old mans eyes with a shriek that sounded likeyou son of a seacook  mr scolliver the elder went down like a stricken beef and his son often afterward explained that if he had not counted a hundred and so given himself time to get thoroughly mad he did not believe he could ever have licked the old man mr hunkers mourner  strolling through lone mountain cemetery one day my attention was arrested by the inconsolable grief of a granite angel bewailing the loss of jacob hunker aged 67 the attitude of utter dejection the look of matchless misery upon that angels face sank into my heart like water into a sponge i was about to offer some words of condolence when another man similarly affected got in before me and laying a rather unsteady hand upon the celestial shoulder tipped back a very senile hat and pointing to the name on the stone remarked with the most exact care and scrupulous accent friend of yours perhaps been dead long  there was no reply he continued very worthy man that jake knew him up in tuolumne good fellerjake no response the gentleman settled his hat still farther back and continued with a trifle less exactness of speech i say young womn jake was my pard in the mines goo fellr i bserved  the last sentence was shot straight into the celestial ear at short range it produced no effect the gentlemans patience and rhetorical vigilance were now completely exhausted he walked round and planting himself defiantly in front of the vicarious mourner he stuck his hands doggedly into his pockets and delivered the following rebuke like the desultory explosions of a bunch of damaged firecrackers it wont do old girl ef jake knowed how yous treatin his old pard hed jest git up and snatch you bald headedhe would you aint no friend o hisn and you aint yur fur no goodyou bet now you jest sling your swag an bolt back to heaven or im hanged ef i dont have suthin worsen horsestealin to answer fur this time  and he took a step forward at this point i interfered a bit of chivalry  at woodwards garden in the city of san francisco is a rather badly chiselled statue of pandora pulling open her casket of ills pandoras raiment i grieve to state has slipped down about her waist in a manner exceedingly reprehensible one evening about twilight i was passing that way and saw a long gaunt miner evidently just down from the mountains and whom i had seen before standing rather unsteadily in front of pandora admiring her shapely figure but seemingly afraid to approach her seeing me advance he turned to me with a queer puzzled expression in his funny eyes and said with an earnestness that came near defeating its purpose good evnn tye stranger good evening sir i replied after having analyzed his salutation and extracted the sense of it lowering his voice to what was intended for a whisper the miner with a jerk of his thumb pandoraward continued stranger dye hapn tknow er certainly that is bridget pandora a greek maiden in the pay of the board of supervisors  he straightened himself up with a jerk that threatened the integrity of his neck and made his teeth snap lurched heavily to the other side oscillated critically for a few moments and muttered brdgtpnd it was too much for him he went down into his pocket fumbled feebly round and finally drawing out a paper of purely hypothetical tobacco conveyed it to his mouth and bit off about twothirds of it which he masticated with much apparent benefit to his understanding offering what was left to me he then resumed the conversation with the easy familiarity of one who has established a claim to respectful attention  pardner couldnt ye interdooce a felrs wants tknower impossible i have not the honour of her acquaintance a look of distrust crept into his face and finally settled into a savage scowl about his eyes sed ye knew er he faltered menacingly so i do but i am not upon speaking terms with her andin fact she declines to recognise me the soul of the honest miner flamed out he laid his hand threateningly upon his pistol jerked himself stiff glared a moment at me with the look of a tiger and hurled this question at my head as if it had been an iron interrogation point wat a yer ben adoin to that gurl  i fled and the last i saw of the chivalrous goldhunter he had his arm about pandoras stony waist and was endeavouring to soothe her supposed agitation by stroking her granite head the head of the family  our story begins with the death of our hero the manner of it was decapitation the instrument a mowing machine a young son of the deceased dumb with horror seized the paternal head and ran with it to the house  there ejaculated the young man bowling the gory pate across the threshold at his mothers feet look at that will you  the old lady adjusted her spectacles lifted the dripping head into her lap wiped the face of it with her apron and gazed into its fishy eyes with tender curiosity john said she thoughtfully is this yours  no ma it aint none o mine  john continued she with a cold unimpassioned earnestness where did you get this thing  why ma returned the hopeful thats paps  johnand there was just a touch of severity in her voicewhen your mother asks you a question you should answer that particular question where did you get this  out in the medder then if youre so derned pertikeller retorted the youngster somewhat piqued the mowin machine lopped it off  the old lady rose and restored the head into the hands of the young man then straightening with some difficulty her aged back and assuming a matronly dignity of bearing and feature she emitted the rebuke following  my son the gentleman whom you hold in your handany more pointed allusion to whom would be painful to both of ushas punished you a hundred times for meddling with things lying about the farm take that head back and put it down where you found it or you will make your mother very angry deathbed repentance  an old man of seventyfive years lay dying for a lifetime he had turned a deaf ear to religion and steeped his soul in every current crime he had robbed the orphan and plundered the widow he had wrested from the hard hands of honest toil the rewards of labour had lost at the gamingtable the wealth with which he should have endowed churches and sunday schools had wasted in riotous living the substance of his patrimony and left his wife and children without bread the intoxicating bowl had been his godhis belly had absorbed his entire attention in carnal pleasures passed his days and nights and to the maddening desires of his heart he had ministered without shame and without remorse he was a bad bad egg and now this hardened iniquitor was to meet his maker feebly and hesitatingly his breath fluttered upon his pallid lips weakly trembled the pulse in his flattened veins wife children motherinlaw friends who should have hovered lovingly about his couch cheering his last moments and giving him medicine he had killed with grief or driven widely away and he was now dying alone by the inadequate light of a tallow candle deserted by heaven and by earth no not by heaven suddenly the door was pushed softly open and there entered the good minister whose pious counsel the suffering wretch had in health so often derided solemnly the man of god advanced bible in hand long and silently he stood uncovered in the presence of death then with cold and impressive dignity he remarked miserable old sinner  old jonas lashworthy looked up he sat up the voice of that holy man put strength into his aged limbs and he stood up he was reserved for a better fate than to die like a neglected dog mr lashworthy was hanged for braining a minister of the gospel with a bootjack this touching tale has a moral  moral of this touching talein snatching a brand from the eternal burning make sure of its condition and be careful how you lay hold of it the new church that was not built  i have a friend who was never a church member but was and is a millionairea generous benevolent millionairewho once went about doing good by stealth but with a natural preference for doing it at his office one day he took it into his thoughtful noddle that he would like to assist in the erection of a new church edifice to replace the inadequate and shabby structure in which a certain small congregation in his town then worshipped so he drew up a subscription paper modestly headed the list with christian 2000 dollars and started one of the deacons about with it in a few days the deacon came back to him like the dove to the ark saying he had succeeded in procuring a few names but the press of his private business was such that he had felt compelled to intrust the paper to deacon smith  next day the document was presented to my friend as nearly blank as when it left his hands brother smith explained that he smith had started this thing and a brother calling himself christian whose name he was not at liberty to disclose had put down 2000 dollars would our friend aid them with an equal amount our friend took the paper and wrote philanthropist 1000 dollars and brother smith went away  in about a week brother jones put in an appearance with the subscription paper by extraordinary exertions brother jonesthinking a handsome new church would be an ornament to the town and increase the value of real estatehad got two brethren who desired to remain incog to subscribe christian 2000 dollars and philanthropist 1000 dollars would my friend kindly help along a struggling congregation my friend would he wrote citizen 500 dollars pledging brother jones as he had pledged the others not to reveal his name until it was time to pay  some weeks afterward a clergyman stepped into my friends countingroom and after smilingly introducing himself produced that identical subscription list  mr k said he i hope you will pardon the liberty but i have set on foot a little scheme to erect a new church for our congregation and three of the brethren have subscribed handsomely would you mind doing something to help along the good work  my friend glanced over his spectacles at the proffered paper he rose in his wrath he towered seizing a loaded pen he dashed at that fair sheet and scrabbled thereon in raging characters impenitent sinnernot one cent by g  after a brief explanatory conference the minister thoughtfully went his way that struggling congregation still worships devoutly in its original unpretending temple a tale of the great quake  one glorious morning after the great earthquake of october 21 1868 had with some difficulty shaken me into my trousers and boots i left the house i may as well state that i left it immediately and by an aperture constructed for another purpose arrived in the street i at once betook myself to saving people this i did by remarking closely the occurrence of other shocks giving the alarm and setting an example fit to be followed the example was followed but owing to the vigour with which it was set was seldom overtaken in passing down claystreet i observed an old rickety brick boardinghouse which seemed to be just on the point of honouring the demands of the earthquake upon its resources the last shock had subsided but the building was slowly and composedly settling into the ground as the third story came down to my level i observed in one of the front rooms a young and lovely female in white standing at a door trying to get out she couldnt for the door was lockedi saw her through the keyhole with a single blow of my heel i opened that door and opened my arms at the same time  thank god cried i i have arrived in time come to these arms  the lady in white stopped drew out an eyeglass placed it carefully upon her nose and taking an inventory of me from head to foot replied  no thank you i prefer to come to grief in the regular way  while the pleasing tones of her voice were still ringing in my ears i noticed a puff of smoke rising from near my left toe it came from the chimney of that house johnny  johnny is a little fouryearold of bright pleasant manners and remarkable for intelligence the other evening his mother took him upon her lap and after stroking his curly head awhile asked him if he knew who made him i grieve to state that instead of answering dod as might have been expected johnny commenced cramming his face full of gingerbread and finally took a fit of coughing that threatened the dissolution of his frame having unloaded his throat and whacked him on the back his mother propounded the following supplementary conundrum  johnny are you not aware that at your age every little boy is expected to say something brilliant in reply to my former question how can you so dishonour your parents as to neglect this golden opportunity think again  the little urchin cast his eyes upon the floor and meditated a long time suddenly he raised his face and began to move his lips there is no knowing what he might have said but at that moment his mother noted the pressing necessity of wringing and mopping his nose which she performed with such painful and conscientious singleness of purpose that johnny set up a warwhoop like that of a nightblooming tomcat  it may be objected that this little tale is neither instructive nor amusing i have never seen any stories of bright children that were the childs provider  mr goboffle had a small child no wife a large dog and a house as he was unable to afford the expense of a nurse he was accustomed to leave the child in the care of the dog who was much attached to it while absent at a distant restaurant for his meals taking the precaution to lock them up together to prevent kidnapping one day while at his dinner he crowded a large hardboiled potato down his neck and it conducted him into eternity his clay was taken to the coroners and the great world went on marrying and giving in marriage lying cheating and praying as if he had never existed  meantime the dog had after several days of neglect forced an egress through a window and a neighbouring baker received a call from him daily walking gravely in he would deposit a piece of silver and receiving a roll and his change would march off homeward as this was a rather unusual proceeding in a cur of his species the baker one day followed him and as the dog leaped joyously into the window of the deserted house the man of dough approached and looked in what was his surprise to see the dog deposit his bread calmly upon the floor and fall to tenderly licking the face of a beautiful child  it is but fair to explain that there was nothing but the face remaining but this dog did so love the child boys who began wrong  two little california boys were arrested at reno for horse thieving they had started from surprise valley with a cavalcade of thirty animals and disposed of them leisurely along their line of march until they were picked up at reno as above explained i dont feel quite easy about those youthsaway out there in nevada without their testaments where there are no sunday school books boys are so apt to swear and chew tobacco and rob sluiceboxes and once a boy begins to do that last he might as well sell out hes bound to end by doing something bad i knew a boy once who

gentleman wanted to go to the united states senate a kansas incident  an invalid wife in leavenworth heard her husband make proposals of marriage to the nurse the dying woman arose in bed fixed her large black eyes for a moment upon the face of her heartless spouse with a reproachful intensity that must haunt him through life and then fell back a corpse the remorse of that widower as he led the blushing nurse to the altar the next week can be more easily imagined than described such reparation as was in his power he made he buried the first wife decently and very deep down laying a handsome and exceedingly heavy stone upon the sepulchre he chiselled upon the stone the following simple and touching line she cant get back mr griles girl  in a lecture about girls cady stanton contrasted the buoyant spirit of young males with the dejected sickliness of immature women this she says is because the latter are keenly sensitive to the fact that they have no aim in life this is a sad sad truth no longer ago than last year the writers youngest girlgloriana a skinmilk blonde concern of fourteencame pensively up to her father with big tears in her little eyes and a forgotten morsel of buttered bread lying unchewed in her mouth  papa murmured the poor thing im gettin awful pokey and my clothes dont seem to set well in the back my days are full of ungratified longins and my nights dont get any better papa i think society needs turnin inside out and scrapin i havent got nothin to aspire tono aim nor anything  the desolate creature spilled herself loosely into a canebottom chair and her sorrow broke like a great dyke broken  the writer lifted her tenderly upon his knee and bit her softly on the neck  gloriana said he have you chewed up all that toffy in two days  a smothered sob was her frank confession  now see here glo continued the parent rather sternly dont let me hear any more about aspirationswhich are always adulterated with terra albanor aimswhich will give you the gripes

fifteen minutes cady stanton is impotent of evil in the grile family so long as the price of sweets remains unchanged his railway  the writer remembers as if it were but yesterday when he edited the hang tree herald for six months he devoted his best talent to advocating the construction of a railway between that place and jayhawk thirty miles distant the route presented every inducement there would be no grading required and not a single curve would be necessary as it lay through an uninhabited alkali flat the right of way could be easily obtained as neither terminus had other than packmule communication with civilization the rolling stock and other material must necessarily be constructed at hang tree because the people at the other end didnt know enough to do it and hadnt any blacksmith the benefit to our place was indisputable it constituted the most seductive charm of the scheme after six months of conscientious lying the company was incorporated and the first shovelful of alkali turned up and preserved in a museum when suddenly the devil put it into the head of one of the directors to inquire publicly what the road was designed to carry it is needless to say the question was never satisfactorily answered and the most daring enterprise of the age was knocked perfectly cold that very night a deputation of stockholders waited upon the editor of the herald and prescribed a change of climate they afterward said the change did them good mr gish makes a present  in the season for making presents my friend stockdoddle gish esq thought he would so far waive his

ordinarily solemn village in the cowcounties a worthy matron who had been absent looking after a vagrom cow returned home and pushing against the door found it obstructed by some heavy substance which upon examination proved to be her husband he had been slaughtered by some roving joker who had wrought upon him with a pickhandle to one of his ears was pinned a scrap of greasy paper upon which were

ridiculous part of the story is that the lady did not wait to summon the coroner but took charge of the remains herself and in dragging them toward the bed she exploded into her face a shotgun which had been cunningly contrived to discharge by a string connected with the body thus was she punished for an infraction of the law the next day the particulars were told me by the facetious coroner himself whose jury had just rendered a verdict of accidental drowning in both cases i dont know when i have enjoyed a heartier laugh the optimist and what he died of  one summer evening while strolling with considerable difficulty over russian hill san francisco mr grile espied a man standing upon the extreme summit with a pensive brow and a suit of clothes which seemed to have been handed down through a long line of ancestors from a remote jew peddler mr grile respectfully saluted a man who has any clothes at all is to him an object of veneration the stranger opened the conversation  my son said he in a tone suggestive of strangulation by the sheriff do you behold this wonderful city its wharves crowded with the shipping of all nations  mr grile beheld with amazement  twentyone years agoalas it used to be but twenty and he wiped away a tearyou might have bought the whole dern thing for a mexican ounce  mr grile hastened to proffer a paper of tobacco which disappeared like a wisp of oats drawn into a threshing machine  i was one among the first who  mr grile hit him on the head with a pavingstone by way of changing the topic  young man continued he do you feel this bommy breeze there isnt a climit in the world  this melancholy relic broke down in a fit of coughing no sooner had he recovered than he leaped into the air making a frantic clutch at something but apparently without success  dern it hissed he there goes my teeth blowed out again by hokey  a passing cloud of dust hid him for a moment from view and when he reappeared he was an altered man a paroxysm of asthma had doubled him up like a nutcracker  excuse me he wheezed im subject to this caught it crossin the isthmus in 49 as i was asayin theres no country in the world that offers such inducements to the immygrunt as californy with her fertile soil her unrivalled climit her magnificent bay and the rest of it there is enough for all  this venerable pioneer picked a fragmentary biscuit from the street and devoured it mr grile thought this had gone on about long enough he twisted the head off that hopeful old party surrendered himself to the authorities and was at once discharged the root of education  a pedagogue in indiana who was had up for unmercifully waling the back of a little girl justified his action by explaining that she persisted in flinging paper pellets at him when his back was turned that is no excuse mr grile once taught school up in the mountains and about every half hour had to remove his coat and scrape off the dried paper wads adhering to the nap he never permitted a trifle like this to unsettle his patience he just kept on wearing that gaberdine until it had no nap and the wads wouldnt stick but when they took to dipping them in mucilage he made a complaint to the board of directors  young man said the chairman ef you dont like our ways youd better sling your blankets and git prentice mulford tort skule yer for moren six months and he never said a word agin the wads  mr grile briefly explained that mr mulford might have been brought up to paper wads and didnt mind them  it aint no use said another director the children hev got to be amused  mr grile protested that there were other amusements quite as diverting but the third director here rose and remarked  i perfeckly agree with the cheer this youngster better travel i consider as paper wads lies at the root uv popillar edyercation ther a necessary adjunck uv the skool systim mr cheerman i move and second that this yer skoolmarster be shot  mr grile did not remain to observe the result of the voting retribution  a citizen of pittsburg aged sixty had by tireless industry and the exercise of rigid economy accumulated a hoard of frugal dollars the sight and feel whereof were to his soul a pure delight imagine his sorrow and the heaviness of his aged heart when he learned that the good wife had bestowed thereof upon her brother bountiful largess exceeding his merit sadly and prayerfully while she slept lifted he the retributive mallet and beat in her brittle pate then with the quiet dignity of one who has redressed a grievous wrong surrendered himself unto the law this worthy old man let him who has never known the great grief of slaughtering a wife judge him harshly he that is without sin among you let him cast the first stoneand let it be a large heavy stone that shall grind that wicked old man into a powder of exceeding impalpability the faithful wife  a man was sentenced to twenty years confinement for a deed of violence in the excitement of the moment his wife sought and obtained a divorce thirteen years afterward he was pardoned the wife brought the pardon to the gate the couple left the spot arm in arm and in less than an hour they were again united in the bonds of wedlock  such is the touching tale narrated by a newspaper correspondent it is in every respect true i knew the parties well and during that long bitter period of thirteen years it was commonly asked concerning the woman hasnt that hag trapped anybody yet shell have to take back old jabe when he gets out and she did for nearly thirteen weary years she struggled nobly against fate she went after every unmarried man in her part of the country but no said they we cannotindeed we cannotmarry you after the way you went back on jabe it is likely that under the same circumstances you would play us the same scurvy trick gway woman and so the poor old heartbroken creature had to go to the governor and get the old man pardoned out bless her for her steadfast fidelity margaret the childless  this therefore is the story of hersome four years ago her husband brought home a baby which he said he found lying in the street and which they concluded to adopt about a year after this he brought home another and the good woman thought she could stand that one too a similar period passed away when one evening he opened the door and fell headlong into the room swearing with studied correctness at a dog which had tripped him up but which upon inspection turned out to be another baby margarets sus picion was aroused but to allay his she hastened to implore him to adopt that darling also to which after some slight hesitation he consented another twelvemonth rolled into eternity when one evening the lady heard a noise in the back yard and going out she saw her husband labouring at the windlass of the well with unwonted industry as the bucket neared the top he reached down and extracted another infant exactly like the former ones and holding it up explained to the astonished matron look at this now did you ever see such a sweet young one go acampaignin about the country without a lantern and atumblin into wells there take the poor little thing in to the fire and get off its wet clothes it suddenly flashed across his mind that he had neglected an obvious precautionthe clothes were not wetand he hastily added theres no tellin what would have become of it aclimbin down that rope if i hadnt seen it afore it got down to the water  silently the good wife took that infant into the house and disrobed it sorrowfully she laid it alongside its little brothers and sister long and bitterly she wept over the quartette and then with one tender look at her lord and master smoking in solemn silence by the fire and resembling them with all his might she gathered her shawl about her bowed shoulders and went away into the night the discomfited demon  i never clearly knew why i visited the old cemetery that night perhaps it was to see how the work of removing the bodies was getting on for they were all being taken up and carted away to a more comfortable place where land was less valuable it was well enough nobody had buried himself there for years and the skeletons that were now exposed were old mouldy affairs for which it was difficult to feel any respect however i put a few bones in my pocket as souvenirs the night was one of those black gusty ones in march with great inky clouds driving rapidly across the sky spilling down sudden showers of rain which as suddenly would cease i could barely see my way between the empty graves and in blundering about among the coffins i tripped and fell headlong a peculiar laugh at my side caused me to turn my head and i saw a singular old gentleman whom i had often noticed hanging about the coroners office sitting crosslegged upon a prostrate tombstone  how are you sir said i rising awkwardly to my feet nice night  get off my tail answered the elderly party without moving a muscle  my eccentric friend rejoined i mockingly may i be permitted to inquire your street and number  certainly he replied no 1 marle place asphalt avenue hades  the devil sneered i  exactly said he oblige me by getting off my tail  i was a little staggered and by way of rallying my somewhat dazed faculties offered a cigar smoke  thank you said the singular old gentleman putting it under his coat after dinner drink  i was not exactly prepared for this but did not know if it would be safe to decline and so putting the proffered flask to my lips pretended to swig elaborately keeping my mouth tightly closed the while good article said i returning it he simply remarked youre a fool and emptied the bottle at a gulp  and now resumed he you will confer a favour i shall highly appreciate by removing your feet from my tail  there was a slight shock of earthquake and all the skeletons in sight arose to their feet stretched themselves and yawned audibly without moving from his seat the old gentleman rapped the nearest one across the skull with his goldheaded cane and they all curled away to sleep again  sire i resumed indulge me in the impertinence of inquiring your business here at this hour  my business is none of yours retorted he calmly what are you up to yourself  i have been picking up some bones i replied carelessly  then you are  i am  a ghoul  my good friend you do me injustice you have doubtless read very frequently in the newspapers of the fiend in human shape whose actions and way of life are so generally denounced sire you see before you that maligned party  there was a quick jerk under the soles of my feet which pitched me prone upon the ground scrambling up i saw the old gentleman vanishing behind an adjacent sandhill as if the devil were after him the mistake of a life  the hotel was in flames mr pokeweed was promptly on hand and tore madly into the burning pile whence he soon emerged with a nude female depositing her tenderly upon a pile of hot bricks he mopped his steaming front with his warm coattail  now mrs pokeweed said he where will i be most likely to find the children they will naturally wish to get out  the lady assumed a stiffly vertical attitude and with freezing dignity replied in the words following  sir you have saved my life i presume you are entitled to my thanks if you are likewise solicitous regarding the fate of the person you have mentioned you had better go back and prospect round till you find her she would probably be delighted to see you but while i have a character to maintain unsullied you shall not stand there and call me mrs pokeweed  just then the front wall toppled outward and pokeweed cleared the street at a single bound he never learned what became of the strange lady and to the day of his death he professed an indifference that was simply brutal l s  early one evening in the autumn of 64 a pale girl stood singing methodist hymns at the summit of bush street hill she was attired spanish fashion in a loose overcoat and slippers suddenly she broke off her song a darkbrowed young soldier from the presidio cautiously approached and seizing her fondly in his arms snatched away the overcoat retreating with it to an auctionhouse on pacific street where it may still be seen by the benighted traveller just agoing for twoandhalfand never gone  the poor maiden after this misfortune felt a bitter resentment swelling in her heart and scorning to remain among her kind in that costume took her way to the cliff house where she arrived worn and weary about breakfasttime  the landlord received her kindly and offered her a pair of his best trousers but she was of noble blood and having been reared in luxury respectfully declined to receive charity from a lowborn stranger all efforts to induce her to eat were equally unavailing she would stand for hours on the rocks where the road descends to the beach and gaze at the playful seals in the surf below who seemed rather flattered by her attention and would swim about singing their sweetest songs to her alone passersby were equally curious as to her but a broken lyre gives forth no music and her heart responded not with any more long metre hymns  after a few weeks of this solitary life she was suddenly missed at the same time a strange seal was noted among the rest she was remarkable for being always clad in an overcoat which she had doubtless fished up from the wreck of the french galleon brignardello which went ashore there some years afterward  one tempestuous night an old hag who had long done business as a hermitess on helmet rock came into the barroom at the cliff house and there amidst the crushing thunders and lightnings spilling all over the horizon she related that she had seen a young seal in a comfortable overcoat sitting pensively upon the pinnacle of seal rock and had distinctly heard the familiar words of a methodist hymn upon inquiry the tale was discovered to be founded upon fact the identity of this seal could no longer be denied without downright blasphemy and in all the old chronicles of that period not a doubt is even implied  one day a handsome dark young lieutenant of infantry don edmundo by name came out to the cliff house to celebrate his recent promotion while standing upon the verge of the cliff with his friends all about him lady celia as visitors had christened her came swimming below him and taking off her overcoat laid it upon a rock she then turned up her eyes and sang a methodist hymn  no sooner did the brave don edmundo hear it than he tore off his gorgeous clothes and cast himself headlong in the billows lady celia caught him dexterously by the waist in her mouth and swimming to the outer rock sat up and softly bit him in halves she then laid the pieces tenderly in a conspicuous place put on her overcoat and plunging into the waters was never seen more  many are the wild fabrications of the poets about her subsequent career but to this day nothing authentic has turned up for some months strenuous efforts were made to recover the wicked lieutenants body every appliance which genius could invent and skill could wield was put in requisition until one night the landlord fearing these constant efforts might frighten away the seals had the remains quietly removed and secretly interred the baffled asian  one day in 49 an honest miner up in calaveras county california bit himself with a small snake of the garter variety and either as a possible antidote or with a determination to enjoy the brief remnant of a wasted life applied a brimming jug of whisky to his lips and kept it there until like a repleted leech it fell off  the man fell off likewise  the next day while the body lay in state upon a pine slab and the bereaved partner of the deceased was unbending in a game of sevenup with a friendly chinaman the game was interrupted by a familiar voice which seemed to proceed from the jaws of the corpse i say jim  bereaved partner played the king of spades claimed high and then looking over his shoulder at the melancholy remains replied well what is it dave im busy  i sayjim repeated the corpse in the same measured tone  with a look of intense annoyance and muttering something about people that could never stop dead moren a minute the bereaved partner rose and stood over the body with his cards in his hand  jim continued the mighty dead how furs this thing gone  ive paid the chinaman twoandahalf to dig the grave responded the bereaved  did he strike anything  the chinaman looked up me strikee

dollars a gallon dern all foreigners anyhow  and the mortal part pulled on its boots tall talk a call to dinner  when the starving peasantry of france were bearing with inimitable fortitude their great bereavement in the death of louis le grand how cheerfully must they have bowed their necks to the easy yoke of philip of orleans who set them an example in eating which he had not the slightest objection to their following a monarch skilled in the mysteries of the cuisine must wield the sceptre all the more gently from his schooling in handling the ladle in royalty the delicate manipulation of an omelette soufflé is at once an evidence of genius and an assurance of a tender forbearance in state policy all good rulers have been good livers and if all bad ones have been the same this merely proves that even the worst of men have still something divine in them  there is more in a good dinner than is disclosed by the removal of the covers where the eye of hunger perceives but a juicy roast the eye of faith detects a smoking god a wellcooked joint is redolent of religion and a delicate pasty is crisp with charity the man who can light his afterdinner havana without feeling full to the neck with all the cardinal virtues is either steeped in iniquity or has dined badly in either case he is no true man we stoutly contend that that worthy personage epicurus has been shamefully misrepresented by abstemious and hence envious and mendacious historians either his philosophy was the most gentle genial and reverential of antique systems or he was not an epicurean and to call him so is a deceitful flattery we hold that it is morally impossible for a man to dine daily upon the fat of the land in courses and yet deny a future state of existence beatific with beef and ecstatic with all edibles another falsity of history is that of heliogabaluswas it notdining off nightingales tongues no true gourmet would ever send this warbler to the shambles so long as scarcer birds might be obtained  it is a fine natural instinct that teaches the hungry and cadaverous to avoid the temples of religion and a shortsighted and misdirected zeal that would gather them into the sanctuary religion is for the oleaginous the fatbellied chylesaturated devotees of the table unless the stomach be lined with good things the parson may say as many as he likes and his truths shall not be swallowed nor his wisdom inly digested probably the highest ripest and most acceptable form of worship is that performed with a knife and fork and whosoever on the resurrection morning can produce from amongst the lumber of his castoff flesh a thincoated and elastic stomach showing evidences of daily stretchings done in the body will find it his readiest passport and best credential we believe that god will not hold him guiltless who eats with his knife but if the deadly steel be always well laden with toothsome morsels divine justice will be tempered with mercy to that mans soul when the author of the lost tales represented sisyphus as capturing his guest the king of terrors and stuffing the old glutton with meat and drink until he became a jolly rubicund tunbellied death he gave us a tale which needs no hæc fabula docet to point out the moral  we verily believe that shakspeare writ down fat jack at his last gasp as babbling not o green fields but o green turtle and that that starvling colley cibber altered the text from sheer envy at a good mans death to die well we must live well is a familiar platitude morality is of course best promoted by the good quality of our fare but quantitative excellence is by no means to be despised cæteris paribus the man who eats much is a better christian than the man who eats little and he who eats little will pursue a more uninterrupted course of benevolence than he who eats nothing on death and immortality  did it ever strike you dear reader that it must be a particularly pleasant thing to be dead to say nothing hackneyed about the blessed freedom from the cares and vexations of lifewhich we cling to with such tenacity while we can and which when we have no longer the power to hold we let go all at once with probably a feeling of exquisite reliefand to take no account of this latter probable but totally undemonstrable felicity it must be what boys call awfully jolly to be dead  here you are lying comfortably upon your backwhat is left of itin the cool dark and with the smell of the fresh earth all about you your soul goes knocking about amongst an infinity of shadowy things lord knows where making all sorts of silent discoveries in the gloom of what was yesterday an unknown and mysterious future and which after centuries of exploration must still be strangely unfamiliar the nomadic thing doubtless comes back occasionally to the old graveif the body is so fortunate as to possess oneand looks down upon it with big round eyes and a lingering tenderness  it is hard to conceive a soul entirely cut loose from the old bones and roving rudderless about eternity it was probably this inability to mentally divorce soul from substance that gave us that absurdly satisfactory belief in the resurrection of the flesh there is said to be a race of people somewhere in africa who believe in the immortality of the body but deny the resurrection of the soul the dead will rise refreshed after their long sleep and in their anxiety to test their rejuvenated powers will skip bodily away and forget their souls upon returning to look for them they will find nothing but little blue flames which can never be extinguished but may be carried about and used for cooking purposes this belief probably originates in some dim perception of the law of compensation in this life the body is the drudge of the spirit in the next the situation is reversed  the heaven of the mussulman is not incompatible with this kind of immortality its delights being merely carnal ones could be as well or better enjoyed without a soul and the latter might be booked for the christian heaven with only just enough of the body to attach a pair of wings to mr solyman muley abdul ben gazel could thus enjoy a dual immortality and secure a double portion of eternal felicity at no expense to anybody  in fact there can be no doubt whatever that this theory of a double heaven is the true one and needs but to be fairly stated to be universally received inasmuch as it supposes the maximum of felicity for terrestrial good behaviour it is therefore a sensible theory resting upon quite as solid a foundation of fact as any other theory and must commend itself at once to the proverbial good sense of christians everywhere the trouble is that some architectural scoundrel of a priest is likely to build a religion upon it and what the world needs is theorygood solid nourishing theory musicmuscular and mechanical  one cheerful evidence of the decivilization of the anglosaxon race is the late tendency to return to first principles in art as manifested in substituting noise for music herein we detect symptoms of a rapid relapse into original barbarism the savage who beats his gong or kettledrum until his face is of a delicate blue and his eyes assert themselves like those of an unterrified snail believes that musical skill is a mere question of brawna matter of muscle if not wholly ignorant of technical gymnastics he has a theory that a deftness at dumbbells is a prime requisite in a finished artist the advancein a circleof civilization has only partially unsettled this belief in the human mind and we are constantly though unconsciously reverting to it  it is true the modern demand for a great deal of music has outstripped the supply of muscle for its production but the ingenuity of man has partially made up for his lack of physical strength and the sublimer harmonies may still be rendered with tolerable effectiveness and with little actual fatigue to the artist as we retrograde towards the condition of primeval manthe man with the gong and kettledrumthe blacksmith slowly reasserts his place as the interpreter of the maestro  but there is a limit beyond which muscle whether that of the arm or cheek can no further go without too great an expenditure of force in proportion to the volume of noise attainable and right here the splendid triumphs of modern invention and discovery are made manifest electricity and gunpowder come to the relief of puny muscle simple appliance and orchestras limited by sparse population batteries of artillery thunder exultingly our victory over primeval man beaten at his own gamesignally routed and put to shame pounding his impotent gong and punishing his ridiculous kettledrum in frantic silence amidst the clash and clang and roar of modern art the good young man  why is he why defaces he the fair page of creation and why is he to be continued this has never been explained it is one of those dispensations of providence the design whereof is wrapped in profoundest obscurity the good young man is perhaps not without excuse for his existence but society is without excuse for permitting it at his time of life to be good is to insult humanity goodness is proper to the aged it is their sole glory why should this milky stripling bring it into disrepute why should he be permitted to defile with the fat of his sleek locks a crown intended to adorn the grizzled pow of his elders  a young man may be manly gentle honourable noble tender and true and nobody will ever think of calling him a good young man your good young man is commonly a sneak and is very nearly allied to that other social pest the nice young lady as applied to the immature male of our kind the adjective good seems to have been perverted from its original and ordinary signification and to have acquired a dyslogistic one it is a term of reproach and means as nearly as may be characterless that any one should submit to have it applied to him is proof of the essential cowardice of virtue  we believe the direst ill afflicting civilization is the good young man the next direst is his natural and appointed mate the nice young lady if the two might be tied neck and heels together and flung into the sea the land would be the fatter for it the average parson  our objection to him is not that he is senseless thisas it concerns us notwe can patiently endure nor that he is bigoted this we expect and have become accustomed to nor that he is smallsouled narrow and hypocritical all these qualities become him well sitting easily and gracefully upon him we protest against him because he is always carrying on  to carry on in one way or another seems to be the function of his existence and essential to his health when he is not doing it in the pulpit he is at it in the newspapers when both fail him he resorts to the social circle the church meeting the sundayschool or even the street corner we have known him to disport for half a day upon the kerbstone carrying on with all his might to whomsoever would endure it  no sooner does a young sickfaced theologue get safely through his ordination as a baby finishes teething than straightway he casts about him for an opportunity to carry on a pretext is soon found and he goes at it hammer and tongs and forty years after you shall find him at the same trick with as simple a faith as exalted an expectation as vigorous an impotence as the day he began  his carryingson are as diverse in kind as comprehensive in scope as those of the most versatile negro minstrel he cuts as many capers in a lifetime as there are stars in heaven or grains of sand in a barrel of sugar everything is fish that comes to his net if a discovery in science is announced he will execute you an antic upon it before it gets fairly cold is a new theory advancedten to one while you are trying to get it through your head he will stand on his own and make mouths at it a great invention provokes him into a whirlwind of flipflaps absolutely bewildering to the secular eye while at any exceptional phenomenon of nature such as an earthquake he will project himself froglike into an infinity of lofty gymnastic absurdities  in short the slightest agitation of the intellectual atmosphere sets your average parson into a tempest of pumping like the jointed ligneous youth attached to the eccentric of a boys whirligig his philosophy of life may be boiled down into a single sentence carry on and you will be happy did we eat one another  there is no doubt of it the unwelcome truth has long been suppressed by interested parties who find their account in playing sycophant to that selfsatisfied tyrant modern man but to the impartial philosopher it is as plain as the nose upon an elephants face that our ancestors ate one another the custom of the fiji islanders which is their only stockintrade their only claim to notoriety is a relic of barbarism but it is a relic of our barbarism  man is naturally a carnivorous animal this none but greengrocers will dispute that he was formerly less vegetarian in his diet than at present is clear from the fact that marketgardening increases in the ratio of civilization so we may safely assume that at some remote period man subsisted upon an exclusively flesh diet our uniform vanity has given us the human mind as the ne plus ultra of intelligence the human face and figure as the standard of beauty of course we cannot deny to human fat and lean an equal superiority over beef mutton and pork it is plain that our meateating ancestors would think in this way and being unrestrained by the mawkish sentiment attendant upon high civilization would act habitually upon the obvious suggestion a priori therefore it is clear that we ate ourselves  philology is about the only thread which connects us with the prehistoric past by picking up and piecing out the scattered remnants of language we form a patchwork of wondrous design oblige us by considering the derivation of the word sarcophagus and see if it be not suggestive of potted meats observe the significance of the phrase sweet sixteen what a world of meaning lurks in the expression she is sweet as a peach and how suggestive of luncheon are the words tender youth a kiss itself is but a modified bite and when a young girl insists upon making a strawberry mark upon the back of your hand she only gives way to an instinct she has not yet learned to control the fond mother when she says her babe is almost good enough to eat merely shows that she herself is only a trifle too good to eat it  these evidences might be multiplied ad infinitum but if enough has been said to induce one human being to revert to the diet of his ancestors the object of this essay is accomplished your friends friend  if there is any individual who combines within himself the vices of an entire species it is he a motherinlaw has usually been thought a rather satisfactory specimen of total depravity it has been customary to regard your sweethearts brother as tolerably vicious for a young man there is excellent authority for looking upon your business partner as not wholly without merit as a nuisancebut your friends friend is as far ahead of these in all that constitutes a healthy disagreeableness as they themselves are in advance of the average reptile or the conventional pestilence  we do not propose to illustrate the great truth we have in hand by instances the experience of the reader will furnish ample evidence in support of our proposition and any narration of pertinent facts could only quicken into life the dead ghosts of a thousand sheeted annoyances to squeak and gibber through a memory studded thick with the tombstones of happy hours murdered by your friends friend  also the animal is too well known to need a description imagine a thing in all essential particulars the exact reverse of a desirable acquaintance and you have his

ridicule that has been expended upon this thing is appalling and yet we are compelled to confess that to all appearance the cause has been thereby shorn of no material strength nor bled of its vitality and shall it be admitted that this potent argument of little minds is as powerless as the dullards of all ages have steadfastly maintained forbid it heaven the gimlet is as proper a gimlet as any in all christendom but the timber is too hard to pierce grant ye that the movement is waxing more wondrous with each springing sun who shall say what it might not have been but for the sharp

vitals of a whale with a bodkinwho may reach his jackknife through the superposed bubber pachyderm thy name is woman all the kings horses and all the kings men shall not bend the bow that can despatch a clothyard shaft through thy pearly hide the male and female women who nightly howl their social and political grievances into the wide ear of the universe are as insensible to the prickings of ridicule as they are unconscious of logic an intellectual goliah of gath might spear them with an epigram like unto a weavers beam and the sting thereof would be as but the nipping of a red ant apollo

through society like a tipsy rhinoceros among the tulip beds and all the torrent of brickbats rained upon her skin is shed as globules of mercury might be supposed to run off the back of a dry drake  one of the rarest amusements in life is to go about with an icicle suspended by a string letting it down the necks of the unwary the sudden shrug the quick frightened shudder the yelp of apprehension are sources of a pure because diabolical delight but these womenyou may practise your chilling joke upon one of them and she will calmly wonder where you got your ice and will pen with deliberate fingers an ungrammatical resolution denouncing congelation as tyrannical and obsolete  we despair of ever dispelling these creatures by pungent pleasantriesof routing them by sharp censure they are apparently to go on practically unmolested to the end meantime we are cast down with a mighty proneness along the dust our shapely anatomy is clothed in a jaunty suit of sackcloth liberally embellished with the frippery of ashes our days are vocal with wailing our nights melodious with snuffle  brethren let us pray that the political sceptre may not pass from us into the jewelled hands which were intended by nature for the clouting of babes and sucklings angels and angles  when abandoned to her own devices the average female has a tendency to put on her things and to contrive the same in a manner that is not conducive to patience in the male beholder her besetting iniquity in this particular is a fondness for angles and she is unwavering in her determination to achieve them at whatever cost  now we vehemently affirm that in womans apparel an angle is an offence to the male eye and therefore a crime of no small magnitude in the masculine garb angles are tolerableangles of whatever acuteness the masculine character and life are rigid and angular and the apparel should or at least may proclaim the man but with the soft rounded nature of woman her bending flexibility of temper angles are absolutely incompatible in her outward seeming all should be easy and flowingevery fold a nest of graces and every line a curve  by close attention to this great truth and a conscientious striving after its advantages woman may hope to become rather comely of exterior and to find considerable favour in the eyes of man it is not impossible that without any abatement of her present usefulness she may come to be regarded as actually ornamental and even attractive if with her angles she will also renounce some hundreds of other equally harassing absurdities of attire she may consider her position assured and her claim to masculine toleration reasonably well grounded a wingless insect  it would be profitable in the end if man would take a hint from his lack of wings and settle down comfortably into the assurance that midair is not his appointed element the confession is a humiliating one but there is a temperate balm in the consciousness that his inability to shave with level wing the blue empyrean cannot justly be charged upon himself he has done his endeavour and done it nobly but hell break his precious neck  in goldsmiths veracious history of animated nature is a sprightly account of one nicolas who was called if our memory be not at fault the manfish and who was endowed by his creatorthe late mr goldsmith aforesaidwith the power of conducting an active existence under the sea that equally veracious and instructive work the arabian nights entertainments peoples the bottom of old ocean with powerful nations of similarly gifted persons while in our own day the manfrog has taught us what may be done in this line when one has once got the knack of it  some years since we do not know if he has yet suffered martyrdom at the hand of the fiendish white there lived a noted indian chieftain whose name being translated signifies the manwhowalksundertheground probably a lineal descendant of the gnomes we have ourselves walked under the ground in wine cellars  with these notable examples in mind we are not prepared to assert that though man has as a rule neither the gills of a fish nor the nose of a mole he may not enjoy a drive at the bottom of the sea or a morning ramble under the subsoil but with the exception of peter wilkins flying islanderswhose existence we vehemently disputeand some similar creatures whom it suits our purpose to ignore there is no record of any person to whom the name of themanwhofliesoverthehills may be justly applied we make no account of the shallow device of mongolfier nor the dubious contrivance of marriott a gentleman of proper aspirations would scorn to employ either as the manfrog would reject a divingbell or the subterranean chieftain would sneer at the mont cenis tunnel these weak inventions only emphasize our impotence to strive with the subtle element about and above they prove nothing so conclusively as that we cant flya fact still more strikingly proven by the constant thud of people tumbling out of them to a titan of comprehensive ear who could catch the noises of a world upon his single tympanum as hector caught argive javelins upon his shield the patter of dropping aëronauts would sound like the gentle pelting of hailstones upon a dusty highwayso thick and fast they fall  it is probable that man is no more eager to float free into space than the earthif it be sentientis to shake him off but it would appear that he and it must like the siamese twins consent to endure the disadvantages of a mutually disagreeable intimacy we submit that it is hardly worth his while to continue larding the lean earth with his carcase in the vain endeavour to emulate angels whom in no respect he at all resembles pork on the hoof  the motto aut cæsar aut nullus is principally nonsense we take it if one may not be a man one may in most cases be a hog with equal satisfaction to his mind and heart  there is thompson washington smith for example his name is not thompson nor washington nor yet smith we call him so to conceal his real name which is perhaps smythe now thompson there is reason to believe tried earnestly for some years to be a man alas he began while he was a boy and got exhausted before he arrived at maturity he could make no further effort and manhood is not acquired without a mighty struggle nor maintained without untiring industry so having fatigued himself before reaching the startingpoint thompson washington did not reenter the race for manhood but contented his simple soul with achieving a modest swinehood he became a hog of considerable talent and promise  let it not be supposed that thompson has anything in common with the typical ideal hoghim who encrusts his hide with clay and inhumes his muzzle in garbage far from it he is a cleanlyalmost a godlyhog preternaturally fair of exterior and eke fastidious of appetite he is glossy of coat stainless of shirt immaculate of trousers he is shiny of beaver and refulgent of boot with all a hog watch him ten minutes under any circumstances and his face shall seem to lengthen and sharpen away split at the point and develop an unmistakeable snout a ridge of bristles will struggle for sunlight under the gloss of his coat this is your imagination and that is about as far as it will take you so long as thompson washington actual maintains a vertical attitude thompson washington unreal will not assume an horizontal one your fancy cannot go the whole hog  it only remains to state explicitly to whom we are alluding well there is a stye in the soul of every one of us in which abides a porker more or less objectionable we dont all let him range at large like smith but he will occasionally exalt his visage above the rails of even the most cleverly constructed pen the best of us are they who spend most time repressing the beast by rapping him upon the nose the young person  we are prepared not perhaps to prove but to maintain that civilization would be materially aided and abetted by the offer of a liberal reward for the scalps of young persons with the ears attached your regular young person is a living nuisance whose every act is a provocation to exterminate her we say her not because physically considered the y p is necesarily of the she sex more commonly is it an irreclaimable male but morally and intellectually it is an unmixed female her virtues are merely milkandmoralityher intelligence is pure spiritual whey her conversation to which not even her own virtues and intelligence are in any way related is three parts rainwater that has stood too long and one part cider that has not stood long enougha sickening sweetish compound one dose of which induces in the mental stomach a colicky qualm followed if no correctives be taken by violent retching coma and death  the young person vegetates best in the atmosphere of parlours and ballrooms if she infested the fields and roadsides like the squirrels lizards and mudhens she would be as ruthlessly exterminated as they every passing sportsman would fill her with duckshot and every strolling gentleman would step out of his way to smite off her head with his cane as one decapitates a thistle but in the drawingroom one lays off his destructiveness with his hat and gloves and the young person enjoys the same immunity that a sleepy mastiff grants to the worthless kitten campaigning against his nose  but there is no good reason why the spider should be destroyed and the young person tolerated a certain popular fallacy  the world makes few graver mistakes than in supposing a man must necessarily possess all the cardinal virtues because he has a big dog and some dirty children  we know a butcher whose children are not merely dirtythey are fearfully and wonderfully besmirched by the hand of an artist he has in addition a big dog with a tendency to dropsy who flies at you across the street with such celerity that he outruns his bark by a full second and you are warned of your danger only after his teeth are buried in your leg and yet the owner of these children and father of this dog is no whit better to all appearance than a baker who has clean brats and a mild poodle he is not even a good butcher he hacks a rib and lacerates a sirloin he talks through his nose which turns up to such an extent that the voice passes right over your head and you have to get on a table to tell whether he is slandering his dead wife or swearing at yourself  if that man possessed a thousand young ones exaltedly nasty and dogs enough to make a subatlantic cable of german sausage you would find it difficult to make us believe in him in fact we look upon the big dog test of morality as a venerable mistakenatural but erroneous and we regard dirty children as indispensable in no other sense than that they are inevitable pastoral journalism  there shall be joy in the household of the country editor what time the rural mind shall no longer crave the unhealthy stimuli afforded by fascinating accounts of corpulent beets bloated pumpkins dropsical melons aspiring maize and precocious cabbages then the bucolic journalist shall have surcease of toil and may go out upon the meads to frisk with kindred lambs frolic familiarly with loosejointed colts and exchange grave gambollings with solemn cows then shall the voice of the press no longer attuned to the praises of the vegetable kingdom find a more humble but not less useful employment in calling the animal kingdom to the evening meal beneath the sanctum window  to the overworked editor life will have a fresh zest and a new significance the hills shall hump more greenly upward to a bluer sky the fields blush with a more tender sunshine he will go forth at dawn with countless flipflaps of gymnastic joy and when the white sun shall redden with the blood of dying day and the hogs shall set up a fine evening hymn of supplication to the giver of swill he will stand upon the editorial head blissfully conscious that his intellect is aripening for the morrows work  the rural newspaper we sit with it in hand running our fingers over the big staring letters as over the black and white keys of a piano drumming out of them a mild melody of perfect repose with what delight do we disport us in the illimitable void of its nothingness as who should swim in air here is nothing to startlenothing to wound the very atmosphere is saturated with the spirit of the rural press and even our dog stands by with pendant tail slowly dropping the lids over his great eyes and then jerking them suddenly up again tries to look as if he were not sleepy in the least a pleasant smell of ploughed ground comes strong upon us the tinkle of ghostly cowbells falls drowsily upon the ear airy figures of phenomenal esculents float dreamily before our halfshut eyes and vanish ere perfect vision can catch them about and above are the drone of bees and the muffled thunder of milk streams shooting into the foaming pail the gabble of distant geese is faintly marked off by the bark of a distant dog the city with its noises sinks away from our feet as from one in a balloon and our senses are steeped in country languor we slumber  god bless the man who first invented the country newspaperthough sancho panza blessed him once before mendicitys mistake  your famishing beggar is a fish of as sorry aspect as may readily be scared up generally speaking he is repulsive as to hat abhorrent as to vesture squalid of boot and in tout ensemble unseemly and atrocious his appeal for alms falls not more vexingly upon the ear than his offensive personality smites hard upon the eye the touching effectiveness of his tale is ever neutralized by the uncomeliness of his raiment and the inartistic besmirchedness of his countenance his pleading is like the pathos of some moving ballad from the lips of a negro minstrel shut your eyes and it shall make you fumble in your pocket for your handkerchief open them and you would fain draw out a pistol instead  it is to be wished that poverty would garb his body in a clean skin that adversity would cultivate a taste for spotless linen and that beggary would address himself unto your pocket from beneath a downy hat however we cannot hope to immediately impress these worthy mendicants with the advantage of devoting a portion of their gains to the purchase of purple and fine linen instead of expending their all upon the pleasures of the table and riotous living but our duty unto them remains  the very least that one can do for the offensive needy is to direct them to the nearest clothier that therefore is the proper course insects  every one has observed a solitary ant breasting a current of his fellows as he retraces his steps to pack off something he has forgotten at each meeting with a neighbour there is a mutual pause and the two confront each other for a moment reaching out their delicate antennæ and making a critical examination of one anothers person this the little creature repeats with tireless persistence to the end of his journey  as with the ant so with the other insectthe sprightly female of our species it is really delightful to watch the fine frenzy of her lovely eye as she notes the approach of a woman more gorgeously arrayed than herself or the triumphant contempt that settles about her lips at the advance of a poorly clad sister how contemplatively she lingers upon each detail of attirewith what keen penetration she takes in the general effect at a sweep  and this suggests the fearful thoughtwhat would the darlings do if they wore no clothes onehalf their pleasure in walking on the street would vanish like a dream and an equal proportion of the philosophers happiness in watching them would perish in the barren prospect of an inartistic nudity picnicking considered as a mistake  why do people attend public picnics we do not wish to be iterative but why do they heaven help them it is because they know no better and no one has had the leisure to enlighten them  now your picnicgoer is a muffan egregious gregarious muff and a glutton moreover a nobody who if he be male wears in nine cases in ten a red necktie and a linen duster to his heel if she be female hath soiled hose to her calf and in her face a premonition of colic to come  we hold it morally impossible to attend a picnic and come home pure in heart and undefiled of cuticle for the dust will get in your nose clog your ears make clay in your mouth and mortar in your eyes and so stop up all the natural passages to the soul whereby the wickedness which that subtle organ doth constantly excrete is balked of its issue tainting the entire system with a grievous taint  at picnics moreover is engendered an unpleasant perspiration which the patient must perforce endure until he shall bathe him in a bath it is not sweet to reek and your picnicker must reek should he chance to break a leg or she a limb the inevitable exposure of the pedal condition is alarming and eke humiliating thanksgiving day  there be those of us whose memories though vexed with an oysterrake would not yield matter for gratitude and whose piety though strained through a sieve would leave no trace of an object upon which to lavish thanks it is easy enough with a waistcoat selected for the occasion to eat ones proportion of turkey and hide away ones allowance of wine and if this be returning thanks why then gratitude is considerably easier and vastly more agreeable than falling off a log and may be acquired in one easy lesson without a master but if more than this be requiredif to be grateful means anything beyond being gluttonous your true philosopherhe of the severe brow upon which logic has stamped its eternal impress and from whose heart sentiment has been banished along with other small vicesyour true philosopher say we will think twice before he crooks the pregnant hinges of the knee in humble observance of the day  for here is the nut of reason he is obliged to crack before he can obtain the kernel of emotion proper to the day unless the blessings we enjoy are favours from the omnipotent to be grateful is to be absurd if they are then also the ills with which we are afflicted have the same origin grant this and you make an offset of the latter against the former or are driven either to the ridiculous position that we must be equally grateful for both evils and blessings or the no less ridiculous one that all evils are blessings in disguise  but the truth is my fine friend your annual gratitude is a sorry sham a cloak my good fellow to cover your unhandsome gluttony and when by chance you do take to your knees it is only that you prefer to digest your bird in that position we understand your case accurately and the hard sense we are poking at you is not a preachment for your edification but a bit of harmless fun for our own diversion for look you there is really a subtle but potent relation between the gratitude of the spirit and the stuffing of the flesh  we have ever taught the identity of soul and stomach these are but different names for one object considered under differing aspects thankfulness we believe to be a kind of ether evolved by the action of the gastric fluid upon rich meats like all gases it ascends and so passes out of the esophagus in prayer and psalmody this beautiful theory we have tested by convincing experiments in the manner following  experiment 1sta quantity of grass was placed in a large bladder and a gill of the gastric fluid of a sheep introduced in ten minutes the neck of the bladder emitted a contented bleat  experiment 2nda pound of beef was substituted for the grass and the fluid of a dog for that of the sheep the result was a cheerful bark accompanied by an agitation of the bottom of the bladder as if it were attempting to wag an imaginary tail  experiment 3rdthe bladder was charged with a handful of chopped turkey and an ounce of human gastric juice obtained from the coroner at first nothing but a deep sigh of satisfaction escaped from the neck of the bladder followed by an unmistakeable grunt similar to that of a hog upon increasing the proportion of turkey and confining the gas the bladder was very much distended appearing to suffer great uneasiness the restriction being removed the neck distinctly articulated the words praise god from whom all blessings flow  against such demonstration as this any mere theological theorizing is of no avail flogging  it may justly be demanded of the essayist that he shall give some small thought to the question of corporal punishment by means of the cat and groundash we have given the subject the most elaborate attention we have written page after page upon it day and night we have toiled and perspired over that distressing problem through summers sun and winters snow with all unfaltering purpose we have strung miles of ink upon acres of paper weaving wisdom into eloquence with the tireless industry of a silkworm fashioning his cocoon we have refused food scorned sleep and endured thirst to see our work grow beneath our cunning hand the more we wrote the wiser we became the opinions of one day were rejected the next the blind surmising of yesterday ripened into the full knowledge of today and this matured into the superhuman omniscience of this evening we have finally got so infernally clever that we have abandoned the original design of our great work and determined to make it a compendium of everything that is accurately known up to date and the bearing of this upon flogging in general  to other and inferior writers it is most fortunate that our design has taken so wide a scope these can go on with their perennial wrangle over the petty question of penal and educational flagellation while we grapple with the higher problem and unfold the broader philosophy of an universal walloping reflections upon the beneficent influence of the press  reflection 1the beneficent influence of the press is most talked about by the press  reflection 2if the press were less evenly divided upon all social political and moral questions the influence of its beneficence would be greater than it is  reflection 3the beneficence of its influence would be more marked  reflection 4if the press were more wise and righteous than it is it might escape the reproach of being more foolish and wicked than it should be  reflection 5the foregoing reflection is not an identical proposition  reflection 6a the beneficent influence of the press cannot be purchased for money b it

host saying that as he should not return until after bedtime he would not trouble him to sit up to let him in he would just leave the door open till he came home by way of doing so he set up a stout fencerail between his landlords distended jaws and went away  returning about midnight he took off his boots outside so as not to awaken his friend entered softly knocked away the prop and prepared to turn in but the noise of pounding on the rail had aroused the householder and so great was the feeling of relief induced by the relaxation of the maxillary muscles that he unconsciously shut his mouth

laid his impious hands upon babies nursing bottles  the tubes of these infernal machines says this tearing beast are composed of indiarubber dissolved in bisulphide of carbon and thickened with lead resin and sometimes oxysulphuret of antimony from which when it comes in contact with the milk sulphuretted hydrogen is evolved and lactate of lead formed in the stomach  this logic is irresistible granting only that the tubes are made in that simple and intelligible manner and anybody can see for himself that they are the sulphuretted hydrogen and the lactate of lead follow down the osophagus as a logical sequence but the scientific horror seems to be profoundly unaware that these substances are not only harmless to the child but actually nutritious and essential to its growth not only so but nature has implanted in its breast an instinctive craving for these very comforts often have we seen some wee thing turn disgusted from the breast and lift up its thin voice not for joseph give me the bottle with the oxysulphuret of antimony tube i take sulphuretted hydrogen and lactate of lead in mine every time and we have said nature is working in that darling what god hath joined together

they catch in a godly reverie unconscious of their proximity this is perfectly natural and human but it is annoying to be always getting horsekicked when one is not in a mood for it  the worst of it is these horses always manage it so as to get tethered across the sidewalk in the most populous thoroughfares where they at once drop into the semblance of a sound slumber by this means they lure the unsuspecting to their doom and just as some unconscious pedestrian is passing astern of them they wake up and without a preliminary yawn or even a warning shake of the tail like the more chivalrous rattlesnake they at once discharge their feet at him with a rapidity and effect that are quite surprising if the range be not too long usually this occurs in merchantstreet below montgomery and the damage is merely nominal some worthless italian fisherman market gardener or decayed gentleman oozing out of a secondclass restaurant being the only sufferer  rut not infrequently these playful brutes

women and children in the air at once impelled heavenward by as many consecutive kicks of a single skilled operator no longer ago than we can remember we saw an aged party in spectacles and a clawhammer coat gyrating through the air like an irregular bolt shot out of a catapult before we could ascertain from him the site of the quadruped from whom he had received his impulsion he had passed like a vague dream and the equine scoundrel went unwhipped of justice  these flying squadrons are serious inconveniences to public travel it is conducive to profanity to have a whizzing young

said to his office there was nothing unusual in his demeanour and he appeared to be in his customary health and spirits it is not known that there was anything in his financial or domestic affairs to make life distasteful to him about half an hour after parting with his family he was seen conversing with a friend at the corner of kearny and sutterstreets from which point he seems to have gone directly to the vallejostreet wharf he was here seen by the captain of the steamer new world standing upon the extreme end of the wharf but the circumstance did not arouse any suspicion in the mind of the captain to whom he was well known at that moment some trivial business diverted the captains attention and he saw mr dummle no more but it has been ascertained that the latter proceeded directly home where he may now be seen by any one desiring to obtain further particulars of the melancholy event here narrated  mr dummle speaks of it with perfect frankness and composure   in deference to a

sympathize with the movement upon several occasions we have stood by and seen young ladies noses disappear beneath the waters blue with a stolid indifference that would have been creditable in a husband it was a trifle rough on the darlings but if we know our own mind we do not purpose just for the doubtful pleasure of saving a females life to surrender our prerogative of marrying when and whom we like  if we take a fancy to a woman we shall wed her but were not to be coerced into matrimony by any ridiculous schoolgirl who may chance to fall into a horsepond we know their tricks and

goosepuddle that obstructs their way their liberty of action will be scrupulously respected   there is a bladdery old nasality ranging about the country upon free passes vexing the public ear with hallowed songs and making of himself a spectacle to the eye this bleating lamb calls himself the sacred singer and has managed to get that pleasing title into the newspapers until it is become as offensive as himself  now therefore we do trustfully petition that this wearisome psalmsharp this miauling metermonger this howling dervish of hymns devotional may strain his trachea unsettle the

we hold a most unflattering opinion of the man who will thieve a dog but between him and the man who will keep one the moral difference is not so great as to be irreconcilable  our own dog is a standing example of canine inutility the scurvy cur is not only totally depraved in his morals but his hair stands the wrong way and his tail is of that nameless type intermediate between the pendulously pitiful and the spirally exasperatinga tail which gives rise to conflicting emotions in the mind of the beholder and causes the involuntarily uplifted hand to hesitate if it shall knuckle away the springing tear or fall in thunderous vengeance upon the head of the dogs master  that dog spends about half his elegant leisure in devouring the cold victuals of compassion and the other half in running after the bricks of which he is the provocation and we are the target within the last six years we employed as editors upon the unhappy journal which it was intended that this article

wish to purchase a cheap dog we would sell this beast   a religious journal published in the far west says that brothers dong gong and tong are chinese converts to its church there is a fine religious nasality about these names that is strongly suggestive of the pulpit in the palmy days of the puritans  by the way we should dearly love to know how to baptize a chinaman we have a shrewd suspicion that it is done as the mongolian laundryman dampens our linen by taking the mouth full of water and spouting it over the converts head in a fine spray if so it follows that the pastor having most cheek is best qualified for cleansing the pagan soul  an important question arises here suppose dong gong and tong to have been baptized in this way who pronounced that efficacious formula i baptize thee in the name etc clearly the parson with his mouth full of water could not have done so at the instant of baptism and if the sentence was spoken by any other person it was a falsehood it must therefore have been spoken either before the minister distended his cheeks or after he had exhausted them in either case according to the learned dr sicklewit the ceremony is utterly null and void of

aged one hundred and eight years who had never been sick in his life lay down one fine day and sawed his neck asunder with a razor henry did not believe in selfslaughter he despised it it was henrys opinion that as god had placed us here we should stay until it was his pleasure to remove us that is also our opinion and the opinion of all other good christians who would like to die but are afraid to do it it will be observed that henry could not claim originality of opinion  but there is a point beyond which hope deferred maketh the heart sick and henry had passed that point he waited patiently till he was naked of scalp and deaf of ear he endured without repining the bent back the sightless eyes and the creaking joints incident to overmaturity but when he saw a man perish of senility who in infancy had called him old hank mr wolfe thought patience had ceased to be commendable and he abandoned his post of duty without being regularly relieved  it is to be hoped he will be hotly punished for it   one day an obscure and unimportant person pitched himself among the rolling porpoises from a ferryboat and an officious busybody not at once clearly apprehending that the

justified in maintaining its innocence   we are tolerably phlegmatic and notoriously hard to provoke we look on with considerable composure while our favourite chinaman is being dismembered in the streets and our dog publicly insulted detecting an alien hand in our trousers pocket excites in us only a feeling of temperate disapprobation and an open swindle executed upon our favourite cousin by

keeping ever within sight of the headlands and promontories of probabilitywhose excursions are limited to short fairweather reaches into the ocean of imagination and who paddles for port as if the

the memory of the late john ridd of illinois we entertain the liveliest contempt mr ridd recently despatched himself with a firearm for the following reasons set forth in a letter that he left behind  two years ago i discovered that i was worthless my great failings are insincerity of character and sly ugliness any one who watched me a little while would discover my unenviable nature  now it is not that mr ridd was worthless that we hold his memory in reprobation nor that he was insincere nor sly nor ugly it is because possessing these qualities he was fool enough to think they disqualified him for the duties of life or stood in the way of his being an ornament to society and an honour to his country  about the first of next month says a pious contemporary we shall discontinue the publication of our paper in this city and shall remove our office and fixtures to where we hope for a blessing upon our work and a share of advertising patronage  a numerous editorial staff of intelligent jackasses will accompany the caravan in imagination we behold them now trudging gravely along behind the moving office fixtures their goggle eyes cast down in christian meditation their horizontal ears flopping solemnly in unison with their measured tread ever and anon the leader halts uprolls the speculative eye arrests the oscillation of the ears laying them rigidly back along the

horsestealing he keeps it neatly coiled away in an old cheese box and every sunday morning he lays his left hand reverently upon it and with uncovered head and a look of stern determination in his eye raises his right to heaven and swears by an avenging god it served the old man right  it has not been deemed advisable to put this dutiful son under bonds to keep the peace   a contemporary has some elaborate obituary commendation of a boy seven years of age who was a child of more than ordinary sprightliness loved the bible and was deeply impressed with a veneration for holy things  now we would sorrowfully ask our contemporary if he thinks flattery like this can soothe the dull cold ear of young dobbin dobbin père may enjoy it as light and entertaining reading but when the resurrecting angel shall stir the dust of young theophilus with his foot and sing out get up dobbin we think that sprightly youth will whimper three times for molasses gingerbread before he will signify an audible aspiration for the bible a sweettooth is often mistaken for early piety and licking a sugar archangel may be easily construed as veneration for holy things   a young physician of troy became enamoured of a rich female patient and continued his visits after she was convalescent during one of these he had the misfortune to give her the smallpox having neglected to change his clothes after calling on another patient enjoying that malady the lady had to be removed to the pesthouse where the stricken medico sedulously attends her for nothing his generosity does not end here he declares that should she recover he will marry herif she be not too badly pitted  apparently the legal profession does not enjoy a monopoly of all the selfsacrifice that is current in the world   a young woman stood before the mirror with a razor pensively she twirled the unaccustomed instrument in her jewelled fingers fancying her smooth cheek clothed with a manly beard in imagination she saw her pouting lips shaded by the curl of a dark moustache and her eyes grew dim with tears that it was not never could be so and the mirrored image wept back at her a silent sob the echo of her grief  ah she sighed why did not god make me a man must i still drag out this hateful whiskerless existence  the girlish tears welled up again and overran her eyes thoughtfully she crossed her right hand over to her left ear carefully but timidly she placed the keen cold edge of the steel against the smooth alabaster neck twisted the fingers of her other hand into her long black hair drew back her head and ripped away there was an apparition in that mirror as of a ripe watermelon opening its mouth to address a public meeting there were the thud and jar of a sudden sitting down and when the old lady came in from frying doughnuts in the adjoining room she found something that seemed to interest hersomething still and warm and wetsomething kind of doubled up  ah poor old wretch your doughnuts shall sizzle and sputter and swim unheeded in their grease but the beardless jaw that should have wagged filially to chew them is dropped in death the stomach which they should have distended is crinkled and dry for ever   miss olive logans lecture upon girls has suggested to the writer the propriety of delivering one upon boys he doesnt know anything about boys and is therefore entirely unprejudiced he was never a boy himselfhas always been just as old as he is now though the peculiar vagueness of his memory previously to the time of building the pyramid of cheops and his indistinct impressions as to the personal appearance of job lead to the suspicion that his faculties at that time were partially undeveloped he regards himself as the only lecturer extant who can do justice to boys and he prefers to do it with an axehandle but is willing like olive logan to sacrifice his mere preferences for the purpose of making money  this lecture will take place as soon as a sum of money has been sent to this office sufficiently large to justify him in renting a hall for one hours uninterrupted profanitysixty minutes of careful accurate and elaborate cursing admissionall the money you have about you boys will be charged in proportion to their estimated depravity fifty dollars a head for the younger sorts and from five hundred to one thousand for those more advanced in general diabolism   some women in new york have set the fashion of having costly diamonds set into their front teeth the attention of robbers and garotters is called to this fact with the recommendation that no greater force be used than is necessary the use of the ordinary bludgeon or slung shot would be quite needless a gentle tap on the head with a clay pipe or a toothpick will place the victim in the proper condition to be despoiled great care should be exercised in extracting the jewels instead of the teeth being knocked inwards as in ordinary cases of mere purposeless mangling they should be artistically lifted out by inserting the point of a crowbar into the mouth and jumping on the other end   the coroner having broken his leg inquests will hereafter be held by the justices of the peace people intending to commit suicide will confer a favour by worrying along until the coroner shall recover as the justices are all new to the business the cold uncharitable world is tolerably hard to endure but if unfortunates will secure some respectable employment and go to work at it they will be surprised to find how glibly the moments will glide away the coroner will probably be ready for their carcases in about four weeks and it would be well not to bind themselves to service for a longer period lest he should find it necessary to send for them and do their little business himself a fair supply of streetcadavers and watercorpses can usually be counted on but it is absolutely necessary to have a certain proportion of suicides   john reed of illinois is a man who knows his rights and knowing dares maintain having communicated to a young lady his intention of conferring upon her the honour of his company at a fourth of july celebration john was pained and disgusted to hear the proposal quietly declined john went thoughtfully away to a neighbour who keeps a doubleshotgun this he secured and again sought the object of his hopeless preference the object was seated at the dinnertable contending with her lobscouse and did not feel his presence near mr reed poised and sighted his artillery and with the very natural remark i think this fetcher he exploded the twin charges a moment later might have been seen the rare spectacle of a headless young lady sitting bolt upright at table spooning a wad of hash into the top of her neck the wall opposite presented the appearance of having been bombarded with fresh livers and baptized with sausagemeat  no one in the vicinity slept any that night they were busy getting ready for the fourth the gentlemen going about inviting the ladies to attend the celebration and the ladies hastily and unconditionally accepting   in answer to the ladies who are always bothering him for a photograph mr grile hopes to satisfy all parties by the following meagre description of his charms  in person he is rather thin early in the morning and a trifle corpulent after dinner in complexion pale with a suspicion of ruby about the gills he wears his hair brown and parted crosswise of his remarkably fine head his eyes are of various colours but mostly bottlegreen with a glare in them reminding one of incipient hydrophobiafrom which he really suffers a permanent depression in the bridge of his nose was inherited from a dying father what time the son mildly petitioned for a division of the estate to which he and his seventeen brothers were about to become the heirs the mouth is gentlemanly capacious indicative of high breeding and feeding the under jaw projects slightly forming a beautiful natural reservoir for the reception of beer and other liquids the forehead retreats rapidly whenever a creditor is met or an offended reader espied coming toward the office  his legs are of unequal length owing to his constant habit of using one of them to kick people who may happen to present a fairer mark than the nearest dog his hand is remarkably slender and white and is usually inserted in another mans pocket in dress he is wonderfully fastidious preferring to wear nothing but what is given him his gait is something between those of a mudturtle and a jackassrabbit verging closely on to the latter at periods of supposed personal danger as before intimated  in conversation he is animated and brilliant some of his lies being quite equal to those of coleridge or bolingbroke but in repose he resembles nothing so much as a heap of old clothes in conclusion his respect for letterwriting ladies is so great that he would not touch one of them with a tenfoot pole   only one hundred and ten thousand pious pilgrims visited mount ararat in a body this year the urbane and gentlemanly proprietors of the ark tavern complain that their receipts have hardly been sufficient to pay for the late improvements in this snug retreat these gentlemen continue to keep on hand their usual assortment of choice wines liquors and cigars  opposite the noah house shem street between ham and japhet   it is commonly supposed that president lopez of paraguay was killed in battle but after reading the following slander upon him and his mother written some time since by a friend of ours it is difficult to believe he did not commit suicide  the telegraph informs us that president lopez of paraguay has again murdered his mother for conspiring against his life that sprightly and active old lady has now been executed three thousand times for the same offence she is now eightythree years old and erect as a telegraph pole time writes no wrinkles on her awful brow and her teeth are as sound as on the day of her birth she rises every morning punctually at four oclock and walks ten miles then after a light breakfast enters her study and proceeds to hatch out a new conspiracy against her first born about 2 p m it is discovered and she is publicly executed a light toast and a cup of strong tea finish the days business she retires at seven and goes to sleep with her mouth open she has pursued this life with the most unfaltering regularity for the last fifty years it is only by this unswerving adherence to hygienic principles that she has attained her present green old age   there is a person resident in stockton street whom we cannot regard with feelings other than those of lively disapproval it is not that the womanfor this person is a mature femaleever did us any harm or is likely to that is not our grievance what we seriously object to and actively contemnyea bitterly denounceis the nose of her so mighty a nose we have never beheldso spacious and open and roomy a human snout the unaided imagination is impotent to picture it rises from her face like a rock from a troubled seagrand serene majestic it turns up at an angle that fills the spectator with admiration and impresses him with an awe that is speechless  but we have no space for a description of this eternal proboscis suffice it that its existence is a standing menace to society a threat to civilization and a danger to commerce the woman who will harbour and cherish such an organ is no better than a pirate we do not know who she is and we have no desire to know we only know that all the angels could not pull us past her house with a chain cable without giving us one look at that astounding feature it is the one prominent landmark of the nineteenth centurythe special wonder of the agethe solitary marvel of a generation  we would give anything to see her blow it   at the coroners inquest in the case of john harvey there was considerable difficulty in ascertaining the cause of death but as one witness testified that the deceased was pounding fulminate of mercury at the powder works just previously to his lamented demise there is good reason to believe he was hoist into heaven with his own petard in fact such fractions of him as have come to hand up to date seem to confirm this view this evidence is rather disjointed and fragmentary but it is sufficient to discourage the brutal practice of pounding fulminate of mercury when our streets and sundayschools are swarming with available chinaman who seldom hit back   we find the following touching tale in all the newspapers it belongs to that class of tales concerning which the mildest doubt is hateful blasphemy  a little girl in ithaca just before she died exclaimed papa take hold of my hand and help me across her father had died two months before did she see him  there is not a doubt of it but interested relatives have somewhat misstated the little girls exclamation which was this  papa take hold of my hand and i will help you out of that   we get the most distressing accounts of the famine in persia it is said that cannibalism is as common among the starving inhabitants as porkeating in california  this is very sad it shows either a very low state of persian morality or a conspicuous lack of persian ingenuity they ought to manage it as the conscientious indians do in time of famine these gentle creatures never disgrace themselves by feasting upon each other they permit their dogs to devour the dead and then they eat the dogs   an old lady was set upon by a fiend in human apparel and remorselessly kissed in the presence of her daughter  this happened a few days since in iowa where the fiend now lies buried any man who is so dead to shame and so callous of soul generally as to force his unwelcome endearments upon a poor defenceless old lady while her beautiful young daughter stands weeping by equally defenceless deserves pretty much all the evil that can be done to him splitting him like a fish is so disgracefully inadequate a punishment that the man who should administer it might justly be regarded as an accomplice   from london we have intelligence of the stabbing to death of a man by mistake his assassin mistook him for a person related to himself whose loss would be his own financial gain fancy the utter dejection of this stabber when he discovered the absurd blunder he had committed we believe a slip like that would justify a man in throwing down the knife and discarding murder for ever while two such errors would be ample excuse for him to go into some kind of business   a small but devout congregation were at worship when it had become a free exhibition in which any brother could enact a part a queerlooking person got up and began a pious and learned exhortation he spake for some two hours and was listened to with profound attention his discourse punctuated with holy groans and pious amens from an edified circle of the saintly tears fell as the gentle rains from heaven several souls were then and there snatched as brands from the eternal burning and started on their way to heaven rejoicing at the end of the second hour and as the inspired stranger approached eightyseventhly some one became curious to know who the teacher was when lo it turned out that he was an escaped lunatic from the asylum  the curses of the elect were not loud but deep they fumed with exceeding wrath and slopped over with pious indignation at the swindle put upon them the inspired however escaped and was afterwards captured in a cornfield  the funeral was unostentatious   we hear a great deal of sentiment with regard to the last solar eclipse considerable ink has been consumed in setting forth the terrible and aweinspiring features of the scene as there will be no other good one this season the following recipe for producing one artificially will be found usefulsuspend a grindstone from the centre of a room take a cheese of nearly the same size and after blacking one side of it pass it slowly across the face of the grindstone and observe the effect in a mirror placed opposite on the cheese side the effect will be terrific and may be heightened by taking a rum punch just at the instant of contact this plan is quite superior to that of nature for with several cheeses graduated in size all known varieties of eclipse may be presented in writing up the subsequent account a great many interesting phenomena may be introduced quite impossible to obtain either by this or any other process   we have observed with considerable impatience that the authors of sunday school books do not seem to know anything there is no reason why these pleasant volumes should not be made as effective as they are deeply interesting the trouble is in the method of treating wicked children instead of being destroyed by appalling calamities they should simply be made painfully ridiculous  for example the little scoundrel who climbs up an appletree to plunder a birdsnest ought never to fall and break his neck he should be permitted to garner his unholy harvest of eggs in his pocket then lose his balance catch the seat of his pantaloons on a knothole and hang doubled up with the smashed eggs trickling down his jacket and getting into his hair and eyes then the good little girls should be lugged in to poke fun at him and ask him if he likes em hard or soft this would be a most impressive warning  the boy who neglects his prayers to go boating on a sunday ought not to be drowned he should be spilled out into the soft mud along shore and stuck fast where the sunday school scholars could pelt him with slush and their teacher have a fair fling at him with a dead cat  the small female glutton who steals jam in the pantry ought not to get poisoned she should get after a pot of warm glue which should be made to miraculously stiffen the moment she gets it into her mouth and have to be gouged out of her with a chisel and hammer  then there is the swearing party who is struck by lightninga very shallow and unprofitable device he should open his face to swear dislocate his jaw be unable to get closed up and the rats should get in at night make nests there and breed  there are other suggestions that might be made but these will give a fair idea of our method the foundation of which is the substitution of potent ridicule for the current grave but imbecile rebuke it may be gratifying to learn that we are embodying our views in a whole library of sunday school literature adapted to the meanest capacity and therefore equally edifying to pupil pastor and parent   a young correspondent who has lately read a great deal in the english papers about babyfarming wishes to know what that may be it is a new method of agriculture in which the young of our species are used for manure  the babies are collected each day and put into large vats containing equal parts of hydrobicarbonate of oxygenated sulphide and oxygenated sulphide of hydrobicarbonate where they are left to soak overnight in the morning they are carefully macerated in a mortar and are then poured into shallow copper pans where they remain until all the liquid portions have been evaporated by the sun the residuum is then scraped out and after the addition of a certain proportion of quicklime the whole is thrown away ordinary bone dust and charcoal are then used for manure and the baby farmers seldom fail of getting a good crop of whatever they plant provided they stick the seeds in right end up  it will be seen that the result depends more upon the hydrobicarbonate than upon the infants there isnt much virtue in babies but then our correspondent should remember that there is none at all in adults   a young woman writes to a contemporary desiring to learn if it is true that kissing a dead man will cure the toothache it might it sometimes makes a great difference whether you take your medicine hot or cold but we would earnestly advise her to try kissing a multitude of live men before taking so peculiar a prescription it is our impression that corpses are absolutely worthless for kissing purposes and if one can find no better use for them they might as well be handed over to the needy and deserving worm   mr knettle deceased became irritated and fired three shots from a revolver into the head of his coy sweetheart while she was making believe to run away from him it has seldom been our lotexcept in the cases of a few isolated policemento record so perfectly satisfactory target practice if that man had lived he would have made his mark as well as hit it he died by his own hand at the beginning of a brilliant career and although we cannot hope to emulate his shooting we may cherish the memory of his virtues just as if we could bring down our girl every time at ten paces   a pedagogue has been sentenced to the county gaol for six months for whipping a boy in a brutal manner the public heartily approves the sentence and quite naturally we dissent we know nothing whatever about this particular case but upon general principles we favour the extreme flagellation of incipient man in our own case the benefit of the system is apparent had not our pious parent administered daily rebukes with such foreign bodies as he could lay his hands on we might have grown up a presbyterian deacon  look at us now   a man who played a leading part in a late railroad accident had had his life insured for twenty thousand dollars unfortunately the policy expired just before he did and he had neglected to renew it this is a happy illustration of the folly of procrastination had he got himself killed a few days sooner his widow would have been provided with the means of setting up housekeeping with another man   people ought not to pack cocked pistols about in the hip pockets of their trousers the custom is wholly indefensible such is the opinion of the last man who leaned up against the counter in a marysville drinkingsaloon for a quiet chat with the barkeeper  the odd boot will be given to the poor   a man ninetyseven years of age has just died in the state of new york the sun says he bad conversed with both president washington and president grant  if there were any further cause of death it is not stated   the letter following was written by the rev reuben hankerlockew a persian christian in relation to the late famine in his country the rev gentleman took a hopeful view of affairs  peace be with youbless your eyes our country is now suffering the direst of calamities compared with which the punishment of tarantulus we suppose our correspondent meant tantalus was nice and the agony of a dyspeptic ostrich in a junk shop is a condition to be coveted we are in the midst of plenty but we cant get anything that seems to suit the

death of that double girl who has been in everybodys mouth for months this shameless little doubleender with two heads and one bodytwo cherries on a single stem as it werehas been for many moons afflicting our simple soul with an itching desire that she might diethe nasty pig two halfgirls joined squarely at the waist and without any legs are not a pleasant type of the coming woman  had she lived she would have been a bone of social theological and political contention and we should never have heard the endof which she had two alike if she had lived to marry some mischiefmaking scoundrel would have procured the indictment of her husband for bigamy the preachers would have fought for her and if converted separately her methodist end might have always been thrashing her episcopal end or vice versâ when she came to serve on a jury nobody could have decided if there ought to be eleven others or only ten and if she ever voted twice the opposite party would have had her up for repeating and if only once she would have been read out of her own for criminal apathy in the exercise of the highest duty etc  we bless god for taking her away though what he can want with her is as difficult a problem as herself or himself she will have to wear two golden crowns thus entailing a double expense she wont be able to fly any and having no legs she must be constantly watched to keep her from

similar sheets do likewise or have they more elastic consciences for behold the muckrake is likewise visible in all   some of the red indians on the plains have discarded the songs of their fathers and adopted certain of dr wattss hymns which they howl at their scalpdances with much satisfaction  this is encouraging certainly but we dare not counsel the good missionaries to pack up their libraries and go home with the impression that the noble red is thoroughly converted there yet remains a work to do he must be taught to mortify instead of paint his countenance and induced to abandon the savage vice of stealing for the christian virtue of cheating likewise he must be made to understand that although conjugal fidelity is highly com mendable all civilized nations are distinguished by a faithful adherence to the opposite practice   some raving maniac sends us a mass of stuff which savours strongly of walt whitman and which probably for that reason he calls poetry we have room for but a single bit of description which we print as an illustration of the depth of literary depravity which may be attained by a poet in love  behold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair thou hast doves eyes within thy locks thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from mt gilead thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn which came up from the washing whereof every one bear twins and none is barren among them thy lips are like a thread of scarlet and thy speech is comely thy temples are like a piece of pomegranate within thy locks thy neck is a tower of ivory thine eyes like the fishpools of heshbon by the gate of bathrabbim thy nose is as the tower of lebanon looking towards damascus  really we think that will do for one instalment what the mischief this poet means with his goats hair sheeps teeth and temples like a piece of pomegranate is quite beyond our mental reach we would suggest that the ignorance of english grammar displayed in the phrase every one bear twins is not atoned for by comparing his mistresss eyes to a duck pond and her nose to the tower of lebanon looking towards damascus the latter simile is suggestive of unpleasant consequences to the inhabitants of that village in case the young lady should decide to blow that astounding feature our very young contributor will consider himself dismissed with such ignominy as is implied by our frantic indifference   a liberal reward will be paid by the writer for a suitably vituperative epithet to be applied to the ordinary street preacher the writer has himself laboured with so unflagging a zeal in the pursuit of the proper word has expended the midnight oil with so lavish and matchless a prodigality has kneaded his brain with such a singular forgetfulness of selfthat he is gone clean daft and all without adequate result from the profoundest deep of his teeming invention he succeeded in evolving only such utterly unsatisfying results as rhinoceros polypus and sheeptick in the animal kingdom and rhubarb snakeroot and smartweed in the vegetable the mineral world was ransacked but gave forth only old red sandstone which is tolerably severe but had been previously used to stigmatize a member of the academy of sciences  now what we wish to secure is a word that shall contain within itself all the essential principles of downright abuse the mere pronouncing of which in

applied would go right away out and kick himself to death with a jackass we covenant that the inventor shall be slain the moment we are in possession of his infernal secret as life would of course be a miserable burden to him ever afterward  with a calm reliance upon the fertile scurrility of our readers we leave the matter in their hands commending their souls to the merciful god who contrived them   we have received from a prominent clergyman a long letter of earnest remonstrance against what he is pleased to term our unprovoked attacks upon gods elect  we emphatically deny that we have ever made any unprovoked attacks upon them gods elect are always irritating us they are eternally lying in wait with some monstrous absurdity to spring it upon us at the very moment when we are least prepared they take a fiendish delight in torturing us with tantrums galling us with gammon and pelting us with platitudes whenever we disguise ourself in the seemly toggery of the godly and enter meekly into the tabernacle hoping to pass unobserved the parson is sure to detect us and explode a bombful of bosh upon our devoted head no sooner do we pick up a religious weekly than we stumble and sprawl through a bewildering succession of inanities manufactured expressly to ensnare our simple feet if we take up a tract we are laid out cold by an apostolic knock straight from the clerical shoulder we cannot walk out of a pleasant sunday without being keeled over by a stroke of pious lightning flashed from the tempestuous eye of an irate churchman at our secular attire should we cast our thoughtless glance upon the demure methodist rachel we are paralysed by a scowl of disapprobation which prostrates like the shock of a gymnotus and any of our mild pleasantry at the expense of young squaretoes is cut short by a bible rebuke shot out of his mouth like a rock from a catapult  is it any wonder that we wax gently facetious in conversing of the electthat in our weak way we seek to get even now good clergyman go thou to the devil and leave us to our own devices or an offended journalist shall skewer thee upon his spit and roast thee in a blaze of righteous indignation   the new york tribune descanting upon the recent national misfortune by which the writers red right hand was quietly chewed by an envious bear says it cannot commend the writers example but hopes his next appearance in print may edify his readers on the dangers of such a practice  we had not hitherto deemed it necessary to raise a warning voice to a universe not much given to fooling with bears anyhow but embrace this opportunity to declare ourself firmly and unalterably opposed to the whole business we plant our ample feet squarely upon the platform of nonintervention so far as affects the social economy and individual idiosyncrasies of bears but if the tribune man expects a homily upon the sin of feeding oneself in courses to wild animals he is informed that we waste no words upon the senseless wretch who is given to that species of iniquity we regard him with ineffable selfcontempt   a young girl in grass valley having died her father wrote some verses upon the occasion in which she is made to discourse thus then do not detain me for why should i stay when cherubs in heaven call me away earth has no pleasure no joys that compare with the joys that await us in heaven so fair  as the little darling was only two years and a fraction of age it is tolerably impossible to divine upon what authority she sought to throw discredit upon the joys of earth her observation having been

mountains have burnt their bowels out and rivers have run dry since a man of god has committed this error obituary notices christians   it is with a feeling of professional regret that we record the death of mr jacob pigwidgeon deceased was one of our earliest pioneers who came to this state long before he was needed his age is a matter of mere conjecture probably he was less advanced in years than methuselah would have been had he practised a reasonable temperance in eating and drinking mr pigwidgeon was a gentleman of sincere but modest piety profoundly respected by all who fancied themselves like him probably no man of his day exercised so peculiar an influence upon society ever foremost in every good work out of which there was anything to be made an unstinted dispenser of every species of charity that paid a commission to the disburser mr pigwidgeon was a model of generosity but so modestly did he lavish his favours that his left hand seldom knew what pocket his right hand was relieving during the troubles of 56 he was closely identified with the vigilance committee being entrusted by that body with the important mission of going into nevada and remaining there in 1863 he was elected an honorary member of the society for the prevention of humanity to the chinese and there is little doubt but he might have been anything so active was the esteem with which he inspired those for whom it was desired that he should vote  originally born in massachusetts but for twentyone years a native of california and partially bald possessing a cosmopolitan nature that loved an english shilling as well in proportion to its value as a mexican dollar the subject of our memoir was one whom it was an honour to know and whose close friendship was a luxury that only the affluent could afford it shall even be the writers proudest boast that he enjoyed it at less than half the usual rates  the circumstances attending his taking off were most mournful he had been for some time very much depressed in spirits of one kind and another and on last wednesday morning was observed to be foaming at the mouth no attention was paid to this his family believing it to be a symptom of hydrophobia with which he had been afflicted from the cradle suddenly a darkeyed stranger entered the house took the patients neck between his thumb and forefinger threw the body across his shoulder winked respectfully to the bereaved widow and withdrew by way of the kitchen cellar farewell pure soul we shall meet again   we are reluctantly compelled to relate the untimely death of mrs margaret ann picklefinch which occurred about one oclock yesterday morning the circumstances attending the melancholy event were these  just before the hour named her husband the wellknown temperance lecturer and less generally known temperance lecturee came home from an adjourned meeting of the coldwater legion and retired very drunk his estimable lady got up and pulled off his boots as usual he got into bed and she lay down beside him she uttered a mild preliminary oath of endearment and suddenly ceased speaking it must have been about this time she died about daylight he invited her to get up and make a fire detecting no movement in her body he enforced family discipline the peculiar hard sound of his wife striking the floor first aroused his suspicions of the bereavement he had sustained and upon rising later in the day he found his first fears realized the lady had waived her claim to his further protection  we extend to mr p our sincere sympathy in the greatest calamity that can befall an unmarriageable man the inconsolable survivor called at our office last evening conversed feelingly some moments about the virtues of the dear departed and left with the air of a dog that has had his tail abbreviated and is forced to begin life anew truly the decrees of providence appear sometimes absurd   mr bildad gorcas whose death has cast a wet blanket of gloom over our community was a man comparatively unknown but his life furnishes an instructive lesson to fast livers mr gorcas never in his life tasted ardent spirits ate spiced meats or sat up later than nine oclock in the evening he rose summer and winter at two a m and passed an hour and three quarters immersed in ice water for the last twenty years he has walked fifteen miles daily before breakfast and then gone without breakfast during his waking hours he was never a moment idle when not hard at work he was trying to think up to the time of his death which occurred last sunday he had never spoken to a doctor never had occasion to curse a dentist had a luxurious growth of variegated hair and there was not a wrinkle upon any part of his body if he had not been cut off by falling across a circular saw at the early age of thirtytwo there is no telling how long he might have weathered it through  a life like his is so bright and shining an example that we are almost sorry he died   during the week just rolled into eternity our city has been plunged into the deepest grief he who doeth all things well though to our weak human understanding his acts may sometimes seen to savour of injustice has seen fit to remove from amongst us one whose genius and blameless life had endeared him to friend and foe alike  in saying that mr jowler was a dog of preeminent abilities and exceptional virtues we but faintly echo the verdict of a bereaved universe endowed with a gigantic intellect and a warm heart modest in his demeanour genial in his intercourse with friends and acquaintances and forbearing towards strangers with whom he ever maintained the most cordial relations unmarred by the gross familiaritytoo common among dogs of inferior breeds inoffensive in his daily walk and conversation the deceased was universally respected and his loss will be even more generally deplored  it would be a work of supererogation to give a résumé of the public career of one so well knownone whose name has become a household word in private life his character was equally estimable he had ever a wag of encouragement for the young the illfavoured the belaboured and the mangy though his gentle spirit has passed away he has left with us the record of his virtues as a shining example for all puppies and the writer is pleased to admit that so far as in him lay he has

coast inn and at the time seemed to be in undisputed possession of all his faculties the remainder of his personal property having been transferred to the white labourer aforesaid at the moment alluded to mr hop was in the act of throwing up his arms as if to ward off some impending danger in the hands of the sole spectator an instant later he experienced one of those sudden deaths which have made this city popularly famous and surgically interesting  the lamented was forty years of age how much longer he might have lived in his own country it is impossible to determine but it is to be remarked that the climate of california is a very trying one to people of his peculiar organization the body was kindly taken in charge by a resident of the vicinity and now lies in state in his back yard where it is being carefully prepared for burial by those skilful meathounds messrs lassirator mangler and chure whose names are a sufficient guarantee that the mournful rites will be attended to in a manner befitting the solemn occasion  we tender the bereaved widow our sincere sympathy at the regular rates the cause of mr hops demise is unknown it is unimportant   a dead asian
