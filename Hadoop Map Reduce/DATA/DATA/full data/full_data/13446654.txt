13446654	the pioneers by rm ballantyne    preface  sir alexander mackenzie was one of the most energetic and successful of the discoverers who have traversed the vast wilderness of british america  he did his work singlehanded with slender means and slight encouragement at a time when discovery was rare and the country almost terra incognita  the long and difficult route so recently traversed by the red river expedition was to sir alexander but the small beginning of his farreaching travels  he traced the great river which bears his name to its outlet in the polar sea and was the first to cross the rocky mountains in those latitudes and descend to the pacific ocean  being a man of action and not particularly enamoured of the pen his journal for a sight of which apply to the british museum london or the advocates library edinburghfull though it be of important and most interesting factsis a bare and unadorned though valuable record of progress made of work done which is unsuited to juvenile minds besides being bulky and scarce  having spent some years in ruperts land and seen something of red indian and furtrading life i have ventured to weave the incidents of sir alexanders narratives into a story which it is hoped may prove interesting to the youngperchance also to the old  i take this opportunity of acknowledging myself deeply indebted to sir alexanders daughter miss mackenzie and to his two sons for kindly placing at my disposal all the information in their possession  rmb  edinburgh 1872    chapter one  shows how it began  the world is round said somebody in ancient times to somebody else  not at all it is flatflat as a pancake replied somebody else to somebody and if you were to travel far enough you might get to the end of it and tumble over the edge if so disposed  ever since the commencement of this early geographical controversy men have been labouring with more or less energy and success to ascertain the form and character of the earth a grand glorious labour it has been resulting in blessings innumerable to mankindblessings both spiritual and temporal  we have heard some people object to geographical discovery especially in the inclement parts of the earth on the ground that it could be of no use and involved great risk to life and limb  of no use  who can tell what discoveries shall be useful and what useless  the works of god are great sought out of all those that have pleasure therein saith the scripture  there is no reference here to usefulness but the searching out of gods works without limitation is authorised and those who take pleasure therein will be content to leave the result of their labours in the hands of him who sent them forth  as to riskwhy a carpenter cannot ascend to the top of a house to put the rafters thereon without risk a chemist cannot investigate the properties of certain fumes without risk you cannot even eat your dinner without risk  only this are we sure ofthat if man had never undertaken labour except when such was obviously useful and devoid of risk the world would still be in the darkness of the middle ages  reuben guff held these sentiments or something like them and reuben was a man who had seen a great deal of life in his day although at the time we introduce him to public notice he had not lived more than sixandthirty summers  he was a bronzed stalwart canadian  his father had been scotch his mother of french extraction and reuben possessed the dogged resolution of the scot with the vivacity of the frenchman  in regard to his tastes and occupation we shall let him speak for himself  sitting under a pinetree in the wild wilderness that lies to the north of canada with the drumstick of a goose in one hand and a scalpingknife in the other with a logfire in front of him and his son a stripling of sixteen by his side he delivered himself of the following sentiments  i tell ee what it is lawrence the lad was named after the great river on the banks of which he had been reared i was born to be a pioneer  ever since i was the height of a threefut rule ive had a skunner at the settlements and a love for the wilderness that i couldnt overcome nohow  moreover i wouldnt overcome it if i could for its my opinion that he who made us knows what he wants us to do an has given us sitch feelins and inclinations as will lead us to do it if we dont run mad after notions of our own as the folk in the settlements are raither apt to do  here some of the notions referred to appeared to tickle the fancy of the backwoodsman for he paused to indulge in a quiet chuckle which wrinkled up all the lines of goodhumour and fun in his rough countenance  after applying himself for a few seconds with much energy to the drumstickhe resumed his discourse in a slow deliberate style of speech which was peculiar to him  yes lawrence my lad ive made it my business ever since i was fifteen to explore this here wilderness livin by my gun and guidin the furtraders on their vyages or consorting with the injins as you know very well and now that weve come to the big lake it is needful to tell ee that im still bent on followin out my callin  im goin away to the norard to explore and youll have to make up your mind tonight whether you will be my steersman or whether im to lay that dooty on swiftarrow  i neednt say which id like best  the hunter finished the drumstick at this point threw the bone into the fire lighted his pipe and awaited his sons answer in silence  but the son appeared to be in no hurry to reply for after giving his father a glance and nod which were meant to say i hear and ill consider but im too much engaged just now to speak he continued his occupation of devouring venison steaks the sauce to which was evidently hunger  having finished his supper and lighted his pipe he became more communicative  father he said you have always advised me to think well before speaking  i have lad its the natur of our forefathers an a very good natur too  id be sorry to see it go out of the family  well then ive thought my best about goin with ee on this trip returned the youth an ive resolved to go on one conditionthat swiftarrow goes with us  why so my son we dont need him  perhaps not but i like him for he has taught me all that i know of woodcraft and im certain that if you and i both leave him hell be sure to return to the new settlement at the south end of ontario and you know what the end of that would be  death by drinkin replied reuben guff shaking his head slowly while he watched the upward flight of a ring of white smoke that had just issued from his lips  well i wont leave him to that continued the youth with sudden energy of manner and look as long as my name is lawrence  you know that nothin would please me more than goin to explore the wilderness with you father but if swiftarrow is to be left behind there shall be no pioneering for me  besides three are better than two on such a trip and the injin will be sure to keep the pot full no matter what sort o country we may have to pass through for hes a dead shot wi the gun as well as wi the bow  i daresay youre right lad replied reuben in a tone of one who muses  theres room in the canoe for three and its not unlikely that the injin would go south to the settlement for he is a lonely man since his poor mother died  i do believe that it was nothin but his extraornar love for that old ooman that kep him from goin to the dogs  leastwise it was that kep him from goin to the settlement which is much the same thing for swiftarrow cant resist firewater yes lad youre rightso well take him with us  as you say three are better than two on such a vyage  some weeks after the foregoing conversation the pioneers arrived at the northern end of that great inland sea lake superior which being upwards of four hundred miles long and one hundred and seventyfive miles broad presents many of the features of ocean itself  this end of the lake was at the time we write of and still is an absolute wilderness inhabited only by scattered tribes of indians and almost untouched by the hand of the white man save at one spot where the furtraders had planted an isolated establishment  at this point in the wild woods the representatives of the furtraders of canada were wont to congregate for the settlement of their affairs in the spring of every year and from this point also tradingparties were despatched in canoes into the still more remote parts of the great northern wilderness whence they returned with rich cargoes of furs received from the red men in exchange for powder and shot guns hatchets knives cloth twine fishhooks and such articles as were suited to the tastes and wants of a primitive and wandering people  here reuben guff and his son found swiftarrow as they had expected and proposed to him that he should accompany them on their voyage northa proposal which he accepted with pleasurefor the strongboned indian had an adventurous spirit as well as a healthy frame  swiftarrow was a brave and powerful indian and was esteemed one of the best hunters of his tribe but no one seeing him in camp in a quiescent state would have thought him to be possessed of much energy for he was slow and deliberate in his movements and withal had a lazy look about his eyes  but the sight of a bear or moosedeer had the effect of waking him up in a way that caused his dark eyes to flash and his large frame to move with catlike activity  when reuben guff discovered him on the shore of lake superior he was seated at the door of his skin lodge anointing his hair which was long and black with bears greasethe genuine article without even the admixture of a drop of scentso pure in fact that the indian basted his steaks and anointed his hair with grease from the same box  hallo  swiftarrow exclaimed reuben as he sauntered up to the savage with his gun on his shoulder ye seem to be beautifyin yerself todaynot goin to get married eh  swiftarrow whose long hair hung over his face like a glossy curtain tossed aside his locks and gazed earnestly at the hunter  a slight smile and a pleasant gleam lighted up his dark countenance as he wiped his greasy right hand on his legging and extended it exclaiming watchee by which he meant what cheer  what cheer what cheer replied reuben with a broad but quiet grin as he shook his friends hand heartily  each man understood the others language perfectly but each appeared to prefer to talk in his own tongue for while reuben addressed the red man in english swiftarrow replied in indian  this had been an understood arrangement between them ever since the time when as lads they had first met and formed a close friendship on the shores of lake huron  is my brothers trail to be through the woods or on the waters  does he go hunting or trading inquired the indian after the first salutations were over  well i may say that im neither goin ahuntin or tradinhere fill yer pipe wi baccy from my pouch its better than yours ill be bound in a manner too im goin both to hunt an trade in a small way but my main business on this trip is to be diskivery  the indian uttered a sound which meant that he did not understand  im goin to sarch out new lands explained reuben away to the far north  ive heard it said by injins that have wandered to the norard that theyve met in with redskins who said that there is a big river flowin out o a great lake in the direction o the north pole an that it runs into the sea there  they may be tellin truth or they may be tellin lies i dun know anyhow im koorious to know somethin about it so im goin north to see for myself and ive comed to ask if swiftarrow will go with me  the hunter paused but the indian remained silently smoking his long stoneheaded pipe or calumet with a countenance so grave and expressionless that no idea of his sentiments could be gathered from it  after a brief pause reuben continued  it wont be altogether a trip of diskivery neither for ive got some bales of goods with me and as we go in a small birch canoe well travel light but i hope to come back sunk to the gunwale with furs for the redskins of the far north are like enough to have plenty of pelts and they wont ask much for them  as to grub you and i could manage to supply ourselves wi lots o that anywheres and ive got plenty of powder and lead  moreover my boy lawrence is goin with me  during the foregoing remarks the indians countenance betrayed no sign of feeling until the name of lawrence was mentioned when a gleam of satisfaction shot from his eyes  removing the pipe from his lips he puffed a volume of smoke through his nostrils and said  swiftarrow will go  backwoodsmen seldom take long to mature their plans and are generally prompt to carry them into execution  two days after the brief conversation above narrated the three friends pushed off in their little birchbark canoe and paddled up the stream which leads to the kakabeka falls on the kamenistaquoia river  surmounting this obstacle by the simple process of carrying the canoe and her lading past the falls by land and relaunching on the still water above they continued their voyage day by day encamping under the trees by night until they had penetrated far and deep into the heart of the northern wilderness and had even passed beyond the most distant establishments of the adventurous furtraders  the world of forest swamp lake and river that still however lay between them and the land which they sought to reach was very wide weeks and even months would certainly elapse before they could hope to approach it one day therefore they buried their goods and stores in a convenient place intending to dig them up on their return and meanwhile turned aside into a country which promised to afford them a good supply of fresh provisions for the voyage north  here an adventure befell them which brought their voyage of discovery at that time to an abrupt close    chapter two  terrible discoveries and altered plans  ho ejaculated swiftarrow  smoke exclaimed reuben guff  both men spoke at the same momenttheir discovery having been simultaneous  at the same time lawrence pointed with the blade of his paddle to a thin line of smoke which rose above the treetops into the blue sky and was faithfully mirrored in the lake on which they floated  injins said reuben resting his steering paddle across the canoe for a few seconds  swiftarrow assented with another ho and lawrence moved his gun into a handy position to be ready for an emergency but there was no other sign of mans presence than the wreath of smoke  all was perfectly silent the air too was quite still and the surface of the lake resembled a sheet of glass  strange observed reuben redskins aint usually so shy  if they mean mischief they dont ever let smoke be seen an when they dont mean mischief they generally show themselves  come push on lads well go see whats i the wind  ill show them the muzzle father said lawrence laying down his paddle and taking up his gun it may be well to let em see that we have arms  no need for that boy  if they know anything at all they know that white men dont go about in the wilderness emptyhanded  put down the piece and use your paddle  thus reproved lawrence flushed slightly but obeyed the order and resumed paddling  in a few minutes they were on shore  still all was silent as the grave hauling the bow of the canoe on the beach to keep it fast the three men took their weapons and entering the woods in single file walked cautiously but swiftly in the direction of the smoke  they soon reached the spot and the scene which met their eyes was one which while it accounted for the silence that reigned around filled their minds with sadness and horror  in an open space where a number of trees had been cut down stood about a dozen skin tents or indian lodges some with the curtaindoors closed others open exposing the interiors on the floors of which the dead bodies of indian men women and children lay in every attitude and in all stages of decomposition  outside of the tents other corpses lay strewn on the ground and most of these bore evidence of having been more or less torn by wolves  the travellers knew at a glance that these unfortunate people had fallen before that terrible disease smallpox which had recently attacked and almost depopulated several districts of the indian country  how the disease was introduced among the indians at the time of which we write it is impossible to say and useless to conjecture  the fact of its desolating effects is unquestionable  one who dwelt in the country at the time writes see sir alexander mackenzies voyages page 14 the fatal infection spread around with a baneful rapidity which no flight could escape and with a fatal effect that nothing could resist it destroyed with its pestilential breath whole families and tribes and the horrid scene presented to those who had the melancholy opportunity of beholding it a combination of the dead the dying and such as to avoid the fate of their friends around them prepared to disappoint the plague of its prey by terminating their own existence  to aggravate the picture if aggravation were possible the carcases were dragged forth from the huts by the wolves or were mangled within them by the dogs which thus sought to satisfy their hunger with the putrid remains of their masters  it was not uncommon at this time for the father of a family whom the infection had not reached to call his household around him represent the terrible sufferings and fate that awaited them which he believed was owing to the influence of an evil spirit who desired to extirpate the race and incited them to baffle death with all its horrors by at once killing themselvesat the same time offering to perform the deed of mercy with his own hand if their hearts should fail them  that some of the dead before our pioneers had acted in this way was evident for while most of the corpses bore marks of having been smitten with the disease others were there which showed nothing to account for death save a knife wound over the region of the heart  it was a sad and sickening sight and drew forth one or two lowtoned sorrowful remarks from reuben as he moved slowly towards the tent from which smoke still issued  the three men paused before it because a sound came from within and they felt reluctant to disturb the awful silence  the pause however was but momentary  reuben lifted the covering and opened it wide  a small fire still burned on the hearth in the centre of the lodge around it lay the bodies of dead men women and children  only one figure that of an old woman remained in a halfreclining position but she was motionless and they thought her dead also  this however was not the case  the flood of light which streamed in on her appeared to rouse her for she raised her grey head and gazing anxiously at the figures which darkened the entrance of the lodge asked in a tremulous voice is that you my son  no mother but it is a friend said swiftarrow who understood her language  a friend repeated the old woman shaking her head slowly i dont want a friend  the master of life is my friend  my people said that an evil spirit was slaying them but i know better  it was the great spirit who came to us  we have been very wicked  we needed punishment but why has he spared me  i was the worst of them all  there was something terrible in the tone and manner in which this was uttered as if the breast of the speaker were torn with conflicting feelings  she must have met wi the missionaries some time or other whispered reuben  is the old woman the only one of all the tribe left alive asked swiftarrow  ay the only oneno not the only one my son is yet alive  he went to set a beartrap not very long since but he should have come back before now  he will be back soon  the deep sigh which followed proved that the poor old woman was hoping against hope  how long ist since he left you mother asked lawrence eagerly  two suns have risen and set since he left and he had not far to go  father ill go seek for this man said lawrence something may have befallen him  reuben made no objection and the youth set off immediately in a direction which was pointed out by the old woman  after he was gone his father and the indian shifted one of the cleanest looking of the empty tents to a considerable distance from the spot where the terrible work of death had been done and removing the old woman from the neighbourhood of the pestilential atmosphere placed her therein kindled a fire and cooked her a little food of which she evidently stood much in need  meanwhile lawrence sped through the pathless forest with the light step of a strong youth and the precision of a practised hunter  about four miles from the indian camp he came upon the track of a bear the footprints of which proved that it was an unusually large one  he followed it up closely and was led by it to a spot where some trees had been cut down and not far from which he saw what appeared to him to be the remains of a trap  almost at the same moment of his making this discovery he heard a growl and saw the bear itselfa monster of the brown species which differs from the ordinary black bear of america in being more carnivorous and much larger as well as more savage and bold no sooner did it see the youth than it rushed upon him with great fury a piece of broken line was drawn tight round its neck and another piece round its foreleg while four arrows stuck in its shoulder and side showing plainly that it had broken loose from a snare and had been attacked by man  but lawrence had no time to think on these things  he had barely time to throw forward and cock his gun when the bear was upon him  it rose on its hindlegs and in doing so towered high above the youth who whatever his feelings might have been looked undismayed with an unflinching eye he took aim at the monsters heart and shot it dead  so close was it to him that he singed the hair on its breast and had to leap to one side to avoid being struck as it fell  reloading quickly the young hunter advanced towards the trap where his worst fears were realised for near to it he found the body of an indian torn limb from limb and mostly eaten except the head which remained entire  it was evident that the poor man having set several snares for bears had gone to visit them and found this brown bear caught by the head and leg  he seemed to have tried to kill it with arrows but must have been afraid to go near enough to use his weapons with effect and the enraged animal having broken the snare flew upon him and tore him to pieces  brown bears of this kind are very powerful  one traveller in these regions saw the footprints of a large one which having seized a moosedeer in a river dragged it for a quarter of a mile along the sandy banks and afterwards devoured it all except part of the hindquarters and the moose which had been treated in this unceremonious way judging from the size and hardness of the bones must have been upwards of a year old when it would weigh as much as an ox of the same age  collecting the scattered remnants of the unfortunate indian who was no other than the old womans son lawrence covered them over with leaves and sticks  he then skinned the bear and cut off its claws which he carried away as trophies along with one or two choice steaks cut from the creatures flank  he also collected the weapons and part of the dress of the indian with which he returned to the camp  heyday  lawrence what have you got there lad said reuben as his son came up and threw the bundle on the ground  a brown bear father  well done exclaimed reuben with a look of pride for although his son had shot many a black bear in the forest he had never before stood face to face with such a monster as that whose skin and claws now lay at his feet  it would have been well father said lawrence gravely if the man who first saw this had owned a gun  his arrows were no better than needles in such a hide  see here  he drew from his breast the bloody portions of dress which had belonged to the slaughtered indian  the son of the old woman has gone to the happy huntinggrounds said swiftarrow referring to the heaven of the indian as he lifted and examined the dress  ay ay said reuben sadly tis the chances of the wilderness  youd better tell the poor old creetur swiftarrow you understand her ways and lingo better than me  silently the indian went to the old woman and laid the bloody garments before her  at first she did not understand what had happened suddenly the truth flashed upon her and she looked quickly up into the grave countenance of the indian but death and sorrow appeared to have already done their worst on her for she neither spoke nor wept for some time  she took up the shreds of cloth and turned them over tenderly but neither sign nor groan escaped her  evidently she had been already so stunned by the horrors which had surrounded her for some time that this additional blow did not tellat least not at firstbut reuben observed while trying to comfort her some time afterwards that a few tears were coursing slowly down her withered cheeks  that night round the campfire the pioneers held earnest counsel and resolved sadly but firmly that their projected journey must be given up for that season  its a hard thing to do said reuben as he lay at full length before the fire after supper to give up our plans after comin so far but it aint possible to carry that old ooman along with us an its not to be thought of to leave her behind to starve so theres nothin for it but to go back an take her wi us to the settlements  i would feel like a murderer if i was to leave one o gods creeturs to perish in the wilderness  what think you lawrence  i think you are right father replied the youth with a deep sigh  an what says swiftarrow  go back was the indians prompt and laconic answer  well then were all agreed so well turn back on our trail tomorrow but i shall try again next year if im above ground  i once knowd a yankee who had what he called a motto an it was this never give in xcept wen yer wrong  i think ill take to that motto  it seems to me a good un  in proof we presume of his sincerity reuben guff rolled himself in his blanket stretched his feet towards the fire pillowed his head on a bundle of moss and at once gave in to the seductive influences of sleep an example which was so irresistible that his companions followed it without delay    chapter three  introduces the king of pioneers  discarding space and ignoring time we seize you by the hand reader and bound away with you still deeper into the northern wilderness away into that remote region which at the time we write of was the ultima thule of the furtraders of canadabeyond which lay the great unknown world stretching to the pole  here amid the grand scenery of the rocky mountains lies the athabasca lake also styled the lake of the hills  we prefer the latter name as being more romantic  this is no pretty pond such as we in england are wont to visit and delight in during our summer holidays  it is a great sheet of water a grand freshwater sea 200 miles long and 15 miles broada fitting gem for the bosom of the mighty region on which it glitters  a year has fled since the period of our last chapter and here in a birchbark canoe on the waters of the lake of the hills we find our pioneersreuben guff his son lawrence and his indian friend swiftarrow  there is also a young indian woman in the canoe swiftarrows wife  the kindhearted red man adopted the old woman who had been rescued on their previous trip but not finding her a good substitute for his own mother he bethought him of adding a young squaw to his establishment while he meditated on this step the old woman died  about the same time reuben guff made proposals to him to join him on a second vyage of diskivery  the indian agreed got married offhand and took his bride along with him  we now find them all four at the lake of the hills  it may be as well to observe in passing that indian brides are usually more robust than those of civilised communities  they are quite competent to follow their lords on the most arduous canoe voyages and besides being able to wield the paddle with great dexterity are exceedingly useful in managing what may be styled the domestic matters of the camp  they also keep up a constant supply of the indians indispensable footgearmoccasinswhich are so slender in their nature that a pair may be completely wornout in a single day of hard hunting  the brown bride therefore was not a hindrance to the party but a useful member of it as well as a pleasant companion  true her companionship consisted chiefly in answering yes and no when spoken to and in smiling pleasantly at all times but this was sufficient to satisfy the moderate demands of her male friends upon her intellectual resources  fort chipewyan at last said reuben resting his paddle across the canoe and looking earnestly towards the horizon i hope we aint too late after all our pushin on  it would be hard to find that monsieur mackenzie had started  too much ice in the lake said swiftarrow  he has not gone yet  im not so sure o that observed lawrence  if reports be true monsieur mackenzie is not the man to wait until the ice is all off the lakes and nothin but plain sailin lies before him  thats true lad replied reuben resuming his paddle  i wonder he murmured to himself as he gazed wistfully towards the unknown north i wonder if the big river is really there an if it do jine the sea  that same question was put to himself that same eveningthough not for the first timeby one of the inhabitants of fort chipewyan  the fort was a mere group of two or three loghuts  in the largest of these huts sat a man whose stronglymarked handsome countenance gave evidence of a bold enterprising spirit and a resolute will  he pored over a map for some time carefully tracing a few pencillines into the blank spaces on the paper and then murmured in words which were almost identical with those of reuben guff i wonder if it joins the polar sea  this man was the true pioneer or rather the king of pioneers to whom guff gave place without a murmur for reuben was a modest man and the moment he heard that one of the gentlemen of the canadian furtrading company had taken up his favourite hobby and meant to work out the problem he resolved as he said to play second fiddle all the more that the man who thus unwittingly supplanted him was a mountaineer of the scottish highlands  its of no manner of use you see he said to swiftarrow when conversing on the subject for me to go off on a vyage o diskivery wen a gentleman like monsieur mackenzie with a good edication an scienteefic knowledge and the wealth of a fur company at his back is goin to take it in hand  no the right thing for reuben guff to do in the circumstances is to jine him an play second fiddleor third if need be  alexander mackenziewhile seated in the lowly hut of that solitary outpost poring over his map trying to penetrate mentally into those mysterious and unknown lands which lay just beyond himsaw in imagination a great river winding its course among majestic mountains towards the shores of the iceladen polar seas  he also saw the lofty peaks and snowclad ridges of that mighty range which forms the backbone of the american continent andagain in imaginationpassed beyond it and penetrated the vast wilderness to the pacific thus adding new lands to the british crown and opening up new sources of wealth to the fur company of which he was one of the most energetic members  he saw all this in imagination we say but he did not at that time see his name attached to one of the largest american rivers classed with the names of the most noted discoverers of the world and himself knighted  still less if possible did he see even in his wildest flights of fancy that the book of travels which he was destined to write would be translated into french by the order of napoleon the first for the express purpose of being studied by marshal bernadotte with the view of enabling that warrior to devise a roundabout and unlookedfor attack on canadain rear as it werefrom the region of the northern wildernessa fact which is well worthy of record  see appendix for an interesting letter on the subject  none of these things loomed on the mind of the modest though romantic and enterprising man for at that time he was only at the beginning of his career of discovery  it may not be out of place here to say a word or two as to the early career of the hero whose footsteps we are about to follow  he was a highlander to begin with and possessed all the fire and determination peculiar to that race  at an early period of life he was led to engage in commercial enterprises in the country northwest of lake superior joined the northwest fur company of canada in 1784 and went into the indian country the following spring  it is not necessary to say more than that alexander mackenzie proved himself to be a firstrate furtrader at a time when the furtrade was carried on under great difficulties and amid severe privations  for many years he was in charge of fort chipewyan the remote establishment to which we have just conducted our reader  seven years before his coming on the scene the lake of the hills had not been visited by white men and was known only through indian report  when mackenzie became ruler of the district all beyond the lake was terra incognita  his spirit was one which thirsted to explore the unknown  he was eminently fitted both to hold an advanced post and to invade new regions being robust in constitution powerful in frame inquisitive in mind and enterprising in spirit  frequently had he arrived at fort chipewyan with ninety or a hundred men without any provision for their sustenance for the winter save their fishingnets and guns  he was therefore accustomed to live from hand to mouth and to depend on his own exertions and resources in a country where the winter is upwards of eight months long and the severity of the climate extreme  it was in june 1789 that he made preparations to start on his first voyage of discovery  rising from the table at which he had been studying his projected route mackenzie turned with the air of a man who has made up his mind and said to a clerk who was smoking beside the fireplace  le roux if we cannot prevail on these indians to accompany us i have determined to start without them  has the small canoe been gummed  it has answered le roux but i would advise delay for a day or two if we give them time the indians may change their minds besides the ice has not yet sufficiently cleared away  mackenzie paced the room impatiently and his eyes flashed for one moment with impatience  they were deep blue eyes that could beam with melting tenderness or sparkle with suppressed passionit is but just to add that passion in his case was usually suppressed for he was a lover of peace as most truly great and powerful men usually are  let us see now he said sitting down in front of le roux how our resources stand  in my canoe there will be the four canadians and the german  then theres our indian friend english chief and his two wives who will embark in the secondsized canoe  the two young indians whom we want to accompany us with their wives must make up their minds tonight else i will start without them  your own canoe with goods for trade and provisions will not be fully loaded i shall therefore place in it the provisions that we cant carry and when we come to the place where you are to stop and trade and where i shall bid you farewell we shall doubtless have eaten our lading down sufficiently to take the whole on board  see by the way that the goods and trinkets to be given in presents as we go along are not placed in the wrong canoe  they are already laid with the other goods and also the nets and ammunition by themselves said le roux rising and laying down his pipe  at that moment reuben guff entered with his friends  the surprise of mackenzie was great on beholding them but greater still was his delight when he learned their errand  the young indians were forthwith told that their services would not now be required and our friends including swiftarrows wife darkeyewere at once added to the exploring party  next day the expedition set forth from fort chipewyan and swept over the broad breast of the lake of the hills  we will not trace their course over known ground  suffice it to say that their troubles began at once  soon after leaving the lake they came to a rapid part of the river which flows out of it where they were obliged to land and carry canoes and goods to the still water further down but here the ice was still unthawed on the banks rendering the process of reloading difficult  soon after they came to a place called the portage dembarras which is occasioned by driftwood filling up the channel of the river  there they entered the slave river where there is a portage or carryingplace named the mountain the landing at which is very steep and close to the fall  below this fall there is a mile of dangerous rapidsand here they met with their first disaster  reuben and swiftarrow having landed with part of the cargo of the small canoe had left it in charge of darkeyeso named because of her large and lustrous eyes which however were the only good points about her for she was illfavoured and clumsy though strong of frame and a diligent worker  while she was moving from one point of rock to another that appeared to her more convenient for landing the canoe was caught by an eddy and swept in a moment out into the strong current down which it sped with fearful velocity towards the falls  darkeye was quite collected and cool but she happened to dip her paddle on the edge of a sunk rock with such vigour that the canoe overturned  upon the heights above her husband saw the accident and stood rooted for a moment in helpless dismay to the spot  it chanced that lawrence guff was at the time the only man near the unfortunate woman who although she swam like an otter could not gain the bank  seeing this the youth sprang towards a jutting rock that almost overhung the fall and entering the rushing stream so deeply that he could barely retain his foothold caught the woman by the hair of the head as she was sweeping towards the edge of the fall  the two swayed for a few seconds on the verge of destruction then swiftarrow came bounding down the bank like a deer and catching lawrence by the hand dragged them both out of danger but before they were fairly landed the canoe was carried over the falls dashed to pieces and in a few seconds its shreds were tossed wildly on the surging rapids far down the river  this accident caused them little loss beyond the canoe which was soon replaced by another purchased from a party of indians with whom they fell in that same evening  passing through slave river they swept out on the bright waters of great slave lake  over these they sped during several days  this lake is one of the largest freshwater oceans of the continent about 250 miles long and 50 broad  and here the work of exploration fairly began  great slave lake was at that time imperfectly known from indian report and the river of which they were in search flowed it was supposed out of its western extremity  here also monsieur le roux was to be left behind with a party of men to prosecute the furtrade    chapter four  vicissitudes of the voyageindians met with etcetera  we have passed over the first three weeks of the voyage rapidly but it must not be supposed that therefore it was all plain sailing  on the contrary the travellers were delayed by thunderstorms and heavy rains and gales and impeded by ice which even in the middle of june lay thick on the waters in some parts  they were also tormented by hosts of mosquitoes and at times they found difficulty in procuring food despite the ability of our friends reuben swiftarrow and lawrence who were constituted hunters to the expedition  at other times however the supply of food was abundant and varied  on one occasion the hunters brought in seven geese a beaver and four ducks besides which a large supply of excellent trout and other fish was obtained from the nets and on another occasion they procured two swans ten beavers and a goose but sometimes they returned emptyhanded or with a single bird or so while the nets produced nothing at all  deer were also shot occasionally and they found immense numbers of wild cranberries strawberries rasps and other berries besides small spring onions so that upon the whole they fared well and days of abstinence were more than compensated by days of superabundance  one evening while they were coasting along this great lake some indians were discovered on the shore and the travellers landed to make inquiries of them as to the nature of the country beyond  there were three lodges belonging to the redknife indians who were so named because their knifes were made of the copper found in that region  to the leading man of these english chief being interpreter addressed himself  english chief we may remark in passing was one of the followers of the chief who conducted hearne on his expedition to the coppermine river since which event he had been a principal leader of his countrymen who were in the habit of carrying furs to the english furtraders at churchill on hudsons bay and was much attached to the interest of the hudson bay company which at that time was in opposition to the canadian or norwest company  these circumstances procured him the title of the english chief  an able active but selfsufficient and somewhat obstinate chief he was and caused mackenzie a good deal of anxiety and much trouble to keep him with the party  in answer to his queries the principal man of the redknife indians said that there were many more of his tribe a short distance off and that he would send a man to fetch them  he also said that the explorers should see no more of them at that time because the slave and beaver indians as well as others of the tribe were about to depart and would not be in that region again till the time when the swans cast their feathers  ask him said mackenzie if he and his friends have many furs to dispose of  to this the indian replied by at once producing upwards of eight large packs of good beaver and marten skins and added the information that his friends had plenty more  now then le roux said mackenzie turning to his clerk here you and i shall part  this seems a good spot and a good opportunity for opening up the trade with these indians  when the rest of them arrive we shall have a palaver and then you shall remain to look after them so open up your packs and get ready a few small presents without delay  that day was spent in considerable bustle and excitement the indians being overjoyed that the white traders had at last penetrated into their country and their joy being increased by the distribution of such trifling but muchprized gifts as glass beads knives small lookingglasses etcetera  it rained in torrents all the time but this did not damp their spirits and as for their bodiesthey were used to it  in the afternoon mackenzie assembled the whole tribe and made them the following speech which was translated by english chief in a very pompous manner for that excellent redskin was fully alive to the dignity of his position  my friends began our explorer i am glad to meet with you  the white man and the indians are always glad to meetthey can benefit each other mutually  each has got what the other requires  i have come for the purpose of opening up trade with you  it is true that i myself will take my departure tomorrow because i am in search of new lands but some of my people will remain on the spot and if you bring in a sufficient quantity of furs to make it answer my men will return to fort chipewyan for more goods and will spend the winter here  they will build a fort and continue to dwell among you as long as you shall be found to deserve it  at this point the speaker paused and the darkskinned audience gave vent to a loud ho which was equivalent to the british hear hear  in regard to my own work continued mackenzie i intend to search for and find the great river which it is said flows out of this lake and follow its current to the seaor as you call it the great salt lake  do my brothers know anything about this river  if so let them speak  hereupon an old chief with hair like small iron wire and a skin like shoeleather got up and delivered himself as follows  we are glad to hear what our white brother says  it encourages us to know that you will make a trading fort in our country for we have need of one  hitherto we have had to travel farvery farwith our furs or if to save trouble we intrusted our furs to the chipewyans they often pillaged us or at most gave us very little for the fruits of our toil  for a long time we have been so discouraged that we had no motive to pursue the beaver except to obtain a sufficiency of food and clothing  now if you come to us we shall be happywauch  the last word was equivalent to the expressionthere think o that the old man paused as if to give his audience time for reflection  as to the great river he continued sententiously we know of its existence but none of our tribe has ever followed its course down to the great salt lake  we earnestly advise our brother not to go there for it is a dreadful river  it is said that there are two impassable falls in its course and it is so long that old age will come upon you before the time of your return  you will also encounter monsters of horrid shapes and awful strength on the land and in the waterwauch  the old chief began to glare solemnly at this point and the whole tribe followed his example  it is said he continued that there are bears which eat the trees as if they were grass whose cubs even at their birth are strong enough to kill the stoutest man  there are monsters in the river so big that a canoe full of men would be but a mouthful to them  there are so few animals or fish fit for food that you will all certainly be starved and besides all this evil spirits dwell there whose chief delight lies in attacking killing roasting and devouring menwauch  here the indian sat down with the decision of a man who has given unanswerable arguments for the overturning of foolish plans nevertheless mackenzies plans remained unaltered  not so however those of a young indian who had been engaged to guide the explorers to the other end of the lake in order to save them from the loss of time which would be occasioned by the necessity of coasting round its numerous bays  the imagination of this youthcoppernose as lawrence guff facetiously styled himwas so wrought upon by the dreadful description of the great river that he manifested a strong desire to draw back but by the timely addition of a small kettle an axe a knife and a few beads to the gifts already bestowed on him he was eventually persuaded to venture  before departing poor coppernose took a ceremonious leave of his family  he cut off a lock of his hair and divided it into three parts one of these he fastened to the top of his wifes head and blew on it three times with the utmost violence at the same time uttering certain cabalistic words  the other two portions he fastened with the same formalities to the heads of his two children  even at the last he hesitated and was finally made to enter the canoe more by force than by persuasion  a few days later and our pioneers were fairly embarked on the great river whose course to the mouth it was their object to explore  the expedition was now somewhat reduced owing to monsieur le roux having been left behind  it consisted of three canoesthe large one with mackenzie and five men a small one with english chief and his two wives and coppernose and another small one containing reuben his son swiftarrow and darkeye  two of the canadians were also attended by their wives so that the party numbered sixteen souls five of whom were women  they all kept company as much as possible but english chief was frequently left behind by the large canoe while reuben and his friends being the hunters as we have said were necessarily absent for considerable periods in search of game  one evening as they were descending a beautiful sweep of the river under sail in grand style the english chiefleaning composedly back in his canoe while his right hand slightly moved the steering paddle and his teeth grasped his beloved pipesaid quietly to coppernose of course in the indian tongue  a pretty guide you are not to know something more about a river so near to your own wigwam  coppernose who was a humbleminded man smiled slightly and shook his head as he said  all red men are not so adventurous as the english chief  i never had occasion to travel in this direction and do not know the way  boo ejaculated english chief meaning no doubt fiddlededee  but i know of a river continued coppernose which falls into this one from the north and comes from the horn mountain that we passed at the end of great slave lake it is the country of the beaver indians my relations meet me frequently on that river  there are great plains on both sides of that river which abound in buffaloes and moosedeer  i dont believe itwauch said english chief  as this was a discouraging reception of his remarks coppernose relapsed into silence  soon afterwards the large canoe was observed to make for a low grassy point and as it was about the usual camping time english chief made for the same place  the hunters reached it about ten minutes later and bore into camp two reindeer four geese and a swan besides a large quantity of berries gathered by the fair or brown hands of darkeye  there is plenty of game everywhere said reuben in answer to a query from his leader we might have killed much more if wed had more time but enough is as good as a feast as the sayin goes in my country  in your country said mackenzie with a smile  ay i claim to be a scotchmanthough i was born and raised in canada my father hailed from the land o cakes  does lawrence claim the same nationality on the same ground reuben  he does not answered lawrence for himself while busy cleaning his fathers gun  the lad loves the canadians replied reuben with a chuckle besides he couldnt claim it on the same ground seein that i am fully half a scot while he is at least threequarters a canadian  more the better luck for him said one of the canadians who had already kindled a fire before which one of his comrades was busily engaged setting up juicy venison steaks to roast  oui observed another vraiment canada beats scottish land altogeder  ha  faderland ees more best den all ze vorld said the german quaffing a can of water with as much zest as if it had been his own native rhine wine  i warrant me said mackenzie with a laugh that our trusty guide coppernose would not give the wilderness here for canada scotland and faderland put together  what say you lad  coppernose looked gravely at his questioner but made no reply  boo said english chief regarding his countryman with a look of contempt hims no onerstan eengleesh  he understands how to eat a rumpsteak of venison however said mackenzie with a laugh as coppernose at that moment coolly appropriated a mass of halfroasted meat and began to devour it youd better follow his example lads  the men were not slow to take this advice  in a short time all were more or less busily engaged with venison steaks marrowbones goose drumsticks and fish and comparative silence prevailed while the cravings of nature were being appeased  after supper pipes were lighted and conversation became animated for some time but they were all too much fatigued to prolong this period interesting though it was one after another they spread their blankets under a convenient bush or tree and ere long the whole party was in the land of nod    chapter five  describes a literal wildgoose chase and other matters  time sped on its proverbially rapid wing the summer advanced and still mackenzie and his men continued to descend the mighty river of the far north encountering dangers and vicissitudes enough undoubtedly but happily escaping those terrified monsters of the forest and the flood which had been described by the copper indians of great slave lake and the thought of which caused poor coppernose himself to grow terrified and desperate by turns  fain would that unhappy son of the forest have bid the party farewell and returned to his own wigwam alone but this might not be for his services were of some importance and the leader of the expedition kept on him constantly an eye which excelled in intense watchfulness the glare of the fiercest of those creatures which filled his imagination  he submitted therefore with the best grace he could assume but what between being watched by mackenzie haunted by ghosts and bullied by english chief poor coppernose had a sad time of it  he possessed however a naturally elastic and jovial spirit which tended greatly to ameliorate his condition and as time passed by without any serious mishap or the appearance of any unusually dreadful creature he became gradually reconciled to his position  one dayperhaps we should rather say one night for it was approaching midnight although the sun was still above the horizon owing to the high northern latitude to which they had attained rendering the whole twentyfour hours round a continuous dayone day or night as the canoes were sweeping down a reach of the broad river they saw a few wreaths of smoke rising above the treetops  the spot was very beautiful being thickly wooded and backed by high land on the slopes of which the trees and bushes hung like delicate fringes of green among masses of silvery grey rock  that looks like the smoke of an indian wigwam louis said mackenzie to his bowman  no monsieur it is the wood burning replied louis dipping his vermilionpainted paddle with great vigour  louis was right for soon afterwards they turned a point which disclosed to their view a considerable tract of woodland which had been recently destroyed by fire  several tracts of this kind had been already passed some of which had been consumed long before and forests of young poplars had grown up in their placesa curious circumstance this which mackenzie remarks on namely that wherever land covered with spruce pine and white birch had been laid waste with fire there poplars and nothing else were found to grow even though none of that species of tree had existed there before  passing this desolated tract they came to a part of the river which was studded with several islands on one of which reindeer were seen  theres your chance said mackenzie to his hunters who happened to range up alongside in their small canoe at that moment  weve seed em monsieur said reuben but we must have some more ammunition afore startin after them for the powderhorns of lawrence and swiftarrow are both empty  as soon as the horns were replenished reuben and his friends pushed out into the stream and made for the island  the other canoes continued to advance  they seldom waited for the hunters for the latter being comparatively light could act as a sort of flying artillery falling behind turning aside or pushing ahead as the case might require in pursuit of game and almost always returning to the main body about the camping hour or soon after it  on this evening however the canoes reached a snug campingground before the usual time they therefore determined to stop there and set the nets as well as to overhaul the canoes which stood much in need of repair  the cold of the iceladen waters through which they had recently passed had cracked the gum off the seams and collisions with the ice itself had made some ugly slits in the birchbark of which the canoes were made  that evening the nets which were set in four fathoms water produced an abundant supply of carp whitefish and trout  now lads said mackenzie when the canoe brought ashore the welcome provisions set the women to work to make pemmican for we must leave a supply concealed here against our return  louis blanc superintended the making of this pemmican which consisted of fish dried in the sun and pounded between two stones  pemmican is also made of meat in which case the pounded meat is put into a bag made of the raw hide of the animal the bag is then filled with melted fat and the mouth sewed up with raw sinews  this style of pemmican will keep fresh for years  where did english chief go when we landed asked mackenzie  dont know monsieur replied louis  after game probably observed the leader as he sat down on the stump of a fallen tree and began to make notes in his journal  some time thereafter reubens canoe returned laden with two deer besides two swans a number of ducks and hares and several brace of ptarmigan which latter were quite grey at that season with the exception of one or two pure white feathers in the tail  they said that wildfowl were innumerable among the islands but this indeed was obvious to all for everywhere their plaintive and peculiar cries and the whirring or flapping of their wings were heard even when the leafy screen over the encampment hid themselves from view  darkeye also contributed her share to the general supplies in the shape of several large birchbaskets full of gooseberries cranberries juniperberries rasps and other wild berries which she said grew luxuriantly in many places  meanwhile the night as regards time advanced although the daylight did not disappear or even much diminish but english chief with coppernose and his two squaws did not return and their prolonged absence became at length a cause of no little anxiety to the leader of the expedition  the fact was that english chief was fond of a little fun and despite the dignified position which he held and the maturity of his years he could not resist availing himself of any little chance that came in his way of having what is more pithily than elegantly styled a spree  it happened to be the particular period at which the wildfowl of those regions begin to cast their feathers  knowing this english chief quietly slipped off with his canoe when mackenzie landed and soon found a colony of swans afflicted with that humiliating lack of natural clothing which is the cause doubtless of their periodically betaking themselves to the uttermost ends of the earth in order to hide in deep solitude their poverty and there renew their garments  judge then reader if you can the consternation with which these once graceful creatures discovered that their retreat had been found out by that inquisitive biped manthat they were actually caught in the act of moulting  uttering a terrific hoozoo or some such equally wild redindian hunting cry english chief dashed his paddle into the water squaws and comrade followed suit the canoe shot in among the rushes and the whole party leaped on shore  thus taken by surprise the swans bounced up extended their miserable wings uttered a trumpetblast of alarm and sought to fly  of course they failed but although they could not fly they fled on the wings of terror and with straight necks heads low legs doing double duty and remnants of wings doing what they could they made for the interior of the island at a pace which at first defied pursuit  the higher part of the island was level and open with here and there a few stunted bushes  arrived here the trumpeting crew scattered like wise troops when pursued  english chief set his heart and eyes on a particularly large bird and dashed after it with upraised paddle  the swan made a desperate detour apparently bent on gaining the water it ran round a bush and was almost caught in the arms of the younger squaw who leaving her senior in the canoe had joined in the pursuit  a shriek from the squaw sent it off at a tangent to the left pinions aloft and terror depicted on its visage  english chief also doubled but a crooked stump caught his foot and sent him headlong into the bush  at that instant coppernose having foiled a swan with a welldirected sweep of his paddle came up and gave chase  english chief nettled at the interference sprung up followed and overtook him just as the hardpushed swan turned at bay  both men came upon it at the same moment stumbled over it and turned their wrath upon each other  the swan recovering ran wildly and blindly back towards the young squaw who was so much alarmed by its look that she fairly turned and fled but hearing the shouts of the indians as they struggled she turned towards them  meanwhile the elder squaw having landed met the retreating swan just as it gained the rushes  stooping down she allowed it to approach to within a yard of herlike a true heroineand then rising hit it a neat blow on the back of the head and laid it low for ever  after this she joined her sisterwife if we may be allowed the expression in trying to tear the indians asunder  this was accomplished after a few seconds but the two men still glared at each other  fortunately they could do little more having left their knives in the canoe  while they were still in a state of indecision an unfortunate swan which had taken refuge behind a bush so far recovered its breath as to think it advisable to get still further away from such company  it was observed and followed as wildly as before by english chief  this time coppernose had the sense to confine his attentions to another part of the field where while prosecuting the chase he suddenly came upon a flock of geese in the same helpless circumstances as the swans  soon the swans were routed out of their places of concealment and the cries of men women and birds again resounded in the air  the way in which those swans behaved was quite marvellous they dodged the blows aimed at them and jinked round the bushes as if they had been trained to such work in a regular public school for human bipeds and they struck out with their pinions too so deftly and with such force that the pursuers had to become extremely cautious as well as bold in their approaches  at last when the indians were thoroughly exhausted they gave up the chase  on conveying the fruits of their exertions to the canoe they found that they had killed five swans and a like number of geese  with these they returned in triumph to camp to the great relief of mackenzie who had began to fear either that an accident had befallen them or that they had deserted him  at this place two bags of pemmican were concealed on an island and here one of their leads was lost in taking soundings  the current of the river also was so violent that mackenzie concluded they must be approaching the rapids of which some of the natives had made mention the strength of the current may be estimated from the fact that when the lead just referred to caught on the bottom and held on they attempted to clear it by paddling up stream yet although they had eight paddles and were held by the line the strength of which was equal to four paddles they were borne down with such force that the line snapped asunder  here the weather became very bad  they had frequent thunderstorms accompanied with violent rain and although it was at that time the beginning of july ice lay in great quantities all along the banks of the river  on shore the earth was thawed only to a depth of about fourteen inches  indeed the soil of those regions never thaws completely  at the hottest season of the year if you were to dig down a few feet you would come to a subsoil which is locked in the embrace of perpetual frost  some signs of natives were discovered here and from the appearance of the cut trees it was evident that they possessed no iron tools  push forward was mackenzies watchword more perhaps than it had been of any previous discoverer in ruperts land  the indians began ere long to complain bitterly of his perseverance  they were not accustomed to such constant and severe exertion and it was with great difficulty that he prevailed on them to continue the voyage  as they advanced fresh signs of natives were observed and at last one evening they came in sight of an encampment of them  it was at a place where the current of the great river was so strong that it was in actual ebullition and produced a hissing noise like a kettle of water in a moderate boiling state  the region was mountainous and just before them they perceived a high ridge covered with snow  theyre evidently not much used to visitors said mackenzie on observing that the natives were running about in great confusion some making for the woods and others hurrying to the canoes  they is used to be tacked by inimis said english chief who was rather proud of his knowledge of the english language  hail them in the chipewyan tongue said mackenzie as the canoes touched the beach  english chief and the hunters landed first and addressed the few natives who had ventured to remain but they were so terrified as to be unable to reply  seeing this mackenzie quietly landed and gave orders for the pitching of the tents  while this was being done the natives grew calm they found that they understood chipewyan a few words relieved them of their apprehensions and soon they not only came down to the tents but were so gratified with their reception that they sent for those members of their tribe who had fled thus friendly relations were established  there were five families consisting of about thirty persons of two different tribesthe slave and the dogrib indians    chapter six  indians met with and the mouth of the great river reached  heroes are not perfect  we deem it necessary to make this observation because many modern biographers seem to imagine that their heroes are perfect and even attempt to prove them to be so  we therefore feel it necessary to disclaim any such imagination or intention in regard to our hero  alexander mackenzie was indeed a hero and a very fine specimen of a manmentally as well as physicallyif we are to credit the report of those who knew him best but he was not perfect  for instance he evidently acted sometimes on the fallacious notion that whatever gave pleasure to himself must necessarily give pleasure to all other men  acting on this idea in the present instance he sought to delight the hearts of these slave and dogrib indians by presenting them with pipes and tobacco and inducing them to smoke  to the credit of humanity be it recorded that they received the gift with marked dislike although they were too polite to absolutely refuse it  slaves though one section of them were in name they were not slaves to tobacco and the other section being dogribs had we presume too little of adams rib in them to find pleasure in smoke  of course they knew something about smoke but it was chiefly as a nuisance which was very troublesome to the eyes and which usually issued from the tops of their wigwamsnot from human lips  it must also be recorded that those estimable savages entertained a strong antipathy to grog when it was produced  their hearts were reached however and their souls gladdened when knives beads awls firesteels flints and hatchets were presented to them and we can fancy how animated and earnest would be their converse over the wigwam fires for weeks and months if not for years afterwards when they brought out for the thousandth time and feasted their wondering eyes on those delightfully useful implements which had been left by the mysterious white beings who had dropped upon them so suddenly as if from the skies and whom they felt half inclined at first to reverence as gods  having won their confidence and esteem mackenzie proceeded to question them as to that portion of the great river which yet lay before him their account was an exaggerated echo of that previously obtained from the indians of great slave lake  being therefore of little or no value our hero was obliged to advance and solve the question for himself  as before the effect of the indian stories on the indians of his party was very marked and discouraging  with great difficulty mackenzie overcame their objections to proceed and even succeeded in persuading one of the dogrib indians to accompany him by the potent influence of a small kettle an axe a knife and a few other gifts this man was a stout young fellow in a very dirty deerskin coat and leggings with a double blue line tattooed on his cheeks from the ears to the nose on the bridge of which it met in a blue spot  hence lawrence following the natural bent of his mind which he had already displayed in naming coppernose immediately addressed this new recruit as bluenose  these poor savages although exemplary in the matters of grog and tobacco were we are constrained to admit a very filthy set of creatures very poor also because utterly destitute of such wealth as the furtraders had carried to many of the less remote tribes of indians  nevertheless they possessed a considerable number of implements of their own manufacture some of wood and others of bone etcetera which proved them to be possessed of much ingenuity and taste the description of their weapons reminds one of those remains of prehistoric man which we find treasured in our museums for they had arrows barbed with horn flint iron and copper spears shod with bone daggers of horn and bone and axes made of brown or grey stone  the latter were from six to eight inches long and two thick having the inside flat and the outside round and tapering to an edge and were fastened by the middle to wooden handles with a cord of raw skin  they kindled fires by striking together a piece of white or yellow pyrites and a flint stone over a piece of touchwood and boiled water in watertight baskets by putting a succession of redhot stones into them  from these indians the explorers learned that they had passed on their voyage down the river large bodies of indians who inhabit the mountains  hell never make up his mind to go observed reuben as when about to set forth again he looked at the pale countenance of the dogrib who had agreed to join the party  mackenzie had already had a severe argument with him in order to induce him to fulfil his engagement and had left him under the impression that he had been successful but when the poor man had said farewell to the tribe and was on the point of entering the canoe his courage failed and he drew back  seeing this lawrence suddenly seized him by the nape of the neck and exclaiming come look sharp bluenose get in with ee gave him a lift that put the matter at rest by sending him sprawling on board  next moment they were off and shooting down the rapid current of the river  that night they encamped amid heavy squalls of wind and rain at the foot of a rocky hill on the top of which their new guide said that it blew a gale every day of the year  here the dogrib became very unhappy and pretended to be ill but a strict watch was kept on him so that he could not escape  the country around them was very wild and rugged and they were informed by their guide that great numbers of bears and small white buffaloes muskoxen frequented the mountains also some tribes of indians  here some of the party attempted to ascend a steep hill but were almost suffocated and fairly driven back by clouds of mosquitoes  natives were sometimes seen and spoken with although their first impulse on beholding the voyagers was almost invariably to flee  on one occasion a whole tribe fled save one old man who came boldly forward and said that he was too old to run or to care much about the short time that yet remained to him of this life  at the same time he pulled out his grey hair by handfuls and distributed them among the party imploring their favour for himself and his relations  his mind was quickly relieved by swiftarrow who seemed to have a special desire as well as talent for comforting aged persons of both sexes  some of these tribes were named the hare indianshares and fish being their principal means of support  while spending a night with these people a storm of thunder and rain came on in the midst of which the dogrib bluenose managed to make his escape  as it was important to have a guide mackenzie compelled a hare indian to fill his place and after carrying him off took great pains to conciliate himin which efforts he was happily successful  next day they observed natives on the east shore of the river and directed their course towards them  their new guide began to call to them in an incomprehensible manner and said that the natives did not belong to his tribe but were a very wicked people who would beat them cruelly and pull out their hair and maltreat them in various ways despite this warning mackenzie advanced and soon found them to be quite as willing to accept of gifts as other tribes  he found that they understood their guide and that english chief clearly comprehended one of themselves although he could not make himself understood  here the joyful information was obtained that in three days more they should meet with the esquimaux and in ten days at furthest reach the great salt lakeor the sea  these natives were very superior to those whom the travellers had last met with and one of them was engaged to take the place of bluenose this man who was clad in a shirt made of the skins of the muskrat after which he was named was a very lively individual  he sang the songs not only of his own tribe but also those of the esquimaux with whom his tribe had been formerly at war but were now at peace  he also undertook to perform an esquimaux dance in mackenzies canoe and would infallibly have upset that conveyance had he not been violently restrained  he commented on the tribe to which bluenose belonged with great contempt calling them by the strong names of cowards and liars  during these brief visits to the natives our discoverer was not only troubled by the thievish propensities of the natives but had to guard against the same tendencies in his own men some of whom were much confused as to the true course of rectitude in regard to mine and thine in addition to which he had to contend with a general propensity on the part of his men to quarrel not only with each other but with the weather the journey and the decrees of fate generally  by a judicious mixture however of firmness and suavity severity and kindness he managed to keep the several parts of his discordant band together and in so doing proved himself an able general for the highest generalship consists in making the most of existing circumstances and materials  the river here ran through various channels formed by islands some of which were without a tree while others were covered with spruce fir and other trees  the banks which were about six feet above the surface of the river displayed a face of solid ice intermixed with veins of black earth and as the heat of the sun melted the ice the trees frequently fell into the river  the variety of channels in the river rendered it difficult to decide which should be followed  muskrat the new guide recommended that which ran to the east but his leader not feeling sure of his wisdom or knowledge preferred the middle channel  here mackenzie put ashore and proceeded to engage in some cabalistic pursuits which utterly confounded muskrat  what is he doing asked the savage of english chief  taking the sun replied the interpreter with immense pomposity  what does that mean asked the savage  english chief tried to explain but failed for this good reasonthat he himself was totally ignorant of the subject beyond the phrase which he had picked up after the manner of a parrot  it was found that the latitude was 67 degrees 47 minutes north  this was further north than mackenzie had expected to make it but the difference was owing to the variation of the compass  from this it became evident that the river emptied itself into the polar sea  not satisfied however with the apparent certainty of this our pioneer resolved to have ocular demonstrationto push on to the mouth of the river even although by so doing he should risk not being able to return to fort chipewyan for want of provisions  but now his men became so much discouraged that they did their utmost to induce him to turn back and he felt convinced that if they had had it in their power some of them would have left him to his fate  as columbus did of old in somewhat similar circumstances he assured them that he would now advance only a specified number of daysseven adding that if he did not then reach the sea he would return  indeed the low state of their provisions alone formed a sufficient security for the maintenance of his engagement  that evening the 11th july they pitched their tents near to a spot where there had been three encampments of the esquimaux and here mackenzie sat up all night to observe the sun being now in that realm of bright unchanging day which in winter becomes a region of continuous night  at halfpast twelve he called up reuben guff and his son and swiftarrow who were the most intelligent members of his party to view a spectacle which they had never before seen  they thought on observing the sun so high that it was the signal to embark and were about to rouse their comrades when mackenzie checked them and it was with difficulty he persuaded them that the sun had not descended nearer to the horizon and that it was then but a short time past midnight  it is but justice to reuben and his party to say that they offered no opposition to their leader during the whole voyage  in regard to this one speech made by reuben will suffice to describe the spirit that animated him  it dont do lawrence said he to go for to interfere wi them as leads  be they wise or be they foolish it ony makes matters wus to interfere wi leaders my lad therefore its best always to hold your tongue an do yer dooty  what monsieur mackenzie is it aint for the likes of you and me to pretend for to judge  he seems to me an able brave and wise man so my colours is nailed to the mast dye seeas was said by the immortal lord nelsonan ive made up my mind to follow him to the end through thick and thin  its little right i would have to claim to be a pioneer if i didnt hold them sentiments  them sentiments we need scarcely add were heartily echoed by his indian friend and his son  the appearance of deserted native encampments still further confirmed mackenzie in his belief that he had at length reached the land of the esquimaux  round their fireplaces were found scattered pieces of whalebone and spots were observed where trainoil had been spilt  the deserted huts also corresponded in construction with those which were known to be built elsewhere by the denizens of the far north  several runners of sledges were also found and the skulls of a large animal which was conjectured to be the walrus  here the land was covered with short grass and flowers though the earth was not thawed above four inches from the surface beneath that all was frozen hard  the pioneers had now at last reached the entrance of what appeared to be a lake which was in the neighbourhood of the polar sea if not that sea itself but the variety of channels the strength of currents the shallowness of the water and quantity of ice with which it was beset with the ignorance of their guide rendered it impossible to make any further advance that season  the object of the expedition however had been accomplished  the largest northern river of america estimated at 2000 miles in length had been traced from its source to its outlet in the polar sea the nature of the country and its inhabitants had been ascertained coal and copper ore had been discovered the region had been wrenched from the realms of terra incognita and the energetic pioneer fixed the position of his most northerly discoveries in 69 degrees 7 minutes north latitude  another fact which proved that they were within the influence of the sea was the rise and fall of the water which could be nothing else than the tide  they caught a fish also resembling a herring which none of the party had ever seen except english chief who declared it to be of a kind that abounds in hudsons bay and finally they beheld what settled the question a shoal of white whales which their indian guide said was the principal food of the esquimaux  it was no wonder that the discoverers found the navigation very intricate because that great river now named the mackenzie is known to empty its waters into the polar sea by innumerable mouths which form a delta of about forty miles in width  storms rain and fogs threw additional hindrances in their way  there was therefore nothing left for it but to erect a post and take possession of the land in the name of the king  homeward after that was the order of the day  but what a mighty distance off that home was  and after all when reached it was but a loghut or two in a part of the vast wilderness which regarded from a civilisedland point of view was itself the very confines of the known world  our space forbids us to follow mackenzie and his men on their arduous and interesting return voyage  suffice it to say that they dragged the canoes by means of lines against the strong current for a large portion of the way and after incurring innumerable dangers from natives rapids storms and starvation they reached the lake of the hills and landed at fort chipewyan on the 12th of september 1789 having been absent for the long period of one hundred and two days  that our hero was not content to rest upon the laurels thus gathered in the far north but longed to act the part of pioneer over the rocky mountains into the far west shall be made plain in our next chapter    chapter seven  a voyage of discovery to the far west planned and begun  three years passed away during which period mackenzie being busily occupied with his arduous duties as a furtrader could not carry out the more noble purposes of discovery on which his heart was set  but a time at length arrived when circumstances permitted him to turn his eyes once more with a set purpose on the unknown wilderness of the west seated one fine morning about the beginning of spring in his wooden residence at fort chipewyan he observed reuben guff passing the window with an axe on his shoulder that worthy with his son and swiftarrow having engaged in the service of the furtraders at the end of the late expedition  opening the door mackenzie called him in  where are you bound for just now reuben  to dinner monsieur  reuben said mackenzie with a peculiar look has all your pioneering enthusiasm oozed out at your finger ends  no monsieur replied the man with a slight smile but lawrence and i have bin thinkin of late that as monsieur mackenzie seems to have lost heart we must undertake a vyage o diskivery on our own account  good  then you are both ready doubtless to begin your discoveries with a canoe journey of some extent on short notice  at once monsieur if it please you  nay reuben not quite so fast as that said mackenzie with a laugh you may have your dinner first  but tomorrow you shall become a genuine pioneer by preceding me towards the far west  you know the position of our most distant settlements on the peace river  perfectly said reuben whose eye kindled as he began to see that his master was in earnest  well i intend to visit these settlements this fall and push on towards the rocky mountains  it will take me to the end of the season to accomplish this so that our real voyage of discovery will not begin until the following spring  now there is a certain locality beyond our most distant outpost which i shall describe to you afterwards where i intend to build a fort and spend next winter so as to be on the spot ready to begin the moment the ice breaks up  preparations must be made there for the building of the fort  timber must be felled cut and squared for the houses and palisades and two able and willing as well as experienced men must go there to begin this work without delay  it occurs to me that the two best men i have for such work are reuben guff and his son  are they prepared for this duty think you  say the word monsieur was reubens laconic but significant reply  well then it is said  come back here after dinner with lawrence and i will give you instructions you shall start tomorrow at daybreak  reuben bowed and left the hall with a light step  next day he and his son started on their journey in a small birchbark canoe on the 10th of october mackenzie followed in a canoe of larger dimensions  he visited several establishments of the district of which he had charge ascended the peace river towards its unknown sources gave good advice to the several bands of indians whom he met with by the way and generally strengthened the hearts and hands of his agents  passing the last outpost on the river he pushed on until finally he reached his intended winterquarters on the 1st of novembernot a day too soon for the river was already being covered with its winter coat of ice  here he found reuben and lawrence bronzed and hardened with toil and exposure  they had done good service during the previous summer for all the timber was prepared a space marked out for the fort and a deep trench dug for the palisades  here also were found a band of natives amounting to about seventy men anxiously awaiting the arrival of the chief as they styled mackenzie and thirsting especially for tobacco and rum both of whichunlike the natives of the far norththey were particularly fond of  to build a fort in a few weeks consisting of a dwellinghouse and several stores with palisades eighteen feet high in the midst of frost so intense that their axes sometimes became as brittle as glass and living in tents the while exposed to the storms of wind and snow peculiar to a hyperborean clime was a feat which if detailed would fill a volume  we are constrained to dismiss the subject in a line thus curtly also must we treat the winter  yet some points we cannot forbear to touch on illustrative as they are of some curious experiences of the furtraders  the indians there were unusually ignorant of medical science and when ill applied to mackenzie believing with childlike simplicity that he certainly knew everything and could do anything  one woman came to him with a swelled breast which her friends had lacerated with flints in order to cure it this failing they had blown on it but with similar want of success  mackenzie knew not what to do but bringing common sense to bear on the case he made the poor creature keep it clean she was naturally dirty poulticed it several times and anointed it with healing salve  in a short time a perfect cure was effected  after that an indian while at work in the woods was attacked with a sudden pain near the first joint of his thumb which disabled him  he appealed to mackenzie who to his surprise found a narrow red inflamed stripe about an inch wide extending from the mans thumb to his shoulder  the pain was very violent and accompanied with chilliness and shivering  mackenzie admits that the case was quite beyond his skill but as it was necessary to relieve the indians mind he attempted a cure  he prepared a kind of volatile liniment of rum and soap with which he ordered the arm to be rubbed  the success of this treatment was doubtful because at first it drove the man mad and the red stripe not only increased but extended in the form of several blotches on the body and was accompanied by pains in the stomach seeing this our amateur doctor fell back on the old plan of bleeding an operation which he had never before performed  the result was marvellous  the following night the man was much better and ere long was restored to his former health and filled with gratitude  again on another occasion a young indians gun burst and maimed his hand so that the thumb hung by a mere strip of flesh  when he came to the fort his wound was in a very offensive state  his friends had done their best for him but as their panacea for everything consisted in singing or howling and blowing on the affected part he was not perceptibly the better for their exertions  the youths life being in danger mackenzie once more tried his skill  he applied to it a poultice of bark stripped from the roots of the spruce fir having first washed the wound with the juice of the bark  this proved to be a very painful dressing but it cleaned the wound effectually  he then cut off the pendent thumb and applied a dressing of salve composed of canadian balsam wax and tallow dropped from a burning candle into the water as before the treatment was successful insomuch that the young redskin was soon in the huntingfield again and brought an elks tongue as a fee to his benefactor  during the winter he was visited by a few rocky mountain indians who gave him some important information namely that the peace river in the mountain districts was interrupted by numerous bad rapids and falls and that towards the midday sun there was another great river whose current ran in an opposite direction the distance between the sources of the two rivers being short  the winter with its dreary storms and bitter colds at length passed away and genial spring returned  as soon as the ice broke up preparations were made for an immediate start  their large birchbark canoe had been overhauled and repaired  her dimensions were twentyfive feet long inside two feet two inches deep and four feet nine inches wide  she carried goods for presents provisions arms ammunition baggage etcetera to the extent of three thousand pounds weight with a crew of ten men including their chief yet she was so light that two men could carry her when empty for three or four miles without resting they had no small canoe on this voyage  their hopes and it may be truly said their lives were dependent on this solitary and frail conveyance  as we have said mackenzie took nine men with him on this occasion our friends reuben lawrence and swiftarrow being among the number and two of them being young indian hunters of that region who were supposed to be acquainted with at least part of the route they were about to pursue and who were to act as interpreters  english chief had long before left his former master and no women were allowed to go with the partyeven darkeye was left behind  there was one other member of the party whom we must not omit to mentionnamely a large dog named wolf  on the 9th of may 1793 mackenzie left the fort in charge of his interpreter pushed off into the waters of the peace river turned the canoes bow westward and the voyage of discovery began  a few days afterwards they passed through scenery which all confessed was the most beautiful they had ever beheld  tis like a glimpse o paradise exclaimed reuben as the whole party rested on their paddles for a few minutes to gaze upon it  ho exclaimed swiftarrow with a nod to his friend which evidently was meant for assent  betterer nor the hudson said ducette one of the canadians with a look of admiration  does it beat scottisland monsieur asked lawrence with a somewhat sly expression  well ahem replied mackenzie with hesitation its not exactlythat is it is vastly different and truly magnificentthey wont compare lawrence they wont compare  the region did indeed merit all that could be said in its praise  the ground on the west side of the riverwhich was wide and full of lovely wooded isletsrose at intervals to a considerable height and stretched inwards to a great distance at the foot of every slope there was a soft grassy lawn broken here and there by abrupt precipices which were fringed with exuberant verdure  shrubs and trees of every kind in clumps and in groves crested the heights or nestled in the hollows among them were groves of poplar with the white spruce and soft birch and other trees while the banks abounded with alders and willows those that bore blossom were just opening their bright buds and the setting sun cast a rich golden light over all as though the glory of the beneficent creator were shining on his gorgeous handiwork  but that beautiful wilderness did not blossom and bloom in solitude  it was tenanted and enjoyed by countless numbers of living creatures  wherever the travellers turned their eyes vast herds of elk and buffaloes were to be seen the latter sporting with their young ones on the plains the former preferring to browse on the slopes and uplands and innumerable birds of all shapes and sizes enlivened the scene with their varied gyrations and filled the air with melody  it seemed indeed a species of paradise but not far from it the travellers were painfully reminded of its terrestrial nature by the sight of a widespread conflagration which carried fierce destruction over the whole plain and left black ruin behind and still further on mackenzie was robbed of the pleasurable feelings due to the influence of sweet scenery by the baleful influence of man in the shape of a chief of the beaver indians with a huntingparty  he tried to push on past these indians but they kept up with the canoe running along shore and when night approached he was compelled to encamp with them  the consequence was as he had feared that these people attempted to terrify his young indian interpreters with dreadful accounts of the land beyond and succeeded so far that it was with the utmost difficulty that they could be persuaded to remain with the expedition  next night they encamped at a spot where a stream fell into the peace river from the north  voila wat is dis exclaimed ducette as he leaped on shore  the futprint of a grizzly bar said reuben stooping to examine and measure the mark an oncommon big un toofull nine inches wide  i wouldnt like to embrace that bar  the den or place where this monster or some of its kindred had spent the winter was also found not faroff  it was ten feet deep horizontally five feet high and six feet wide  i wish we could find him said lawrence as he kindled the campfire  ha  swiftarrow has found something better said mackenzie as the indian strode into camp laden with the tongue marrowbones and other choice portions of an elk which he had killed a short distance down the river  lawrence had his wish next day for they found a grizzly bear so fiercelooking and large that it was well for him he was in the canoe struggling with rapids at the time for he was reckless enough to have attacked it singlehandeda very dangerous proceeding and a thing that the indians never do  they appear to think that at least three men are necessary to the destruction of this much and justly feared monster of the mountains  lawrence looked at bruin with a feeling of bloodthirsty desire bruin looked at lawrence with an expression of stupid curiosity and then slowly not to say sulkily retired into his native forest  next day they beheld a more gratifying sightnamely the snowcapped rocky mountains themselves within the rugged portals of which their canoe passed not long afterwards  here as was to be expected the river became narrower and more turbulent and ere long the explorers had to face dangers and difficulties which tested their courage and endurance to the uttermost    chapter eight  difficulties and dangers faced and overcome  their entrance on the difficult navigation of the mountains was inaugurated by an accident to the canoe  it was a slight one howevera rub against a rock which cracked the bark and compelled them to land and spend an hour or so in mending it  the current here was very strong and creeping up along the banks was dangerous owing to the masses of rock that frequently fell from the cliffs  at one turn of the river in particular a loud noise was heard look out cried mackenzie  before any one could well understand what danger threatened them an enormous mass of rock was seen to bound down the banks right abreast of them crashing through trees and bushes and sending down showers of smaller stones  the men paddled with all their might but the rock came straight at them struck a flat piece of the cliff and bursting like a bombshell descended round them in a shower of small pieces none of which however touched them although many fell very near  coming one afternoon to a place where the current was stronger than usual mackenzie landed with reuben lawrence and ducette in order to lighten the canoe  they ascended the hills which were covered with cypress and but little encumbered with underwood  here they found a beaten path made either by indians or wild animals  after walking a mile along it they fell in with a herd of buffaloes with their young ones  hist whispered reuben throwing forward the muzzle of his gun with the instinct of a hunter  dont fire said mackenzie arresting his arm it may alarm the natives if any should chance to be within earshot  send wolf at them ducette  wolf who belonged to ducette and had followed his master was a splendid fellownot unlike the animal after which he had been named he was well trained too and kept foot and tongue equally under command until his masters wishes were made known  hearing his name mentioned he cocked his ears and gazed up in ducettes face  allons donc wolf said ducette  instantly the dog made a magnificent rush into the midst of the herd which scattered right and left and seized a young calf by the nose the creature though young was powerful and for some time struggled bravely but the hound held on with deadly firmness and worried the calfto such an extent that in a short time ducette was able to run in and despatch it  to skin and dismember the carcase was a matter of little difficulty to these hunters who were all expert butchers  they had just completed the work and were congratulating each other on this accession of veal to the larder when a shot was heard in the direction of the canoe  it was immediately followed by another  the signal to recall us said mackenzie  gather up the meat lads come be smart  give them a couple of shots reuben in reply  the shots were fired and pushing down the hill through very close underwood they soon came upon the canoe at the foot of a rapid which it was deemed impossible to ascend  what seemed impossible to some of his men however was by no means impossible to mackenzie himself  he surveyed their position saw that the succession of rapids above were indeed impracticable on that side of the river but observed that on the other side it seemed possible to continue the ascent  the chief danger lay in attempting to cross with a heavilyladen canoe but the attempt was made and proved successful  the dangers and mishaps which now assailed them in succession were enough to have damped the ardour of the most resolute pioneer but there are some natures which cannot be quelled whose motto in all circumstances seem to be victory or death  of such a spirit was alexander mackenzie although some of his men would fain have turned back  indeed the overcoming of their objection to proceed sometimes cost him more trouble than overcoming the difficulties of the navigation  on reaching the other side of the river they towed the canoe along an island and advanced well enough till they reached the extremity of it when the line had to be exchanged for the paddles  in attempting to clear the point of the island they were driven with great violence on a stony shore and the frail canoe received considerable injury  to land and unload was the work of a few minutes but it took a long time to repair the damage by fitting in new pieces of bark and regumming the exposed seams  part of the cargo also had to be opened and dried this accomplished they carried the whole across the point which had damaged them reloaded and embarked  but it was now seen that it was not possible to advance farther up that side of the river either by paddling hauling with the line or pushing with poles  there remained only the alternative therefore of returning by the way they had come or recrossing the river despite the strength of the current and the fact that there were several cascades just below them to get into which would have involved canoe and men in certain destruction  ve can nevair do it  monsieur dare not whispered ducette to reuben as they floated for a few moments in an eddy  reuben glanced at his leader who stood up in the canoe surveying the boiling rapids with a stern intent gaze and said quietly hell try  now my lads shove out with a willho said mackenzie sitting down  lawrence who was steering dipped his paddle vigorously the men followed suit the canoe shot into the stream and in a moment gained the sheltering eddy below an island which was shaped somewhat like a table with a thick centre legor a mushroom  there were several such islands of solid rock in the river  they had been formed apparently by the action of the currentdoubtless also of icecutting away their lower part and leaving the mushroomlike tops on which numbers of geese found a convenient breedingplace  from one to another of these islands the canoe shot in this way thus decreasing the width of the final traverse  they paused a little longer at the last island then shot into the stream and with a splendid sweep gained the other side  but here their case was little improved for the current was almost as violent as that from which they had escaped  the craggy banks being low enough however to admit of the trackingline being used the men landed and towed the canoe till they came to the foot of the most rapid cascade they had yet seen  to ascend being impossible they unloaded and carried everything over a rocky point relaunched reloaded and continued to track with the line but the dangers attending this operation had now seriously increased for stones both small and great came continually rolling down the bank and the steepness of the ground was such that the risk of the men slipping and falling into the water became imminent besides which they had frequently to pass outside of trees which overhung the precipices at such times a false step or a slip might have proved fatal  presently they came to a sheer impassable precipice where the men had to embark and take to poling up the stream but ere long they got into water too deep for the poles and recourse was again had to the trackingline  coming to another precipice they were again checked but mackenzie finding that the rock was soft cut steps in it for the distance of about twenty feet and thus passing along leaped at the risk of his life on a small rock below where he received those who followed him on his shoulders  thus four of them passed and managed to drag up the canoe though they damaged her in doing so  they had now reached a spot where the canoe could be repaired and fortunately found a dead tree which had fallen from the cliffs above  but for this fire could not have been kindled there as no wood was to be procured within a mile of the place in which case the repairs could not have been accomplished  thus yard by yard these hardy pioneers advanced by means of the line the paddle or the pole sometimes carrying the lading sometimes the canoe as well and often within a hairbreadth of destruction  indeed nothing but the coolness courage and skill of all concerned could under god have brought them safely through the fatigues and dangers of that tremendous day  but they had not yet done with it  having surmounted these and many other difficulties they reached a place where it became absolutely necessary to make a traverse across an unusually strong current  here the men silently showed their estimate of the danger by stripping themselves to their shirts that they might be the better prepared to swim for their lives in case of accident to the canoe  fortunately the traverse was made successfully and then at noon mackenzie stopped and went ashore to take an altitude  while he was thus engaged the men fastened the canoe and left it but so insecure was the fastening that the current sheered her off and if it had not happened that one of the men had remained in her and held on to the line they would then and there have been deprived of every means of advancing or returning as well as of present subsistence  despite the alarming nature of this incident and the interference of a cloud that sought to neutralise the sun our persevering traveller completed his observations and proved the luckless spot to be situated in 56 degrees north latitude  the rapidity of the current increased so much here that in the distance of two miles they were compelled to unload four times and carry everything except the canoe and even when thus light they found it difficult to prevent her being dashed to pieces against the rocks by the violence of the eddies  the last danger they encountered was the worst  they came to a place where the river was nothing less than one continuous rapid and they took everything out of the canoe intending to tow her up with the line only a few of the men being left in her  at length however the tumultuous heaving of the water was so great that a wave struck the canoes bow and broke the line  the dismay of those on shore may be imagined for now it seemed as if nothing could save their comrades from destruction and certainly no human power did save them on that occasion for while they grasped the sides of the canoe helplessly another wave drove them with a wild surge out of the tumbling water so that the men were enabled to thrust her ashore and strange to say though the frail vessel had been carried by tossing swells over rocks which were left naked a moment later she had received no material injury  this last accident coupled with the fact that the river as far as they could see was a sheet of white foaming water induced the leader of the band to give up all idea of advancing farther at that point by water  but do not imagine good reader that this implied the desertion of the canoe  on the contrary that accommodating vessel having hitherto carried our pioneers they now proposed to carry itas shall be related presently  mackenzie met the grumbling discontent of his men with an order to ascend the hill and encamp there for the night  vraimentit all very easy to say go up dere and camp for de noit mais i will go not farder growled ducette as he threw a heavy bag of provisions on his back and trudged sulkily up the hill  the two young indians evidently approved of this sentiment and one or two of the other men seemed inclined to echo it but reuben and lawrence laughed as they each shouldered a burdenand the former said it was his firm conviction that nothing would could or should stop monsieur mackenzie but the pacific ocean  the precipitous bank of the river or hill up which they were desired to carry the tents provisions etcetera necessary for their encampment was so steep and encumbered with wood and scrub that it might of itself have formed a sufficiently disheartening obstacle to men less accustomed to hardships nevertheless they braced themselves to it with wonted vigour pushed through the scrub felled trees to facilitate their ascent and climbed like monkeys by the stems until they gained the summit where very soon a roaring fire was covered with bubbling kettles and broiling steaks and marrowbones  meanwhile mackenzie accompanied by swiftarrow went off on foot to survey the river ahead  he walked as long as daylight permitted but found that there seemed to be no end to the rapids and cascades and returned to camp with wornout moccasins and wounded feet  during the excursion he came on several old encampments of the knisteneaux indians which must have been formed during war expeditions a decided proof he thought of the savage and bloodthirsty nature of that people seeing that their natural huntinggrounds were very far removed from those almost inaccessible regions  it now became too apparent to the leader of the expedition that the mountain at this place must be crossed on foot with the canoe and its heavy lading on the shoulders of himself and his men but before deciding on this course he resolved to despatch reuben and three men with the two indian interpreters to proceed along the line of the river until they should reach a navigable part of it  accordingly next day this party set out  mackenzie remained in camp to superintend the repairing of the canoe and take observations  he was successful in obtaining correct time and found the latitude to be 56 degrees 8 minutes  at sunset the exploring party returned  they had penetrated the thick woods ascended hills descended valleys and had finally got above the rapids a distance of about three leagues but their account of the difficulties in the way of advancing was very discouraging indeed mackenzie had foreseen this and had made suitable preparations to counteract the evil effects thereof  in their absence he had prepared for them an enormous kettle of wild rice highly sweetened with sugar when the tired hungry and footsore men sat down to this they became quite willing to listen to their leaders arguments in favour of a bold advance and when the hearty supper was washed down with a liberal allowance of rum and finished off with a pipe they avowed themselves ready to face anything  in this satisfactory state of mind they retired to rest while their leader sat up in the hope of obtaining an observation of jupiter and his first satellite which laudable aim was frustrated by cloudy weather    chapter nine  deeper and deeper into the unknown wilderness  next day the arduous work of cutting a road through the forest and up the mountainside was begun  at daybreak their leader assembled the men  now my lads said he the work before us for the next two or three days will be very stiff but it would be a disgrace to us if after having come so far we were so soononly a little beyond the middle of mayto give in because of a few difficulties  besides i am strongly of opinion that we cannot now be far from the height of land and you know well enough that the moment we set foot on the other side of the topmost ridge of the mountains it will be all down stream  let us set to work then with a will  take your axes and cut your way through everything  the trees here are as you see of small growth  cut those of them that stand conveniently in such a way as that they shall fall parallel with the intended road but dont sever them quite through so that they make a sort of railing on each side  come lawrence im glad to see that you are ready to begin like a good pioneershow them an example  lawrence who was the only one of the listening band who chanced to have his axe on his shoulder smiled when thus addressed and turning round exclaimed voila as he swayed the axe aloft and sent it sweeping at one stroke through a young tree which fell with a crash and covered half of the party with its branches  a general laugh followed and immediately the whole band set to work with their axes headed by mackenzie himself  from early morning till sunset they toiled during the next three days almost without cessation except for meals  they cut their way from the margin of the river where the rocks and ground shelved so steeply that one false step of any of the men would have been followed by a headlong plunge into the water  over the ridge and down into a hollow beyond and up the mountain farther on they hewed a broad track by which they conveyed the baggage and then carried up the canoe  this latter was an extremely difficult operation at the first part of the road requiring the united efforts of the whole party  being lifted on the shoulders of some of the men the trackingrope was fastened to the bow and others of the party went in advance and took a couple of turns of the rope round a stump  the bearers then advanced steadily up the steep side of the mountain till they reached those who by holding on to the rope relieved them of any downward weight  the rope was then shifted to a stump farther up and the advance was continued  thus they may be said to have warped the canoe up the mountain  by two in the afternoon everything was got to the summit  then mackenzie axe in hand led the way forward  the progress was slow the work exhausting  through every species of country they cut their way  here the trees were large and the ground encumbered with little underwood there the land was strewn with the trunks of fallen timber where fire had passed with desolating power years before and in its place had sprung up extensive copses of so close a growth and so choked up with briars that it was all but impossible to cut through them  poplar birch cypress redpine spruce willow alder arrowwood redwood hard and other treesall fell before the bright axes of the voyageurs with gooseberrybushes currantbushes briars and other shrubs innumerable  it must not be supposed that they did this heavy work with absolute impunity  no there was many a bruise and blow from falling trees and even the shrubs were successful not only in tearing trousers and leggings but also in doing considerable damage to skin and flesh  so toilsome was the labour that at the close of one of the days they had advanced only three miles  on the afternoon of the third day they finally came out in triumph on the banks of the river above the cascades having cut a road of about nine miles in extent  once again then behold them afloat and paddling up streamstill westwardwith hopes animated and fortune smiling or as reuben put it with a gale of luck blowin right astarn  reuben be it observed had consorted with sailors in his day down the gulf of st lawrence and had picked up a little of their slang  but their good fortune never lasted long at a time  their progress being very slow it was found advisable to send the young indian interpreters on shore to lighten the canoe and to hunt as they advanced they frequently killed elk and other game  on one of these occasions swiftarrow was nearly killed  he had been sent to fetch the choice parts of an elk which they had shot when a big rock fell from the cliffs above and was dashed to pieces at his very feet  just after this incident a violent fall of rain took place obliging them to remain in camp for a day  then driftwood barred the river and an opening had to be forced through it  then more cascades appeared to check their advance and worst of all just as they began to hope that the height of land was gained an opening in the hills revealed a range of blue mountains far ahead of them running south and north as far as the eye could reach  to add to their perplexities they came to a fork in the river one branch running due west the other in a southerly direction  follow the westerly branch said one that must be the right one  not so sure o that observed reuben the end of a track dont needsesarly pint out the ginral run of it  you are right reuben said mackenzie besides i have been warned of this very branch by an old indian whom i met last winter and who said he had been up here in his youth  therefore though appearances are against it i shall follow the southern branch  mackenzie was right in this determination as it afterwards proved but most of his men grumbled very much at the time because the southerly branch besides appearing to be the wrong one was a very rapid and dangerous stream  they knew by that time however that nothing could bend their leaders will so they submitted though with a bad grace  here an immense number of beaver were seen and a gladsome sight it was to the furtrader because beaver skins at that time were in great reputesilk hats not having as yet beaten them off the field and reduced their value to almost nothing  in some places these sagacious and busy animals had cut down several acres of large poplars  at this place too they had an alarm some of the men declaring that they had heard shots fired by indians in the woods  a whole night was therefore spent on the qui vive although it turned out to be a false alarm  one morning the weather being fine and the river more manageable than usual mackenzie landed with reuben and the two indians to ascend an adjacent mountain telling his men to proceed in the canoe diligently and directing them to fire two shots if they should require his return agreeing that he would do the same if he should wish them to wait for him  nothing was gained by this attempt to obtain a better prospect on descending to the river they fired two shots as agreed on but no answer was received  again they tried it but the deep silence was only broken by an echo and by the rushing of the river  theyre behind us suggested reuben  theyve overshot us said the indians  again two shots were fired but still no reply came  mackenzies mind was at once filled with anxious fears lest some accident should have befallen his canoe while he reproached himself for having left them even for a brief period in such dangerous navigation  in these circumstances he turned to consult with his men  its my opinion said reuben that theyve diskivered more rapids than they bargained for and are out of earshot behind us so wed better make tracks down stream till we find em  not so said the elder of the indians without doubt the canoe is dashed to pieces and our comrades are even now with their forefathers we shall see them no more and my advice is that we construct a raft and try to return on it to the lands whence we came  anxious though he was mackenzie could scarce refrain from laughing at the prompt way in which the red man had consigned his comrades to destruction  come said he we wont give them up quite so readily as you seem inclined to  we shall make at least one effort to find them  it was now arranged that reuben and one of the indians should remain at the spot where they then were kindle a large fire and send branches down the stream from time to time as a signal to their comrades if they chanced to be below and that mackenzie with the other indian should walk up the bank of the river several miles  this was done but they returned after some hours to the fire having seen nothing of the canoe  as evening was now approaching they became thoroughly alarmed and a more rigorous plan of search was instituted  reuben was sent off with one indian to proceed down the river as far as he could go before night came on with directions to continue the journey in the morning as far as to the place where they had encamped the preceding evening mackenzie with the other indian again went off up the river intending to make a thorough search in that direction  they had no food with them but having their guns and the means of making fire they had no anxiety on that score except in regard to an immediate meal for game was scarcer than usual at that particular spot  it was agreed that if both should fail of success they were to return to the place where they then separated  but their anxieties were brought to an end sooner than they had hoped for  not very long after parting mackenzie heard a very faroff shot and then another and in a few minutes an answering double shot at a still greater distance  these being the concerted signals he knew that the canoe party must have been discovered by reuben he therefore retraced his steps with a light heart despite the fact that he had worn the moccasins off his feet and was completely drenched with rain  it turned out that the delay had been occasioned by the breaking of the canoe and the consequent necessity of landing to repair damages  indeed the sorelybattered craft had become almost a wreck  as a fitting climax to this disastrous day the night finished off with thunder lightning and rain  while thus forcing their way to the headwaters of the river they met with a small party of miserablelooking natives who received them at first with violent demonstrations of an intention to immolate them on the spot if they should dare to land  it was evident that the poor creatures had been subjected to bad treatment and deception by other and more powerful tribes because they remained in a state of great suspicion and anxiety even after the interpreter had stated earnestly that the intentions of the white men were friendly and after gifts had been presented to them  by degrees however they became more confident and as their anxieties diminished their curiosity increased  i do believe said lawrence that the critters have never seen white folk before  to most people it might have seemed ridiculous to have heard that bronzed voyageur calling himself and his brownfaced smokedried weatherworn companions by the title of white people but lawrence referred to the natural colour of the race to which he belonged  they do seem rather koorious observed reuben as one of the indians timidly touched his arm and looked wonderingly up into his blue eyes  it was found however that these natives had heard of white people though they had not seen them moreover they displayed a number of knives and iron implements which they said had been procured from people inhabiting the banks of a river which might be reached over a carryingplace of eleven days in length and which river flowed in an opposite direction from the peace river  these people they said travelled during a moon to get to the country of another tribe who dwelt in houses and these again extended their journeys to the sea or as they called it the stinking lake where they exchanged their furs with white people like our pioneers who came to the coast of that lake in canoes as big as islands  here then at last was definite information and the enterprising discoverer was not long in availing himself of it  after gratifying his new friends with sundry little gifts a feed of pemmican which they relished amazingly and a taste of sugar to tickle their palates he gained their confidence so much as to induce one of them to be his guide and immediately pushed forward  in the course of the following week they gained the muchlongedfor height of land and found two lakelets within a quarter of a mile of each other from one of which the waters find their way through peace river on the east side of the mountains into the arctic sea while from the other the waters flow south and west through the great river columbia to the pacific ocean  but the succession of disasters that befell them here and the difficulties of the routefor it could not be called navigationthrew all their previous experiences into the shade  one day having made a portage they relaunched the canoe and began the wellnigh forgotten process of descending stream  they had not gone far when they struck a rock and were driven down sideways with great violence mackenzie followed by his men jumped into the shallow to turn the canoe straight but in a moment the water deepened and they had to scramble inboard again hurriedly  swiftarrow by some mischance was left behind to struggle on shore as best he might  before they could resume their paddles they struck again the stem of the canoe was shattered like an eggshell and hung only by the gunwales so that lawrence who was steering had to quit his place  the violence of the stroke drove them to the opposite side of the river where the bow met with the same fate at that moment reuben seized the branches of a small overhanging tree in a desperate hope of checking the canoe but the tree proved so elastic that he was jerked on shore in an instant as if by magic and the canoe swept over a cascade where several holes were broken in her bottom and nearly all the bars started  at the same moment the wreck fell flat on the water all the men jumped out and ducette whose courage forsook him shouted save yourselves  not so  hold on to the canoe men cried mackenzie sternly  the men obeyed and thus prevented the total loss of everything  yard by yard on the verge of destruction they waded down the rapid and guided the wreck into shallow water where some held her fast while the others who were quickly joined by reuben and swiftarrow carried the lading safely ashore  on this occasion several things were lost the chief of these being their whole stock of bullets but they had plenty of shot left from which ball could be made  one might have thought this was at last sufficient to have turned them backso at least thought most of the men who began to look rebelliousbut mackenzie partly compelled partly encouraged them to advance  the canoe was dragged ashore and repaired or rather reconstructed and eventually through indescribable difficulties he reached the navigable stream which forms the headwaters of the columbia river  this he descended a considerable distance and met with many of the natives who told him that the country below abounded with game and the river with fish but as the course of the latter ran towards the south and the distance by it to the sea was described as being extremely great he deemed it advisable to retrace his course a short way and then strike westward overland to the pacific  the old canoe being now little better than a wreck birchbark was procured and a new canoe built after which the stream was ascended until a spot was reached where the natives were in the habit of starting overland for the sea coast  here the canoe was hidden an indian guide procured and then these indomitable pioneers prepared to cross the wilderness on foot    chapter ten  the last  we follow our travellers now over the last portion of their trying journey  well would it have been for them if they could have followed their route as easily as you and i reader follow them in imagination over mountain and swamp through forest and brake in heat and in cold sunshine and rain they plodded wearily but resolutely on towards the far west until they reached the farthest west of all where the great continent dips into the greater pacific  at starting on this overland route they buried some provisions and putting in a place of security their canoe and such stores as they did not require or could not carry they set out each man laden with a burden varying from fortyfive to ninety pounds weight besides arms and ammunition  they were led by an indian guide with several of his relations and followed by their dog wolf  this guide was deemed necessary not so much to show the way as to introduce them to the various tribes through whose territory they should have to pass  it takes a large portion of a quarto volume to recount their interesting adventures by the way  how then can we presume to attempt a fair narrative in a few pages  the thing is impossible  we can but refer our readers to mackenzies ponderous journal in which embedded amongst a mass of important details will be found a record of one of the most interesting voyages ever undertaken  as a matter of course difficulties assailed them at the outset  this would seem to be the universal experience of pioneers  game latterly had begun to grow scarce so that their provisions being low they were obliged to go on short allowancetwo meals a day  their food being pemmican required no cooking  mingled heat mosquitoes sandflies and a rugged country with short commons and danger as well as worry from savages was the beginningand pretty much the middle and endof their experience  they were soon joined by an elderly man and three other natives and not only did these three indians but all the others along the route harass them by their caprice unfaithfulness and childish petulance and selfwill  one day their guide resolved to leave them then without being solicited to stay he changed his mind and went on with them  again one night at a time when they were anxious not to lose him mackenzie who knew he meant to take leave quietly asked him to sleep with him he willingly consented the white mans cloak being a snug covering and thus was he guarded but his guardian suffered severe consequences owing to the filthy state of the indian whose garments were indescribable his body being smeared with red earth and his hair with fishoil  coming to a lake they observed the sky grow very black  a thunderstorm brewin suggested reuben  encamp and up with the tent boys said mackenzie  the tent  it was a misnomer their only shelter being a sheet of thin oiled cloth and the overhanging trees  down came a deluge that kept them very close for a time then on resuming the march the guide was requested to go in advance and brush the water off the bushes but he coolly declined  mackenzie himself therefore undertook the duty during this storm the ground was rendered white with hailstones as large as a musket ball  the third day they met natives who received them well  these were going to the great river to fish and seemedunlike many other tribesto venerate age for they carried on their backs by turns a poor old woman who was quite blind and infirm  farther on they met other indians on their way to the same great river which abounded with salmon  these told them that they would soon reach a river neither large nor long which entered an arm of the sea and where a great wooden canoe with white people was said to be frequently seen  here is encouragement for us let us push on said mackenzie  push on echoed reuben and lawrence and some of the other men but some grumbled at the hardships they had to endure and the short allowance of provisions while the indians threatened to desert them  mackenzie must have had something very peculiar in his look and manner for he seemed to possess the faculty of saying little in reply to his men and yet of constraining them to follow him  doubtless had some one else written his journal we should have learned the secret  it seems as if when rebellion was looking blackest and the storm about to burst instead of commanding or disputing he calmly held his tongue and went off to take an observation of the sun and on that process being completed he almost invariably found his men in a more tractable condition  occasionally we read of quiet remonstrance or grave reasoning and frequently of hearty encouragement and wise counsel but never of violence although he was sorely tried  perchance they knew that he was dangerous to trifle with  we cannot tell but certainly he seems to have been a splendid manager of men  at last they reached an indian village where they were hospitably entertained and presented with as much roasted salmon as they required these people lived almost exclusively on fish and berries were more cleanly than other tribes and apparently less addicted to war or hunting  here two new guides were obtained and the people conciliated with gifts of beads knives and other trinkets  leaving them they spent a wretched night on the shores of a lake deluged with rain and tormented with sandflies and mosquitoesthe former being perhaps the greatest pests of the country  soon the guides grew tired of their mode of travelling and the allowance of provisions had to be still further reduced  fearing that they might run short altogether mackenzie ordered reuben and his son to fall behind bury some pemmican in reserve for their return and make a fire over the spot to conceal the fact that it had been dug into  they were now on twothirds of their regular allowance  soon afterwards they came to a river too deep to ford but one of their guides swam across and brought over a raft that lay on the other side  this ferried most of them over but swiftarrow and some of the others preferred to swim across  at length after many days of suffering and toil they crossed the last range of mountains and began to descend  here magnificent cedars and other trees were seen some of the former being fully eighteen feet in circumference  the natives whom they met with were sometimes stern sometimes kind but always suspicious at first  the soothing effects of gifts however were pretty much the same in all  still the party had several narrow escapes  on one occasion mackenzie when alone was surrounded and seized but he soon freed himself and just at that moment when his life seemed to hang on a hair reuben guff happened to come up and the natives took to flight  some of these natives were very expert canoemen caught salmon by means of weirs dwelt in wooden houses elevated on poles boiled their food in watertight baskets by putting redhot stones into them made cakes of the inner rind of the hemlock sprinkled with oil and seemed to have a rooted antipathy to flesh of every kind  some of the salmon they caught were fully forty pounds weight  the chief of one tribe said that ten years before he had gone down to the sea in a large canoe and there had met with two large vessels full of white men who treated him very kindly  these mackenzie concluded must have been the ships of captain cook an opinion which was strengthened by the discovery that the chiefs canoe was ornamented with seaotters teeth which bear some resemblance to human teeth for which they had been mistaken by the great navigator  at last on the 20th of july the heroic perseverance of mackenzie met with its reward  on that day he obtained a canoe and descending a river entered an arm of the pacific he did not himself indeed deem the object of the expedition attained until he had battled on for a couple of days longerin the face of the opposition of his own men and hostility of the nativesand had obtained reliable observations which settled beyond all dispute his exact position on the globe  but to all intents and purposes he had accomplished his great object on that daynamely the crossing of the american wilderness to the pacific ocean  even in the midst of his triumph this longenduring man was worried by petty trials for one of the indian guides took it into his head to desert  as he was the son of a chief and it was to be feared might prejudice the natives against them reuben guff was directed to pursue him  that worthy took with him swiftarrow and exerting his long sinewy legs to the utmost soon overtook the fugitive and brought him back but it was no part of mackenzies plan to tyrannise over men  he received the deserter kindly gave him a pair of moccasins some provisions a silk handkerchief and some good advice and then sent him back to his friends  the other indian who remained with them succeeded about the same time in killing a large porcupine which was very acceptable to allespecially to its captor who ate so largely of it as to be obliged to undergo a prolonged period of repose in order to sleep it off  at length being in a state of semistarvation with a leaky canoe and unfriendly natives around mackenzie took a last observation which gave 52 degrees 20 minutes 48 second north latitude and 128 degrres 2 minutes west longitude  then he turned his face eastward  before quitting the coast however a smooth rock was selected and thereon was written in large letters with a mixture of melted grease and vermilion this brief memorialalexander mackenzie from canada by land the twentysecond of july one thousand seven hundred and ninetythree  the return journey was scarcely less arduous than the outward but they undertook it with the knowledge that every step carried them nearer home and with the exhilarating consciousness that their labours had been crowned with success  besides this they now knew what lay before them each dayas far as the route was concernedand at the various places where provisions had been secreted the party was strengthened and enabled to advance with greater vigour  on arriving at the great river they found their canoe goods and provisions just as they had left them about five weeks before  here they made preparations for proceeding to the headwaters of the columbia river crossing over to those of the peace river and so returning by the way they had come  in order to mark this happy point in the expedition mackenzie treated himself and men to a dram butobserve that i quote his words readerwe had been so long without tasting any spirituous liquor that we had lost all relish for it  rejoice in that testimony ye teetotallers think of it ye topers  put it in your pipes ye smokersand make the most of it  nearing home at last boys said mackenzie many weeks afterwards as having descended the turbulent peace river they rounded a point of land and came in sight of their old winterquarters shake out the flag and give them a volley and a cheer  the men obeyed and were in such high spirits and made such active use of their paddles that they reached the landingplace before the two men who had been left there in the spring could recover their senses sufficiently to answer their questions  but this was not home yet some days had still to elapse ere these toilworn men could lay aside their paddles and rest their wearied limbs  at last after an absence of eleven months they reached fort chipewyan where their leader resumed the duties of the furtrade and swiftarrow once more kissed the brown cheek of darkeye who filled his heart with grim delight by placing in his paternal arms a soft round fat little brown female baby with eyes as dark and bright as her own and a nose which was a miniature facsimile of its fathers  one week after their arrival reuben and lawrence swiftarrow and darkeye entered mackenzies room to bid him farewell  im sorry you are bent on leaving me said their former leader but you have the satisfaction of knowing that you have contributed greatly to the success of our two expeditions  you have indeed proved yourselves able pioneers  thankee sir said reuben while a quiet smile of satisfaction lighted up his grave features  it was all along a hobby o mine an of lawrence too to do a bit o diskivery an now were contentfor it aint possible i fancy to do much more in that line than push your canoe into the frozen sea on the one hand or the pacific on the other its harder work than i thowt it would bethough i didnt expect childs play neither an its our opinion sir that you are the only man in the country as could have done it at all  we intend now to go back to the settlements  as for the redskin he added glancing at swiftarrow he hant got no ambition one way or another as to diskivery but hes a good and true man nevertheless youll allow and now sir farewell  may a blessing from above rest on you and yours  saying this the bold backwoodsman shook mackenzie by the hand and left the room  every one in the fort was on the bank to bid them farewell silently they stepped into their canoe and in a few minutes had paddled out of sight into the great wilderness of wood and water  reader our tale if such it may be styled is told  as for the hero whose steps for a time we have so closely followed he became one of the most noted traders as he was now one of the most celebrated discoverers in north america  he afterwards became for a time the travelling companion in america of the duke of kent father of queen victoria was knighted in acknowledgment of his great and important achievements married one of scotlands fair daughters and finally died in the midst of his native highland hills leaving behind him a volume whichas we said at the beginningproves him to have been one of the most vigorous persevering manly and successful pioneers that ever traversed the continent of north america  the end    chapter eleven  extract of letter referred to on page 85  from william mackenzie esquire of gairloch to george mackenzie esquire of avoch dated leamington 24th may 1856  when in stockholm in 1824 lord blomfield our minister there did me the honour of presenting me to the king bernadotte father of the present king of sweden  at the kings special request the audience was a private one and i was further especially requested to oblige by coming in my full highland dress  the audience lasted fully an hour  such an interest did napoleons first and most fortunate marshal take in everything that was highland not even the skiandhu escaped him  i now come to your family portion of the audience  as we chatted on old bernadotte leaning familiarly upon my okeachan claymore was pleased to say in that suaviter in modo for which his eagle eye so fitted him yes i repeat it you highlanders are deservedly proud of your country  your forefathers and your people are a race apart distinct from all the rest of britain in high moral as well as martial bearing and long i hope may you feel and show it outwardly by this noble distinction in dress  but allow me to observe sir that in your family name in the name of mackenzie there is a very predominant lustre which shall never be obliterated from my mind pray are you connected in any way with sir alexander mackenzie the celebrated north american traveller whose name and researches are immortalised by his discoveries in the arctic ocean and of the river which since then does honour to his name  i informed his majesty that as a boy i had known him well and that our family and his were nearly connected  this seemed to give me still greater favour with him for familiarly putting his hand on my shoulderbrooch he replied that on that account alone his making my acquaintance gave him greater satisfaction  he then proceeded to tell lord blomfield and me how your fathers name had become familiar to him and so much valued in his eyes  he said that at one time napoleon had arranged to distract the affairs of britain by attacking her in her canadian possessionsnot by a direct descent upon them but by a route which men expected would take england quite by surprise and prove infallible  that route was to be up the mississippi ohio etcetera up to our canadian border lakes  for this arrangements were to be made with america new orleans occupied as a pied a terre by france etcetera etcetera  the organisation and command of this gigantic enterprise as bernadotte said was given to me by the emperor with instructions to make myself master of every work which could bear upon it and the facilities the nature of the country afforded  foremost amongst these the work of your namesake sir alexander mackenzie was recommended but how to get at it with all communications with england interdicted all knowledge of english unknown to me seemed a difficulty not easily to be got over  however as every one knows my then master lempereur was not the man to be overcome by such small difficulties  the book a huge quarto was procured through the smugglers and in an inconceivably short space of time most admirably translated into french for my especial use  a copy of this translation was found in napoleons library at st helena i need hardly say with what interest i perused and reperused that admirable work till i had made myself so thoroughly master of it that i could almost fancy myself this he said laughing heartily taking your canadas en revers from the upper waters and ever since i have never ceased to look upon the name and think of the author with more than ordinary respect and esteem  after a short pause and a longdrawn breath almost amounting to a sigh accompanied by a look at blomfield and a most expressive ah milord que de changes depuis ces joursla bernadotte concluded by saying that the russian campaign had knocked that of canada on the head until russia was crushed but it had pleased god to ordain it otherwise et maintenant me voila roi de suedehis exact words as he concluded these compliments to your father
