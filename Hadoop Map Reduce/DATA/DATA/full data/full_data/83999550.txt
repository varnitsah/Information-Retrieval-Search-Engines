83999550	beyond the city  by arthur conan doyle     chapter i the newcomers   if you please mum said the voice of a domestic from somewhere round the angle of the door number three is moving in  two little old ladies who were sitting at either side of a table sprang to their feet with ejaculations of interest and rushed to the window of the sittingroom  take care monica dear said one shrouding herself in the lace curtain dont let them see us  no no bertha we must not give them reason to say that their neighbors are inquisitive but i think that we are safe if we stand like this  the open window looked out upon a sloping lawn well trimmed and pleasant with fuzzy rosebushes and a starshaped bed of sweetwilliam it was bounded by a low wooden fence which screened it off from a broad modern new metaled road at the other side of this road were three large detached deepbodied villas with peaky eaves and small wooden balconies each standing in its own little square of grass and of flowers all three were equally new but numbers one and two were curtained and sedate with a human sociable look to them while number three with yawning door and unkempt garden had apparently only just received its furniture and made itself ready for its occupants a fourwheeler had driven up to the gate and it was at this that the old ladies peeping out birdlike from behind their curtains directed an eager and questioning gaze  the cabman had descended and the passengers within were handing out the articles which they desired him to carry up to the house he stood redfaced and blinking with his crooked arms outstretched while a male hand protruding from the window kept piling up upon him a series of articles the sight of which filled the curious old ladies with bewilderment  my goodness me cried monica the smaller the drier and the more wizened of the pair what do you call that bertha it looks to me like four batter puddings  those are what young men box each other with said bertha with a conscious air of superior worldly knowledge  and those  two great bottleshaped pieces of yellow shining wood had been heaped upon the cabman  oh i dont know what those are confessed bertha indian clubs had never before obtruded themselves upon her peaceful and very feminine existence  these mysterious articles were followed however by others which were more within their range of comprehensionby a pair of dumbbells a purple cricketbag a set of golf clubs and a tennis racket finally when the cabman all topheavy and bristling had staggered off up the garden path there emerged in a very leisurely way from the cab a big powerfully built young man with a bull pup under one arm and a pink sporting paper in his hand the paper he crammed into the pocket of his light yellow dustcoat and extended his hand as if to assist some one else from the vehicle to the surprise of the two old ladies however the only thing which his open palm received was a violent slap and a tall lady bounded unassisted out of the cab with a regal wave she motioned the young man towards the door and then with one hand upon her hip she stood in a careless lounging attitude by the gate kicking her toe against the wall and listlessly awaiting the return of the driver  as she turned slowly round and the sunshine struck upon her face the two watchers were amazed to see that this very active and energetic lady was far from being in her first youth so far that she had certainly come of age again since she first passed that landmark in lifes journey her finely chiseled cleancut face with something red indian about the firm mouth and strongly marked cheek bones showed even at that distance traces of the friction of the passing years and yet she was very handsome her features were as firm in repose as those of a greek bust and her great dark eyes were arched over by two brows so black so thick and so delicately curved that the eye turned away from the harsher details of the face to marvel at their grace and strength her figure too was straight as a dart a little portly perhaps but curving into magnificent outlines which were half accentuated by the strange costume which she wore her hair black but plentifully shot with grey was brushed plainly back from her high forehead and was gathered under a small round felt hat like that of a man with one sprig of feather in the band as a concession to her sex a doublebreasted jacket of some dark friezelike material fitted closely to her figure while her straight blue skirt untrimmed and ungathered was cut so short that the lower curve of her finelyturned legs was plainly visible beneath it terminating in a pair of broad flat lowheeled and squaretoed shoes such was the lady who lounged at the gate of number three under the curious eyes of her two opposite neighbors  but if her conduct and appearance had already somewhat jarred upon their limited and precise sense of the fitness of things what were they to think of the next little act in this tableau vivant the cabman red and heavyjowled had come back from his labors and held out his hand for his fare the lady passed him a coin there was a moment of mumbling and gesticulating and suddenly she had him with both hands by the red cravat which girt his neck and was shaking him as a terrier would a rat right across the pavement she thrust him and pushing him up against the wheel she banged his head three several times against the side of his own vehicle  can i be of any use to you aunt asked the large youth framing himself in the open doorway  not the slightest panted the enraged lady there you low blackguard that will teach you to be impertinent to a lady  the cabman looked helplessly about him with a bewildered questioning gaze as one to whom alone of all men this unheardof and extraordinary thing had happened then rubbing his head he mounted slowly on to the box and drove away with an uptossed hand appealing to the universe the lady smoothed down her dress pushed back her hair under her little felt hat and strode in through the halldoor which was closed behind her as with a whisk her short skirts vanished into the darkness the two spectatorsmiss bertha and miss monica williamssat looking at each other in speechless amazement for fifty years they had peeped through that little window and across that trim garden but never yet had such a sight as this come to confound them  i wish said monica at last that we had kept the field  i am sure i wish we had answered her sister     chapter ii breaking the ice   the cottage from the window of which the misses williams had looked out stands and has stood for many a year in that pleasant suburban district which lies between norwood anerley and forest hill long before there had been a thought of a township there when the metropolis was still quite a distant thing old mr williams had inhabited the brambles as the little house was called and had owned all the fields about it six or eight such cottages scattered over a rolling countryside were all the houses to be found there in the days when the century was young from afar when the breeze came from the north the dull low roar of the great city might be heard like the breaking of the tide of life while along the horizon might be seen the dim curtain of smoke the grim spray which that tide threw up gradually however as the years passed the city had thrown out a long brickfeeler here and there curving extending and coalescing until at last the little cottages had been gripped round by these red tentacles and had been absorbed to make room for the modern villa field by field the estate of old mr williams had been sold to the speculative builder and had borne rich crops of snug suburban dwellings arranged in curving crescents and treelined avenues the father had passed away before his cottage was entirely bricked round but his two daughters to whom the property had descended lived to see the last vestige of country taken from them for years they had clung to the one field which faced their windows and it was only after much argument and many heartburnings that they had at last consented that it should share the fate of the others a broad road was driven through their quiet domain the quarter was renamed the wilderness and three square staring uncompromising villas began to sprout up on the other side with sore hearts the two shy little old maids watched their steady progress and speculated as to what fashion of neighbors chance would bring into the little nook which had always been their own  and at last they were all three finished wooden balconies and overhanging eaves had been added to them so that in the language of the advertisement there were vacant three eligible swissbuilt villas with sixteen rooms no basement electric bells hot and cold water and every modern convenience including a common tennis lawn to be let at l100 a year or l1500 purchase so tempting an offer did not long remain open within a few weeks the card had vanished from number one and it was known that admiral hay denver v c c b with mrs hay denver and their only son were about to move into it the news brought peace to the hearts of the williams sisters they had lived with a settled conviction that some wild impossible colony some shouting singing family of madcaps would break in upon their peace this establishment at least was irreproachable a reference to men of the time showed them that admiral hay denver was a most distinguished officer who had begun his active career at bomarsund and had ended it at alexandria having managed between these two episodes to see as much service as any man of his years from the taku forts and the shannon brigade to dhowharrying off zanzibar there was no variety of naval work which did not appear in his record while the victoria cross and the albert medal for saving life vouched for it that in peace as in war his courage was still of the same true temper clearly a very eligible neighbor this the more so as they had been confidentially assured by the estate agent that mr harold denver the son was a most quiet young gentleman and that he was busy from morning to night on the stock exchange  the hay denvers had hardly moved in before number two also struck its placard and again the ladies found that they had no reason to be discontented with their neighbors doctor balthazar walker was a very wellknown name in the medical world did not his qualifications his membership and the record of his writings fill a long halfcolumn in the medical directory from his first little paper on the gouty diathesis in 1859 to his exhaustive treatise upon affections of the vasomotor system in 1884 a successful medical career which promised to end in a presidentship of a college and a baronetcy had been cut short by his sudden inheritance of a considerable sum from a grateful patient which had rendered him independent for life and had enabled him to turn his attention to the more scientific part of his profession which had always had a greater charm for him than its more practical and commercial aspect to this end he had given up his house in weymouth street and had taken this opportunity of moving himself his scientific instruments and his two charming daughters he had been a widower for some years into the more peaceful atmosphere of norwood  there was thus but one villa unoccupied and it was no wonder that the two maiden ladies watched with a keen interest which deepened into a dire apprehension the curious incidents which heralded the coming of the new tenants they had already learned from the agent that the family consisted of two only mrs westmacott a widow and her nephew charles westmacott how simple and how select it had sounded who could have foreseen from it these fearful portents which seemed to threaten violence and discord among the dwellers in the wilderness again the two old maids cried in heartfelt chorus that they wished they had not sold their field  well at least monica remarked bertha as they sat over their teacups that afternoon however strange these people may be it is our duty to be as polite to them as to the others  most certainly acquiesced her sister  since we have called upon mrs hay denver and upon the misses walker we must call upon this mrs westmacott also  certainly dear as long as they are living upon our land i feel as if they were in a sense our guests and that it is our duty to welcome them  then we shall call tomorrow said bertha with decision  yes dear we shall but oh i wish it was over  at four oclock on the next day the two maiden ladies set off upon their hospitable errand in their stiff crackling dresses of black silk with jetbespangled jackets and little rows of cylindrical grey curls drooping down on either side of their black bonnets they looked like two old fashion plates which had wandered off into the wrong decade half curious and half fearful they knocked at the door of number three which was instantly opened by a redheaded pageboy  yes mrs westmacott was at home he ushered them into the front room furnished as a drawingroom where in spite of the fine spring weather a large fire was burning in the grate the boy took their cards and then as they sat down together upon a settee he set their nerves in a thrill by darting behind a curtain with a shrill cry and prodding at something with his foot the bull pup which they had seen upon the day before bolted from its hidingplace and scuttled snarling from the room  it wants to get at eliza said the youth in a confidential whisper master says she would give him moren he brought he smiled affably at the two little stiff black figures and departed in search of his mistress  whatwhat did he say gasped bertha  something about a oh goodness gracious oh help help help help help the two sisters had bounded on to the settee and stood there with staring eyes and skirts gathered in while they filled the whole house with their yells out of a high wickerwork basket which stood by the fire there had risen a flat diamondshaped head with wicked green eyes which came flickering upwards waving gently from side to side until a foot or more of glossy scaly neck was visible slowly the vicious head came floating up while at every oscillation a fresh burst of shrieks came from the settee   what in the name of mischief cried a voice and there was the mistress of the house standing in the doorway her gaze at first had merely taken in the fact that two strangers were standing screaming upon her red plush sofa a glance at the fireplace however showed her the cause of the terror and she burst into a hearty fit of laughter  charley she shouted heres eliza misbehaving again  ill settle her answered a masculine voice and the young man dashed into the room he had a brown horsecloth in his hand which he threw over the basket making it fast with a piece of twine so as to effectually imprison its inmate while his aunt ran across to reassure her visitors  it is only a rock snake she explained  oh bertha oh monica gasped the poor exhausted gentlewomen  shes hatching out some eggs that is why we have the fire eliza always does better when she is warm she is a sweet gentle creature but no doubt she thought that you had designs upon her eggs i suppose that you did not touch any of them  oh let us get away bertha cried monica with her thin blackgloved hands thrown forwards in abhorrence  not away but into the next room said mrs westmacott with the air of one whose word was law this way if you please it is less warm here she led the way into a very handsomely appointed library with three great cases of books and upon the fourth side a long yellow table littered over with papers and scientific instruments sit here and you there she continued that is right now let me see which of you is miss williams and which miss bertha williams  i am miss williams said monica still palpitating and glancing furtively about in dread of some new horror  and you live as i understand over at the pretty little cottage it is very nice of you to call so early i dont suppose that we shall get on but still the intention is equally good she crossed her legs and leaned her back against the marble mantelpiece  we thought that perhaps we might be of some assistance said bertha timidly if there is anything which we could do to make you feel more at home  oh thank you i am too old a traveler to feel anything but at home wherever i go ive just come back from a few months in the marquesas islands where i had a very pleasant visit that was where i got eliza in many respects the marquesas islands now lead the world  dear me ejaculated miss williams in what respect  in the relation of the sexes they have worked out the great problem upon their own lines and their isolated geographical position has helped them to come to a conclusion of their own the woman there is as she should be in every way the absolute equal of the male come in charles and sit down is eliza all right  all right aunt  these are our neighbors the misses williams perhaps they will have some stout you might bring in a couple of bottles charles  no no thank you none for us cried her two visitors earnestly  no i am sorry that i have no tea to offer you i look upon the subserviency of woman as largely due to her abandoning nutritious drinks and invigorating exercises to the male i do neither she picked up a pair of fifteenpound dumbbells from beside the fireplace and swung them lightly about her head you see what may be done on stout said she  but dont you think the elder miss williams suggested timidly dont you think mrs westmascott that woman has a mission of her own  the lady of the house dropped her dumbbells with a crash upon the floor  the old cant she cried the old shibboleth what is this mission which is reserved for woman all that is humble that is mean that is soulkilling that is so contemptible and so illpaid that none other will touch it all that is womans mission and who imposed these limitations upon her who cooped her up within this narrow sphere was it providence was it nature no it was the arch enemy it was man  oh i say auntie drawled her nephew  it was man charles it was you and your fellows i say that woman is a colossal monument to the selfishness of man what is all this boasted chivalrythese fine words and vague phrases where is it when we wish to put it to the test man in the abstract will do anything to help a woman of course how does it work when his pocket is touched where is his chivalry then will the doctors help her to qualify will the lawyers help her to be called to the bar will the clergy tolerate her in the church oh it is close your ranks then and refer poor woman to her mission her mission to be thankful for coppers and not to interfere with the men while they grabble for gold like swine round a trough that is mans reading of the mission of women you may sit there and sneer charles while you look upon your victim but you know that it is truth every word of it  terrified as they were by this sudden torrent of words the two gentlewomen could not but smile at the sight of the fiery domineering victim and the big apologetic representative of mankind who sat meekly bearing all the sins of his sex the lady struck a match whipped a cigarette from a case upon the mantelpiece and began to draw the smoke into her lungs  i find it very soothing when my nerves are at all ruffled she explained you dont smoke ah you miss one of the purest of pleasuresone of the few pleasures which are without a reaction  miss williams smoothed out her silken lap  it is a pleasure she said with some approach to selfassertion which bertha and i are rather too oldfashioned to enjoy  no doubt it would probably make you very ill if you attempted it by the way i hope that you will come to some of our guild meetings i shall see that tickets are sent you  your guild  it is not yet formed but i shall lose no time in forming a committee it is my habit to establish a branch of the emancipation guild wherever i go there is a mrs sanderson in anerley who is already one of the emancipated so that i have a nucleus it is only by organized resistance miss williams that we can hope to hold our own against the selfish sex must you go then  yes we have one or two other visits to pay said the elder sister you will i am sure excuse us i hope that you will find norwood a pleasant residence  all places are to me simply a battlefield she answered gripping first one and then the other with a grip which crumpled up their little thin fingers the days for work and healthful exercise the evenings to browning and high discourse eh charles goodbye she came to the door with them and as they glanced back they saw her still standing there with the yellow bull pup cuddled up under one forearm and the thin blue reek of her cigarette ascending from her lips  oh what a dreadful dreadful woman whispered sister bertha as they hurried down the street thank goodness that it is over  but shell return the visit answered the other i think that we had better tell mary that we are not at home     chapter iii dwellers in the wilderness   how deeply are our destinies influenced by the most trifling causes had the unknown builder who erected and owned these new villas contented himself by simply building each within its own grounds it is probable that these three small groups of people would have remained hardly conscious of each others existence and that there would have been no opportunity for that action and reaction which is here set forth but there was a common link to bind them together to single himself out from all other norwood builders the landlord had devised and laid out a common lawn tennis ground which stretched behind the houses with tautstretched net green closecropped sward and widespread whitewashed lines hither in search of that hard exercise which is as necessary as air or food to the english temperament came young hay denver when released from the toil of the city hither too came dr walker and his two fair daughters clara and ida and hither also champions of the lawn came the shortskirted muscular widow and her athletic nephew ere the summer was gone they knew each other in this quiet nook as they might not have done after years of a stiffer and more formal acquaintance  and especially to the admiral and the doctor were this closer intimacy and companionship of value each had a void in his life as every man must have who with unexhausted strength steps out of the great race but each by his society might help to fill up that of his neighbor it is true that they had not much in common but that is sometimes an aid rather than a bar to friendship each had been an enthusiast in his profession and had retained all his interest in it the doctor still read from cover to cover his lancet and his medical journal attended all professional gatherings worked himself into an alternate state of exaltation and depression over the results of the election of officers and reserved for himself a den of his own in which before rows of little round bottles full of glycerine canadian balsam and staining agents he still cut sections with a microtome and peeped through his long brass oldfashioned microscope at the arcana of nature with his typical face clean shaven on lip and chin with a firm mouth a strong jaw a steady eye and two little white fluffs of whiskers he could never be taken for anything but what he was a highclass british medical consultant of the age of fifty or perhaps just a year or two older  the doctor in his heyday had been cool over great things but now in his retirement he was fussy over trifles the man who had operated without the quiver of a finger when not only his patients life but his own reputation and future were at stake was now shaken to the soul by a mislaid book or a careless maid he remarked it himself and knew the reason when mary was alive he would say she stood between me and the little troubles i could brace myself for the big ones my girls are as good as girls can be but who can know a man as his wife knows him then his memory would conjure up a tuft of brown hair and a single white thin hand over a coverlet and he would feel as we have all felt that if we do not live and know each other after death then indeed we are tricked and betrayed by all the highest hopes and subtlest intuitions of our nature  the doctor had his compensations to make up for his loss the great scales of fate had been held on a level for him for where in all great london could one find two sweeter girls more loving more intelligent and more sympathetic than clara and ida walker so bright were they so quick so interested in all which interested him that if it were possible for a man to be compensated for the loss of a good wife then balthazar walker might claim to be so  clara was tall and thin and supple with a graceful womanly figure there was something stately and distinguished in her carriage queenly her friends called her while her critics described her as reserved and distant  such as it was however it was part and parcel of herself for she was and had always from her childhood been different from any one around her there was nothing gregarious in her nature she thought with her own mind saw with her own eyes acted from her own impulse her face was pale striking rather than pretty but with two great dark eyes so earnestly questioning so quick in their transitions from joy to pathos so swift in their comment upon every word and deed around her that those eyes alone were to many more attractive than all the beauty of her younger sister hers was a strong quiet soul and it was her firm hand which had taken over the duties of her mother had ordered the house restrained the servants comforted her father and upheld her weaker sister from the day of that great misfortune  ida walker was a hands breadth smaller than clara but was a little fuller in the face and plumper in the figure she had light yellow hair mischievous blue eyes with the light of humor ever twinkling in their depths and a large perfectly formed mouth with that slight upward curve of the corners which goes with a keen appreciation of fun suggesting even in repose that a latent smile is ever lurking at the edges of the lips she was modern to the soles of her dainty little highheeled shoes frankly fond of dress and of pleasure devoted to tennis and to comic opera delighted with a dance which came her way only too seldom longing ever for some new excitement and yet behind all this lighter side of her character a thoroughly good healthyminded english girl the life and soul of the house and the idol of her sister and her father such was the family at number two a peep into the remaining villa and our introductions are complete  admiral hay denver did not belong to the florid whitehaired hearty school of seadogs which is more common in works of fiction than in the navy list on the contrary he was the representative of a much more common type which is the antithesis of the conventional sailor he was a thin hardfeatured man with an ascetic acquiline cast of face grizzled and hollowcheeked cleanshaven with the exception of the tiniest curved promontory of ashcolored whisker an observer accustomed to classify men might have put him down as a canon of the church with a taste for lay costume and a country life or as the master of a large public school who joined his scholars in their outdoor sports his lips were firm his chin prominent he had a hard dry eye and his manner was precise and formal forty years of stern discipline had made him reserved and silent yet when at his ease with an equal he could readily assume a less quarterdeck style and he had a fund of little dry stories of the world and its ways which were of interest from one who had seen so many phases of life dry and spare as lean as a jockey and as tough as whipcord he might be seen any day swinging his silverheaded malacca cane and pacing along the suburban roads with the same measured gait with which he had been wont to tread the poop of his flagship he wore a good service stripe upon his cheek for on one side it was pitted and scarred where a spurt of gravel knocked up by a roundshot had struck him thirty years before when he served in the lancaster gunbattery yet he was hale and sound and though he was fifteen years senior to his friend the doctor he might have passed as the younger man  mrs hay denvers life had been a very broken one and her record upon land represented a greater amount of endurance and selfsacrifice than his upon the sea they had been together for four months after their marriage and then had come a hiatus of four years during which he was flitting about between st helena and the oil rivers in a gunboat then came a blessed year of peace and domesticity to be followed by nine years with only a three months break five upon the pacific station and four on the east indian after that was a respite in the shape of five years in the channel squadron with periodical runs home and then again he was off to the mediterranean for three years and to halifax for four now at last however this old married couple who were still almost strangers to one another had come together in norwood where if their short day had been chequered and broken the evening at least promised to be sweet and mellow in person mrs hay denver was tall and stout with a bright round ruddycheeked face still pretty with a gracious matronly comeliness her whole life was a round of devotion and of love which was divided between her husband and her only son harold  this son it was who kept them in the neighborhood of london for the admiral was as fond of ships and of salt water as ever and was as happy in the sheets of a twoton yacht as on the bridge of his sixteenknot monitor had he been untied the devonshire or hampshire coast would certainly have been his choice there was harold however and harolds interests were their chief care harold was fourandtwenty now three years before he had been taken in hand by an acquaintance of his fathers the head of a considerable firm of stockbrokers and fairly launched upon change his three hundred guinea entrance fee paid his three sureties of five hundred pounds each found his name approved by the committee and all other formalities complied with he found himself whirling round an insignificant unit in the vortex of the money market of the world there under the guidance of his fathers friend he was instructed in the mysteries of bulling and of bearing in the strange usages of change in the intricacies of carrying over and of transferring he learned to know where to place his clients money which of the jobbers would make a price in new zealands and which would touch nothing but american rails which might be trusted and which shunned all this and much more he mastered and to such purpose that he soon began to prosper to retain the clients who had been recommended to him and to attract fresh ones but the work was never congenial he had inherited from his father his love of the air of heaven his affection for a manly and natural existence to act as middleman between the pursuer of wealth and the wealth which he pursued or to stand as a human barometer registering the rise and fall of the great mammon pressure in the markets was not the work for which providence had placed those broad shoulders and strong limbs upon his well knit frame his dark open face too with his straight grecian nose well opened brown eyes and round blackcurled head were all those of a man who was fashioned for active physical work meanwhile he was popular with his fellow brokers respected by his clients and beloved at home but his spirit was restless within him and his mind chafed unceasingly against his surroundings  do you know willy said mrs hay denver one evening as she stood behind her husbands chair with her hand upon his shoulder i think sometimes that harold is not quite happy  he looks happy the young rascal answered the admiral pointing with his cigar it was after dinner and through the open french window of the diningroom a clear view was to be had of the tennis court and the players a set had just been finished and young charles westmacott was hitting up the balls as high as he could send them in the middle of the ground doctor walker and mrs westmacott were pacing up and down the lawn the lady waving her racket as she emphasized her remarks and the doctor listening with slanting head and little nods of agreement against the rails at the near end harold was leaning in his flannels talking to the two sisters who stood listening to him with their long dark shadows streaming down the lawn behind them the girls were dressed alike in dark skirts with light pink tennis blouses and pink bands on their straw hats so that as they stood with the soft red of the setting sun tinging their faces clara demure and quiet ida mischievous and daring it was a group which might have pleased the eye of a more exacting critic than the old sailor  yes he looks happy mother he repeated with a chuckle it is not so long ago since it was you and i who were standing like that and i dont remember that we were very unhappy either it was croquet in our time and the ladies had not reefed in their skirts quite so taut what year would it be just before the commission of the penelope  mrs hay denver ran her fingers through his grizzled hair it was when you came back in the antelope just before you got your step  ah the old antelope what a clipper she was she could sail two points nearer the wind than anything of her tonnage in the service you remember her mother you saw her come into plymouth bay wasnt she a beauty  she was indeed dear but when i say that i think that harold is not happy i mean in his daily life has it never struck you how thoughtful he is at times and how absentminded  in love perhaps the young dog he seems to have found snug moorings now at any rate  i think that it is very likely that you are right willy answered the mother seriously but with which of them  i cannot tell  well they are very charming girls both of them but as long as he hangs in the wind between the two it cannot be serious after all the boy is fourandtwenty and he made five hundred pounds last year he is better able to marry than i was when i was lieutenant  i think that we can see which it is now remarked the observant mother charles westmacott had ceased to knock the tennis balls about and was chatting with clara walker while ida and harold denver were still talking by the railing with little outbursts of laughter presently a fresh set was formed and doctor walker the odd man out came through the wicket gate and strolled up the garden walk  good evening mrs hay denver said he raising his broad straw hat may i come in  good evening doctor pray do  try one of these said the admiral holding out his cigarcase they are not bad i got them on the mosquito coast i was thinking of signaling to you but you seemed so very happy out there  mrs westmacott is a very clever woman said the doctor lighting the cigar by the way you spoke about the mosquito coast just now did you see much of the hyla when you were out there  no such name on the list answered the seaman with decision theres the hydra a harbor defense turretship but she never leaves the home waters  the doctor laughed we live in two separate worlds said he the hyla is the little green tree frog and beale has founded some of his views on protoplasm upon the appearances of its nerve cells it is a subject in which i take an interest  there were vermin of all sorts in the woods when i have been on river service i have heard it at night like the engineroom when you are on the measured mile you cant sleep for the piping and croaking and chirping great scott what a woman that is she was across the lawn in three jumps she would have made a captain of the foretop in the old days  she is a very remarkable woman  a very cranky one  a very sensible one in some things remarked mrs hay denver  look at that now cried the admiral with a lunge of his forefinger at the doctor you mark my words walker if we dont look out that woman will raise a mutiny with her preaching heres my wife disaffected already and your girls will be no better we must combine man or theres an end of all discipline  no doubt she is a little excessive in her views said the doctor but in the main i think as she does  bravo doctor cried the lady  what turned traitor to your sex well courtmartial you as a deserter  she is quite right the professions are not sufficiently open to women they are still far too much circumscribed in their employments they are a feeble folk the women who have to work for their breadpoor unorganized timid taking as a favor what they might demand as a right that is why their case is not more constantly before the public for if their cry for redress was as great as their grievance it would fill the world to the exclusion of all others it is all very well for us to be courteous to the rich the refined those to whom life is already made easy it is a mere form a trick of manner if we are truly courteous we shall stoop to lift up struggling womanhood when she really needs our helpwhen it is life and death to her whether she has it or not and then to cant about it being unwomanly to work in the higher professions it is womanly enough to starve but unwomanly to use the brains which god has given them is it not a monstrous contention  the admiral chuckled you are like one of these phonographs walker said he you have had all this talked into you and now you are reeling it off again its rank mutiny every word of it for man has his duties and woman has hers but they are as separate as their natures are i suppose that we shall have a woman hoisting her pennant on the flagship presently and taking command of the channel squadron  well you have a woman on the throne taking command of the whole nation remarked his wife and everybody is agreed that she does it better than any of the men  the admiral was somewhat staggered by this homethrust thats quite another thing said he  you should come to their next meeting i am to take the chair i have just promised mrs westmacott that i will do so but it has turned chilly and it is time that the girls were indoors good night i shall look out for you after breakfast for our constitutional admiral  the old sailor looked after his friend with a twinkle in his eyes  how old is he mother  about fifty i think  and mrs westmacott  i heard that she was fortythree  the admiral rubbed his hands and shook with amusement well find one of these days that three and two make one said he ill bet you a new bonnet on it mother     chapter iv a sisters secret   tell me miss walker you know how things should be what would you say was a good profession for a young man of twentysix who has had no education worth speaking about and who is not very quick by nature the speaker was charles westmacott and the time this same summer evening in the tennis ground though the shadows had fallen now and the game been abandoned  the girl glanced up at him amused and surprised  do you mean yourself  precisely  but how could i tell  i have no one to advise me i believe that you could do it better than any one i feel confidence in your opinion  it is very flattering she glanced up again at his earnest questioning face with its saxon eyes and drooping flaxen mustache in some doubt as to whether he might be joking on the contrary all his attention seemed to be concentrated upon her answer  it depends so much upon what you can do you know i do not know you sufficiently to be able to say what natural gifts you have they were walking slowly across the lawn in the direction of the house  i have none that is to say none worth mentioning i have no memory and i am very slow  but you are very strong  oh if that goes for anything i can put up a hundredpound bar till further orders but what sort of a calling is that  some little joke about being called to the bar flickered up in miss walkers mind but her companion was in such obvious earnest that she stifled down her inclination to laugh  i can do a mile on the cindertrack in 450 and acrosscountry in 520 but how is that to help me i might be a cricket professional but it is not a very dignified position not that i care a straw about dignity you know but i should not like to hurt the old ladys feelings  your aunts  yes my aunts my parents were killed in the mutiny you know when i was a baby and she has looked after me ever since she has been very good to me im sorry to leave her  but why should you leave her they had reached the garden gate and the girl leaned her racket upon the top of it looking up with grave interest at her big whiteflanneled companion  its browning said he  what  dont tell my aunt that i said ithe sank his voice to a whisperi hate browning  clara walker rippled off into such a merry peal of laughter that he forgot the evil things which he had suffered from the poet and burst out laughing too  i cant make him out said he i try but he is one too many no doubt it is very stupid of me i dont deny it but as long as i cannot there is no use pretending that i can and then of course she feels hurt for she is very fond of him and likes to read him aloud in the evenings she is reading a piece now pippa passes and i assure you miss walker that i dont even know what the title means you must think me a dreadful fool  but surely he is not so incomprehensible as all that she said as an attempt at encouragement  he is very bad there are some things you know which are fine that ride of the three dutchmen and herve riel and others they are all right but there was a piece we read last week the first line stumped my aunt and it takes a good deal to do that for she rides very straight setebos and setebos and setebos that was the line  it sounds like a charm  no it is a gentlemans name three gentlemen i thought at first but my aunt says one then he goes on thinketh he dwelleth in the light of the moon it was a very trying piece  clara walker laughed again  you must not think of leaving your aunt she said think how lonely she would be without you  well yes i have thought of that but you must remember that my aunt is to all intents hardly middleaged and a very eligible person i dont think that her dislike to mankind extends to individuals she might form new ties and then i should be a third wheel in the coach it was all very well as long as i was only a boy when her first husband was alive  but good gracious you dont mean that mrs westmacott is going to marry again gasped clara  the young man glanced down at her with a question in his eyes oh it is only a remote possibility you know said he still of course it might happen and i should like to know what i ought to turn my hand to  i wish i could help you said clara but i really know very little about such things however i could talk to my father who knows a very great deal of the world  i wish you would i should be so glad if you would  then i certainly will and now i must say goodnight mr westmacott for papa will be wondering where i am  good night miss walker he pulled off his flannel cap and stalked away through the gathering darkness  clara had imagined that they had been the last on the lawn but looking back from the steps which led up to the french windows she saw two dark figures moving across towards the house as they came nearer she could distinguish that they were harold denver and her sister ida the murmur of their voices rose up to her ears and then the musical little childlike laugh which she knew so well i am so delighted she heard her sister say so pleased and proud i had no idea of it your words were such a surprise and a joy to me oh i am so glad  is that you ida  oh there is clara i must go in mr denver goodnight  there were a few whispered words a laugh from ida and a goodnight miss walker out of the darkness clara took her sisters hand and they passed together through the long folding window the doctor had gone into his study and the diningroom was empty a single small red lamp upon the sideboard was reflected tenfold by the plate about it and the mahogany beneath it though its single wick cast but a feeble light into the large dimly shadowed room ida danced off to the big central lamp but clara put her hand upon her arm i rather like this quiet light said she why should we not have a chat she sat in the doctors large red plush chair and her sister cuddled down upon the footstool at her feet glancing up at her elder with a smile upon her lips and a mischievous gleam in her eyes there was a shade of anxiety in claras face which cleared away as she gazed into her sisters frank blue eyes  have you anything to tell me dear she asked  ida gave a little pout and shrug to her shoulder the solicitorgeneral then opened the case for the prosecution said she you are going to crossexamine me clara so dont deny it i do wish you would have that grey satin foulard of yours done up with a little trimming and a new white vest it would look as good as new and it is really very dowdy  you were quite late upon the lawn said the inexorable clara  yes i was rather so were you have you anything to tell me she broke away into her merry musical laugh  i was chatting with mr westmacott  and i was chatting with mr denver by the way clara now tell me truly what do you think of mr denver do you like him honestly now  i like him very much indeed i think that he is one of the most gentlemanly modest manly young men that i have ever known so now dear have you nothing to tell me clara smoothed down her sisters golden hair with a motherly gesture and stooped her face to catch the expected confidence she could wish nothing better than that ida should be the wife of harold denver and from the words which she had overheard as they left the lawn that evening she could not doubt that there was some understanding between them  but there came no confession from ida only the same mischievous smile and amused gleam in her deep blue eyes  that grey foulard dress she began  oh you little tease come now i will ask you what you have just asked me do you like harold denver  oh hes a darling  ida  well you asked me thats what i think of him and now you dear old inquisitive you will get nothing more out of me so you must wait and not be too curious im going off to see what papa is doing she sprang to her feet threw her arms round her sisters neck gave her a final squeeze and was gone a chorus from olivette sung in her clear contralto grew fainter and fainter until it ended in the slam of a distant door  but clara walker still sat in the dimlit room with her chin upon her hands and her dreamy eyes looking out into the gathering gloom it was the duty of her a maiden to play the part of a motherto guide another in paths which her own steps had not yet trodden since her mother died not a thought had been given to herself all was for her father and her sister in her own eyes she was herself very plain and she knew that her manner was often ungracious when she would most wish to be gracious she saw her face as the glass reflected it but she did not see the changing play of expression which gave it its charmthe infinite pity the sympathy the sweet womanliness which drew towards her all who were in doubt and in trouble even as poor slowmoving charles westmacott had been drawn to her that night she was herself she thought outside the pale of love but it was very different with ida merry little quickwitted brightfaced ida she was born for love it was her inheritance but she was young and innocent she must not be allowed to venture too far without help in those dangerous waters some understanding there was between her and harold denver in her heart of hearts clara like every good woman was a matchmaker and already she had chosen denver of all men as the one to whom she could most safely confide ida he had talked to her more than once on the serious topics of life on his aspirations on what a man could do to leave the world better for his presence she knew that he was a man of a noble nature highminded and earnest and yet she did not like this secrecy this disinclination upon the part of one so frank and honest as ida to tell her what was passing she would wait and if she got the opportunity next day she would lead harold denver himself on to this topic it was possible that she might learn from him what her sister had refused to tell her     chapter v a naval conquest   it was the habit of the doctor and the admiral to accompany each other upon a morning ramble between breakfast and lunch the dwellers in those quiet treelined roads were accustomed to see the two figures the long thin austere seaman and the short bustling tweedclad physician pass and repass with such regularity that a stopped clock has been reset by them the admiral took two steps to his companions three but the younger man was the quicker and both were equal to a good four and a half miles an hour  it was a lovely summer day which followed the events which have been described the sky was of the deepest blue with a few white fleecy clouds drifting lazily across it and the air was filled with the low drone of insects or with a sudden sharper note as bee or bluefly shot past with its quivering longdrawn hum like an insect tuningfork as the friends topped each rise which leads up to the crystal palace they could see the dun clouds of london stretching along the northern skyline with spire or dome breaking through the lowlying haze the admiral was in high spirits for the morning post had brought good news to his son  it is wonderful walker he was saying positively wonderful the way that boy of mine has gone ahead during the last three years we heard from pearson today pearson is the senior partner you know and my boy the juniorpearson and denver the firm cunning old dog is pearson as cute and as greedy as a rio shark yet he goes off for a fortnights leave and puts my boy in full charge with all that immense business in his hands and a freehand to do what he likes with it hows that for confidence and he only three years upon change  any one would confide in him his face is a surety said the doctor  go on walker the admiral dug his elbow at him you know my weak side still its truth all the same ive been blessed with a good wife and a good son and maybe i relish them the more for having been cut off from them so long i have much to be thankful for  and so have i the best two girls that ever stepped theres clara who has learned up as much medicine as would give her the lsa simply in order that she may sympathize with me in my work but hullo what is this coming along  all drawing and the wind astern cried the admiral fourteen knots if its one why by george it is that woman  a rolling cloud of yellow dust had streamed round the curve of the road and from the heart of it had emerged a high tandem tricycle flying along at a breakneck pace in front sat mrs westmacott clad in a heather tweed peajacket a skirt which just passed her knees and a pair of thick gaiters of the same material she had a great bundle of red papers under her arm while charles who sat behind her clad in norfolk jacket and knickerbockers bore a similar roll protruding from either pocket even as they watched the pair eased up the lady sprang off impaled one of her bills upon the garden railing of an empty house and then jumping on to her seat again was about to hurry onwards when her nephew drew her attention to the two gentlemen upon the footpath  oh now really i didnt notice you said she taking a few turns of the treadle and steering the machine across to them is it not a beautiful morning  lovely answered the doctor you seem to be very busy  i am very busy she pointed to the colored paper which still fluttered from the railing we have been pushing our propaganda you see charles and i have been at it since seven oclock it is about our meeting i wish it to be a great success see she smoothed out one of the bills and the doctor read his own name in great black letters across the bottom  we dont forget our chairman you see everybody is coming those two dear little old maids opposite the williamses held out for some time but i have their promise now admiral i am sure that you wish us well  hum i wish you no harm maam  you will come on the platform  ill be no i dont think i can do that  to our meeting then  no maam i dont go out after dinner  oh yes you will come i will call in if i may and chat it over with you when you come home we have not breakfasted yet goodbye there was a whir of wheels and the yellow cloud rolled away down the road again by some legerdemain the admiral found that he was clutching in his right hand one of the obnoxious bills he crumpled it up and threw it into the roadway  ill be hanged if i go walker said he as he resumed his walk ive never been hustled into doing a thing yet whether by woman or man  i am not a betting man answered the doctor but i rather think that the odds are in favor of your going  the admiral had hardly got home and had just seated himself in his diningroom when the attack upon him was renewed he was slowly and lovingly unfolding the times preparatory to the long read which led up to luncheon and had even got so far as to fasten his golden pincenez on to his thin highbridged nose when he heard a crunching of gravel and looking over the top of his paper saw mrs westmacott coming up the garden walk she was still dressed in the singular costume which offended the sailors oldfashioned notions of propriety but he could not deny as he looked at her that she was a very fine woman in many climes he had looked upon women of all shades and ages but never upon a more clearcut handsome face nor a more erect supple and womanly figure he ceased to glower as he gazed upon her and the frown smoothed away from his rugged brow  may i come in said she framing herself in the open window with a background of green sward and blue sky i feel like an invader deep in an enemys country  it is a very welcome invasion maam said he clearing his throat and pulling at his high collar try this garden chair what is there that i can do for you shall i ring and let mrs denver know that you are here  pray do not trouble admiral i only looked in with reference to our little chat this morning i wish that you would give us your powerful support at our coming meeting for the improvement of the condition of woman  no maam i cant do that he pursed up his lips and shook his grizzled head  and why not  against my principles maam  but why  because woman has her duties and man has his i may be oldfashioned but that is my view why what is the world coming to i was saying to dr walker only last night that we shall have a woman wanting to command the channel fleet next  that is one of the few professions which cannot be improved said mrs westmacott with her sweetest smile poor woman must still look to man for protection  i dont like these newfangled ideas maam i tell you honestly that i dont i like discipline and i think every one is the better for it women have got a great deal which they had not in the days of our fathers they have universities all for themselves i am told and there are women doctors i hear surely they should rest contented what more can they want  you are a sailor and sailors are always chivalrous if you could see how things really are you would change your opinion what are the poor things to do there are so many of them and so few things to which they can turn their hands governesses but there are hardly any situations music and drawing there is not one in fifty who has any special talent in that direction medicine it is still surrounded with difficulties for women and it takes many years and a small fortune to qualify nursing it is hard work ill paid and none but the strongest can stand it what would you have them do then admiral sit down and starve  tut tut it is not so bad as that  the pressure is terrible advertise for a lady companion at ten shillings a week which is less than a cooks wage and see how many answers you get there is no hope no outlook for these struggling thousands life is a dull sordid struggle leading down to a cheerless old age yet when we try to bring some little ray of hope some chance however distant of something better we are told by chivalrous gentlemen that it is against their principles to help  the admiral winced but shook his head in dissent  there is banking the law veterinary surgery government offices the civil service all these at least should be thrown freely open to women if they have brains enough to compete successfully for them then if woman were unsuccessful it would be her own fault and the majority of the population of this country could no longer complain that they live under a different law to the minority and that they are held down in poverty and serfdom with every road to independence sealed to them  what would you propose to do maam  to set the more obvious injustices right and so to pave the way for a reform now look at that man digging in the field i know him he can neither read nor write he is steeped in whisky and he has as much intelligence as the potatoes that he is digging yet the man has a vote can possibly turn the scale of an election and may help to decide the policy of this empire now to take the nearest example here am i a woman who have had some education who have traveled and who have seen and studied the institutions of many countries i hold considerable property and i pay more in imperial taxes than that man spends in whisky which is saying a great deal and yet i have no more direct influence upon the disposal of the money which i pay than that fly which creeps along the wall is that right is it fair  the admiral moved uneasily in his chair yours is an exceptional case said he  but no woman has a voice consider that the women are a majority in the nation yet if there was a question of legislation upon which all women were agreed upon one side and all the men upon the other it would appear that the matter was settled unanimously when more than half the population were opposed to it is that right  again the admiral wriggled it was very awkward for the gallant seaman to have a handsome woman opposite to him bombarding him with questions to none of which he could find an answer couldnt even get the tompions out of his guns as he explained the matter to the doctor that evening  now those are really the points that we shall lay stress upon at the meeting the free and complete opening of the professions the final abolition of the zenana i call it and the franchise to all women who pay queens taxes above a certain sum surely there is nothing unreasonable in that nothing which could offend your principles we shall have medicine law and the church all rallying that night for the protection of woman is the navy to be the one profession absent  the admiral jumped out of his chair with an evil word in his throat there there maam he cried drop it for a time i have heard enough youve turned me a point or two i wont deny it but let it stand at that i will think it over  certainly admiral we would not hurry you in your decision but we still hope to see you on our platform she rose and moved about in her lounging masculine fashion from one picture to another for the walls were thickly covered with reminiscences of the admirals voyages  hullo said she surely this ship would have furled all her lower canvas and reefed her topsails if she found herself on a lee shore with the wind on her quarter  of course she would the artist was never past gravesend i swear its the penelope as she was on the 14th of june 1857 in the throat of the straits of banca with the island of banca on the starboard bow and sumatra on the port he painted it from description but of course as you very sensibly say all was snug below and she carried storm sails and doublereefed topsails for it was blowing a cyclone from the soueast i compliment you maam i do indeed  oh i have done a little sailoring myselfas much as a woman can aspire to you know this is the bay of funchal what a lovely frigate  lovely you say ah she was lovely that is the andromeda i was a mate aboard of hersublieutenant they call it now though i like the old name best  what a lovely rake her masts have and what a curve to her bows she must have been a clipper  the old sailor rubbed his hands and his eyes glistened his old ships bordered close upon his wife and his son in his affections  i know funchal said the lady carelessly a couple of years ago i had a seventon cutterrigged yacht the banshee and we ran over to madeira from falmouth  you maam in a seventonner  with a couple of cornish lads for a crew oh it was glorious a fortnight right out in the open with no worries no letters no callers no petty thoughts nothing but the grand works of god the tossing sea and the great silent sky they talk of riding indeed i am fond of horses too but what is there to compare with the swoop of a little craft as she pitches down the long steep side of a wave and then the quiver and spring as she is tossed upwards again oh if our souls could transmigrate id be a seamew above all birds that fly but i keep you admiral adieu  the old sailor was too transported with sympathy to say a word he could only shake her broad muscular hand she was halfway down the garden path before she heard him calling her and saw his grizzled head and weatherstained face looking out from behind the curtains  you may put me down for the platform he cried and vanished abashed behind the curtain of his times where his wife found him at lunch time  i hear that you have had quite a long chat with mrs westmacott said she  yes and i think that she is one of the most sensible women that i ever knew  except on the womans rights question of course  oh i dont know she had a good deal to say for herself on that also in fact mother i have taken a platform ticket for her meeting     chapter vi an old story   but this was not to be the only eventful conversation which mrs westmacott held that day nor was the admiral the only person in the wilderness who was destined to find his opinions considerably changed two neighboring families the winslows from anerley and the cumberbatches from gipsy hill had been invited to tennis by mrs westmacott and the lawn was gay in the evening with the blazers of the young men and the bright dresses of the girls to the older people sitting round in their wickerwork garden chairs the darting stooping springing white figures the sweep of skirts and twinkle of canvas shoes the click of the rackets and sharp whiz of the balls with the continual fifteen lovefifteen all of the marker made up a merry and exhilarating scene to see their sons and daughters so flushed and healthy and happy gave them also a reflected glow and it was hard to say who had most pleasure from the game those who played or those who watched  mrs westmacott had just finished a set when she caught a glimpse of clara walker sitting alone at the farther end of the ground she ran down the court cleared the net to the amazement of the visitors and seated herself beside her claras reserved and refined nature shrank somewhat from the boisterous frankness and strange manners of the widow and yet her feminine instinct told her that beneath all her peculiarities there lay much that was good and noble she smiled up at her therefore and nodded a greeting  why arent you playing then dont for goodness sake begin to be languid and young ladyish when you give up active sports you give up youth  i have played a set mrs westmacott  thats right my dear she sat down beside her and tapped her upon the arm with her tennis racket i like you my dear and i am going to call you clara you are not as aggressive as i should wish clara but still i like you very much selfsacrifice is all very well you know but we have had rather too much of it on our side and should like to see a little on the other what do you think of my nephew charles  the question was so sudden and unexpected that clara gave quite a jump in her chair iii hardly ever have thought of your nephew charles  no oh you must think him well over for i want to speak to you about him  to me but why  it seemed to me most delicate you see clara the matter stands in this way it is quite possible that i may soon find myself in a completely new sphere of life which will involve fresh duties and make it impossible for me to keep up a household which charles can share  clara stared did this mean that she was about to marry again what else could it point to  therefore charles must have a household of his own that is obvious now i dont approve of bachelor establishments do you  really mrs westmacott i have never thought of the matter  oh you little sly puss was there ever a girl who never thought of the matter i think that a young man of sixandtwenty ought to be married  clara felt very uncomfortable the awful thought had come upon her that this ambassadress had come to her as a proxy with a proposal of marriage but how could that be she had not spoken more than three or four times with her nephew and knew nothing more of him than he had told her on the evening before it was impossible then and yet what could his aunt mean by this discussion of his private affairs  do you not think yourself she persisted that a young man of sixandtwenty is better married  i should think that he is old enough to decide for himself  yes yes he has done so but charles is just a little shy just a little slow in expressing himself i thought that i would pave the way for him two women can arrange these things so much better men sometimes have a difficulty in making themselves clear  i really hardly follow you mrs westmacott cried clara in despair  he has no profession but he has nice tastes he reads browning every night and he is most amazingly strong when he was younger we used to put on the gloves together but i cannot persuade him to now for he says he cannot play light enough i should allow him five hundred which should be enough at first  my dear mrs westmacott cried clara i assure you that i have not the least idea what it is that you are talking of  do you think your sister ida would have my nephew charles  her sister ida quite a little thrill of relief and of pleasure ran through her at the thought ida and charles westmacott she had never thought of it and yet they had been a good deal together they had played tennis they had shared the tandem tricycle again came the thrill of joy and close at its heels the cold questionings of conscience why this joy what was the real source of it was it that deep down somewhere pushed back in the black recesses of the soul there was the thought lurking that if charles prospered in his wooing then harold denver would still be free how mean how unmaidenly how unsisterly the thought she crushed it down and thrust it aside but still it would push up its wicked little head she crimsoned with shame at her own baseness as she turned once more to her companion  i really do not know she said  she is not engaged  not that i know of  you speak hesitatingly  because i am not sure but he may ask she cannot but be flattered  quite so i tell him that it is the most practical compliment which a man can pay to a woman he is a little shy but when he sets himself to do it he will do it he is very much in love with her i assure you these little lively people always do attract the slow and heavy ones which is natures device for the neutralizing of bores but they are all going in i think if you will allow me that i will just take the opportunity to tell him that as far as you know there is no positive obstacle in the way  as far as i know clara repeated as the widow moved away to where the players were grouped round the net or sauntering slowly towards the house she rose to follow her but her head was in a whirl with new thoughts and she sat down again which would be best for ida harold or charles she thought it over with as much solicitude as a mother who plans for her only child harold had seemed to her to be in many ways the noblest and the best young man whom she had known if ever she was to love a man it would be such a man as that but she must not think of herself she had reason to believe that both these men loved her sister which would be the best for her but perhaps the matter was already decided she could not forget the scrap of conversation which she had heard the night before nor the secret which her sister had refused to confide to her if ida would not tell her there was but one person who could she raised her eyes and there was harold denver standing before her  you were lost in your thoughts said he smiling i hope that they were pleasant ones  oh i was planning said she rising it seems rather a waste of time as a rule for things have a way of working themselves out just as you least expect  what were you planning then  the future  whose  oh my own and idas  and was i included in your joint futures  i hope all our friends were included  dont go in said he as she began to move slowly towards the house i wanted to have a word let us stroll up and down the lawn perhaps you are cold if you are i could bring you out a shawl  oh no i am not cold  i was speaking to your sister ida last night she noticed that there was a slight quiver in his voice and glancing up at his dark clearcut face she saw that he was very grave she felt that it was settled that he had come to ask her for her sisters hand  she is a charming girl said he after a pause  indeed she is cried clara warmly and no one who has not lived with her and known her intimately can tell how charming and good she is she is like a sunbeam in the house  no one who was not good could be so absolutely happy as she seems to be heavens last gift i think is a mind so pure and a spirit so high that it is unable even to see what is impure and evil in the world around us for as long as we can see it how can we be truly happy  she has a deeper side also she does not turn it to the world and it is not natural that she should for she is very young but she thinks and has aspirations of her own  you cannot admire her more than i do indeed miss walker i only ask to be brought into nearer relationship with her and to feel that there is a permanent bond between us  it had come at last for a moment her heart was numbed within her and then a flood of sisterly love carried all before it down with that dark thought which would still try to raise its unhallowed head she turned to harold with sparkling eyes and words of pleasure upon her lips  i should wish to be near and dear to both of you said he as he took her hand i should wish ida to be my sister and you my wife  she said nothing she only stood looking at him with parted lips and great dark questioning eyes the lawn had vanished away the sloping gardens the brick villas the darkening sky with half a pale moon beginning to show over the chimneytops all was gone and she was only conscious of a dark earnest pleading face and of a voice far away disconnected from herself the voice of a man telling a woman how he loved her he was unhappy said the voice his life was a void there was but one thing that could save him he had come to the parting of the ways here lay happiness and honor and all that was high and noble there lay the soulkilling round the lonely life the base pursuit of money the sordid selfish aims he needed but the hand of the woman that he loved to lead him into the better path and how he loved her his life would show he loved her for her sweetness for her womanliness for her strength he had need of her would she not come to him and then of a sudden as she listened it came home to her that the man was harold denver and that she was the woman and that all gods work was very beautifulthe green sward beneath her feet the rustling leaves the long orange slashes in the western sky she spoke she scarce knew what the broken words were but she saw the light of joy shine out on his face and her hand was still in his as they wandered amid the twilight they said no more now but only wandered and felt each others presence all was fresh around them familiar and yet new tinged with the beauty of their newfound happiness  did you not know it before he asked i did not dare to think it  what a mask of ice i must wear how could a man feel as i have done without showing it your sister at least knew  ida  it was last night she began to praise you i said what i felt and then in an instant it was all out  but what could youwhat could you see in me oh i do pray that you may not repent it the gentle heart was ruffled amid its joy by the thought of its own unworthiness  repent it i feel that i am a saved man you do not know how degrading this city life is how debasing and yet how absorbing money for ever clinks in your ear you can think of nothing else from the bottom of my heart i hate it and yet how can i draw back without bringing grief to my dear old father there was but one way in which i could defy the taint and that was by having a home influence so pure and so high that it may brace me up against all that draws me down i have felt that influence already i know that when i am talking to you i am a better man it is you who must go with me through life or i must walk for ever alone  oh harold i am so happy still they wandered amid the darkening shadows while one by one the stars peeped out in the blue black sky above them at last a chill night wind blew up from the east and brought them back to the realities of life  you must go in you will be cold  my father will wonder where i am shall i say anything to him  if you like my darling or i will in the morning i must tell my mother tonight i know how delighted she will be  i do hope so  let me take you up the garden path it is so dark your lamp is not lit yet there is the window till tomorrow then dearest  till tomorrow harold  my own darling he stooped and their lips met for the first time then as she pushed open the folding windows she heard his quick firm step as it passed down the graveled path a lamp was lit as she entered the room and there was ida dancing about like a mischievous little fairy in front of her  and have you anything to tell me she asked with a solemn face then suddenly throwing her arms round her sisters neck oh you dear dear old clara i am so pleased i am so pleased     chapter vii venit tandem felicitas   it was just three days after the doctor and the admiral had congratulated each other upon the closer tie which was to unite their two families and to turn their friendship into something even dearer and more intimate that miss ida walker received a letter which caused her some surprise and considerable amusement it was dated from next door and was handed in by the redheaded page after breakfast  dear miss ida began this curious document and then relapsed suddenly into the third person mr charles westmacott hopes that he may have the extreme pleasure of a ride with miss ida walker upon his tandem tricycle mr charles westmacott will bring it round in half an hour you in front yours very truly charles westmacott the whole was written in a large loosejointed and schoolboyish hand very thin on the up strokes and thick on the down as though care and pains had gone to the fashioning of it  strange as was the form the meaning was clear enough so ida hastened to her room and had hardly slipped on her light grey cycling dress when she saw the tandem with its large occupant at the door he handed her up to her saddle with a more solemn and thoughtful face than was usual with him and a few moments later they were flying along the beautiful smooth suburban roads in the direction of forest hill the great limbs of the athlete made the heavy machine spring and quiver with every stroke while the mignon grey figure with the laughing face and the golden curls blowing from under the little pinkbanded straw hat simply held firmly to her perch and let the treadles whirl round beneath her feet mile after mile they flew the wind beating in her face the trees dancing past in two long ranks on either side until they had passed round croydon and were approaching norwood once more from the further side  arent you tired she asked glancing over her shoulder and turning towards him a little pink ear a fluffy golden curl and one blue eye twinkling from the very corner of its lid  not a bit i am just getting my swing  isnt it wonderful to be strong you always remind me of a steamengine  why a steamengine  well because it is so powerful and reliable and unreasoning well i didnt mean that last you know butbutyou know what i mean what is the matter with you  why  because you have something on your mind you have not laughed once  he broke into a gruesome laugh i am quite jolly said he  oh no you are not and why did you write me such a dreadfully stiff letter  there now he cried i was sure it was stiff i said it was absurdly stiff  then why write it  it wasnt my own composition  whose then your aunts  oh no it was a person of the name of slattery  goodness who is he  i knew it would come out i felt that it would youve heard of slattery the author  never  he is wonderful at expressing himself he wrote a book called the secret solved or letterwriting made easy it gives you models of all sorts of letters  ida burst out laughing so you actually copied one  it was to invite a young lady to a picnic but i set to work and soon got it changed so that it would do very well slattery seems never to have asked any one to ride a tandem but when i had written it it seemed so dreadfully stiff that i had to put a little beginning and end of my own which seemed to brighten it up a good deal   i thought there was something funny about the beginning and end  did you fancy your noticing the difference in style how quick you are i am very slow at things like that i ought to have been a woodman or gamekeeper or something i was made on those lines but i have found something now  what is that then  ranching i have a chum in texas and he says it is a rare life i am to buy a share in his business it is all in the open airshooting and riding and sport would itwould it inconvenience you much ida to come out there with me  ida nearly fell off her perch in her amazement the only words of which she could think were my goodness me so she said them  if it would not upset your plans or change your arrangements in any way he had slowed down and let go of the steering handle so that the great machine crawled aimlessly about from one side of the road to the other i know very well that i am not clever or anything of that sort but still i would do all i can to make you very happy dont you think that in time you might come to like me a little bit  ida gave a cry of fright i wont like you if you run me against a brick wall she said as the machine rasped up against the curb do attend to the steering  yes i will but tell me ida whether you will come with me  oh i dont know its too absurd how can we talk about such things when i cannot see you you speak to the nape of my neck and then i have to twist my head round to answer  i know that was why i put you in front upon my letter i thought that it would make it easier but if you would prefer it i will stop the machine and then you can sit round and talk about it  good gracious cried ida fancy our sitting face to face on a motionless tricycle in the middle of the road and all the people looking out of their windows at us  it would look rather funny wouldnt it well then suppose that we both get off and push the tandem along in front of us  oh no this is better than that  or i could carry the thing  ida burst out laughing that would be more absurd still  then we will go quietly and i will look out for the steering i wont talk about it at all if you would rather not but i really do love you very much and you would make me happy if you came to texas with me and i think that perhaps after a time i could make you happy too  but your aunt  oh she would like it very much i can understand that your father might not like to lose you im sure i wouldnt either if i were he but after all america is not very far off nowadays and is not so very wild we would take a grand piano andanda copy of browning and denver and his wife would come over to see us we should be quite a family party it would be jolly  ida sat listening to the stumbling words and awkward phrases which were whispered from the back of her but there was something in charles westmacotts clumsiness of speech which was more moving than the words of the most eloquent of pleaders he paused he stammered he caught his breath between the words and he blurted out in little blunt phrases all the hopes of his heart if love had not come to her yet there was at least pity and sympathy which are nearly akin to it wonder there was also that one so weak and frail as she should shake this strong man so should have the whole course of his life waiting for her decision her left hand was on the cushion at her side he leaned forward and took it gently in his own she did not try to draw it back from him  may i have it said he for life  oh do attend to your steering said she smiling round at him and dont say any more about this today please dont  when shall i know then  oh tonight tomorrow i dont know i must ask clara talk about something else  and they did talk about something else but her left hand was still enclosed in his and he knew without asking again that all was well     chapter viii shadows before   mrs westmacotts great meeting for the enfranchisement of woman had passed over and it had been a triumphant success all the maids and matrons of the southern suburbs had rallied at her summons there was an influential platform with dr balthazar walker in the chair and admiral hay denver among his more prominent supporters one benighted male had come in from the outside darkness and had jeered from the further end of the hall but he had been called to order by the chair petrified by indignant glances from the unenfranchised around him and finally escorted to the door by charles westmacott fiery resolutions were passed to be forwarded to a large number of leading statesmen and the meeting broke up with the conviction that a shrewd blow had been struck for the cause of woman  but there was one woman at least to whom the meeting and all that was connected with it had brought anything but pleasure clara walker watched with a heavy heart the friendship and close intimacy which had sprung up between her father and the widow from week to week it had increased until no day ever passed without their being together the coming meeting had been the excuse for these continual interviews but now the meeting was over and still the doctor would refer every point which rose to the judgment of his neighbor he would talk too to his two daughters of her strength of character her decisive mind and of the necessity of their cultivating her acquaintance and following her example until at last it had become his most common topic of conversation  all this might have passed as merely the natural pleasure which an elderly man might take in the society of an intelligent and handsome woman but there were other points which seemed to clara to give it a deeper meaning she could not forget that when charles westmacott had spoken to her one night he had alluded to the possibility of his aunt marrying again he must have known or noticed something before he would speak upon such a subject and then again mrs westmacott had herself said that she hoped to change her style of living shortly and take over completely new duties what could that mean except that she expected to marry and whom she seemed to see few friends outside their own little circle she must have alluded to her father it was a hateful thought and yet it must be faced  one evening the doctor had been rather late at his neighbors he used to go into the admirals after dinner but now he turned more frequently in the other direction when he returned clara was sitting alone in the drawingroom reading a magazine she sprang up as he entered pushed forward his chair and ran to fetch his slippers  you are looking a little pale dear he remarked  oh no papa i am very well  all well with harold  yes his partner mr pearson is still away and he is doing all the work  well done he is sure to succeed where is ida  in her room i think  she was with charles westmacott on the lawn not very long ago he seems very fond of her he is not very bright but i think he will make her a good husband  i am sure of it papa he is very manly and reliable  yes i should think that he is not the sort of man who goes wrong there is nothing hidden about him as to his brightness it really does not matter for his aunt mrs westmacott is very rich much richer than you would think from her style of living and she has made him a handsome provision  i am glad of that  it is between ourselves i am her trustee and so i know something of her arrangements and when are you going to marry clara  oh papa not for some time yet we have not thought of a date  well really i dont know that there is any reason for delay he has a competence and it increases yearly as long as you are quite certain that your mind is made up  oh papa  well then i really do not know why there should be any delay and ida too must be married within the next few months now what i want to know is what i am to do when my two little companions run away from me he spoke lightly but his eyes were grave as he looked questioningly at his daughter  dear papa you shall not be alone it will be years before harold and i think of marrying and when we do you must come and live with us  no no dear i know that you mean what you say but i have seen something of the world and i know that such arrangements never answer there cannot be two masters in a house and yet at my age my freedom is very necessary to me  but you would be completely free  no dear you cannot be that if you are a guest in another mans house can you suggest no other alternative  that we remain with you  no no that is out of the question mrs westmacott herself says that a womans first duty is to marry marriage however should be an equal partnership as she points out i should wish you both to marry but still i should like a suggestion from you clara as to what i should do  but there is no hurry papa let us wait i do not intend to marry yet  doctor walker looked disappointed well clara if you can suggest nothing i suppose that i must take the initiative myself said he  then what do you propose papa she braced herself as one who sees the blow which is about to fall  he looked at her and hesitated how like your poor dear mother you are clara he cried as i looked at you then it was as if she had come back from the grave he stooped towards her and kissed her there run away to your sister my dear and do not trouble yourself about me nothing is settled yet but you will find that all will come right  clara went upstairs sad at heart for she was sure now that what she had feared was indeed about to come to pass and that her father was going to take mrs westmacott to be his wife in her pure and earnest mind her mothers memory was enshrined as that of a saint and the thought that any one should take her place seemed a terrible desecration even worse however did this marriage appear when looked at from the point of view of her fathers future the widow might fascinate him by her knowledge of the world her dash her strength her unconventionalityall these qualities clara was willing to allow herbut she was convinced that she would be unendurable as a life companion she had come to an age when habits are not lightly to be changed nor was she a woman who was at all likely to attempt to change them how would a sensitive man like her father stand the constant strain of such a wife a woman who was all decision with no softness and nothing soothing in her nature it passed as a mere eccentricity when they heard of her stout drinking her cigarette smoking her occasional whiffs at a long clay pipe her horsewhipping of a drunken servant and her companionship with the snake eliza whom she was in the habit of bearing about in her pocket all this would become unendurable to her father when his first infatuation was past for his own sake then as well as for her mothers memory this match must be prevented and yet how powerless she was to prevent it what could she do could harold aid her perhaps or ida at least she would tell her sister and see what she could suggest  ida was in her boudoir a tiny little tapestried room as neat and dainty as herself with low walls hung with imari plaques and with pretty little swiss brackets bearing blue kaga ware or the pure white coalport china in a low chair beneath a red shaded standing lamp sat ida in a diaphanous evening dress of mousseline de soie the ruddy light tinging her sweet childlike face and glowing on her golden curls she sprang up as her sister entered and threw her arms around her  dear old clara come and sit down here beside me i have not had a chat for days but oh what a troubled face what is it then she put up her forefinger and smoothed her sisters brow with it  clara pulled up a stool and sitting down beside her sister passed her arm round her waist i am so sorry to trouble you dear ida she said but i do not know what to do  theres nothing the matter with harold  oh no ida  nor with my charles  no no  ida gave a sigh of relief you quite frightened me dear said she you cant think how solemn you look what is it then  i believe that papa intends to ask mrs westmacott to marry him  ida burst out laughing what can have put such a notion into your head clara  it is only too true ida i suspected it before and he himself almost told me as much with his own lips tonight i dont think that it is a laughing matter  really i could not help it if you had told me that those two dear old ladies opposite the misses williams were both engaged you would not have surprised me more it is really too funny  funny ida think of any one taking the place of dear mother  but her sister was of a more practical and less sentimental nature i am sure said she that dear mother would like papa to do whatever would make him most happy we shall both be away and why should papa not please himself  but think how unhappy he will be you know how quiet he is in his ways and how even a little thing will upset him how could he live with a wife who would make his whole life a series of surprises fancy what a whirlwind she must be in a house a man at his age cannot change his ways i am sure he would be miserable  idas face grew graver and she pondered over the matter for a few minutes i really think that you are right as usual said she at last i admire charlies aunt very much you know and i think that she is a very useful and good person but i dont think she would do as a wife for poor quiet papa  but he will certainly ask her and i really think that she intends to accept him then it would be too late to interfere we have only a few days at the most and what can we do how can we hope to make him change his mind  again ida pondered he has never tried what it is to live with a strongminded woman said she if we could only get him to realize it in time oh clara i have it i have it such a lovely plan she leaned back in her chair and burst into a fit of laughter so natural and so hearty that clara had to forget her troubles and to join in it  oh it is beautiful she gasped at last poor papa what a time he will have but its all for his own good as he used to say when we had to be punished when we were little oh clara i do hope your heart wont fail you  i would do anything to save him dear  thats it you must steel yourself by that thought  but what is your plan  oh i am so proud of it we will tire him for ever of the widow and of all emancipated women let me see what are mrs westmacotts main ideas you have listened to her more than i women should attend less to household duties that is one is it not  yes if they feel they have capabilities for higher things then she thinks that every woman who has leisure should take up the study of some branch of science and that as far as possible every woman should qualify herself for some trade or profession choosing for preference those which have been hitherto monopolized by men to enter the others would only be to intensify the present competition  quite so that is glorious her blue eyes were dancing with mischief and she clapped her hands in her delight what else she thinks that whatever a man can do a woman should be allowed to do alsodoes she not  she says so  and about dress the short skirt and the divided skirt are what she believes in  yes  we must get in some cloth  why  we must make ourselves a dress each a brandnew enfranchised emancipated dress dear dont you see my plan we shall act up to all mrs westmacotts views in every respect and improve them when we can then papa will know what it is to live with a woman who claims all her rights oh clara it will be splendid  her milder sister sat speechless before so daring a scheme but it would be wrong ida she cried at last  not a bit it is to save him  i should not dare  oh yes you would harold will help besides what other plan have you  i have none  then you must take mine  yes perhaps you are right well we do it for a good motive  you will do it  i do not see any other way  you dear good clara now i will show you what you are to do we must not begin too suddenly it might excite suspicion  what would you do then  tomorrow we must go to mrs westmacott and sit at her feet and learn all her views  what hypocrites we shall feel  we shall be her newest and most enthusiastic converts oh it will be such fun clara then we shall make our plans and send for what we want and begin our new life  i do hope that we shall not have to keep it up long it seems so cruel to dear papa  cruel to save him  i wish i was sure that we were doing right and yet what else can we do well then ida the die is cast and we will call upon mrs westmacott tomorrow     chapter ix a family plot   little did poor doctor walker imagine as he sat at his breakfasttable next morning that the two sweet girls who sat on either side of him were deep in a conspiracy and that he munching innocently at his muffins was the victim against whom their wiles were planned patiently they waited until at last their opening came  it is a beautiful day he remarked it will do for mrs westmacott she was thinking of having a spin upon the tricycle  then we must call early we both intended to see her after breakfast  oh indeed the doctor looked pleased  you know pa said ida it seems to us that we really have a very great advantage in having mrs westmacott living so near  why so dear  well because she is so advanced you know if we only study her ways we may advance ourselves also  i think i have heard you say papa clara remarked that she is the type of the woman of the future  i am very pleased to hear you speak so sensibly my dears i certainly think that she is a woman whom you may very well take as your model the more intimate you are with her the better pleased i shall be  then that is settled said clara demurely and the talk drifted to other matters  all the morning the two girls sat extracting from mrs westmacott her most extreme view as to the duty of the one sex and the tyranny of the other absolute equality even in details was her ideal enough of the parrot cry of unwomanly and unmaidenly it had been invented by man to scare woman away when she poached too nearly upon his precious preserves every woman should be independent every woman should learn a trade it was their duty to push in where they were least welcome then they were martyrs to the cause and pioneers to their weaker sisters why should the washtub the needle and the housekeepers book be eternally theirs might they not reach higher to the consultingroom to the bench and even to the pulpit mrs westmacott sacrificed her tricycle ride in her eagerness over her pet subject and her two fair disciples drank in every word and noted every suggestion for future use that afternoon they went shopping in london and before evening strange packages began to be handed in at the doctors door the plot was ripe for execution and one of the conspirators was merry and jubilant while the other was very nervous and troubled  when the doctor came down to the diningroom next morning he was surprised to find that his daughters had already been up some time ida was installed at one end of the table with a spiritlamp a curved glass flask and several bottles in front of her the contents of the flask were boiling furiously while a villainous smell filled the room clara lounged in an armchair with her feet upon a second one a bluecovered book in her hand and a huge map of the british islands spread across her lap hullo cried the doctor blinking and sniffing wheres the breakfast  oh didnt you order it asked ida  i no why should i he rang the bell why have you not laid the breakfast jane  if you please sir miss ida was a workin at the table  oh of course jane said the young lady calmly i am so sorry i shall be ready to move in a few minutes  but what on earth are you doing ida asked the doctor the smell is most offensive and good gracious look at the mess which you have made upon the cloth why you have burned a hole right through  oh that is the acid ida answered contentedly mrs westmacott said that it would burn holes  you might have taken her word for it without trying said her father dryly  but look here pa see what the book says the scientific mind takes nothing upon trust prove all things i have proved that  you certainly have well until breakfast is ready ill glance over the times have you seen it  the times oh dear me this is it which i have under my spiritlamp i am afraid there is some acid upon that too and it is rather damp and torn here it is  the doctor took the bedraggled paper with a rueful face everything seems to be wrong today he remarked what is this sudden enthusiasm about chemistry ida  oh i am trying to live up to mrs westmacotts teaching  quite right quite right said he though perhaps with less heartiness than he had shown the day before ah here is breakfast at last  but nothing was comfortable that morning there were eggs without eggspoons toast which was leathery from being kept driedup rashers and grounds in the coffee above all there was that dreadful smell which pervaded everything and gave a horrible twang to every mouthful  i dont wish to put a damper upon your studies ida said the doctor as he pushed back his chair but i do think it would be better if you did your chemical experiments a little later in the day  but mrs westmacott says that women should rise early and do their work before breakfast  then they should choose some other room besides the breakfastroom the doctor was becoming just a little ruffled a turn in the open air would soothe him he thought where are my boots he asked  but they were not in their accustomed corner by his chair up and down he searched while the three servants took up the quest stooping and peeping under bookcases and drawers ida had returned to her studies and clara to her bluecovered volume sitting absorbed and disinterested amid the bustle and the racket at last a general buzz of congratulation announced that the cook had discovered the boots hung up among the hats in the hall the doctor very red and flustered drew them on and stamped off to join the admiral in his morning walk  as the door slammed ida burst into a shout of laughter you see clara she cried the charm works already he has gone to number one instead of to number three oh we shall win a great victory youve been very good dear i could see that you were on thorns to help him when he was looking for his boots  poor papa it is so cruel and yet what are we to do  oh he will enjoy being comfortable all the more if we give him a little discomfort now what horrible work this chemistry is look at my frock it is ruined and this dreadful smell she threw open the window and thrust her little goldencurled head out of it charles westmacott was hoeing at the other side of the garden fence  good morning sir said ida  good morning the big man leaned upon his hoe and looked up at her  have you any cigarettes charles  yes certainly  throw me up two  here is my case can you catch  a sealskin case came with a soft thud on to the floor ida opened it it was full  what are these she asked  egyptians  what are some other brands  oh richmond gems and turkish and cambridge but why  never mind she nodded to him and closed the window we must remember all those clara said she we must learn to talk about such things mrs westmacott knows all about the brands of cigarettes has your rum come  yes dear it is here  and i have my stout come along up to my room now this smell is too abominable but we must be ready for him when he comes back if we sit at the window we shall see him coming down the road  the fresh morning air and the genial company of the admiral had caused the doctor to forget his troubles and he came back about midday in an excellent humor as he opened the hall door the vile smell of chemicals which had spoilt his breakfast met him with a redoubled virulence he threw open the hall window entered the diningroom and stood aghast at the sight which met his eyes  ida was still sitting among her bottles with a lit cigarette in her left hand and a glass of stout on the table beside her clara with another cigarette was lounging in the easy chair with several maps spread out upon the floor around her feet were stuck up on the coal scuttle and she had a tumblerful of some reddishbrown composition on the smoking table close at her elbow the doctor gazed from one to the other of them through the thin grey haze of smoke but his eyes rested finally in a settled stare of astonishment upon his elder and more serious daughter  clara he gasped i could not have believed it  what is it papa  you are smoking  trying to papa i find it a little difficult for i have not been used to it  but why in the name of goodness  mrs westmacott recommends it  oh a lady of mature years may do many things which a young girl must avoid  oh no cried ida mrs westmacott says that there should be one law for all have a cigarette pa  no thank you i never smoke in the morning  no perhaps you dont care for the brand what are these clara  egyptians  ah we must have some richmond gems or turkish i wish pa when you go into town you would get me some turkish  i will do nothing of the kind i do not at all think that it is a fitting habit for young ladies i do not agree with mrs westmacott upon the point  really pa it was you who advised us to imitate her  but with discrimination what is it that you are drinking clara  rum papa  rum in the morning he sat down and rubbed his eyes as one who tries to shake off some evil dream did you say rum  yes pa they all drink it in the profession which i am going to take up  profession clara  mrs westmacott says that every woman should follow a calling and that we ought to choose those which women have always avoided  quite so  well i am going to act upon her advice i am going to be a pilot  my dear clara a pilot this is too much  this is a beautiful book papa the lights beacons buoys channels and landmarks of great britain here is another the master mariners handbook you cant imagine how interesting it is  you are joking clara you must be joking  not at all pa you cant think what a lot i have learned already im to carry a green light to starboard and a red to port with a white light at the masthead and a flareup every fifteen minutes  oh wont it look pretty at night cried her sister  and i know the fogsignals one blast means that a ship steers to starboard two to port three astern four that it is unmanageable but this man asks such dreadful questions at the end of each chapter listen to this you see a red light the ship is on the port tack and the wind at north what course is that ship steering to a point  the doctor rose with a gesture of despair i cant imagine what has come over you both said he  my dear papa we are trying hard to live up to mrs westmacotts standard  well i must say that i do not admire the result your chemistry ida may perhaps do no harm but your scheme clara is out of the question how a girl of your sense could ever entertain such a notion is more than i can imagine but i must absolutely forbid you to go further with it  but pa asked ida with an air of innocent inquiry in her big blue eyes what are we to do when your commands and mrs westmacotts advice are opposed you told us to obey her she says that when women try to throw off their shackles their fathers brothers and husbands are the very first to try to rivet them on again and that in such a matter no man has any authority  does mrs westmacott teach you that i am not the head of my own house the doctor flushed and his grizzled hair bristled in his anger  certainly she says that all heads of houses are relics of the dark ages  the doctor muttered something and stamped his foot upon the carpet then without a word he passed out into the garden and his daughters could see him striding furiously up and down cutting off the heads of the flowers with a switch  oh you darling you played your part so splendidly cried ida  but how cruel it is when i saw the sorrow and surprise in his eyes i very nearly put my arms about him and told him all dont you think we have done enough  no no no not nearly enough you must not turn weak now clara it is so funny that i should be leading you it is quite a new experience but i know i am right if we go on as we are doing we shall be able to say all our lives that we have saved him and if we dont oh clara we should never forgive ourselves     chapter x women of the future   from that day the doctors peace was gone never was a quiet and orderly household transformed so suddenly into a bear garden or a happy man turned into such a completely miserable one he had never realized before how entirely his daughters had shielded him from all the friction of life now that they had not only ceased to protect him but had themselves become a source of trouble to him he began to understand how great the blessing was which he had enjoyed and to sigh for the happy days before his girls had come under the influence of his neighbor  you dont look happy mrs westmacott had remarked to him one morning you are pale and a little off color you should come with me for a ten mile spin upon the tandem  i am troubled about my girls they were walking up and down in the garden from time to time there sounded from the house behind them the long sad wail of a french horn  that is ida said he she has taken to practicing on that dreadful instrument in the intervals of her chemistry and clara is quite as bad i declare it is getting quite unendurable  ah doctor doctor she cried shaking her forefinger with a gleam of her white teeth you must live up to your principlesyou must give your daughters the same liberty as you advocate for other women  liberty madam certainly but this approaches to license  the same law for all my friend she tapped him reprovingly on the arm with her sunshade when you were twenty your father did not i presume object to your learning chemistry or playing a musical instrument you would have thought it tyranny if he had  but there is such a sudden change in them both  yes i have noticed that they have been very enthusiastic lately in the cause of liberty of all my disciples i think that they promise to be the most devoted and consistent which is the more natural since their father is one of our most trusted champions  the doctor gave a twitch of impatience i seem to have lost all authority he cried  no no my dear friend they are a little exuberant at having broken the trammels of custom that is all  you cannot think what i have had to put up with madam it has been a dreadful experience last night after i had extinguished the candle in my bedroom i placed my foot upon something smooth and hard which scuttled from under me imagine my horror i lit the gas and came upon a wellgrown tortoise which clara has thought fit to introduce into the house i call it a filthy custom to have such pets  mrs westmacott dropped him a little courtesy thank you sir said she that is a nice little side hit at my poor eliza  i give you my word that i had forgotten about her cried the doctor flushing one such pet may no doubt be endured but two are more than i can bear ida has a monkey which lives on the curtain rod it is a most dreadful creature it will remain absolutely motionless until it sees that you have forgotten its presence and then it will suddenly bound from picture to picture all round the walls and end by swinging down on the bellrope and jumping on to the top of your head at breakfast it stole a poached egg and daubed it all over the door handle ida calls these outrages amusing tricks  oh all will come right said the widow reassuringly  and clara is as bad clara who used to be so good and sweet the very image of her poor mother she insists upon this preposterous scheme of being a pilot and will talk of nothing but revolving lights and hidden rocks and codes of signals and nonsense of the kind  but why preposterous asked his companion what nobler occupation can there be than that of stimulating commerce and aiding the mariner to steer safely into port i should think your daughter admirably adapted for such duties  then i must beg to differ from you madam  still you are inconsistent  excuse me madam i do not see the matter in the same light and i should be obliged to you if you would use your influence with my daughter to dissuade her  you wish to make me inconsistent too  then you refuse  i am afraid that i cannot interfere  the doctor was very angry very well madam said he in that case i can only say that i have the honor to wish you a very good morning he raised his broad straw hat and strode away up the gravel path while the widow looked after him with twinkling eyes she was surprised herself to find that she liked the doctor better the more masculine and aggressive he became it was unreasonable and against all principle and yet so it was and no argument could mend the matter  very hot and angry the doctor retired into his room and sat down to read his paper ida had retired and the distant wails of the bugle showed that she was upstairs in her boudoir clara sat opposite to him with her exasperating charts and her blue book the doctor glanced at her and his eyes remained fixed in astonishment upon the front of her skirt  my dear clara he cried you have torn your skirt  his daughter laughed and smoothed out her frock to his horror he saw the red plush of the chair where the dress ought to have been it is all torn he cried what have you done  my dear papa said she what do you know about the mysteries of ladies dress this is a divided skirt  then he saw that it was indeed so arranged and that his daughter was clad in a sort of loose extremely long knickerbockers  it will be so convenient for my seaboots she explained  her father shook his head sadly your dear mother would not have liked it clara said he  for a moment the conspiracy was upon the point of collapsing there was something in the gentleness of his rebuke and in his appeal to her mother which brought the tears to her eyes and in another instant she would have been kneeling beside him with everything confessed when the door flew open and her sister ida came bounding into the room she wore a short grey skirt like that of mrs westmacott and she held it up in each hand and danced about among the furniture  i feel quite the gaiety girl she cried how delicious it must be to be upon the stage you cant think how nice this dress is papa one feels so free in it and isnt clara charming  go to your room this instant and take it off thundered the doctor i call it highly improper and no daughter of mine shall wear it  papa improper why it is the exact model of mrs westmacotts  i say it is improper and yours also clara your conduct is really outrageous you drive me out of the house i am going to my club in town i have no comfort or peace of mind in my own house i will stand it no longer i may be late tonighti shall go to the british medical meeting but when i return i shall hope to find that you have reconsidered your conduct and that you have shaken yourself clear of the pernicious influences which have recently made such an alteration in your conduct he seized his hat slammed the diningroom door and a few minutes later they heard the crash of the big front gate  victory clara victory cried ida still pirouetting around the furniture did you hear what he said pernicious influences dont you understand clara why do you sit there so pale and glum why dont you get up and dance  oh i shall be so glad when it is over ida i do hate to give him pain surely he has learned now that it is very unpleasant to spend ones life with reformers  he has almost learned it clara just one more little lesson we must not risk all at this last moment  what would you do ida oh dont do anything too dreadful i feel that we have gone too far already  oh we can do it very nicely you see we are both engaged and that makes it very easy harold will do what you ask him especially as you have told him the reason why and my charles will do it without even wanting to know the reason now you know what mrs westmacott thinks about the reserve of young ladies mere prudery affectation and a relic of the dark ages of the zenana those were her words were they not  what then  well now we must put it in practice we are reducing all her other views to practice and we must not shirk this one  but what would you do oh dont look so wicked ida you look like some evil little fairy with your golden hair and dancing mischievous eyes i know that you are going to propose something dreadful  we must give a little supper tonight  we a supper  why not young gentlemen give suppers why not young ladies  but whom shall we invite  why harold and charles of course  and the admiral and mrs hay denver  oh no that would be very oldfashioned we must keep up with the times clara  but what can we give them for supper  oh something with a nice fast rollicking lateatnightkind of flavor to it let me see champagne of courseand oysters oysters will do in the novels all the naughty people take champagne and oysters besides they wont need any cooking how is your pocketmoney clara  i have three pounds  and i have one four pounds i have no idea how much champagne costs have you  not the slightest  how many oysters does a man eat  i cant imagine  ill write and ask charles no i wont ill ask jane ring for her clara she has been a cook and is sure to know  jane on being crossquestioned refused to commit herself beyond the statement that it depended upon the gentleman and also upon the oysters the united experience of the kitchen however testified that three dozen was a fair provision  then we shall have eight dozen altogether said ida jotting down all her requirements upon a sheet of paper and two pints of champagne and some brown bread and vinegar and pepper thats all i think it is not so very difficult to give a supper after all is it clara  i dont like it ida it seems to me to be so very indelicate  but it is needed to clinch the matter no no there is no drawing back now clara or we shall ruin everything papa is sure to come back by the 945 he will reach the door at 10 we must have everything ready for him now just sit down at once and ask harold to come at nine oclock and i shall do the same to charles  the two invitations were dispatched received and accepted harold was already a confidant and he understood that this was some further development of the plot as to charles he was so accustomed to feminine eccentricity in the person of his aunt that the only thing which could surprise him would be a rigid observance of etiquette at nine oclock they entered the diningroom of number 2 to find the master of the house absent a redshaded lamp a snowy cloth a pleasant little feast and the two whom they would have chosen as their companions a merrier party never met and the house rang with their laughter and their chatter  it is three minutes to ten cried clara suddenly glancing at the clock  good gracious so it is now for our little tableau ida pushed the champagne bottles obtrusively forward in the direction of the door and scattered oyster shells over the cloth  have you your pipe charles  my pipe yes  then please smoke it now dont argue about it but do it for you will ruin the effect otherwise  the large man drew out a red case and extracted a great yellow meerschaum out of which a moment later he was puffing thick wreaths of smoke harold had lit a cigar and both the girls had cigarettes  that looks very nice and emancipated said ida glancing round now i shall lie on this sofa so now charles just sit here and throw your arm carelessly over the back of the sofa no dont stop smoking i like it clara dear put your feet upon the coalscuttle and do try to look a little dissipated i wish we could crown ourselves with flowers there are some lettuces on the sideboard oh dear here he is i hear his key she began to sing in her high fresh voice a little snatch from a french song with a swinging tra lala chorus  the doctor had walked home from the station in a peaceable and relenting frame of mind feeling that perhaps he had said too much in the morning that his daughters had for years been models in every way and that if there had been any change of late it was as they said themselves on account of their anxiety to follow his advice and to imitate mrs westmacott he could see clearly enough now that that advice was unwise and that a world peopled with mrs westmacotts would not be a happy or a soothing one it was he who was himself to blame and he was grieved by the thought that perhaps his hot words had troubled and saddened his two girls  this fear however was soon dissipated as he entered his hall he heard the voice of ida uplifted in a rollicking ditty and a very strong smell of tobacco was borne to his nostrils he threw open the diningroom door and stood aghast at the scene which met his eyes  the room was full of the blue wreaths of smoke and the lamplight shone through the thin haze upon goldtopped bottles plates napkins and a litter of oyster shells and cigarettes ida flushed and excited was reclining upon the settee a wineglass at her elbow and a cigarette between her fingers while charles westmacott sat beside her with his arm thrown over the head of the sofa with the suggestion of a caress on the other side of the room clara was lounging in an armchair with harold beside her both smoking and both with wineglasses beside them the doctor stood speechless in the doorway staring at the bacchanalian scene  come in papa do cried ida wont you have a glass of champagne  pray excuse me said her father coldly i feel that i am intruding i did not know that you were entertaining perhaps you will kindly let me know when you have finished you will find me in my study he ignored the two young men completely and closing the door retired deeply hurt and mortified to his room a quarter of an hour afterwards he heard the door slam and his two daughters came to announce that the guests were gone  guests whose guests he cried angrily what is the meaning of this exhibition  we have been giving a little supper papa they were our guests  oh indeed the doctor laughed sarcastically you think it right then to entertain young bachelors late at night to smoke and drink with them to oh that i should ever have lived to blush for my own daughters i thank god that your dear mother never saw the day  dearest papa cried clara throwing her arms about him do not be angry with us if you understood all you would see that there is no harm in it  no harm miss who is the best judge of that  mrs westmacott suggested ida slyly  the doctor sprang from his chair confound mrs westmacott he cried striking frenziedly into the air with his hands am i to hear of nothing but this woman is she to confront me at every turn i will endure it no longer  but it was your wish papa  then i will tell you now what my second and wiser wish is and we shall see if you will obey it as you have the first  of course we will papa  then my wish is that you should forget these odious notions which you have imbibed that you should dress and act as you used to do before ever you saw this woman and that in future you confine your intercourse with her to such civilities as are necessary between neighbors  we are to give up mrs westmacott  or give up me  oh dear dad how can you say anything so cruel cried ida burrowing her towsy golden hair into her fathers shirt front while clara pressed her cheek against his whisker of course we shall give her up if you prefer it  of course we shall papa  the doctor patted the two caressing heads these are my own two girls again he cried it has been my fault as much as yours i have been astray and you have followed me in my error it was only by seeing your mistake that i have become conscious of my own let us set it aside and neither say nor think anything more about it     chapter xi a blot from the blue   so by the cleverness of two girls a dark cloud was thinned away and turned into sunshine over one of them alas another cloud was gathering which could not be so easily dispersed of these three households which fate had thrown together two had already been united by ties of love it was destined however that a bond of another sort should connect the westmacotts with the hay denvers  between the admiral and the widow a very cordial feeling had existed since the day when the old seaman had hauled down his flag and changed his opinions granting to the yachtswoman all that he had refused to the reformer his own frank and downright nature respected the same qualities in his neighbor and a friendship sprang up between them which was more like that which exists between two men founded upon esteem and a community of tastes  by the way admiral said mrs westmacott one morning as they walked together down to the station i understand that this boy of yours in the intervals of paying his devotions to miss walker is doing something upon change  yes maam and there is no man of his age who is doing so well hes drawing ahead i can tell you maam some of those that started with him are hull down astarn now he touched his five hundred last year and before hes thirty hell be making the four figures  the reason i asked is that i have small investments to make myself from time to time and my present broker is a rascal i should be very glad to do it through your son  it is very kind of you maam his partner is away on a holiday and harold would like to push on a bit and show what he can do you know the poop isnt big enough to hold the lieutenant when the skippers on shore  i suppose he charges the usual half per cent  dont know im sure maam ill swear that he does what is right and proper  that is what i usually payten shillings in the hundred pounds if you see him before i do just ask him to get me five thousand in new zealands it is at four just now and i fancy it may rise  five thousand exclaimed the admiral reckoning it in his own mind lemme see thats twentyfive pounds commission a nice days work upon my word it is a very handsome order maam  well i must pay some one and why not him  ill tell him and im sure hell lose no time  oh there is no great hurry by the way i understand from what you said just now that he has a partner  yes my boy is the junior partner pearson is the senior i was introduced to him years ago and he offered harold the opening of course we had a pretty stiff premium to pay  mrs westmacott had stopped and was standing very stiffly with her red indian face even grimmer than usual  pearson said she jeremiah pearson  the same  then its all off she cried you need not carry out that investment  very well maam  they walked on together side by side she brooding over some thought of her own and he a little crossed and disappointed at her caprice and the lost commission for harold  i tell you what admiral she exclaimed suddenly if i were you i should get your boy out of this partnership  but why madam  because he is tied to one of the deepest slyest foxes in the whole city of london  jeremiah pearson maam what can you know of him he bears a good name  no one in this world knows jeremiah pearson as i know him admiral i warn you because i have a friendly feeling both for you and for your son the man is a rogue and you had best avoid him  but these are only words maam do you tell me that you know him better than the brokers and jobbers in the city  man cried mrs westmacott will you allow that i know him when i tell you that my maiden name was ada pearson and that jeremiah is my only brother  the admiral whistled whew cried he now that i think of it there is a likeness  he is a man of iron admirala man without a heart i should shock you if i were to tell you what i have endured from my brother my fathers wealth was divided equally between us his own share he ran through in five years and he has tried since then by every trick of a cunning lowminded man by base cajolery by legal quibbles by brutal intimidation to juggle me out of my share as well there is no villainy of which the man is not capable oh i know my brother jeremiah i know him and i am prepared for him  this is all new to me maam pon my word i hardly know what to say to it i thank you for having spoken so plainly from what you say this is a poor sort of consort for a man to sail with perhaps harold would do well to cut himself adrift  without losing a day  well we shall talk it over you may be sure of that but here we are at the station so i will just see you into your carriage and then home to see what my wife says to the matter  as he trudged homewards thoughtful and perplexed he was surprised to hear a shout behind him and to see harold running down the road after him  why dad he cried i have just come from town and the first thing i saw was your back as you marched away but you are such a quick walker that i had to run to catch you  the admirals smile of pleasure had broken his stern face into a thousand wrinkles you are early today said he  yes i wanted to consult you  nothing wrong  oh no only an inconvenience  what is it then  how much have we in our private account  pretty fair some eight hundred i think  oh half that will be ample it was rather thoughtless of pearson  what then  well you see dad when he went away upon this little holiday to havre he left me to pay accounts and so on he told me that there was enough at the bank for all claims i had occasion on tuesday to pay away two cheques one for l80 and the other for l120 and here they are returned with a bank notice that we have already overdrawn to the extent of some hundreds  the admiral looked very grave whats the meaning of that then he asked  oh it can easily be set right you see pearson invests all the spare capital and keeps as small a margin as possible at the bank still it was too bad for him to allow me even to run a risk of having a cheque returned i have written to him and demanded his authority to sell out some stock and i have written an explanation to these people in the meantime however i have had to issue several cheques so i had better transfer part of our private account to meet them  quite so my boy all thats mine is yours but who do you think this pearson is he is mrs westmacotts brother  really what a singular thing well i can see a likeness now that you mention it they have both the same hard type of face  she has been warning me against himsays he is the rankest pirate in london i hope that it is all right boy and that we may not find ourselves in broken water  harold had turned a little pale as he heard mrs westmacotts opinion of his senior partner it gave shape and substance to certain vague fears and suspicions of his own which had been pushed back as often as they obtruded themselves as being too monstrous and fantastic for belief  he is a wellknown man in the city dad said he  of course he isof course he is that is what i told her they would have found him out there if anything had been amiss with him bless you theres nothing so bitter as a family quarrel still it is just as well that you have written about this affair for we may as well have all fair and aboveboard  but harolds letter to his partner was crossed by a letter from his partner to harold it lay awaiting him upon the breakfast table next morning and it sent the heart into his mouth as he read it and caused him to spring up from his chair with a white face and staring eyes  my boy my boy  i am ruined motherruined he stood gazing wildly in front of him while the sheet of paper fluttered down on the carpet then he dropped back into the chair and sank his face into his hands his mother had her arms round him in an instant while the admiral with shaking fingers picked up the letter from the floor and adjusted his glasses to read it   my dear denver it ran by the time that this reaches you i shall be out of the reach of yourself or of any one else who may desire an interview you need not search for me for i assure you that this letter is posted by a friend and that you will have your trouble in vain if you try to find me i am sorry to leave you in such a tight place but one or other of us must be squeezed and on the whole i prefer that it should be you youll find nothing in the bank and about l13000 unaccounted for im not sure that the best thing you can do is not to realize what you can and imitate your seniors example if you act at once you may get clean away if not its not only that you must put up your shutters but i am afraid that this missing money could hardly be included as an ordinary debt and of course you are legally responsible for it just as much as i am take a friends advice and get to america a young man with brains can always do something out there and you can live down this little mischance it will be a cheap lesson if it teaches you to take nothing upon trust in business and to insist upon knowing exactly what your partner is doing however senior he may be to you  yours faithfully  jeremiah pearson   great heavens groaned the admiral he has absconded  and left me both a bankrupt and a thief  no no harold sobbed his mother all will be right what matter about money  money mother it is my honor  the boy is right it is his honor and my honor for his is mine this is a sore trouble mother when we thought our lifes troubles were all behind us but we will bear it as we have borne others he held out his stringy hand and the two old folk sat with bowed grey heads their fingers intertwined strong in each others love and sympathy  we were too happy she sighed  but it is gods will mother  yes john it is gods will  and yet it is bitter to bear i could have lost all the house money ranki could have borne it but at my agemy honorthe honor of an admiral of the fleet  no honor can be lost john where no dishonor has been done what have you done what has harold done there is no question of honor  the old man shook his head but harold had already called together his clear practical sense which for an instant in the presence of this frightful blow had deserted him  the mater is right dad said he it is bad enough heaven knows but we must not take too dark a view of it after all this insolent letter is in itself evidence that i had nothing to do with the schemes of the base villain who wrote it  they may think it prearranged  they could not my whole life cries out against the thought they could not look me in the face and entertain it  no boy not if they have eyes in their heads cried the admiral plucking up courage at the sight of the flashing eyes and brave defiant face we have the letter and we have your character well weather it yet between them its my fault from the beginning for choosing such a landshark for your consort god help me i thought i was finding such an opening for you  dear dad how could you possibly know as he says in his letter it has given me a lesson but he was so much older and so much more experienced that it was hard for me to ask to examine his books but we must waste no time i must go to the city  what will you do  what an honest man should do i will write to all our clients and creditors assemble them lay the whole matter before them read them the letter and put myself absolutely in their hands  thats it boyyardarm to yardarm and have it over  i must go at once he put on his topcoat and his hat but i have ten minutes yet before i can catch a train there is one little thing which i must do before i start  he had caught sight through the long glass folding door of the gleam of a white blouse and a straw hat in the tennis ground clara used often to meet him there of a morning to say a few words before he hurried away into the city he walked out now with the quick firm step of a man who has taken a momentous resolution but his face was haggard and his lips pale  clara said he as she came towards him with words of greeting i am sorry to bring ill news to you but things have gone wrong in the city andand i think that i ought to release you from your engagement  clara stared at him with her great questioning dark eyes and her face became as pale as his  how can the city affect you and me harold  it is dishonor i cannot ask you to share it  dishonor the loss of some miserable gold and silver coins  oh clara if it were only that we could be far happier together in a little cottage in the country than with all the riches of the city poverty could not cut me to the heart as i have been cut this morning why it is but twenty minutes since i had the letter clara and it seems to me to be some old old thing which happened far away in my past life some horrid black cloud which shut out all the freshness and the peace from it  but what is it then what do you fear worse than poverty  to have debts that i cannot meet to be hammered upon change and declared a bankrupt to know that others have a just claim upon me and to feel that i dare not meet their eyes is not that worse than poverty  yes harold a thousand fold worse but all this may be got over is there nothing more  my partner has fled and left me responsible for heavy debts and in such a position that i may be required by the law to produce some at least of this missing money it has been confided to him to invest and he has embezzled it i as his partner am liable for it i have brought misery on all whom i lovemy father my mother but you at least shall not be under the shadow you are free clara there is no tie between us  it takes two to make such a tie harold said she smiling and putting her hand inside his arm it takes two to make it dear and also two to break it is that the way they do business in the city sir that a man can always at his own sweet will tear up his engagement  you hold me to it clara  no creditor so remorseless as i harold never never shall you get from that bond  but i am ruined my whole life is blasted  and so you wish to ruin me and blast my life also no indeed sir you shall not get away so lightly but seriously now harold you would hurt me if it were not so absurd do you think that a womans love is like this sunshade which i carry in my hand a thing only fitted for the sunshine and of no use when the winds blow and the clouds gather  i would not drag you down clara  should i not be dragged down indeed if i left your side at such a time it is only now that i can be of use to you help you sustain you you have always been so strong so above me you are strong still but then two will be stronger besides sir you have no idea what a woman of business i am papa says so and he knows  harold tried to speak but his heart was too full he could only press the white hand which curled round his sleeve she walked up and down by his side prattling merrily and sending little gleams of cheeriness through the gloom which girt him in to listen to her he might have thought that it was ida and not her staid and demure sister who was chatting to him  it will soon be cleared up she said and then we shall feel quite dull of course all business men have these little ups and downs why i suppose of all the men you meet upon change there is not one who has not some such story to tell if everything was always smooth you know then of course every one would turn stockbroker and you would have to hold your meetings in hyde park how much is it that you need  more than i can ever get not less than thirteen thousand pounds  claras face fell as she heard the amount what do you purpose doing  i shall go to the city now and i shall ask all our creditors to meet me tomorrow i shall read them pearsons letter and put myself into their hands  and they what will they do  what can they do they will serve writs for their money and the firm will be declared bankrupt  and the meeting will be tomorrow you say will you take my advice  what is it clara  to ask them for a few days of delay who knows what new turn matters may take  what turn can they take i have no means of raising the money  let us have a few days  oh we should have that in the ordinary course of business the legal formalities would take them some little time but i must go clara i must not seem to shirk my place now must be at my offices  yes dear you are right god bless you and guard you i shall be here in the wilderness but all day i shall be by your office table at throgmorton street in spirit and if ever you should be sad you will hear my little whisper in your ear and know that there is one client whom you will never be able to get rid ofnever as long as we both live dear     chapter xii friends in need   now papa said clara that morning wrinkling her brows and putting her fingertips together with the air of an experienced person of business i want to have a talk to you about money matters  yes my dear he laid down his paper and looked a question  kindly tell me again papa how much money i have in my very own right you have often told me before but i always forget figures  you have two hundred and fifty pounds a year of your own under your aunts will  and ida  ida has one hundred and fifty  now i think i can live very well on fifty pounds a year papa i am not very extravagant and i could make my own dresses if i had a sewingmachine  very likely dear  in that case i have two hundred a year which i could do without  if it were necessary  but it is necessary oh do help me like a good dear kind papa in this matter for my whole heart is set upon it harold is in sore need of money and through no fault of his own with a womans tact and eloquence she told the whole story put yourself in my place papa what is the money to me i never think of it from years end to years end but now i know how precious it is i could not have thought that money could be so valuable see what i can do with it it may help to save him i must have it by tomorrow oh do do advise me as to what i should do and how i should get the money  the doctor smiled at her eagerness you are as anxious to get rid of money as others are to gain it said he in another case i might think it rash but i believe in your harold and i can see that he has had villainous treatment you will let me deal with the matter  you papa  it can be done best between men your capital clara is some five thousand pounds but it is out on a mortgage and you could not call it in  oh dear oh dear  but we can still manage i have as much at my bank i will advance it to the denvers as coming from you and you can repay it to me or the interest of it when your money becomes due  oh that is beautiful how sweet and kind of you  but there is one obstacle i do not think that you would ever induce harold to take this money  claras face fell dont you think so really  i am sure that he would not  then what are you to do what horrid things money matters are to arrange  i shall see his father we can manage it all between us  oh do do papa and you will do it soon  there is no time like the present i will go in at once he scribbled a cheque put it in an envelope put on his broad straw hat and strolled in through the garden to pay his morning call  it was a singular sight which met his eyes as he entered the sittingroom of the admiral a great sea chest stood open in the center and all round upon the carpet were little piles of jerseys oilskins books sextant boxes instruments and seaboots the old seaman sat gravely amidst this lumber turning it over and examining it intently while his wife with the tears running silently down her ruddy cheeks sat upon the sofa her elbows upon her knees and her chin upon her hands rocking herself slowly backwards and forwards  hullo doctor said the admiral holding out his hand theres foul weather set in upon us as you may have heard but i have ridden out many a worse squall and please god we shall all three of us weather this one also though two of us are a little more cranky than we were  my dear friends i came in to tell you how deeply we sympathize with you all my girl has only just told me about it  it has come so suddenly upon us doctor sobbed mrs hay denver i thought that i had john to myself for the rest of our livesheaven knows that we have not seen very much of each otherbut now he talks of going to sea again  aye aye walker thats the only way out of it when i first heard of it i was thrown up in the wind with all aback i give you my word that i lost my bearings more completely than ever since i strapped a middys dirk to my belt you see friend i know something of shipwreck or battle or whatever may come upon the waters but the shoals in the city of london on which my poor boy has struck are clean beyond me pearson had been my pilot there and now i know him to be a rogue but ive taken my bearings now and i see my course right before me  what then admiral  oh i have one or two little plans ill have some news for the boy why hang it walker man i may be a bit stiff in the joints but youll be my witness that i can do my twelve miles under the three hours what then my eyes are as good as ever except just for the newspaper my head is clear im threeandsixty but im as good a man as ever i wastoo good a man to lie up for another ten years id be the better for a smack of the salt water again and a whiff of the breeze tut mother its not a four years cruise this time ill be back every month or two its no more than if i went for a visit in the country he was talking boisterously and heaping his seaboots and sextants back into his chest  and you really think my dear friend of hoisting your pennant again  my pennant walker no no her majesty god bless her has too many young men to need an old hulk like me i should be plain mr hay denver of the merchant service i daresay that i might find some owner who would give me a chance as second or third officer it will be strange to me to feel the rails of the bridge under my fingers once more  tut tut this will never do this will never do admiral the doctor sat down by mrs hay denver and patted her hand in token of friendly sympathy we must wait until your son has had it out with all these people and then we shall know what damage is done and how best to set it right it will be time enough then to begin to muster our resources to meet it  our resources the admiral laughed theres the pension im afraid walker that our resources wont need much mustering  oh come there are some which you may not have thought of for example admiral i had always intended that my girl should have five thousand from me when she married of course your boys trouble is her trouble and the money cannot be spent better than in helping to set it right she has a little of her own which she wished to contribute but i thought it best to work it this way will you take the cheque mrs denver and i think it would be best if you said nothing to harold about it and just used it as the occasion served  god bless you walker you are a true friend i wont forget this walker the admiral sat down on his sea chest and mopped his brow with his red handkerchief  what is it to me whether you have it now or then it may be more useful now theres only one stipulation if things should come to the worst and if the business should prove so bad that nothing can set it right then hold back this cheque for there is no use in pouring water into a broken basin and if the lad should fall he will want something to pick himself up again with  he shall not fall walker and you shall not have occasion to be ashamed of the family into which your daughter is about to marry i have my own plan but we shall hold your money my friend and it will strengthen us to feel that it is there  well that is all right said doctor walker rising and if a little more should be needed we must not let him go wrong for the want of a thousand or two and now admiral im off for my morning walk wont you come too  no i am going into town  well goodbye i hope to have better news and that all will come right goodbye mrs denver i feel as if the boy were my own and i shall not be easy until all is right with him     chapter xiii in strange waters   when doctor walker had departed the admiral packed all his possessions back into his sea chest with the exception of one little brassbound desk this he unlocked and took from it a dozen or so blue sheets of paper all mottled over with stamps and seals with very large v rs printed upon the heads of them he tied these carefully into a small bundle and placing them in the inner pocket of his coat he seized his stick and hat  oh john dont do this rash thing cried mrs denver laying her hands upon his sleeve i have seen so little of you john only three years since you left the service dont leave me again i know it is weak of me but i cannot bear it  theres my own brave lass said he smoothing down the greyshot hair weve lived in honor together mother and please god in honor well die no matter how debts are made they have got to be met and what the boy owes we owe he has not the money and how is he to find it he cant find it what then it becomes my business and theres only one way for it  but it may not be so very bad john had we not best wait until after he sees these people tomorrow  they may give him little time lass but ill have a care that i dont go so far that i cant put back again now mother theres no use holding me its got to be done and theres no sense in shirking it he detached her fingers from his sleeve pushed her gently back into an armchair and hurried from the house  in less than half an hour the admiral was whirled into victoria station and found himself amid a dense bustling throng who jostled and pushed in the crowded terminus his errand which had seemed feasible enough in his own room began now to present difficulties in the carrying out and he puzzled over how he should take the first steps amid the stream of business men each hurrying on his definite way the old seaman in his grey tweed suit and black soft hat strode slowly along his head sunk and his brow wrinkled in perplexity suddenly an idea occurred to him he walked back to the railway stall and bought a daily paper this he turned and turned until a certain column met his eye when he smoothed it out and carrying it over to a seat proceeded to read it at his leisure  and indeed as a man read that column it seemed strange to him that there should still remain any one in this world of ours who should be in straits for want of money here were whole lines of gentlemen who were burdened with a surplus in their incomes and who were loudly calling to the poor and needy to come and take it off their hands here was the guileless person who was not a professional moneylender but who would be glad to correspond etc here too was the accommodating individual who advanced sums from ten to ten thousand pounds without expense security or delay the money actually paid over within a few hours ran this fascinating advertisement conjuring up a vision of swift messengers rushing with bags of gold to the aid of the poor struggler a third gentleman did all business by personal application advanced money on anything or nothing the lightest and airiest promise was enough to content him according to his circular and finally he never asked for more than five per cent this struck the admiral as far the most promising and his wrinkles relaxed and his frown softened away as he gazed at it he folded up the paper rose from the seat and found himself face to face with charles westmacott  hullo admiral  hullo westmacott charles had always been a favorite of the seamans what are you doing here  oh i have been doing a little business for my aunt but i have never seen you in london before  i hate the place it smothers me theres not a breath of clean air on this side of greenwich but maybe you know your way about pretty well in the city  well i know something about it you see ive never lived very far from it and i do a good deal of my aunts business  maybe you know bread street  it is out of cheapside  well then how do you steer for it from here you make me out a course and ill keep to it  why admiral i have nothing to do ill take you there with pleasure  will you though well id take it very kindly if you would i have business there smith and hanbury financial agents bread street  the pair made their way to the riverside and so down the thames to st pauls landinga mode of travel which was much more to the admirals taste than bus or cab on the way he told his companion his mission and the causes which had led to it charles westmacott knew little enough of city life and the ways of business but at least he had more experience in both than the admiral and he made up his mind not to leave him until the matter was settled  these are the people said the admiral twisting round his paper and pointing to the advertisement which had seemed to him the most promising it sounds honest and aboveboard does it not the personal interview looks as if there were no trickery and then no one could object to five per cent  no it seems fair enough  it is not pleasant to have to go hat in hand borrowing money but there are times as you may find before you are my age westmacott when a man must stow away his pride but heres their number and their plate is on the corner of the door  a narrow entrance was flanked on either side by a row of brasses ranging upwards from the shipbrokers and the solicitors who occupied the ground floors through a long succession of west indian agents architects surveyors and brokers to the firm of which they were in quest a winding stone stair well carpeted and railed at first but growing shabbier with every landing brought them past innumerable doors until at last just under the groundglass roofing the names of smith and hanbury were to be seen painted in large white letters across a panel with a laconic invitation to push beneath it following out the suggestion the admiral and his companion found themselves in a dingy apartment ill lit from a couple of glazed windows an inkstained table littered with pens papers and almanacs an american cloth sofa three chairs of varying patterns and a muchworn carpet constituted all the furniture save only a very large and obtrusive porcelain spittoon and a gaudily framed and very somber picture which hung above the fireplace sitting in front of this picture and staring gloomily at it as being the only thing which he could stare at was a small sallowfaced boy with a large head who in the intervals of his art studies munched sedately at an apple  is mr smith or mr hanbury in asked the admiral  there aint no such people said the small boy  but you have the names on the door  ah that is the name of the firm you see its only a name its mr reuben metaxa that you wants  well then is he in  no hes not  when will he be back  cant tell im sure hes gone to lunch sometimes he takes one hour and sometimes two itll be two today i spect for he said he was hungry afore he went  then i suppose that we had better call again said the admiral  not a bit cried charles i know how to manage these little imps see here you young varmint heres a shilling for you run off and fetch your master if you dont bring him here in five minutes ill clump you on the side of the head when you get back shoo scat he charged at the youth who bolted from the room and clattered madly downstairs  hell fetch him said charles let us make ourselves at home this sofa does not feel over and above safe it was not meant for fifteenstone men but this doesnt look quite the sort of place where one would expect to pick up money  just what i was thinking said the admiral looking ruefully about him  ah well i have heard that the best furnished offices generally belong to the poorest firms let us hope its the opposite here they cant spend much on the management anyhow that pumpkinheaded boy was the staff i suppose ha by jove thats his voice and hes got our man i think  as he spoke the youth appeared in the doorway with a small brown driedup little chip of a man at his heels he was cleanshaven and bluechinned with bristling black hair and keen brown eyes which shone out very brightly from between pouched underlids and drooping upper ones he advanced glancing keenly from one to the other of his visitors and slowly rubbing together his thin blueveined hands the small boy closed the door behind him and discreetly vanished  i am mr reuben metaxa said the moneylender was it about an advance you wished to see me  yes  for you i presume turning to charles westmacott  no for this gentleman  the moneylender looked surprised how much did you desire  i thought of five thousand pounds said the admiral  and on what security  i am a retired admiral of the british navy you will find my name in the navy list there is my card i have here my pension papers i get l850 a year i thought that perhaps if you were to hold these papers it would be security enough that i should pay you you could draw my pension and repay yourselves at the rate say of l500 a year taking your five per cent interest as well  what interest  five per cent per annum  mr metaxa laughed per annum he said five per cent a month  a month that would be sixty per cent a year  precisely  but that is monstrous  i dont ask gentlemen to come to me they come of their own free will those are my terms and they can take it or leave it  then i shall leave it the admiral rose angrily from his chair  but one moment sir just sit down and we shall chat the matter over yours is a rather unusual case and we may find some other way of doing what you wish of course the security which you offer is no security at all and no sane man would advance five thousand pennies on it  no security why not sir  you might die tomorrow you are not a young man what age are you  sixtythree  mr metaxa turned over a long column of figures here is an actuarys table said he at your time of life the average expectancy of life is only a few years even in a wellpreserved man  do you mean to insinuate that i am not a wellpreserved man  well admiral it is a trying life at sea sailors in their younger days are gay dogs and take it out of themselves then when they grow older they are still hard at it and have no chance of rest or peace i do not think a sailors life a good one  ill tell you what sir said the admiral hotly if you have two pairs of gloves ill undertake to knock you out under three rounds or ill race you from here to st pauls and my friend here will see fair ill let you see whether i am an old man or not  this is beside the question said the moneylender with a deprecatory shrug the point is that if you died tomorrow where would be the security then  i could insure my life and make the policy over to you  your premiums for such a sum if any office would have you which i very much doubt would come to close on five hundred a year that would hardly suit your book  well sir what do you intend to propose asked the admiral  i might to accommodate you work it in another way i should send for a medical man and have an opinion upon your life then i might see what could be done  that is quite fair i have no objection to that  there is a very clever doctor in the street here proudie is his name john go and fetch doctor proudie the youth was dispatched upon his errand while mr metaxa sat at his desk trimming his nails and shooting out little comments upon the weather presently feet were heard upon the stairs the moneylender hurried out there was a sound of whispering and he returned with a large fat greasylooking man clad in a much worn frockcoat and a very dilapidated top hat  doctor proudie gentlemen said mr metaxa  the doctor bowed smiled whipped off his hat and produced his stethoscope from its interior with the air of a conjurer upon the stage which of these gentlemen am i to examine he asked blinking from one to the other of them ah it is you only your waistcoat you need not undo your collar thank you a full breath thank you ninetynine thank you now hold your breath for a moment oh dear dear what is this i hear  what is it then asked the admiral coolly  tut tut this is a great pity have you had rheumatic fever  never  you have had some serious illness  never  ah you are an admiral you have been abroad tropics malaria aguei know  i have never had a days illness  not to your knowledge but you have inhaled unhealthy air and it has left its effect you have an organic murmurslight but distinct  is it dangerous  it might at anytime become so you should not take violent exercise  oh indeed it would hurt me to run a half mile  it would be very dangerous  and a mile  would be almost certainly fatal  then there is nothing else the matter  no but if the heart is weak then everything is weak and the life is not a sound one  you see admiral remarked mr metaxa as the doctor secreted his stethoscope once more in his hat my remarks were not entirely uncalled for i am sorry that the doctors opinion is not more favorable but this is a matter of business and certain obvious precautions must be taken  of course then the matter is at an end  well we might even now do business i am most anxious to be of use to you how long do you think doctor that this gentleman will in all probability live  well well its rather a delicate question to answer said dr proudie with a show of embarrassment  not a bit sir out with it i have faced death too often to flinch from it now though i saw it as near me as you are  well well we must go by averages of course shall we say two years i should think that you have a full two years before you  in two years your pension would bring you in l1600 now i will do my very best for you admiral i will advance you l2000 and you can make over to me your pension for your life it is pure speculation on my part if you die tomorrow i lose my money if the doctors prophecy is correct i shall still be out of pocket if you live a little longer then i may see my money again it is the very best i can do for you  then you wish to buy my pension  yes for two thousand down  and if i live for twenty years  oh in that case of course my speculation would be more successful but you have heard the doctors opinion  would you advance the money instantly  you should have a thousand at once the other thousand i should expect you to take in furniture  in furniture  yes admiral we shall do you a beautiful houseful at that sum it is the custom of my clients to take half in furniture  the admiral sat in dire perplexity he had come out to get money and to go back without any to be powerless to help when his boy needed every shilling to save him from disaster that would be very bitter to him on the other hand it was so much that he surrendered and so little that he received little and yet something would it not be better than going back emptyhanded he saw the yellow backed chequebook upon the table the moneylender opened it and dipped his pen into the ink  shall i fill it up said he  i think admiral remarked westmacott that we had better have a little walk and some luncheon before we settle this matter  oh we may as well do it at once it would be absurd to postpone it now metaxa spoke with some heat and his eyes glinted angrily from between his narrow lids at the imperturbable charles the admiral was simple in money matters but he had seen much of men and had learned to read them he saw that venomous glance and saw too that intense eagerness was peeping out from beneath the careless air which the agent had assumed  youre quite right westmacott said he well have a little walk before we settle it  but i may not be here this afternoon  then we must choose another day  but why not settle it now  because i prefer not said the admiral shortly  very well but remember that my offer is only for today it is off unless you take it at once  let it be off then  theres my fee cried the doctor  how much  a guinea  the admiral threw a pound and a shilling upon the table come westmacott said he and they walked together from the room  i dont like it said charles when they found themselves in the street once more i dont profess to be a very sharp chap but this is a trifle too thin what did he want to go out and speak to the doctor for and how very convenient this tale of a weak heart was i believe they are a couple of rogues and in league with each other  a shark and a pilot fish said the admiral  ill tell you what i propose sir theres a lawyer named mcadam who does my aunts business he is a very honest fellow and lives at the other side of poultry well go over to him together and have his opinion about the whole matter  how far is it to his place  oh a mile at least we can have a cab  a mile then we shall see if there is any truth in what that swab of a doctor said come my boy and clap on all sail and see who can stay the longest  then the sober denizens of the heart of business london saw a singular sight as they returned from their luncheons down the roadway dodging among cabs and carts ran a weatherstained elderly man with wide flapping black hat and homely suit of tweeds with elbows braced back hands clenched near his armpits and chest protruded he scudded along while close at his heels lumbered a largelimbed heavy yellow mustached young man who seemed to feel the exercise a good deal more than his senior on they dashed helterskelter until they pulled up panting at the office where the lawyer of the westmacotts was to be found  there now cried the admiral in triumph what dye think of that nothing wrong in the engineroom eh  you seem fit enough sir  blessed if i believe the swab was a certificated doctor at all he was flying false colors or i am mistaken  they keep the directories and registers in this eatinghouse said westmacott well go and look him out  they did so but the medical rolls contained no such name as that of dr proudie of bread street  pretty villainy this cried the admiral thumping his chest a dummy doctor and a vamped up disease well weve tried the rogues westmacott let us see what we can do with your honest man     chapter xiv eastward ho   mr mcadam of the firm of mcadam and squire was a highly polished man who dwelt behind a highly polished table in the neatest and snuggest of offices he was whitehaired and amiable with a deeplined aquiline face was addicted to low bows and indeed always seemed to carry himself at halfcock as though just descending into one or just recovering himself he wore a highbuckled stock took snuff and adorned his conversation with little scraps from the classics  my dear sir said he when he had listened to their story any friend of mrs westmacotts is a friend of mine try a pinch i wonder that you should have gone to this man metaxa his advertisement is enough to condemn him habet foenum in cornu they are all rogues  the doctor was a rogue too i didnt like the look of him at the time  arcades ambo but now we must see what we can do for you of course what metaxa said was perfectly right the pension is in itself no security at all unless it were accompanied by a life assurance which would be an income in itself it is no good whatever  his clients faces fell  but there is the second alternative you might sell the pension right out speculative investors occasionally deal in such things i have one client a sporting man who would be very likely to take it up if we could agree upon terms of course i must follow metaxas example by sending for a doctor  for the second time was the admiral punched and tapped and listened to this time however there could be no question of the qualifications of the doctor a wellknown fellow of the college of surgeons and his report was as favorable as the others had been adverse  he has the heart and chest of a man of forty said he i can recommend his life as one of the best of his age that i have ever examined  thats well said mr mcadam making a note of the doctors remarks while the admiral disbursed a second guinea your price i understand is five thousand pounds i can communicate with mr elberry my client and let you know whether he cares to touch the matter meanwhile you can leave your pension papers here and i will give you a receipt for them  very well i should like the money soon  that is why i am retaining the papers if i can see mr elberry today we may let you have a cheque tomorrow try another pinch no well goodbye i am very happy to have been of service mr mcadam bowed them out for he was a very busy man and they found themselves in the street once more with lighter hearts than when they had left it  well westmacott i am sure i am very much obliged to you said the admiral you have stood by me when i was the better for a little help for im clean out of my soundings among these city sharks but ive something to do now which is more in my own line and i need not trouble you any more  oh it is no trouble i have nothing to do i never have anything to do i dont suppose i could do it if i had i should be delighted to come with you sir if i can be of any use  no no my lad you go home again it would be kind of you though if you would look in at number one when you get back and tell my wife that alls well with me and that ill be back in an hour or so  all right sir ill tell her westmacott raised his hat and strode away to the westward while the admiral after a hurried lunch bent his steps towards the east  it was a long walk but the old seaman swung along at a rousing pace leaving street after street behind him the great business places dwindled down into commonplace shops and dwellings which decreased and became more stunted even as the folk who filled them did until he was deep in the evil places of the eastern end it was a land of huge dark houses and of garish ginshops a land too where life moves irregularly and where adventures are to be gainedas the admiral was to learn to his cost  he was hurrying down one of the long narrow stoneflagged lanes between the double lines of crouching disheveled women and of dirty children who sat on the hollowed steps of the houses and basked in the autumn sun at one side was a barrowman with a load of walnuts and beside the barrow a bedraggled woman with a black fringe and a chequered shawl thrown over her head she was cracking walnuts and picking them out of the shells throwing out a remark occasionally to a rough man in a rabbitskin cap with straps under the knees of his corduroy trousers who stood puffing a black clay pipe with his back against the wall what the cause of the quarrel was or what sharp sarcasm from the womans lips pricked suddenly through that thick skin may never be known but suddenly the man took his pipe in his left hand leaned forward and deliberately struck her across the face with his right it was a slap rather than a blow but the woman gave a sharp cry and cowered up against the barrow with her hand to her cheek  you infernal villain cried the admiral raising his stick you brute and blackguard  garn growled the rough with the deep rasping intonation of a savage garn out o this or ill he took a step forward with uplifted hand but in an instant down came cut number three upon his wrist and cut number five across his thigh and cut number one full in the center of his rabbitskin cap it was not a heavy stick but it was strong enough to leave a good red weal wherever it fell the rough yelled with pain and rushed in hitting with both hands and kicking with his ironshod boots but the admiral had still a quick foot and a true eye so that he bounded backwards and sideways still raining a shower of blows upon his savage antagonist suddenly however a pair of arms closed round his neck and glancing backwards he caught a glimpse of the black coarse fringe of the woman whom he had befriended ive got him she shrieked ill old im now bill knock the tripe out of him her grip was as strong as a mans and her wrist pressed like an iron bar upon the admirals throat he made a desperate effort to disengage himself but the most that he could do was to swing her round so as to place her between his adversary and himself as it proved it was the very best thing that he could have done the rough halfblinded and maddened by the blows which he had received struck out with all his ungainly strength just as his partners head swung round in front of him there was a noise like that of a stone hitting a wall a deep groan her grasp relaxed and she dropped a dead weight upon the pavement while the admiral sprang back and raised his stick once more ready either for attack or defense neither were needed however for at that moment there was a scattering of the crowd and two police constables burly and helmeted pushed their way through the rabble at the sight of them the rough took to his heels and was instantly screened from view by a veil of his friends and neighbors  i have been assaulted panted the admiral this woman was attacked and i had to defend her  this is bermondsey sal said one police officer bending over the bedraggled heap of tattered shawl and dirty skirt shes got it hot this time  he was a shortish man thick with a beard  ah thats black davie hes been up four times for beating her hes about done the job now if i were you i would let that sort settle their own little affairs sir  do you think that a man who holds the queens commission will stand by and see a woman struck cried the admiral indignantly  well just as you like sir but youve lost your watch i see  my watch he clapped his hand to his waistcoat the chain was hanging down in front and the watch gone  he passed his hand over his forehead i would not have lost that watch for anything said he no money could replace it it was given me by the ships company after our african cruise it has an inscription  the policeman shrugged his shoulders it comes from meddling said he  whatll you give me if i tell yer where it is said a sharpfaced boy among the crowd will you gimme a quid  certainly  well wheres the quid  the admiral took a sovereign from his pocket here it is  then eres the ticker the boy pointed to the clenched hand of the senseless woman a glimmer of gold shone out from between the fingers and on opening them up there was the admirals chronometer this interesting victim had throttled her protector with one hand while she had robbed him with the other  the admiral left his address with the policeman satisfied that the woman was only stunned not dead and then set off upon his way once more the poorer perhaps in his faith in human nature but in very good spirits none the less he walked with dilated nostrils and clenched hands all glowing and tingling with the excitement of the combat and warmed with the thought that he could still when there was need take his own part in a street brawl in spite of his threescore and odd years  his way now led towards the riverside regions and a cleansing whiff of tar was to be detected in the stagnant autumn air men with the blue jersey and peaked cap of the boatman or the white ducks of the dockers began to replace the corduroys and fustian of the laborers shops with nautical instruments in the windows rope and paint sellers and slop shops with long rows of oilskins dangling from hooks all proclaimed the neighborhood of the docks the admiral quickened his pace and straightened his figure as his surroundings became more nautical until at last peeping between two high dingy wharfs he caught a glimpse of the mudcolored waters of the thames and of the bristle of masts and funnels which rose from its broad bosom to the right lay a quiet street with many brass plates upon either side and wire blinds in all of the windows the admiral walked slowly down it until the saint lawrence shipping company caught his eye he crossed the road pushed open the door and found himself in a lowceilinged office with a long counter at one end and a great number of wooden sections of ships stuck upon boards and plastered all over the walls  is mr henry in asked the admiral  no sir answered an elderly man from a high seat in the corner he has not come into town today i can manage any business you may wish seen to  you dont happen to have a first or second officers place vacant do you  the manager looked with a dubious eye at his singular applicant  do you hold certificates he asked  i hold every nautical certificate there is  then you wont do for us  why not  your age sir  i give you my word that i can see as well as ever and am as good a man in every way  i dont doubt it  why should my age be a bar then  well i must put it plainly if a man of your age holding certificates has not got past a second officers berth there must be a black mark against him somewhere i dont know what it is drink or temper or want of judgment but something there must be  i assure you there is nothing but i find myself stranded and so have to turn to the old business again  oh thats it said the manager with suspicion in his eye how long were you in your last billet  fiftyone years  what  yes sir oneandfifty years  in the same employ  yes  why you must have begun as a child  i was twelve when i joined  it must be a strangely managed business said the manager which allows men to leave it who have served for fifty years and who are still as good as ever who did you serve  the queen heaven bless her  oh you were in the royal navy what rating did you hold  i am admiral of the fleet  the manager started and sprang down from his high stool  my name is admiral hay denver there is my card and here are the records of my service i dont you understand want to push another man from his billet but if you should chance to have a berth open i should be very glad of it i know the navigation from the cod banks right up to montreal a great deal better than i know the streets of london  the astonished manager glanced over the blue papers which his visitor had handed him wont you take a chair admiral said he  thank you but i should be obliged if you would drop my title now i told you because you asked me but ive left the quarterdeck and i am plain mr hay denver now  may i ask said the manager are you the same denver who commanded at one time on the north american station  i did  then it was you who got one of our boats the comus off the rocks in the bay of fundy the directors voted you three hundred guineas as salvage and you refused them  it was an offer which should not have been made said the admiral sternly  well it reflects credit upon you that you should think so if mr henry were here i am sure that he would arrange this matter for you at once as it is i shall lay it before the directors today and i am sure that they will be proud to have you in our employment and i hope in some more suitable position than that which you suggest  i am very much obliged to you sir said the admiral and started off again well pleased upon his homeward journey     chapter xv still among shoals   next day brought the admiral a cheque for l5000 from mr mcadam and a stamped agreement by which he made over his pension papers to the speculative investor it was not until he had signed and sent it off that the full significance of all that he had done broke upon him he had sacrificed everything his pension was gone he had nothing save only what he could earn but the stout old heart never quailed he waited eagerly for a letter from the saint lawrence shipping company and in the meanwhile he gave his landlord a quarters notice hundred pound a year houses would in future be a luxury which he could not aspire to a small lodging in some inexpensive part of london must be the substitute for his breezy norwood villa so be it then better that a thousand fold than that his name should be associated with failure and disgrace  on that morning harold denver was to meet the creditors of the firm and to explain the situation to them it was a hateful task a degrading task but he set himself to do it with quiet resolution at home they waited in intense anxiety to learn the result of the meeting it was late before he returned haggard pale like a man who has done and suffered much  whats this board in front of the house he asked  we are going to try a little change of scene said the admiral this place is neither town nor country but never mind that boy tell us what happened in the city  god help me my wretched business driving you out of house and home cried harold broken down by this fresh evidence of the effects of his misfortunes it is easier for me to meet my creditors than to see you two suffering so patiently for my sake  tut tut cried the admiral theres no suffering in the matter mother would rather be near the theaters thats at the bottom of it isnt it mother you come and sit down here between us and tell us all about it  harold sat down with a loving hand in each of his  its not so bad as we thought said he and yet it is bad enough i have about ten days to find the money but i dont know which way to turn for it pearson however lied as usual when he spoke of l13000 the amount is not quite l7000  the admiral claped his hands i knew we should weather it after all hurrah my boy hip hip hip hurrah  harold gazed at him in surprise while the old seaman waved his arm above his head and bellowed out three stentorian cheers where am i to get seven thousand pounds from dad he asked  never mind you spin your yarn  well they were very good and very kind but of course they must have either their money or their moneys worth they passed a vote of sympathy with me and agreed to wait ten days before they took any proceedings three of them whose claim came to l3500 told me that if i would give them my personal iou and pay interest at the rate of five per cent their amounts might stand over as long as i wished that would be a charge of l175 upon my income but with economy i could meet it and it diminishes the debt by onehalf  again the admiral burst out cheering  there remains therefore about l3200 which has to be found within ten days no man shall lose by me i gave them my word in the room that if i worked my soul out of my body every one of them should be paid i shall not spend a penny upon myself until it is done but some of them cant wait they are poor men themselves and must have their money they have issued a warrant for pearsons arrest but they think that he has got away the states  these men shall have their money said the admiral  dad  yes my boy you dont know the resources of the family one never does know until one tries what have you yourself now  i have about a thousand pounds invested  all right and i have about as much more theres a good start now mother it is your turn what is that little bit of paper of yours  mrs denver unfolded it and placed it upon harolds knee  five thousand pounds he gasped  ah but mother is not the only rich one look at this and the admiral unfolded his cheque and placed it upon the other knee  harold gazed from one to the other in bewilderment ten thousand pounds he cried good heavens where did these come from  you will not worry any longer dear murmured his mother slipping her arm round him  but his quick eye had caught the signature upon one of the cheques doctor walker he cried flushing this is claras doing oh dad we cannot take this money it would not be right nor honorable  no boy i am glad you think so it is something however to have proved ones friend for a real good friend he is it was he who brought it in though clara sent him but this other money will be enough to cover everything and it is all my own  your own where did you get it dad  tut tut see what it is to have a city man to deal with it is my own and fairly earned and that is enough  dear old dad harold squeezed his gnarled hand and you mother you have lifted the trouble from my heart i feel another man you have saved my honor my good name everything i cannot owe you more for i owe you everything already  so while the autumn sunset shone ruddily through the broad window these three sat together hand in hand with hearts which were too full to speak suddenly the soft thudding of tennis balls was heard and mrs westmacott bounded into view upon the lawn with brandished racket and short skirts fluttering in the breeze the sight came as a relief to their strained nerves and they burst all three into a hearty fit of laughter  she is playing with her nephew said harold at last the walkers have not come out yet i think that it would be well if you were to give me that cheque mother and i were to return it in person  certainly harold i think it would be very nice  he went in through the garden clara and the doctor were sitting together in the diningroom she sprang to her feet at the sight of him  oh harold i have been waiting for you so impatiently she cried i saw you pass the front windows half an hour ago i would have come in if i dared do tell us what has happened  i have come in to thank you both how can i repay you for your kindness here is your cheque doctor i have not needed it i find that i can lay my hands on enough to pay my creditors  thank god said clara fervently  the sum is less than i thought and our resources considerably more we have been able to do it with ease  with ease the doctors brow clouded and his manner grew cold i think harold that you would do better to take this money of mine than to use that which seems to you to be gained with ease  thank you sir if i borrowed from any one it would be from you but my father has this very sum five thousand pounds and as i tell him i owe him so much that i have no compunction about owing him more  no compunction surely there are some sacrifices which a son should not allow his parents to make  sacrifices what do you mean  is it possible that you do not know how this money has been obtained  i give you my word doctor walker that i have no idea i asked my father but he refused to tell me  i thought not said the doctor the gloom clearing from his brow i was sure that you were not a man who to clear yourself from a little money difficulty would sacrifice the happiness of your mother and the health of your father  good gracious what do you mean  it is only right that you should know that money represents the commutation of your fathers pension he has reduced himself to poverty and intends to go to sea again to earn a living  to sea again impossible  it is the truth charles westmacott has told ida he was with him in the city when he took his poor pension about from dealer to dealer trying to sell it he succeeded at last and hence the money  he has sold his pension cried harold with his hands to his face my dear old dad has sold his pension he rushed from the room and burst wildly into the presence of his parents once more i cannot take it father he cried better bankruptcy than that oh if i had only known your plan we must have back the pension oh mother mother how could you think me capable of such selfishness give me the cheque dad and i will see this man tonight for i would sooner die like a dog in the ditch than touch a penny of this money     chapter xvi a midnight visitor   now all this time while the tragicomedy of life was being played in these three suburban villas while on a commonplace stage love and humor and fears and lights and shadows were so swiftly succeeding each other and while these three families drifted together by fate were shaping each others destinies and working out in their own fashion the strange intricate ends of human life there were human eyes which watched over every stage of the performance and which were keenly critical of every actor on it across the road beyond the green palings and the closecropped lawn behind the curtains of their creeperframed windows sat the two old ladies miss bertha and miss monica williams looking out as from a private box at all that was being enacted before them the growing friendship of the three families the engagement of harold denver with clara walker the engagement of charles westmacott with her sister the dangerous fascination which the widow exercised over the doctor the preposterous behavior of the walker girls and the unhappiness which they had caused their father not one of these incidents escaped the notice of the two maiden ladies bertha the younger had a smile or a sigh for the lovers monica the elder a frown or a shrug for the elders every night they talked over what they had seen and their own dull uneventful life took a warmth and a coloring from their neighbors as a blank wall reflects a beacon fire  and now it was destined that they should experience the one keen sensation of their later years the one memorable incident from which all future incidents should be dated  it was on the very night which succeeded the events which have just been narrated when suddenly into monica williams head as she tossed upon her sleepless bed there shot a thought which made her sit up with a thrill and a gasp  bertha said she plucking at the shoulder of her sister i have left the front window open  no monica surely not bertha sat up also and thrilled in sympathy  i am sure of it you remember i had forgotten to water the pots and then i opened the window and jane called me about the jam and i have never been in the room since  good gracious monica it is a mercy that we have not been murdered in our beds there was a house broken into at forest hill last week shall we go down and shut it  i dare not go down alone dear but if you will come with me put on your slippers and dressinggown we do not need a candle now bertha we will go down together  two little white patches moved vaguely through the darkness the stairs creaked the door whined and they were at the front room window monica closed it gently down and fastened the snib  what a beautiful moon said she looking out we can see as clearly as if it were day how peaceful and quiet the three houses are over yonder it seems quite sad to see that to let card upon number one i wonder how number two will like their going for my part i could better spare that dreadful woman at number three with her short skirts and her snake but oh bertha look look look her voice had fallen suddenly to a quivering whisper and she was pointing to the westmacotts house her sister gave a gasp of horror and stood with a clutch at monicas arm staring in the same direction  there was a light in the front room a slight wavering light such as would be given by a small candle or taper the blind was down but the light shone dimly through outside in the garden with his figure outlined against the luminous square there stood a man his back to the road his two hands upon the window ledge and his body rather bent as though he were trying to peep in past the blind so absolutely still and motionless was he that in spite of the moon they might well have overlooked him were it not for that telltale light behind  good heaven gasped bertha it is a burglar  but her sister set her mouth grimly and shook her head we shall see she whispered it may be something worse  swiftly and furtively the man stood suddenly erect and began to push the window slowly up then he put one knee upon the sash glanced round to see that all was safe and climbed over into the room as he did so he had to push the blind aside then the two spectators saw where the light came from mrs westmacott was standing as rigid as a statue in the center of the room with a lighted taper in her right hand for an instant they caught a glimpse of her stern face and her white collar then the blind fell back into position and the two figures disappeared from their view  oh that dreadful woman cried monica that dreadful dreadful woman she was waiting for him you saw it with your own eyes sister bertha  hush dear hush and listen said her more charitable companion they pushed their own window up once more and watched from behind the curtains  for a long time all was silent within the house the light still stood motionless as though mrs westmacott remained rigidly in the one position while from time to time a shadow passed in front of it to show that her midnight visitor was pacing up and down in front of her once they saw his outline clearly with his hands outstretched as if in appeal or entreaty then suddenly there was a dull sound a cry the noise of a fall the taper was extinguished and a dark figure fled in the moonlight rushed across the garden and vanished amid the shrubs at the farther side  then only did the two old ladies understand that they had looked on whilst a tragedy had been enacted help they cried and help in their high thin voices timidly at first but gathering volume as they went on until the wilderness rang with their shrieks lights shone in all the windows opposite chains rattled bars were unshot doors opened and out rushed friends to the rescue harold with a stick the admiral with his sword his grey head and bare feet protruding from either end of a long brown ulster finally doctor walker with a poker all ran to the help of the westmacotts their door had been already opened and they crowded tumultuously into the front room  charles westmacott white to his lips was kneeling an the floor supporting his aunts head upon his knee she lay outstretched dressed in her ordinary clothes the extinguished taper still grasped in her hand no mark or wound upon herpale placid and senseless  thank god you are come doctor said charles looking up do tell me how she is and what i should do  doctor walker kneeled beside her and passed his left hand over her head while he grasped her pulse with the right  she has had a terrible blow said he it must have been with some blunt weapon here is the place behind the ear but she is a woman of extraordinary physical powers her pulse is full and slow there is no stertor it is my belief that she is merely stunned and that she is in no danger at all  thank god for that  we must get her to bed we shall carry her upstairs and then i shall send my girls in to her but who has done this  some robber said charles you see that the window is open she must have heard him and come down for she was always perfectly fearless i wish to goodness she had called me  but she was dressed  sometimes she sits up very late  i did sit up very late said a voice she had opened her eyes and was blinking at them in the lamplight a villain came in through the window and struck me with a lifepreserver you can tell the police so when they come also that it was a little fat man now charles give me your arm and i shall go upstairs  but her spirit was greater than her strength for as she staggered to her feet her head swam round and she would have fallen again had her nephew not thrown his arms round her they carried her upstairs among them and laid her upon the bed where the doctor watched beside her while charles went off to the policestation and the denvers mounted guard over the frightened maids     chapter xvii in port at last   day had broken before the several denizens of the wilderness had all returned to their homes the police finished their inquiries and all come back to its normal quiet mrs westmacott had been left sleeping peacefully with a small chloral draught to steady her nerves and a handkerchief soaked in arnica bound round her head it was with some surprise therefore that the admiral received a note from her about ten oclock asking him to be good enough to step in to her he hurried in fearing that she might have taken some turn for the worse but he was reassured to find her sitting up in her bed with clara and ida walker in attendance upon her she had removed the handkerchief and had put on a little cap with pink ribbons and a maroon dressingjacket daintily fulled at the neck and sleeves  my dear friend said she as he entered i wish to make a last few remarks to you no no she continued laughing as she saw a look of dismay upon his face i shall not dream of dying for at least another thirty years a woman should be ashamed to die before she is seventy i wish clara that you would ask your father to step up and you ida just pass me my cigarettes and open me a bottle of stout  now then she continued as the doctor joined their party i dont quite know what i ought to say to you admiral you want some very plain speaking to  pon my word maam i dont know what you are talking about  the idea of you at your age talking of going to sea and leaving that dear patient little wife of yours at home who has seen nothing of you all her life its all very well for you you have the life and the change and the excitement but you dont think of her eating her heart out in a dreary london lodging you men are all the same  well maam since you know so much you probably know also that i have sold my pension how am i to live if i do not turn my hand to work  mrs westmacott produced a large registered envelope from beneath the sheets and tossed it over to the old seaman  that excuse wont do there are your pension papers just see if they are right  he broke the seal and out tumbled the very papers which he had made over to mcadam two days before  but what am i to do with these now he cried in bewilderment  you will put them in a safe place or get a friend to do so and if you do your duty you will go to your wife and beg her pardon for having even for an instant thought of leaving her  the admiral passed his hand over his rugged forehead this is very good of you maam said he very good and kind and i know that you are a staunch friend but for all that these papers mean money and though we may have been in broken water lately we are not quite in such straits as to have to signal to our friends when we do maam theres no one we would look to sooner than to you  dont be ridiculous said the widow you know nothing whatever about it and yet you stand there laying down the law ill have my way in the matter and you shall take the papers for it is no favor that i am doing you but simply a restoration of stolen property  hows that maam  i am just going to explain though you might take a ladys word for it without asking any questions now what i am going to say is just between you four and must go no farther i have my own reasons for wishing to keep it from the police who do you think it was who struck me last night admiral  some villain maam i dont know his name  but i do it was the same man who ruined or tried to ruin your son it was my only brother jeremiah  ah  i will tell you about himor a little about him for he has done much which i would not care to talk of nor you to listen to he was always a villain smoothspoken and plausible but a dangerous subtle villain all the same if i have some hard thoughts about mankind i can trace them back to the childhood which i spent with my brother he is my only living relative for my other brother charless father was killed in the indian mutiny  our father was rich and when he died he made a good provision both for jeremiah and for me he knew jeremiah and he mistrusted him however so instead of giving him all that he meant him to have he handed me over a part of it telling me with what was almost his dying breath to hold it in trust for my brother and to use it in his behalf when he should have squandered or lost all that he had this arrangement was meant to be a secret between my father and myself but unfortunately his words were overheard by the nurse and she repeated them afterwards to my brother so that he came to know that i held some money in trust for him i suppose tobacco will not harm my head doctor thank you then i shall trouble you for the matches ida she lit a cigarette and leaned back upon the pillow with the blue wreaths curling from her lips  i cannot tell you how often he has attempted to get that money from me he has bullied cajoled threatened coaxed done all that a man could do i still held it with the presentiment that a need for it would come when i heard of this villainous business his flight and his leaving his partner to face the storm above all that my old friend had been driven to surrender his income in order to make up for my brothers defalcations i felt that now indeed i had a need for it i sent in charles yesterday to mr mcadam and his client upon hearing the facts of the case very graciously consented to give back the papers and to take the money which he had advanced not a word of thanks to me admiral i tell you that it was very cheap benevolence for it was all done with his own money and how could i use it better  i thought that i should probably hear from him soon and i did last evening there was handed in a note of the usual whining cringing tone he had come back from abroad at the risk of his life and liberty just in order that he might say goodbye to the only sister he ever had and to entreat my forgiveness for any pain which he had caused me he would never trouble me again and he begged only that i would hand over to him the sum which i held in trust for him that with what he had already would be enough to start him as an honest man in the new world when he would ever remember and pray for the dear sister who had been his savior that was the style of the letter and it ended by imploring me to leave the windowlatch open and to be in the front room at three in the morning when he would come to receive my last kiss and to bid me farewell  bad as he was i could not when he trusted me betray him i said nothing but i was there at the hour he entered through the window and implored me to give him the money he was terribly changed gaunt wolfish and spoke like a madman i told him that i had spent the money he gnashed his teeth at me and swore it was his money i told him that i had spent it on him he asked me how i said in trying to make him an honest man and in repairing the results of his villainy he shrieked out a curse and pulling something out of the breast of his coata loaded stick i thinkhe struck me with it and i remembered nothing more  the blackguard cried the doctor but the police must be hot upon his track  i fancy not mrs westmacott answered calmly as my brother is a particularly tall thin man and as the police are looking for a short fat one i do not think that it is very probable that they will catch him it is best i think that these little family matters should be adjusted in private  my dear maam said the admiral if it is indeed this mans money that has bought back my pension then i can have no scruples about taking it you have brought sunshine upon us maam when the clouds were at their darkest for here is my boy who insists upon returning the money which i got he can keep it now to pay his debts for what you have done i can only ask god to bless you maam and as to thanking you i cant even  then pray dont try said the widow now run away admiral and make your peace with mrs denver i am sure if i were she it would be a long time before i should forgive you as for me i am going to america when charles goes youll take me so far wont you ida there is a college being built in denver which is to equip the woman of the future for the struggle of life and especially for her battle against man some months ago the committee offered me a responsible situation upon the staff and i have decided now to accept it for charless marriage removes the last tie which binds me to england you will write to me sometimes my friends and you will address your letters to professor westmacott emancipation college denver from there i shall watch how the glorious struggle goes in conservative old england and if i am needed you will find me here again fighting in the forefront of the fray goodbyebut not you girls i have still a word i wish to say to you  give me your hand ida and yours clara said she when they were alone oh you naughty little pusses arent you ashamed to look me in the face did you thinkdid you really think that i was so very blind and could not see your little plot you did it very well i must say that and really i think that i like you better as you are but you had all your pains for nothing you little conspirators for i give you my word that i had quite made up my mind not to have him  and so within a few weeks our little ladies from their observatory saw a mighty bustle in the wilderness when twohorse carriages came and coachmen with favors to bear away the twos who were destined to come back one and they themselves in their crackling silk dresses went across as invited to the big double wedding breakfast which was held in the house of doctor walker then there was healthdrinking and laughter and changing of dresses and ricethrowing when the carriages drove up again and two more couples started on that journey which ends only with life itself  charles westmacott is now a flourishing ranchman in the western part of texas where he and his sweet little wife are the two most popular persons in all that county of their aunt they see little but from time to time they see notices in the papers that there is a focus of light in denver where mighty thunderbolts are being forged which will one day bring the dominant sex upon their knees the admiral and his wife still live at number one while harold and clara have taken number two where doctor walker continues to reside as to the business it had been reconstructed and the energy and ability of the junior partner had soon made up for all the ill that had been done by his senior yet with his sweet and refined home atmosphere he is able to realize his wish and to keep himself free from the sordid aims and base ambitions which drag down the man whose business lies too exclusively in the money market of the vast babylon as he goes back every evening from the crowds of throgmorton street to the treelined peaceful avenues of norwood so he has found it possible in spirit also to do ones duties amidst the babel of the city and yet to live beyond it
